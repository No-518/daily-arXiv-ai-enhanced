Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A model-agnostic framework using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with random contrastive sampling to improve radiography report generation accuracy without needing reward models or human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing radiography report generation methods lack the quality needed for real-world clinical deployment, while large visual language models have shown success with alignment techniques from LLMs.

Method: Uses Direct Preference Optimization with random contrastive sampling to construct training pairs, eliminating the need for reward models or human preference annotations.

Result: Improves clinical performance metrics by up to 5% when supplementing three state-of-the-art models, without requiring additional training data.

Conclusion: The proposed Random DPO framework effectively enhances radiography report generation accuracy and is model-agnostic, making it widely applicable.

Abstract: Radiography Report Generation (RRG) has gained significant attention in
medical image analysis as a promising tool for alleviating the growing workload
of radiologists. However, despite numerous advancements, existing methods have
yet to achieve the quality required for deployment in real-world clinical
settings. Meanwhile, large Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable progress in the general domain by adopting training strategies
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as alignment
techniques. In this paper, we introduce a model-agnostic framework to enhance
RRG accuracy using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our approach leverages
random contrastive sampling to construct training pairs, eliminating the need
for reward models or human preference annotations. Experiments on supplementing
three state-of-the-art models with our Random DPO show that our method improves
clinical performance metrics by up to 5%, without requiring any additional
training data.

*William Saakyan,Matthias Norden,Lola Eversmann,Simon Kirsch,Muyu Lin,Simon Guendelman,Isabel Dziobek,Hanna Drimalla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multimodal approach for autism detection using video data, addressing limitations in gaze feature performance and generalizability through novel statistical descriptors and late fusion of multiple behavioral cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computer-aided autism diagnostic methods struggle with poor gaze feature performance and lack real-world generalizability, despite the need for scalable screening tools to support autism assessment.

Method: Analyzed a large, balanced dataset of 325 participants using multimodal analysis of facial expressions, voice prosody, head motion, heart rate variability, and gaze behavior. Introduced novel statistical descriptors for gaze angles and used late fusion to integrate behavioral markers across modalities.

Result: Improved gaze-based classification accuracy from 64% to 69% using novel gaze descriptors, and achieved overall classification accuracy of 74% through late fusion of multiple modalities.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential for scalable, video-based screening tools to support autism assessment by effectively integrating behavioral markers across multiple modalities.

Abstract: Due to the complex and resource-intensive nature of diagnosing Autism
Spectrum Condition (ASC), several computer-aided diagnostic support methods
have been proposed to detect autism by analyzing behavioral cues in patient
video data. While these models show promising results on some datasets, they
struggle with poor gaze feature performance and lack of real-world
generalizability. To tackle these challenges, we analyze a standardized video
dataset comprising 168 participants with ASC (46% female) and 157 non-autistic
participants (46% female), making it, to our knowledge, the largest and most
balanced dataset available. We conduct a multimodal analysis of facial
expressions, voice prosody, head motion, heart rate variability (HRV), and gaze
behavior. To address the limitations of prior gaze models, we introduce novel
statistical descriptors that quantify variability in eye gaze angles, improving
gaze-based classification accuracy from 64% to 69% and aligning computational
findings with clinical research on gaze aversion in ASC. Using late fusion, we
achieve a classification accuracy of 74%, demonstrating the effectiveness of
integrating behavioral markers across multiple modalities. Our findings
highlight the potential for scalable, video-based screening tools to support
autism assessment.

### [3] [KV-Efficient VLA: A Method of Speed up Vision Language Model with RNN-Gated Chunked KV Cache](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21354)
*Wanshun Xu,Long Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KV-Efficient VLA is a memory compression framework that reduces KV cache memory usage by 36% and speeds up inference by 1.21x through selective context retention and pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the quadratic attention cost and unbounded KV memory growth in Vision-Language-Action models during long-horizon inference, which limits real-time deployment scalability.

Method: Partitions KV cache into fixed-size chunks and uses a recurrent gating module to selectively retain high-utility context while pruning stale, low-relevance memory, maintaining causality.

Result: Achieves up to 1.21x inference speedup and 36% KV memory reduction with minimal impact on task success rates.

Conclusion: The framework enables scalable inference for VLA models without modifying training pipelines or downstream control logic, making it suitable for real-time robotic deployment.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models promise unified robotic perception and
control, yet their scalability is constrained by the quadratic cost of
attention and the unbounded growth of key-value (KV) memory during long-horizon
inference. While recent methods improve generalization through scaling backbone
architectures, they often neglect the inference inefficiencies critical to
real-time deployment. In this work, we present KV-Efficient VLA, a
model-agnostic memory compression framework that addresses these limitations by
introducing a lightweight, training-friendly mechanism to selectively retain
high-utility context. Our method partitions the KV cache into fixed size chunks
and employs a recurrent gating module to summarize and filter historical
context according to learned utility scores. This design preserves recent
fine-grained detail while aggressively pruning stale, low-relevance memory, all
while maintaining causality. Theoretically, KV-Efficient VLA yields up to 1.21x
inference speedup and 36% KV memory reduction, with minimal impact on task
success. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing autoregressive and
hybrid VLA stacks, enabling scalable inference without modifying training
pipelines or downstream control logic.

### [4] [Phrase-grounded Fact-checking for Automatically Generated Chest X-ray Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21356)
*Razi Mahmood,Diego Machado-Reyes,Joy Wu,Parisa Kaviani,Ken C. L. Wong,Niharika D'Souza,Mannudeep Kalra,Ge Wang,Pingkun Yan,Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A phrase-grounded fact-checking model that detects factual errors and hallucinations in AI-generated chest radiology reports by verifying findings and their anatomical locations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale vision language models can generate realistic radiology reports but suffer from factual errors and hallucinations, limiting their clinical adoption. There's a need for automated error detection in AI-generated medical reports.

Method: Created a synthetic dataset by perturbing findings and locations in ground truth reports to form real/fake finding-location pairs. Trained a multi-label cross-modal contrastive regression network on this dataset for error detection.

Result: The model achieved high accuracy in finding veracity prediction and localization across multiple X-ray datasets. It achieved 0.997 concordance correlation coefficient with ground truth verification when detecting errors in state-of-the-art report generators.

Conclusion: The proposed fact-checking model shows strong potential for clinical deployment by reliably detecting errors in AI-generated radiology reports, addressing the hallucination problem that hampers clinical translation of vision language models.

Abstract: With the emergence of large-scale vision language models (VLM), it is now
possible to produce realistic-looking radiology reports for chest X-ray images.
However, their clinical translation has been hampered by the factual errors and
hallucinations in the produced descriptions during inference. In this paper, we
present a novel phrase-grounded fact-checking model (FC model) that detects
errors in findings and their indicated locations in automatically generated
chest radiology reports.
  Specifically, we simulate the errors in reports through a large synthetic
dataset derived by perturbing findings and their locations in ground truth
reports to form real and fake findings-location pairs with images. A new
multi-label cross-modal contrastive regression network is then trained on this
dataset. We present results demonstrating the robustness of our method in terms
of accuracy of finding veracity prediction and localization on multiple X-ray
datasets. We also show its effectiveness for error detection in reports of SOTA
report generators on multiple datasets achieving a concordance correlation
coefficient of 0.997 with ground truth-based verification, thus pointing to its
utility during clinical inference in radiology workflows.

### [5] [MDF-MLLM: Deep Fusion Through Cross-Modal Feature Alignment for Contextually Aware Fundoscopic Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21358)
*Jason Jordan,Mohammadreza Akbari Lor,Peter Koulen,Mei-Ling Shyu,Shu-Ching Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel multimodal deep learning architecture (MDF-MLLM) that integrates fine-grained retinal image features with global textual context significantly improves disease classification accuracy from 60% to 94% compared to baseline MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal large language models struggle to capture low-level spatial details critical for diagnosing retinal diseases like glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa.

Method: The MDF-MLLM integrates skip features from four U-Net encoder layers into cross-attention blocks within a LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM, using patch-wise projection, scaled cross-attention, and FiLM-based U-Net modulation. Both U-Net and MLLM components were fully fine-tuned during training.

Result: MDF-MLLM achieved 94% accuracy (56% improvement over baseline), with recall and F1-scores improving by up to 67% and 35% respectively. The model showed substantial gains in spatial reasoning and classification, particularly for inherited diseases with rich clinical text.

Conclusion: MDF-MLLM presents a generalizable, interpretable, and modular framework for fundus image classification that outperforms traditional MLLM baselines through multi-scale feature fusion, holding promise for clinical decision support systems.

Abstract: This study aimed to enhance disease classification accuracy from retinal
fundus images by integrating fine-grained image features and global textual
context using a novel multimodal deep learning architecture. Existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to capture low-level
spatial details critical for diagnosing retinal diseases such as glaucoma,
diabetic retinopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa. This model development and
validation study was conducted on 1,305 fundus image-text pairs compiled from
three public datasets (FIVES, HRF, and StoneRounds), covering acquired and
inherited retinal diseases, and evaluated using classification accuracy and
F1-score. The MDF-MLLM integrates skip features from four U-Net encoder layers
into cross-attention blocks within a LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM. Vision features are
patch-wise projected and fused using scaled cross-attention and FiLM-based
U-Net modulation. Baseline MLLM achieved 60% accuracy on the dual-type disease
classification task. MDF-MLLM, with both U-Net and MLLM components fully
fine-tuned during training, achieved a significantly higher accuracy of 94%,
representing a 56% improvement. Recall and F1-scores improved by as much as 67%
and 35% over baseline, respectively. Ablation studies confirmed that the
multi-depth fusion approach contributed to substantial gains in spatial
reasoning and classification, particularly for inherited diseases with rich
clinical text. MDF-MLLM presents a generalizable, interpretable, and modular
framework for fundus image classification, outperforming traditional MLLM
baselines through multi-scale feature fusion. The architecture holds promise
for real-world deployment in clinical decision support systems. Future work
will explore synchronized training techniques, a larger pool of diseases for
more generalizability, and extending the model for segmentation tasks.

### [6] [Multimodal Prompt Decoupling Attack on the Safety Filters in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21360)
*Xingkai Peng,Jun Jiang,Meng Tong,Shuai Li,Weiming Zhang,Nenghai Yu,Kejiang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MPDA, a multimodal jailbreak attack that decouples unsafe text prompts into pseudo-safe and harmful components, uses adversarial rewriting to bypass filters, and employs visual feedback for semantic consistency in generating NSFW content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-based jailbreak methods struggle to bypass T2I model safety filters, and image-based vulnerabilities remain unexplored. There's a need for more effective attacks that leverage multimodal inputs.

Method: Three-step approach: 1) LLM decouples unsafe prompts into pseudo-safe and harmful components; 2) LLM rewrites harmful prompts into natural adversarial prompts; 3) Visual language model provides captions for iterative refinement to maintain semantic consistency.

Result: MPDA successfully bypasses safety filters and generates NSFW content that aligns with original unsafe prompts through multimodal prompt manipulation and iterative refinement.

Conclusion: MPDA demonstrates the vulnerability of T2I models to multimodal jailbreak attacks, highlighting the need for more robust safety mechanisms that consider both text and image modalities.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have been widely applied in generating
high-fidelity images across various domains. However, these models may also be
abused to produce Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) content via jailbreak attacks.
Existing jailbreak methods primarily manipulate the textual prompt, leaving
potential vulnerabilities in image-based inputs largely unexplored. Moreover,
text-based methods face challenges in bypassing the model's safety filters. In
response to these limitations, we propose the Multimodal Prompt Decoupling
Attack (MPDA), which utilizes image modality to separate the harmful semantic
components of the original unsafe prompt. MPDA follows three core steps:
firstly, a large language model (LLM) decouples unsafe prompts into pseudo-safe
prompts and harmful prompts. The former are seemingly harmless sub-prompts that
can bypass filters, while the latter are sub-prompts with unsafe semantics that
trigger filters. Subsequently, the LLM rewrites the harmful prompts into
natural adversarial prompts to bypass safety filters, which guide the T2I model
to modify the base image into an NSFW output. Finally, to ensure semantic
consistency between the generated NSFW images and the original unsafe prompts,
the visual language model generates image captions, providing a new pathway to
guide the LLM in iterative rewriting and refining the generated content.

### [7] [A Mutual Learning Method for Salient Object Detection with intertwined Multi-Supervision--Revised](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21363)
*Runmin Wu,Mengyang Feng,Wenlong Guan,Dong Wang,Huchuan Lu,Errui Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a multi-task learning approach for salient object detection that combines salient object detection, foreground contour detection, and edge detection tasks using mutual learning modules to improve prediction completeness and boundary accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in current deep learning-based salient object detection methods, which suffer from incomplete predictions due to object complexity and inaccurate boundaries caused by convolution/pooling operations.

Method: Uses intertwined supervision from three tasks: salient object detection, foreground contour detection, and edge detection. Develops mutual learning modules (MLM) with multiple network branches trained in mutual learning manner to improve performance.

Result: Extensive experiments on seven challenging datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art results in both salient object detection and edge detection.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-task learning approach with mutual learning modules effectively addresses incomplete predictions and boundary inaccuracies in salient object detection, achieving superior performance across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Though deep learning techniques have made great progress in salient object
detection recently, the predicted saliency maps still suffer from incomplete
predictions due to the internal complexity of objects and inaccurate boundaries
caused by strides in convolution and pooling operations. To alleviate these
issues, we propose to train saliency detection networks by exploiting the
supervision from not only salient object detection, but also foreground contour
detection and edge detection. First, we leverage salient object detection and
foreground contour detection tasks in an intertwined manner to generate
saliency maps with uniform highlight. Second, the foreground contour and edge
detection tasks guide each other simultaneously, thereby leading to precise
foreground contour prediction and reducing the local noises for edge
prediction. In addition, we develop a novel mutual learning module (MLM) which
serves as the building block of our method. Each MLM consists of multiple
network branches trained in a mutual learning manner, which improves the
performance by a large margin. Extensive experiments on seven challenging
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method has delivered state-of-the-art
results in both salient object detection and edge detection.

### [8] [MAJORScore: A Novel Metric for Evaluating Multimodal Relevance via Joint Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21365)
*Zhicheng Du,Qingyang Shi,Jiasheng Lu,Yingshan Liang,Xinyu Zhang,Yiran Wang,Peiwu Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAJORScore is a new evaluation metric for multimodal relevance that handles N modalities (N≥3) using multimodal joint representation, outperforming existing methods that only work with two modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal relevance metrics are limited to two modalities (bimodal) and cannot properly evaluate similarity across three or more modalities, which restricts comprehensive multimodal analysis.

Method: Uses multimodal joint representation to integrate multiple modalities into the same latent space, enabling fair relevance scoring across all modalities at one consistent scale.

Result: MAJORScore increases relevance scoring by 26.03%-64.29% for consistent modalities and decreases by 13.28%-20.54% for inconsistent modalities compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: MAJORScore provides a more reliable metric for evaluating similarity on large-scale multimodal datasets and multimodal model performance, overcoming the limitations of bimodal evaluation methods.

Abstract: The multimodal relevance metric is usually borrowed from the embedding
ability of pretrained contrastive learning models for bimodal data, which is
used to evaluate the correlation between cross-modal data (e.g., CLIP).
However, the commonly used evaluation metrics are only suitable for the
associated analysis between two modalities, which greatly limits the evaluation
of multimodal similarity. Herein, we propose MAJORScore, a brand-new evaluation
metric for the relevance of multiple modalities ($N$ modalities, $N\ge3$) via
multimodal joint representation for the first time. The ability of multimodal
joint representation to integrate multiple modalities into the same latent
space can accurately represent different modalities at one scale, providing
support for fair relevance scoring. Extensive experiments have shown that
MAJORScore increases by 26.03%-64.29% for consistent modality and decreases by
13.28%-20.54% for inconsistence compared to existing methods. MAJORScore serves
as a more reliable metric for evaluating similarity on large-scale multimodal
datasets and multimodal model performance evaluation.

### [9] [Safety Assessment of Scaffolding on Construction Site using AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21368)
*Sameer Prabhu,Amit Patwardhan,Ramin Karim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a cloud-based AI platform that uses point cloud data to automate scaffolding inspections, reducing manual effort and improving safety in construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual scaffolding inspections are time-consuming and prone to human error, potentially leading to unsafe conditions on construction sites.

Method: Developed a cloud-based AI platform that processes point cloud data of scaffolding structures and compares them with certified reference data to detect structural modifications.

Result: The system enables automated monitoring of scaffolding, reducing time and effort required for manual inspections.

Conclusion: AI and digitization can enhance scaffolding inspection accuracy and contribute to improved construction site safety through automated monitoring systems.

Abstract: In the construction industry, safety assessment is vital to ensure both the
reliability of assets and the safety of workers. Scaffolding, a key structural
support asset requires regular inspection to detect and identify alterations
from the design rules that may compromise the integrity and stability. At
present, inspections are primarily visual and are conducted by site manager or
accredited personnel to identify deviations. However, visual inspection is
time-intensive and can be susceptible to human errors, which can lead to unsafe
conditions. This paper explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
digitization to enhance the accuracy of scaffolding inspection and contribute
to the safety improvement. A cloud-based AI platform is developed to process
and analyse the point cloud data of scaffolding structure. The proposed system
detects structural modifications through comparison and evaluation of certified
reference data with the recent point cloud data. This approach may enable
automated monitoring of scaffolding, reducing the time and effort required for
manual inspections while enhancing the safety on a construction site.

### [10] [Automated Prompt Generation for Creative and Counterfactual Text-to-image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21375)
*Aleksa Jelaca,Ying Jiao,Chang Tian,Marie-Francine Moens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an automatic prompt engineering framework for counterfactual size control in text-to-image generation, enabling generation of images that contradict common-sense patterns like tiny walrus beside giant button.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of fine-grained controllability in text-to-image generation, specifically counterfactual controllability which enables creativity and exploratory applications by generating images that deliberately contradict common-sense patterns.

Method: Three-component framework: 1) Image evaluator using extended Grounded SAM for dataset construction, 2) Supervised prompt rewriter to produce revised prompts, 3) DPO-trained ranker to select optimal revised prompts. Constructs first counterfactual size text-image dataset.

Result: Achieves 114% improvement over backbone in image evaluator performance. Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ChatGPT-4o in experiments.

Conclusion: Establishes foundation for future research on counterfactual controllability in text-to-image generation through effective automatic prompt engineering framework.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has advanced rapidly with large-scale multimodal
training, yet fine-grained controllability remains a critical challenge.
Counterfactual controllability, defined as the capacity to deliberately
generate images that contradict common-sense patterns, remains a major
challenge but plays a crucial role in enabling creativity and exploratory
applications. In this work, we address this gap with a focus on counterfactual
size (e.g., generating a tiny walrus beside a giant button) and propose an
automatic prompt engineering framework that adapts base prompts into revised
prompts for counterfactual images. The framework comprises three components: an
image evaluator that guides dataset construction by identifying successful
image generations, a supervised prompt rewriter that produces revised prompts,
and a DPO-trained ranker that selects the optimal revised prompt. We construct
the first counterfactual size text-image dataset and enhance the image
evaluator by extending Grounded SAM with refinements, achieving a 114 percent
improvement over its backbone. Experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ChatGPT-4o, establishing a
foundation for future research on counterfactual controllability.

### [11] [In silico Deep Learning Protocols for Label-Free Super-Resolution Microscopy: A Comparative Study of Network Architectures and SNR Dependence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21376)
*Shiraz S Kaderuppan,Jonathan Mar,Andrew Irvine,Anurag Sharma,Muhammad Ramadan Saifuddin,Wai Leong Eugene Wong,Wai Lok Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates two deep neural network architectures (O-Net and Theta-Net) for super-resolution optical microscopy using non-fluorescent phase-contrast techniques, showing they are complementary approaches that perform best under different signal-to-noise ratio conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the resolution limitations of conventional optical microscopy (~200nm) without requiring expensive specialized equipment or fluorescent techniques, making super-resolution microscopy more accessible to non-specialist users.

Method: Used two previously developed deep neural network architectures (O-Net and Theta-Net) to super-resolve images from non-fluorescent phase-modulated microscopes (Zernike PCM and DIC), tested on custom-fabricated nanoscale test targets calibrated with atomic force microscopy.

Result: Both O-Net and Theta-Net performed well but were complementary rather than competing approaches. O-Net performed better with high signal-to-noise ratio images, while Theta-Net was preferred for low signal-to-noise ratio conditions.

Conclusion: The choice of neural network architecture significantly impacts super-resolution performance in non-fluorescent optical nanoscopy, with optimal performance depending on the source image signal-to-noise ratio, even when using identical training datasets and epochs.

Abstract: The field of optical microscopy spans across numerous industries and research
domains, ranging from education to healthcare, quality inspection and analysis.
Nonetheless, a key limitation often cited by optical microscopists refers to
the limit of its lateral resolution (typically defined as ~200nm), with
potential circumventions involving either costly external modules (e.g.
confocal scan heads, etc) and/or specialized techniques [e.g. super-resolution
(SR) fluorescent microscopy]. Addressing these challenges in a normal
(non-specialist) context thus remains an aspect outside the scope of most
microscope users & facilities. This study thus seeks to evaluate an alternative
& economical approach to achieving SR optical microscopy, involving
non-fluorescent phase-modulated microscopical modalities such as Zernike phase
contrast (PCM) and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Two in
silico deep neural network (DNN) architectures which we developed previously
(termed O-Net and Theta-Net) are assessed on their abilities to resolve a
custom-fabricated test target containing nanoscale features calibrated via
atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results of our study demonstrate that
although both O-Net and Theta-Net seemingly performed well when super-resolving
these images, they were complementary (rather than competing) approaches to be
considered for image SR, particularly under different image signal-to-noise
ratios (SNRs). High image SNRs favoured the application of O-Net models, while
low SNRs inclined preferentially towards Theta-Net models. These findings
demonstrate the importance of model architectures (in conjunction with the
source image SNR) on model performance and the SR quality of the generated
images where DNN models are utilized for non-fluorescent optical nanoscopy,
even where the same training dataset & number of epochs are being used.

### [12] [Dynamic Multi-Target Fusion for Efficient Audio-Visual Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21377)
*Yinfeng Yu,Hailong Zhang,Meiling Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DMTF-AVN is a novel audio-visual navigation method that uses multi-target architecture and refined Transformer to dynamically fuse visual and audio cues, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Replica and Matterport3D datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior works overlook deeper perceptual context in audio-visual navigation and fail to effectively leverage multimodal cues. The core challenge is to dynamically integrate visual observations with auditory signals for better navigation guidance.

Method: Proposes Dynamic Multi-Target Fusion (DMTF-AVN) using multi-target architecture coupled with refined Transformer mechanism to filter and selectively fuse cross-modal information from visual and audio data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Replica and Matterport3D datasets, outperforming existing methods in success rate (SR), path efficiency (SPL), and scene adaptation (SNA). Shows strong scalability and generalizability.

Conclusion: DMTF-AVN paves the way for advanced multimodal fusion strategies in robotic navigation by effectively leveraging cross-modal cues through dynamic filtering and selective fusion.

Abstract: Audiovisual embodied navigation enables robots to locate audio sources by
dynamically integrating visual observations from onboard sensors with the
auditory signals emitted by the target. The core challenge lies in effectively
leveraging multimodal cues to guide navigation. While prior works have explored
basic fusion of visual and audio data, they often overlook deeper perceptual
context. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Multi-Target Fusion for
Efficient Audio-Visual Navigation (DMTF-AVN). Our approach uses a multi-target
architecture coupled with a refined Transformer mechanism to filter and
selectively fuse cross-modal information. Extensive experiments on the Replica
and Matterport3D datasets demonstrate that DMTF-AVN achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in success rate (SR), path
efficiency (SPL), and scene adaptation (SNA). Furthermore, the model exhibits
strong scalability and generalizability, paving the way for advanced multimodal
fusion strategies in robotic navigation. The code and videos are available at

### [13] [SAEmnesia: Erasing Concepts in Diffusion Models with Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21379)
*Enrico Cassano,Riccardo Renzulli,Marco Nurisso,Mirko Zaffaroni,Alan Perotti,Marco Grangetto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAEmnesia introduces supervised sparse autoencoder training to create one-to-one concept-neuron mappings, enabling more efficient concept unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models with reduced computational overhead and improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current concept unlearning methods require extensive search procedures because concept representations are distributed across multiple latent features, even after using sparse autoencoders to reduce neuron polysemanticity.

Method: Supervised sparse autoencoder training with systematic concept labeling that promotes one-to-one concept-neuron mappings, mitigating feature splitting and promoting feature centralization.

Result: 96.67% reduction in hyperparameter search, 9.22% improvement on UnlearnCanvas benchmark, and 28.4% improvement in unlearning accuracy for 9-object sequential removal tasks.

Conclusion: SAEmnesia provides an efficient and scalable approach for concept unlearning by learning specialized neurons with strong concept associations, significantly reducing computational overhead while improving unlearning performance.

Abstract: Effective concept unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models requires
precise localization of concept representations within the model's latent
space. While sparse autoencoders successfully reduce neuron polysemanticity
(i.e., multiple concepts per neuron) compared to the original network,
individual concept representations can still be distributed across multiple
latent features, requiring extensive search procedures for concept unlearning.
We introduce SAEmnesia, a supervised sparse autoencoder training method that
promotes one-to-one concept-neuron mappings through systematic concept
labeling, mitigating feature splitting and promoting feature centralization.
Our approach learns specialized neurons with significantly stronger concept
associations compared to unsupervised baselines. The only computational
overhead introduced by SAEmnesia is limited to cross-entropy computation during
training. At inference time, this interpretable representation reduces
hyperparameter search by 96.67% with respect to current approaches. On the
UnlearnCanvas benchmark, SAEmnesia achieves a 9.22% improvement over the
state-of-the-art. In sequential unlearning tasks, we demonstrate superior
scalability with a 28.4% improvement in unlearning accuracy for 9-object
removal.

### [14] [Coreset selection based on Intra-class diversity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21380)
*Imran Ashraf,Mukhtar Ullah,Muhammad Faisal Nadeem,Muhammad Nouman Noor*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an intelligent coreset selection method for deep learning in biomedical image classification that captures intra-class diversity through clustering, outperforming random sampling while reducing computational demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models require substantial computational resources for training and hyperparameter search, especially with large datasets. Random sampling for coreset selection fails to capture intra-class diversity and can be biased in imbalanced datasets.

Method: Proposes an intelligent coreset selection mechanism that extracts intra-class diversity by forming per-class clusters, which are then utilized for final sampling to create representative subsets of the original dataset.

Result: Extensive classification experiments on a biomedical imaging dataset show the proposed scheme outperforms random sampling on several performance metrics under uniform conditions.

Conclusion: The intelligent coreset selection method effectively addresses the limitations of random sampling by capturing intra-class diversity, providing a more representative subset for training and hyperparameter optimization while reducing computational demands.

Abstract: Deep Learning models have transformed various domains, including the
healthcare sector, particularly biomedical image classification by learning
intricate features and enabling accurate diagnostics pertaining to complex
diseases. Recent studies have adopted two different approaches to train DL
models: training from scratch and transfer learning. Both approaches demand
substantial computational time and resources due to the involvement of massive
datasets in model training. These computational demands are further increased
due to the design-space exploration required for selecting optimal
hyperparameters, which typically necessitates several training rounds. With the
growing sizes of datasets, exploring solutions to this problem has recently
gained the research community's attention. A plausible solution is to select a
subset of the dataset for training and hyperparameter search. This subset,
referred to as the corset, must be a representative set of the original
dataset. A straightforward approach to selecting the coreset could be employing
random sampling, albeit at the cost of compromising the representativeness of
the original dataset. A critical limitation of random sampling is the bias
towards the dominant classes in an imbalanced dataset. Even if the dataset has
inter-class balance, this random sampling will not capture intra-class
diversity. This study addresses this issue by introducing an intelligent,
lightweight mechanism for coreset selection. Specifically, it proposes a method
to extract intra-class diversity, forming per-class clusters that are utilized
for the final sampling. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology
by conducting extensive classification experiments on a well-known biomedical
imaging dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the
random sampling approach on several performance metrics for uniform conditions.

### [15] [The LongiMam model for improved breast cancer risk prediction using longitudinal mammograms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21383)
*Manel Rakez,Thomas Louis,Julien Guillaumin,Foucauld Chamming's,Pierre Fillard,Brice Amadeo,Virginie Rondeau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongiMam is an end-to-end deep learning model that integrates current and up to four prior mammograms using CNN and RNN to improve breast cancer prediction in screening programs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models use single or limited prior mammograms and lack adaptation for real-world settings with imbalanced outcome distribution and heterogeneous follow-up.

Method: Combines convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) to capture spatial and temporal patterns from current and up to four prior mammograms, trained on large population-based screening dataset.

Result: Consistently improved prediction when prior mammograms were included; addition of prior and current visits outperformed single-visit models; performed best in women with observed changes in mammographic density over time.

Conclusion: Longitudinal modeling enhances breast cancer prediction and supports using repeated mammograms to refine risk stratification in screening programs.

Abstract: Risk-adapted breast cancer screening requires robust models that leverage
longitudinal imaging data. Most current deep learning models use single or
limited prior mammograms and lack adaptation for real-world settings marked by
imbalanced outcome distribution and heterogeneous follow-up. We developed
LongiMam, an end-to-end deep learning model that integrates both current and up
to four prior mammograms. LongiMam combines a convolutional and a recurrent
neural network to capture spatial and temporal patterns predictive of breast
cancer. The model was trained and evaluated using a large, population-based
screening dataset with disproportionate case-to-control ratio typical of
clinical screening. Across several scenarios that varied in the number and
composition of prior exams, LongiMam consistently improved prediction when
prior mammograms were included. The addition of prior and current visits
outperformed single-visit models, while priors alone performed less well,
highlighting the importance of combining historical and recent information.
Subgroup analyses confirmed the model's efficacy across key risk groups,
including women with dense breasts and those aged 55 years or older. Moreover,
the model performed best in women with observed changes in mammographic density
over time. These findings demonstrate that longitudinal modeling enhances
breast cancer prediction and support the use of repeated mammograms to refine
risk stratification in screening programs. LongiMam is publicly available as
open-source software.

### [16] [Assessing the Alignment of Popular CNNs to the Brain for Valence Appraisal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21384)
*Laurent Mertens,Elahe' Yargholi,Laura Van Hove,Hans Op de Beeck,Jan Van den Stock,Joost Vennekens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores whether CNN architectures correspond to human social cognition processes, specifically image valence appraisal, finding that CNNs struggle with higher-order brain processing despite some visual perception similarities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if the known correspondences between CNNs and human visual perception extend to more complex social cognition processes like image valence appraisal.

Method: Used correlation analysis between CNN architectures and human behavioral/fMRI data, and developed Object2Brain framework combining GradCAM and object detection at CNN-filter level to study object class influences.

Result: CNNs showed limited alignment with human social cognition, struggling beyond simple visual processing; different architectures displayed varying object class sensitivities despite similar correlation trends.

Conclusion: The correspondence between CNNs and human brain processing does not extend well to higher-order social cognition tasks, with CNNs primarily reflecting basic visual processing rather than complex cognitive functions.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a popular type of computer model
that have proven their worth in many computer vision tasks. Moreover, they form
an interesting study object for the field of psychology, with shown
correspondences between the workings of CNNs and the human brain. However,
these correspondences have so far mostly been studied in the context of general
visual perception. In contrast, this paper explores to what extent this
correspondence also holds for a more complex brain process, namely social
cognition. To this end, we assess the alignment between popular CNN
architectures and both human behavioral and fMRI data for image valence
appraisal through a correlation analysis. We show that for this task CNNs
struggle to go beyond simple visual processing, and do not seem to reflect
higher-order brain processing. Furthermore, we present Object2Brain, a novel
framework that combines GradCAM and object detection at the CNN-filter level
with the aforementioned correlation analysis to study the influence of
different object classes on the CNN-to-human correlations. Despite similar
correlation trends, different CNN architectures are shown to display different
object class sensitivities.

### [17] [Debugging Concept Bottleneck Models through Removal and Retraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21385)
*Eric Enouen,Sainyam Galhotra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CBDebug is an interpretable debugging framework for Concept Bottleneck Models that removes undesired concepts and retrains models using concept-level feedback converted to sample-level labels for bias mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address systemic misalignment between CBMs and expert reasoning when models learn shortcuts from biased data, going beyond individual concept interventions.

Method: Two-step process: Removal (experts identify/remove undesired concepts) and Retraining (CBDebug converts concept feedback to sample labels for supervised bias mitigation and targeted augmentation).

Result: CBDebug significantly outperforms prior retraining methods across multiple CBM architectures (PIP-Net, Post-hoc CBM) and benchmarks with known spurious correlations.

Conclusion: The framework effectively reduces model reliance on undesired concepts by leveraging CBM interpretability to translate expert feedback into actionable training signals.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) use a set of human-interpretable concepts to
predict the final task label, enabling domain experts to not only validate the
CBM's predictions, but also intervene on incorrect concepts at test time.
However, these interventions fail to address systemic misalignment between the
CBM and the expert's reasoning, such as when the model learns shortcuts from
biased data. To address this, we present a general interpretable debugging
framework for CBMs that follows a two-step process of Removal and Retraining.
In the Removal step, experts use concept explanations to identify and remove
any undesired concepts. In the Retraining step, we introduce CBDebug, a novel
method that leverages the interpretability of CBMs as a bridge for converting
concept-level user feedback into sample-level auxiliary labels. These labels
are then used to apply supervised bias mitigation and targeted augmentation,
reducing the model's reliance on undesired concepts. We evaluate our framework
with both real and automated expert feedback, and find that CBDebug
significantly outperforms prior retraining methods across multiple CBM
architectures (PIP-Net, Post-hoc CBM) and benchmarks with known spurious
correlations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShipwreckFinder is an open-source QGIS plugin that uses deep learning to automatically detect shipwrecks from multibeam sonar data, outperforming existing methods like ArcGIS toolkit and inverse sinkhole detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual inspection of bathymetric data for shipwreck detection is time-consuming and requires expert analysis, creating a need for automated tools to streamline this process.

Method: The tool uses a deep learning model trained on shipwreck data from the Great Lakes and Irish coasts, enhanced with synthetic data generation. It performs automatic preprocessing, deep learning inference, thresholding, and produces segmentation masks or bounding boxes.

Result: The tool demonstrates superior segmentation performance compared to deep learning-based ArcGIS toolkit and classical inverse sinkhole detection methods.

Conclusion: ShipwreckFinder provides an effective open-source solution for automated shipwreck detection from sonar data, making the process more efficient and accessible.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ShipwreckFinder, an open-source QGIS plugin that
detects shipwrecks from multibeam sonar data. Shipwrecks are an important
historical marker of maritime history, and can be discovered through manual
inspection of bathymetric data. However, this is a time-consuming process and
often requires expert analysis. Our proposed tool allows users to automatically
preprocess bathymetry data, perform deep learning inference, threshold model
outputs, and produce either pixel-wise segmentation masks or bounding boxes of
predicted shipwrecks. The backbone of this open-source tool is a deep learning
model, which is trained on a variety of shipwreck data from the Great Lakes and
the coasts of Ireland. Additionally, we employ synthetic data generation in
order to increase the size and diversity of our dataset. We demonstrate
superior segmentation performance with our open-source tool and training
pipeline as compared to a deep learning-based ArcGIS toolkit and a more
classical inverse sinkhole detection method. The open-source tool can be found

*Sanish Suwal,Dipkamal Bhusal,Michael Clifford,Nidhi Rastogi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates how magnitude-based pruning affects neural network interpretability, finding that light-to-moderate pruning improves saliency map quality and concept coherence, while aggressive pruning reduces interpretability despite maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how neural network pruning impacts model interpretability, specifically examining both low-level saliency maps and high-level concept representations, as prior work focused mainly on performance preservation rather than interpretability.

Method: Used ResNet-18 trained on ImageNette, applied magnitude-based pruning followed by fine-tuning, compared post-hoc explanations from Vanilla Gradients and Integrated Gradients across pruning levels, and applied CRAFT-based concept extraction to evaluate semantic coherence.

Result: Light-to-moderate pruning improved saliency-map focus and faithfulness while retaining distinct, meaningful concepts. Aggressive pruning merged heterogeneous features, reducing saliency map sparsity and concept coherence despite maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: Pruning can shape internal representations toward more human-aligned attention patterns, but excessive pruning undermines interpretability by merging features and reducing concept coherence.

Abstract: Prior works have shown that neural networks can be heavily pruned while
preserving performance, but the impact of pruning on model interpretability
remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how magnitude-based pruning
followed by fine-tuning affects both low-level saliency maps and high-level
concept representations. Using a ResNet-18 trained on ImageNette, we compare
post-hoc explanations from Vanilla Gradients (VG) and Integrated Gradients (IG)
across pruning levels, evaluating sparsity and faithfulness. We further apply
CRAFT-based concept extraction to track changes in semantic coherence of
learned concepts. Our results show that light-to-moderate pruning improves
saliency-map focus and faithfulness while retaining distinct, semantically
meaningful concepts. In contrast, aggressive pruning merges heterogeneous
features, reducing saliency map sparsity and concept coherence despite
maintaining accuracy. These findings suggest that while pruning can shape
internal representations toward more human-aligned attention patterns,
excessive pruning undermines interpretability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TUN3D is the first method for joint layout estimation and 3D object detection from multi-view images without requiring ground-truth camera poses or depth supervision, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple indoor scene understanding benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches rely on point cloud input, which limits practical application since most consumer cameras lack depth sensors and visual-only data is more common. There's a need for methods that work directly from multi-view images without requiring ground-truth camera poses or depth supervision.

Method: Builds on a lightweight sparse-convolutional backbone with two dedicated heads: one for 3D object detection and one for layout estimation using a novel parametric wall representation. Works with multi-view images without requiring ground-truth camera poses or depth supervision.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across three challenging benchmarks: using ground-truth point clouds, posed images, and unposed images. Performs on par with specialized 3D object detection methods while significantly advancing layout estimation.

Conclusion: TUN3D sets a new benchmark in holistic indoor scene understanding by enabling joint layout estimation and 3D object detection from multi-view images without requiring ground-truth camera poses or depth supervision, making it more practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Layout estimation and 3D object detection are two fundamental tasks in indoor
scene understanding. When combined, they enable the creation of a compact yet
semantically rich spatial representation of a scene. Existing approaches
typically rely on point cloud input, which poses a major limitation since most
consumer cameras lack depth sensors and visual-only data remains far more
common. We address this issue with TUN3D, the first method that tackles joint
layout estimation and 3D object detection in real scans, given multi-view
images as input, and does not require ground-truth camera poses or depth
supervision. Our approach builds on a lightweight sparse-convolutional backbone
and employs two dedicated heads: one for 3D object detection and one for layout
estimation, leveraging a novel and effective parametric wall representation.
Extensive experiments show that TUN3D achieves state-of-the-art performance
across three challenging scene understanding benchmarks: (i) using ground-truth
point clouds, (ii) using posed images, and (iii) using unposed images. While
performing on par with specialized 3D object detection methods, TUN3D
significantly advances layout estimation, setting a new benchmark in holistic
indoor scene understanding. Code is available at

*Qiyu Ma,Wanli Ni,Zhijin Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A generative semantic communication system that segments images into key and non-key regions, using different processing methods for each to improve transmission efficiency while maintaining visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic communication methods often treat all image regions equally, potentially compromising reconstruction quality of visually critical content. The paper aims to address this by recognizing the varying importance of different image regions.

Method: Images are segmented into key regions (processed with image-oriented semantic encoder) and non-key regions (compressed via image-to-text modeling). Uses lightweight deployment with model quantization and low-rank adaptation fine-tuning to reduce computational demands.

Result: Simulation results show the proposed system outperforms traditional methods in both semantic fidelity and visual quality for image transmission tasks.

Conclusion: The system effectively improves image transmission by refining semantic granularity through region-based processing while maintaining performance through efficient deployment strategies.

Abstract: The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has
introduced significant opportunities for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy
of image transmission within semantic communication systems. Despite these
advancements, existing methodologies often neglect the difference in importance
of different regions of the image, potentially compromising the reconstruction
quality of visually critical content. To address this issue, we introduce an
innovative generative semantic communication system that refines semantic
granularity by segmenting images into key and non-key regions. Key regions,
which contain essential visual information, are processed using an image
oriented semantic encoder, while non-key regions are efficiently compressed
through an image-to-text modeling approach. Additionally, to mitigate the
substantial storage and computational demands posed by large AI models, the
proposed system employs a lightweight deployment strategy incorporating model
quantization and low-rank adaptation fine-tuning techniques, significantly
boosting resource utilization without sacrificing performance. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms traditional methods in
terms of both semantic fidelity and visual quality, thereby affirming its
effectiveness for image transmission tasks.

### [23] [Skeleton Sparsification and Densification Scale-Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21398)
*Julia Gierke,Pascal Peter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces skeletonisation scale-spaces, a novel framework that combines medial axis theory with sparsification principles to create hierarchical shape simplifications that overcome the noise sensitivity of traditional medial axis representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The medial axis (Hamilton-Jacobi skeleton) is a powerful shape descriptor but suffers from extreme sensitivity to boundary noise, where minor variations cause disproportionately large skeletal expansions. Classical pruning methods address this but lack systematic hierarchical properties.

Method: The authors propose skeletonisation scale-spaces that leverage sparsification of the medial axis to achieve hierarchical simplification. The framework satisfies key scale-space properties including hierarchical architecture, controllable simplification, and geometric equivariance. They provide both continuous and discrete formulations and extend with densification for inverse progression from coarse to fine scales.

Result: The framework produces hierarchical shape representations that can range from coarse to fine scales, including overcomplete representations beyond the original skeleton. Proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate effectiveness for robust skeletonisation, shape compression, and stiffness enhancement in additive manufacturing.

Conclusion: Skeletonisation scale-spaces provide a theoretically grounded approach to hierarchical shape simplification that overcomes the noise sensitivity limitations of traditional medial axis representations, with practical applications in multiple domains including manufacturing and shape analysis.

Abstract: The Hamilton-Jacobi skeleton, also known as the medial axis, is a powerful
shape descriptor that represents binary objects in terms of the centres of
maximal inscribed discs. Despite its broad applicability, the medial axis
suffers from sensitivity to noise: minor boundary variations can lead to
disproportionately large and undesirable expansions of the skeleton. Classical
pruning methods mitigate this shortcoming by systematically removing extraneous
skeletal branches. This sequential simplification of skeletons resembles the
principle of sparsification scale-spaces that embed images into a family of
reconstructions from increasingly sparse pixel representations.
  We combine both worlds by introducing skeletonisation scale-spaces: They
leverage sparsification of the medial axis to achieve hierarchical
simplification of shapes. Unlike conventional pruning, our framework inherently
satisfies key scale-space properties such as hierarchical architecture,
controllable simplification, and equivariance to geometric transformations. We
provide a rigorous theoretical foundation in both continuous and discrete
formulations and extend the concept further with densification. This allows
inverse progression from coarse to fine scales and can even reach beyond the
original skeleton to produce overcomplete shape representations with relevancy
for practical applications.
  Through proof-of-concept experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework for practical tasks including robust skeletonisation, shape
compression, and stiffness enhancement for additive manufacturing.

TL;DR: Using single-image super-resolution models to downscale climate projections from 12.5 km to 1 km resolution, trained on observational data and evaluated using climate indicators without ground-truth high-resolution projections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution climate projections are essential for local decision-making, but current projections have low spatial resolution (12.5 km) which limits their usability.

Method: Train single-image super-resolution models on high-resolution observational gridded data, then apply them to low-resolution climate projections. Use climate indicator-based assessment with observed climate indices from weather stations for evaluation.

Result: Experiments on daily mean temperature show that super-resolution models can downscale climate projections without increasing the error of climate indicators compared to low-resolution projections.

Conclusion: Single-image super-resolution models are effective for statistically downscaling climate projections to higher resolution when trained on observational data and evaluated using climate indicators.

Abstract: High-resolution climate projections are essential for local decision-making.
However, available climate projections have low spatial resolution (e.g. 12.5
km), which limits their usability. We address this limitation by leveraging
single-image super-resolution models to statistically downscale climate
projections to 1-km resolution. Since high-resolution climate projections are
unavailable for training, we train models on a high-resolution observational
gridded data set and apply them to low-resolution climate projections. We
propose a climate indicator-based assessment using observed climate indices
computed at weather station locations to evaluate the downscaled climate
projections without ground-truth high-resolution climate projections.
Experiments on daily mean temperature demonstrate that single-image
super-resolution models can downscale climate projections without increasing
the error of climate indicators compared to low-resolution climate projections.

TL;DR: JaiLIP is a jailbreaking attack method that uses loss-guided image perturbations to make Vision-Language Models generate harmful outputs while keeping the perturbations imperceptible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models are vulnerable to image-based attacks that can bypass safety alignments, and existing jailbreaking methods have unstable performance and visible perturbations.

Method: Jailbreaking with Loss-guided Image Perturbation (JaiLIP) minimizes a joint objective combining MSE loss between clean and adversarial images with the model's harmful-output loss.

Result: JaiLIP generates highly effective and imperceptible adversarial images that outperform existing methods in producing toxicity, and works in practical domains like transportation.

Conclusion: Image-based jailbreak attacks pose practical challenges for VLMs, highlighting the need for efficient defense mechanisms.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have remarkable abilities in generating
multimodal reasoning tasks. However, potential misuse or safety alignment
concerns of VLMs have increased significantly due to different categories of
attack vectors. Among various attack vectors, recent studies have demonstrated
that image-based perturbations are particularly effective in generating harmful
outputs. In the literature, many existing techniques have been proposed to
jailbreak VLMs, leading to unstable performance and visible perturbations. In
this study, we propose Jailbreaking with Loss-guided Image Perturbation
(JaiLIP), a jailbreaking attack in the image space that minimizes a joint
objective combining the mean squared error (MSE) loss between clean and
adversarial image with the models harmful-output loss. We evaluate our proposed
method on VLMs using standard toxicity metrics from Perspective API and
Detoxify. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates highly
effective and imperceptible adversarial images, outperforming existing methods
in producing toxicity. Moreover, we have evaluated our method in the
transportation domain to demonstrate the attacks practicality beyond toxic text
generation in specific domain. Our findings emphasize the practical challenges
of image-based jailbreak attacks and the need for efficient defense mechanisms
for VLMs.

TL;DR: The paper compares automated plant identification systems with human expert botanists, finding that deep learning models now perform close to human expertise levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify the gap between automated species identification systems and human experts, and compare their performance given that even experts can be uncertain due to partial information in observations.

Method: LifeCLEF 2018 ExpertCLEF challenge evaluated 19 deep-learning systems from 4 research teams against 9 expert botanists of French flora using standardized resources and assessments.

Result: State-of-the-art deep learning models achieved performance levels close to the most advanced human expertise in plant identification.

Conclusion: Automated plant identification using deep learning has reached near-human expert performance, representing significant progress in the field.

Abstract: Automated identification of plants and animals has improved considerably in
the last few years, in particular thanks to the recent advances in deep
learning. The next big question is how far such automated systems are from the
human expertise. Indeed, even the best experts are sometimes confused and/or
disagree between each others when validating visual or audio observations of
living organism. A picture actually contains only a partial information that is
usually not sufficient to determine the right species with certainty.
Quantifying this uncertainty and comparing it to the performance of automated
systems is of high interest for both computer scientists and expert
naturalists. The LifeCLEF 2018 ExpertCLEF challenge presented in this paper was
designed to allow this comparison between human experts and automated systems.
In total, 19 deep-learning systems implemented by 4 different research teams
were evaluated with regard to 9 expert botanists of the French flora. The main
outcome of this work is that the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning
models is now close to the most advanced human expertise. This paper presents
more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge, summarizes the
approaches and systems employed by the participating research groups, and
provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuadGPT is the first autoregressive framework for end-to-end quadrilateral mesh generation, using sequence prediction with unified tokenization for mixed topologies and RL fine-tuning to surpass previous triangle-to-quad conversion methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods generate quad meshes by first creating triangle meshes and then merging them, which produces poor topology quality in the resulting quadrilateral meshes.

Method: QuadGPT uses an autoregressive framework with sequence prediction, featuring a unified tokenization method for mixed triangle/quadrilateral topologies and a specialized Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning method called tDPO.

Result: Extensive experiments show QuadGPT significantly outperforms previous triangle-to-quad conversion pipelines in both geometric accuracy and topological quality.

Conclusion: This work establishes a new benchmark for native quad-mesh generation and demonstrates the effectiveness of combining large-scale autoregressive models with topology-aware RL refinement for structured 3D asset creation.

Abstract: The generation of quadrilateral-dominant meshes is a cornerstone of
professional 3D content creation. However, existing generative models generate
quad meshes by first generating triangle meshes and then merging triangles into
quadrilaterals with some specific rules, which typically produces quad meshes
with poor topology. In this paper, we introduce QuadGPT, the first
autoregressive framework for generating quadrilateral meshes in an end-to-end
manner. QuadGPT formulates this as a sequence prediction paradigm,
distinguished by two key innovations: a unified tokenization method to handle
mixed topologies of triangles and quadrilaterals, and a specialized
Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning method tDPO for better generation quality.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuadGPT significantly surpasses previous
triangle-to-quad conversion pipelines in both geometric accuracy and
topological quality. Our work establishes a new benchmark for native quad-mesh
generation and showcases the power of combining large-scale autoregressive
models with topology-aware RL refinement for creating structured 3D assets.

*Jiaqi Liu,Lan Zhang,Xiaoyong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DyME is an on-demand concept erasure framework for diffusion models that uses dynamic composition of lightweight LoRA adapters with orthogonality constraints to enable flexible multi-concept erasure while minimizing interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models inadvertently reproduce copyrighted styles and protected visual concepts, raising legal and ethical concerns. Existing concept erasure methods don't scale to practical settings with multiple and potentially conflicting concepts due to their reliance on static erasure approaches.

Method: Proposes DyME framework that trains lightweight, concept-specific LoRA adapters and dynamically composes only those needed at inference. Introduces bi-level orthogonality constraints at feature and parameter levels to disentangle representation shifts and enforce orthogonal adapter subspaces, overcoming interference issues.

Result: Experiments on ErasureBench-H (new hierarchical benchmark) and standard datasets show DyME consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher multi-concept erasure fidelity with minimal collateral degradation.

Conclusion: DyME provides an effective solution for scalable multi-concept erasure in diffusion models through its modular adapter composition approach with orthogonality constraints, addressing the limitations of static erasure methods in practical settings.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) inadvertently reproduce copyrighted
styles and protected visual concepts, raising legal and ethical concerns.
Concept erasure has emerged as a safeguard, aiming to selectively suppress such
concepts through fine-tuning. However, existing methods do not scale to
practical settings where providers must erase multiple and possibly conflicting
concepts. The core bottleneck is their reliance on static erasure: a single
checkpoint is fine-tuned to remove all target concepts, regardless of the
actual erasure needs at inference. This rigid design mismatches real-world
usage, where requests vary per generation, leading to degraded erasure success
and reduced fidelity for non-target content. We propose DyME, an on-demand
erasure framework that trains lightweight, concept-specific LoRA adapters and
dynamically composes only those needed at inference. This modular design
enables flexible multi-concept erasure, but naive composition causes
interference among adapters, especially when many or semantically related
concepts are suppressed. To overcome this, we introduce bi-level orthogonality
constraints at both the feature and parameter levels, disentangling
representation shifts and enforcing orthogonal adapter subspaces. We further
develop ErasureBench-H, a new hierarchical benchmark with
brand-series-character structure, enabling principled evaluation across
semantic granularities and erasure set sizes. Experiments on ErasureBench-H and
standard datasets (e.g., CIFAR-100, Imagenette) demonstrate that DyME
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher
multi-concept erasure fidelity with minimal collateral degradation.

TL;DR: VideoJudge is a 3B/7B MLLM specialized for evaluating video understanding models, outperforming larger baselines and showing that video inputs are crucial for accurate evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics like BLEU/ROUGE fail to capture human judgment nuances, while manual evaluation is costly. LLM/MLLM evaluators for video understanding remain underexplored.

Method: Training involves generator-evaluator interplay: generator produces responses conditioned on target ratings, mismatched responses are discarded to train the specialized MLLM judge.

Result: VideoJudge-7B outperforms larger MLLM baselines (Qwen2.5-VL 32B/72B) on 3 out of 4 benchmarks. LLM judges perform worse than MLLM judges, and chain-of-thought reasoning doesn't help.

Conclusion: Video inputs are essential for evaluating video understanding tasks, and specialized smaller MLLMs can outperform larger general-purpose models in this domain.

Abstract: Precisely evaluating video understanding models remains challenging: commonly
used metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore fail to capture the fineness of
human judgment, while obtaining such judgments through manual evaluation is
costly. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) or
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as evaluators, but their extension to video
understanding remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we introduce
VideoJudge, a 3B and 7B-sized MLLM judge specialized to evaluate outputs from
video understanding models (\textit{i.e.}, text responses conditioned on
videos). To train VideoJudge, our recipe builds on the interplay between a
generator and an evaluator: the generator is prompted to produce responses
conditioned on a target rating, and responses not matching the evaluator's
rating are discarded. Across three out of four meta-evaluation benchmarks,
VideoJudge-7B outperforms larger MLLM judge baselines such as Qwen2.5-VL (32B
and 72B). Notably, we find that LLM judges (Qwen3) models perform worse than
MLLM judges (Qwen2.5-VL) and long chain-of-thought reasoning does not improve
performance, indicating that providing video inputs is crucial for evaluation
of video understanding tasks.

### [30] [Residual Vector Quantization For Communication-Efficient Multi-Agent Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21464)
*Dereje Shenkut,B. V. K Vijaya Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReVQom is a learned feature codec for multi-agent collaborative perception that achieves 273x to 1365x compression (6-30 bpp) while preserving spatial identity and maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent collaborative perception improves scene understanding but faces scalability constraints due to communication bandwidth limitations.

Method: End-to-end method using a simple bottleneck network followed by multi-stage residual vector quantization (RVQ) to compress feature dimensions, transmitting only per-pixel code indices.

Result: Achieves 273x compression at 30 bpp to 1365x compression at 6 bpp on DAIR-V2X dataset, matches or outperforms raw-feature CP at 18 bpp (455x), and enables ultra-low-bandwidth operation with graceful degradation at 6-12 bpp.

Conclusion: ReVQom enables efficient and accurate multi-agent collaborative perception, representing a step toward practical V2X deployment.

Abstract: Multi-agent collaborative perception (CP) improves scene understanding by
sharing information across connected agents such as autonomous vehicles,
unmanned aerial vehicles, and robots. Communication bandwidth, however,
constrains scalability. We present ReVQom, a learned feature codec that
preserves spatial identity while compressing intermediate features. ReVQom is
an end-to-end method that compresses feature dimensions via a simple bottleneck
network followed by multi-stage residual vector quantization (RVQ). This allows
only per-pixel code indices to be transmitted, reducing payloads from 8192 bits
per pixel (bpp) of uncompressed 32-bit float features to 6-30 bpp per agent
with minimal accuracy loss. On DAIR-V2X real-world CP dataset, ReVQom achieves
273x compression at 30 bpp to 1365x compression at 6 bpp. At 18 bpp (455x),
ReVQom matches or outperforms raw-feature CP, and at 6-12 bpp it enables
ultra-low-bandwidth operation with graceful degradation. ReVQom allows
efficient and accurate multi-agent collaborative perception with a step toward
practical V2X deployment.

### [31] [Gender Stereotypes in Professional Roles Among Saudis: An Analytical Study of AI-Generated Images Using Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21466)
*Khaloud S. AlKhalifah,Malak Mashaabi,Hend Al-Khalifa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Text-to-Image AI models (ImageFX, DALL-E V3, Grok) show strong gender bias and cultural inaccuracies when generating Saudi professionals, with DALL-E V3 being most biased (96% male outputs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how current AI models perpetuate gender stereotypes and cultural inaccuracies in depicting Saudi professionals, revealing biases in training data.

Method: Analyzed 1,006 images from three AI models using neutral prompts for 56 Saudi professions, with two trained Saudi annotators evaluating five dimensions and a third researcher adjudicating disagreements.

Result: Strong gender imbalance across all models (85-96% male), most evident in leadership/technical roles, with frequent cultural inaccuracies in clothing, settings, and activities.

Conclusion: Current models mirror societal biases from training data, offering limited reflection of Saudi labor market diversity, highlighting need for more diverse data, fairer algorithms, and culturally sensitive evaluation.

Abstract: This study investigates the extent to which contemporary Text-to-Image
artificial intelligence (AI) models perpetuate gender stereotypes and cultural
inaccuracies when generating depictions of professionals in Saudi Arabia. We
analyzed 1,006 images produced by ImageFX, DALL-E V3, and Grok for 56 diverse
Saudi professions using neutral prompts. Two trained Saudi annotators evaluated
each image on five dimensions: perceived gender, clothing and appearance,
background and setting, activities and interactions, and age. A third senior
researcher adjudicated whenever the two primary raters disagreed, yielding
10,100 individual judgements. The results reveal a strong gender imbalance,
with ImageFX outputs being 85\% male, Grok 86.6\% male, and DALL-E V3 96\%
male, indicating that DALL-E V3 exhibited the strongest overall gender
stereotyping. This imbalance was most evident in leadership and technical
roles. Moreover, cultural inaccuracies in clothing, settings, and depicted
activities were frequently observed across all three models.
Counter-stereotypical images often arise from cultural misinterpretations
rather than genuinely progressive portrayals. We conclude that current models
mirror societal biases embedded in their training data, generated by humans,
offering only a limited reflection of the Saudi labour market's gender dynamics
and cultural nuances. These findings underscore the urgent need for more
diverse training data, fairer algorithms, and culturally sensitive evaluation
frameworks to ensure equitable and authentic visual outputs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a reasoning-enhanced MLLM pretraining paradigm with three tasks (Caption, VQA, CoT) to improve inappropriate content detection in short videos, addressing distribution gaps and complex issue definitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches require separate models for each content issue type, needing extensive human-labeled data and lacking cross-issue generalization capabilities.

Method: Introduces three pretraining tasks: Caption for video detail perception, VQA for understanding issue definitions, and Chain-of-Thought for reasoning enhancement in multimodal large language models.

Result: Pretraining approach significantly improves MLLM performance in both zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning settings, with strong generalization to emergent, unseen issues.

Conclusion: The reasoning-enhanced MLLM pretraining paradigm effectively addresses distribution gaps and complex issue definitions, enabling unified inappropriate content detection with improved generalization.

Abstract: Short video platforms are evolving rapidly, making the identification of
inappropriate content increasingly critical. Existing approaches typically
train separate and small classification models for each type of issue, which
requires extensive human-labeled data and lacks cross-issue generalization. We
propose a reasoning-enhanced multimodal large language model (MLLM) pretraining
paradigm for unified inappropriate content detection. To address the
distribution gap between short video content and the original pretraining data
of MLLMs, as well as the complex issue definitions, we introduce three targeted
pretraining tasks: (1) \textit{Caption}, to enhance the MLLM's perception of
video details; (2) \textit{Visual Question Answering (VQA)}, to deepen the
MLLM's understanding of issue definitions and annotation guidelines; (3)
\textit{Chain-of-Thought (CoT)}, to enhance the MLLM's reasoning capability.
Experimental results show that our pretraining approach significantly improves
the MLLM's performance in both zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
settings. In addition, our pretrained model demonstrates strong generalization
capabilities to emergent, previously unseen issues.

TL;DR: GUI-Cursor reframes GUI grounding as an interactive search task where a VLM moves a cursor step-by-step to locate UI elements, achieving state-of-the-art performance on ScreenSpot benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional coordinate prediction approaches for GUI grounding often fail with high-resolution GUI images and complex layouts, leading to inaccurate numeric coordinate predictions.

Method: Transform GUI grounding into interactive search with cursor movement, using multi-step online reinforcement learning with dense trajectory-based rewards. The model evaluates spatial relations and moves cursor closer to target based on movement history.

Result: GUI-Cursor improves GUI grounding accuracy significantly: ScreenSpot-v2 (88.8% → 93.9%) and ScreenSpot-Pro (26.8% → 56.5%). It solves problems within 2 steps for 95% of instances and adapts step count for difficult examples.

Conclusion: Interactive search paradigm with visual feedback through cursor movement is more effective than direct coordinate prediction for GUI grounding, enabling better spatial reasoning and adaptive problem-solving.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding is commonly framed as a coordinate
prediction task -- given a natural language instruction, generate on-screen
coordinates for actions such as clicks and keystrokes. However, recent Vision
Language Models (VLMs) often fail to predict accurate numeric coordinates when
processing high-resolution GUI images with complex layouts. To address this
issue, we reframe GUI grounding as an \emph{interactive search task}, where the
VLM generates actions to move a cursor in the GUI to locate UI elements. At
each step, the model determines the target object, evaluates the spatial
relations between the cursor and the target, and moves the cursor closer to the
target conditioned on the movement history. In this interactive process, the
rendered cursor provides visual feedback to help the model align its
predictions with the corresponding on-screen locations. We train our GUI
grounding model, GUI-Cursor, using multi-step online reinforcement learning
with a dense trajectory-based reward function. Our experimental results show
that GUI-Cursor, based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, improves the GUI grounding accuracy
and achieves state-of-the-art results on ScreenSpot-v2 ($88.8\% \rightarrow
93.9\%$) and ScreenSpot-Pro ($26.8\% \rightarrow 56.5\%$). Moreover, we observe
that GUI-Cursor learns to solve the problem within two steps for 95\% of
instances and can adaptively conduct more steps on more difficult examples.

*Prasanna Reddy Pulakurthi,Jiamian Wang,Majid Rabbani,Sohail Dianat,Raghuveer Rao,Zhiqiang Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-CoT is an explainable text-to-video retrieval framework that replaces traditional embedding-based similarity ranking with LLM chain-of-thought reasoning, providing detailed explanations for ranking results and improving retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional text-to-video retrieval systems have two limitations: they are compromised by low-quality text-video data pairs that are hard to identify, and cosine similarity alone provides no explanation for ranking results, limiting interpretability.

Method: Proposes X-CoT framework using LLM chain-of-thought reasoning instead of embedding models. Expands benchmarks with additional video annotations, and devises a retrieval CoT consisting of pairwise comparison steps that yield detailed reasoning and complete ranking.

Result: X-CoT empirically improves retrieval performance and produces detailed rationales. It also facilitates model behavior and data quality analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed X-CoT framework successfully addresses interpretability issues in text-to-video retrieval while improving performance, enabling better assessment of retrieval models and examination of text-video data quality.

Abstract: Prevalent text-to-video retrieval systems mainly adopt embedding models for
feature extraction and compute cosine similarities for ranking. However, this
design presents two limitations. Low-quality text-video data pairs could
compromise the retrieval, yet are hard to identify and examine. Cosine
similarity alone provides no explanation for the ranking results, limiting the
interpretability. We ask that can we interpret the ranking results, so as to
assess the retrieval models and examine the text-video data? This work proposes
X-CoT, an explainable retrieval framework upon LLM CoT reasoning in place of
the embedding model-based similarity ranking. We first expand the existing
benchmarks with additional video annotations to support semantic understanding
and reduce data bias. We also devise a retrieval CoT consisting of pairwise
comparison steps, yielding detailed reasoning and complete ranking. X-CoT
empirically improves the retrieval performance and produces detailed
rationales. It also facilitates the model behavior and data quality analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a domain-adapted unsupervised defect detection method for surgical instruments that addresses false positives from textured backgrounds, poor sensitivity to small defects, and domain shift issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual inspection of surgical instruments is error-prone, and existing automated methods trained on natural/industrial images fail to transfer effectively to the surgical domain due to domain shift, false positives from textured backgrounds, and poor detection of small defects.

Method: Integrates background masking, patch-based analysis strategy, and efficient domain adaptation to adapt unsupervised defect detection methods specifically for surgical instruments.

Result: Enables reliable detection of fine-grained defects in surgical instrument imagery by overcoming limitations of existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an effective solution for automated surgical instrument defect detection by specifically addressing domain-specific challenges through background masking, patch-based analysis, and domain adaptation.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of surgical instruments requires reliable detection of
visual defects. However, manual inspection is prone to error, and existing
automated defect detection methods, typically trained on natural/industrial
images, fail to transfer effectively to the surgical domain. We demonstrate
that simply applying or fine-tuning these approaches leads to issues: false
positive detections arising from textured backgrounds, poor sensitivity to
small, subtle defects, and inadequate capture of instrument-specific features
due to domain shift. To address these challenges, we propose a versatile method
that adapts unsupervised defect detection methods specifically for surgical
instruments. By integrating background masking, a patch-based analysis
strategy, and efficient domain adaptation, our method overcomes these
limitations, enabling the reliable detection of fine-grained defects in
surgical instrument imagery.

*Junno Yun,Yaşar Utku Alçalar,Mehmet Akçakaya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes LSEP (Linear SEParability) regularization as an alternative to representation alignment methods, eliminating the need for expensive pretrained encoders while improving training efficiency and generation quality in diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current alignment-based approaches for improving discriminative features in diffusion models depend on computationally expensive pretrained encoders, creating a need for more efficient alternatives.

Method: The authors introduce LSEP regularization that promotes linear separability of intermediate layer representations, incorporating linear probing directly into the learning dynamics without requiring auxiliary encoders.

Result: The method achieves substantial improvements in training efficiency and generation quality, with an FID of 1.46 on 256×256 ImageNet dataset using flow-based transformer architectures like SiTs.

Conclusion: LSEP provides an effective alternative to encoder-dependent alignment methods, demonstrating better efficiency and performance while integrating linear probing into the core training process.

Abstract: Efficient training strategies for large-scale diffusion models have recently
emphasized the importance of improving discriminative feature representations
in these models. A central line of work in this direction is representation
alignment with features obtained from powerful external encoders, which
improves the representation quality as assessed through linear probing.
Alignment-based approaches show promise but depend on large pretrained
encoders, which are computationally expensive to obtain. In this work, we
propose an alternative regularization for training, based on promoting the
Linear SEParability (LSEP) of intermediate layer representations. LSEP
eliminates the need for an auxiliary encoder and representation alignment,
while incorporating linear probing directly into the network's learning
dynamics rather than treating it as a simple post-hoc evaluation tool. Our
results demonstrate substantial improvements in both training efficiency and
generation quality on flow-based transformer architectures such as SiTs,
achieving an FID of 1.46 on $256 \times 256$ ImageNet dataset.

### [37] [Enhancing Contrastive Learning for Geolocalization by Discovering Hard Negatives on Semivariograms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21573)
*Boyi Chen,Zhangyu Wang,Fabian Deuser,Johann Maximilian Zollner,Martin Werner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a spatially regularized contrastive learning strategy that integrates semivariograms to address false negatives and hard negatives in image-based geo-localization by modeling spatial dependencies in geographic space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current contrastive learning methods for image-based geo-localization neglect spatial dependencies, leading to issues with false negatives (visually/geographically similar images labeled as negatives) and hard negatives (visually similar but geographically distant images).

Method: Integrates semivariograms - a geostatistical tool that models how spatial correlation changes with distance - into contrastive learning. Fits semivariogram by relating feature space distance to geographical distance, then uses expected visual dissimilarity at given spatial distances to identify hard negatives and false negatives.

Result: Evaluation on OSV5M dataset shows improved geo-localization performance, particularly at finer granularity, demonstrating that explicit spatial prior modeling enhances accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling spatial priors through semivariogram-based regularization significantly improves image-based geo-localization by better handling spatial dependencies and addressing key limitations of standard contrastive learning approaches.

Abstract: Accurate and robust image-based geo-localization at a global scale is
challenging due to diverse environments, visually ambiguous scenes, and the
lack of distinctive landmarks in many regions. While contrastive learning
methods show promising performance by aligning features between street-view
images and corresponding locations, they neglect the underlying spatial
dependency in the geographic space. As a result, they fail to address the issue
of false negatives -- image pairs that are both visually and geographically
similar but labeled as negatives, and struggle to effectively distinguish hard
negatives, which are visually similar but geographically distant. To address
this issue, we propose a novel spatially regularized contrastive learning
strategy that integrates a semivariogram, which is a geostatistical tool for
modeling how spatial correlation changes with distance. We fit the
semivariogram by relating the distance of images in feature space to their
geographical distance, capturing the expected visual content in a spatial
correlation. With the fitted semivariogram, we define the expected visual
dissimilarity at a given spatial distance as reference to identify hard
negatives and false negatives. We integrate this strategy into GeoCLIP and
evaluate it on the OSV5M dataset, demonstrating that explicitly modeling
spatial priors improves image-based geo-localization performance, particularly
at finer granularity.

Motivation: To create digital human agents capable of infinite interactions across text, speech, and video within a single unified architecture, enabling persistent and intelligent audiovisual interactions from static portraits.

Method: Thinker-Actor dual-transformer architecture with Thinker module for multimodal reasoning using pretrained large language-speech model, and Actor module using chunk-wise autoregressive diffusion model with cross-attention to Thinker's hidden states. Includes inter- and intra-chunk attentions with time-aligned multimodal positional embeddings, chunk-wise diffusion forcing, and global identity referencing.

Result: X-Streamer runs in real time on two A100 GPUs, sustaining hours-long consistent video chat experiences from arbitrary portraits.

Conclusion: The framework paves the way toward unified world modeling of interactive digital humans by enabling real-time, multimodal interactions from static portraits.

Abstract: We introduce X-Streamer, an end-to-end multimodal human world modeling
framework for building digital human agents capable of infinite interactions
across text, speech, and video within a single unified architecture. Starting
from a single portrait, X-Streamer enables real-time, open-ended video calls
driven by streaming multimodal inputs. At its core is a Thinker-Actor
dual-transformer architecture that unifies multimodal understanding and
generation, turning a static portrait into persistent and intelligent
audiovisual interactions. The Thinker module perceives and reasons over
streaming user inputs, while its hidden states are translated by the Actor into
synchronized multimodal streams in real time. Concretely, the Thinker leverages
a pretrained large language-speech model, while the Actor employs a chunk-wise
autoregressive diffusion model that cross-attends to the Thinker's hidden
states to produce time-aligned multimodal responses with interleaved discrete
text and audio tokens and continuous video latents. To ensure long-horizon
stability, we design inter- and intra-chunk attentions with time-aligned
multimodal positional embeddings for fine-grained cross-modality alignment and
context retention, further reinforced by chunk-wise diffusion forcing and
global identity referencing. X-Streamer runs in real time on two A100 GPUs,
sustaining hours-long consistent video chat experiences from arbitrary
portraits and paving the way toward unified world modeling of interactive
digital humans.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method for forecasting object motion from single images by generating dense trajectory grids instead of pixels, achieving better accuracy and diversity than prior approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generators struggle with motion forecasting from single images due to the overhead of pixel generation, even in simple physical scenarios. There's a need for direct motion modeling that captures scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty.

Method: Formulates motion forecasting as conditional generation of dense trajectory grids using an architecture similar to modern video generators, but outputs motion trajectories instead of pixels.

Result: The approach captures scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty, yielding more accurate and diverse predictions than prior regressors and generators. It shows effectiveness on robotics applications and promising accuracy on real-world intuitive physics datasets.

Conclusion: Direct motion trajectory modeling outperforms pixel-based video generation for motion forecasting tasks, as video generators struggle with this task due to the overhead of pixel generation rather than focusing on motion patterns.

Abstract: We consider the problem of forecasting motion from a single image, i.e.,
predicting how objects in the world are likely to move, without the ability to
observe other parameters such as the object velocities or the forces applied to
them. We formulate this task as conditional generation of dense trajectory
grids with a model that closely follows the architecture of modern video
generators but outputs motion trajectories instead of pixels. This approach
captures scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty, yielding more accurate and
diverse predictions than prior regressors and generators. We extensively
evaluate our method on simulated data, demonstrate its effectiveness on
downstream applications such as robotics, and show promising accuracy on
real-world intuitive physics datasets. Although recent state-of-the-art video
generators are often regarded as world models, we show that they struggle with
forecasting motion from a single image, even in simple physical scenarios such
as falling blocks or mechanical object interactions, despite fine-tuning on
such data. We show that this limitation arises from the overhead of generating
pixels rather than directly modeling motion.

*Sai Varun Kodathala,Rakesh Vunnam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Comparative analysis shows DINOv3 excels at pose recognition with superior clustering and discrimination, while V-JEPA2 provides more balanced and reliable performance across all action types due to its temporal modeling approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental trade-offs between spatial-only (DINOv3) and temporal-aware (V-JEPA2) self-supervised learning architectures for video action recognition.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation of both architectures on UCF Sports dataset using multiple metrics: classification accuracy, clustering performance (Silhouette score), intra-class consistency, and inter-class discrimination.

Result: DINOv3 achieved better clustering (0.31 vs 0.21 Silhouette) and discrimination (6.16x separation ratio) for pose-identifiable actions, while V-JEPA2 showed lower performance variance (0.094 vs 0.288) and consistent reliability across all action types.

Conclusion: Architecture choice depends on task requirements: DINOv3 for static pose recognition, V-JEPA2 for balanced performance across diverse actions with reliability constraints.

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of two prominent
self-supervised learning architectures for video action recognition: DINOv3,
which processes frames independently through spatial feature extraction, and
V-JEPA2, which employs joint temporal modeling across video sequences. We
evaluate both approaches on the UCF Sports dataset, examining feature quality
through multiple dimensions including classification accuracy, clustering
performance, intra-class consistency, and inter-class discrimination. Our
analysis reveals fundamental architectural trade-offs: DINOv3 achieves superior
clustering performance (Silhouette score: 0.31 vs 0.21) and demonstrates
exceptional discrimination capability (6.16x separation ratio) particularly for
pose-identifiable actions, while V-JEPA2 exhibits consistent reliability across
all action types with significantly lower performance variance (0.094 vs
0.288). Through action-specific evaluation, we identify that DINOv3's spatial
processing architecture excels at static pose recognition but shows degraded
performance on motion-dependent actions, whereas V-JEPA2's temporal modeling
provides balanced representation quality across diverse action categories.
These findings contribute to the understanding of architectural design choices
in video analysis systems and provide empirical guidance for selecting
appropriate feature extraction methods based on task requirements and
reliability constraints.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLCE is a multimodal system that generates detailed descriptions of disaster imagery using dual architectures (CNN-LSTM for satellite images and ViT for UAV images) with external semantic knowledge, outperforming baseline models in informativeness while maintaining semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional damage assessment methods after natural disasters are slow and dangerous. While satellite/UAV imagery provides broad coverage, current computer vision methods only produce classification labels or segmentation masks, limiting comprehensive situational understanding.

Method: Dual-architecture approach: CNN-LSTM with ResNet50 backbone pretrained on EuroSat for xBD dataset, and Vision Transformer (ViT) pretrained on UAV images for RescueNet dataset. Both utilize external semantic knowledge from ConceptNet and WordNet to expand vocabulary and improve accuracy.

Result: VLCE significantly outperforms baseline models (LLaVA and QwenVL), achieving up to 95.33% on InfoMetIC for caption informativeness while maintaining competitive semantic alignment measured by CLIPScore.

Conclusion: The dual-architecture system shows significant potential for improving disaster damage assessment by automating the production of actionable, information-dense descriptions from satellite and drone photos.

Abstract: Immediate damage assessment is essential after natural catastrophes; yet,
conventional hand evaluation techniques are sluggish and perilous. Although
satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photos offer extensive perspectives
of impacted regions, current computer vision methodologies generally yield just
classification labels or segmentation masks, so constraining their capacity to
deliver a thorough situational comprehension. We introduce the Vision Language
Caption Enhancer (VLCE), a multimodal system designed to produce comprehensive,
contextually-informed explanations of disaster imagery. VLCE employs a
dual-architecture approach: a CNN-LSTM model with a ResNet50 backbone
pretrained on EuroSat satellite imagery for the xBD dataset, and a Vision
Transformer (ViT) model pretrained on UAV pictures for the RescueNet dataset.
Both systems utilize external semantic knowledge from ConceptNet and WordNet to
expand vocabulary coverage and improve description accuracy. We assess VLCE in
comparison to leading vision-language models (LLaVA and QwenVL) utilizing
CLIPScore for semantic alignment and InfoMetIC for caption informativeness.
Experimental findings indicate that VLCE markedly surpasses baseline models,
attaining a maximum of 95.33% on InfoMetIC while preserving competitive
semantic alignment. Our dual-architecture system demonstrates significant
potential for improving disaster damage assessment by automating the production
of actionable, information-dense descriptions from satellite and drone photos.

*Jialin Wu,Shreya Saha,Yiqing Bo,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework using multiple representational similarity metrics and Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) reveals that vision model families have distinct geometric and tuning signatures while sharing linearly decodable information, with self-supervised models clustering together across architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop principled methods for understanding which aspects of vision model representations are shared across different architectural families and training paradigms, and which reflect distinctive computational strategies.

Method: Leveraged a suite of representational similarity metrics (capturing geometry, unit tuning, and linear decodability) and adapted Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) from multi-omics integration to combine these complementary facets for comprehensive analysis.

Result: Geometry and tuning metrics strongly discriminate model families, while linear decodability shows weaker separation. SNF achieved substantially sharper family separation than individual metrics, revealing that self-supervised models cluster together across architectural boundaries, and hybrid architectures group with masked autoencoders.

Conclusion: Vision model representations are shaped jointly by architecture and training objective, creating emergent computational strategies that define representational structure beyond surface design categories, with self-supervised training driving convergence across architectural families.

Abstract: Large vision models differ widely in architecture and training paradigm, yet
we lack principled methods to determine which aspects of their representations
are shared across families and which reflect distinctive computational
strategies. We leverage a suite of representational similarity metrics, each
capturing a different facet-geometry, unit tuning, or linear decodability-and
assess family separability using multiple complementary measures. Metrics
preserving geometry or tuning (e.g., RSA, Soft Matching) yield strong family
discrimination, whereas flexible mappings such as Linear Predictivity show
weaker separation. These findings indicate that geometry and tuning carry
family-specific signatures, while linearly decodable information is more
broadly shared. To integrate these complementary facets, we adapt Similarity
Network Fusion (SNF), a method inspired by multi-omics integration. SNF
achieves substantially sharper family separation than any individual metric and
produces robust composite signatures. Clustering of the fused similarity matrix
recovers both expected and surprising patterns: supervised ResNets and ViTs
form distinct clusters, yet all self-supervised models group together across
architectural boundaries. Hybrid architectures (ConvNeXt, Swin) cluster with
masked autoencoders, suggesting convergence between architectural modernization
and reconstruction-based training. This biology-inspired framework provides a
principled typology of vision models, showing that emergent computational
strategies-shaped jointly by architecture and training objective-define
representational structure beyond surface design categories.

*Yixiang Dai,Fan Jiang,Chiyu Wang,Mu Xu,Yonggang Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FantasyWorld is a geometry-enhanced framework that augments video foundation models with a trainable geometric branch to enable joint modeling of video latents and implicit 3D fields, improving spatial consistency and utility for 3D reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video foundation models lack explicit 3D grounding capabilities, limiting their spatial consistency and utility for downstream 3D reasoning tasks like AR/VR content creation and robotic navigation.

Method: Introduces a framework with cross-branch supervision where geometry cues guide video generation and video priors regularize 3D prediction, enabling joint modeling of video latents and implicit 3D fields in a single forward pass.

Result: Outperforms recent geometry-consistent baselines in multi-view coherence and style consistency, effectively bridging video imagination and 3D perception without requiring per-scene optimization or fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The unified backbone and cross-branch information exchange enable consistent and generalizable 3D-aware video representations that can serve as versatile representations for downstream 3D tasks.

Abstract: High-quality 3D world models are pivotal for embodied intelligence and
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), underpinning applications such as AR/VR
content creation and robotic navigation. Despite the established strong
imaginative priors, current video foundation models lack explicit 3D grounding
capabilities, thus being limited in both spatial consistency and their utility
for downstream 3D reasoning tasks. In this work, we present FantasyWorld, a
geometry-enhanced framework that augments frozen video foundation models with a
trainable geometric branch, enabling joint modeling of video latents and an
implicit 3D field in a single forward pass. Our approach introduces
cross-branch supervision, where geometry cues guide video generation and video
priors regularize 3D prediction, thus yielding consistent and generalizable
3D-aware video representations. Notably, the resulting latents from the
geometric branch can potentially serve as versatile representations for
downstream 3D tasks such as novel view synthesis and navigation, without
requiring per-scene optimization or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show
that FantasyWorld effectively bridges video imagination and 3D perception,
outperforming recent geometry-consistent baselines in multi-view coherence and
style consistency. Ablation studies further confirm that these gains stem from
the unified backbone and cross-branch information exchange.

TL;DR: MORPH is a shape-agnostic autoregressive foundation model for PDEs that handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal datasets of varying dimensions and fields, outperforming specialized models in generalization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a flexible foundation model that can handle the heterogeneous and multimodal nature of scientific observations across different PDE datasets with varying data dimensionality, resolutions, and mixed scalar/vector fields.

Method: Built on a convolutional vision transformer with component-wise convolution for joint scalar/vector processing, inter-field cross-attention for information propagation between fields, and axial attention for computational efficiency. Pretrained on diverse PDE datasets and evaluated with fine-tuning and LoRA adapters.

Result: MORPH outperforms models trained from scratch in both zero-shot and full-shot generalization, matching or surpassing strong baselines and state-of-the-art models across extensive evaluations.

Conclusion: MORPH presents a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from heterogeneous scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable and data-efficient scientific machine learning.

Abstract: We introduce MORPH, a shape-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for
partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision
transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal
datasets of varying data dimensionality (1D--3D) at different resolutions,
multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture
combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and
vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field
cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between
different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorizes full
spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to
reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple
model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and
evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both
full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters (LoRA), MORPH
outperforms models trained from scratch in both zero-shot and full-shot
generalization. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong
baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities
present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from heterogeneous and
multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable
and data-efficient scientific machine learning.

Conclusion: MS-YOLO effectively addresses the dual challenge of maintaining high detection quality while minimizing computational costs, making it suitable for real-time edge deployment in urban environments.

Abstract: Infrared imaging has emerged as a robust solution for urban object detection
under low-light and adverse weather conditions, offering significant advantages
over traditional visible-light cameras. However, challenges such as class
imbalance, thermal noise, and computational constraints can significantly
hinder model performance in practical settings. To address these issues, we
evaluate multiple YOLO variants on the FLIR ADAS V2 dataset, ultimately
selecting YOLOv8 as our baseline due to its balanced accuracy and efficiency.
Building on this foundation, we present \texttt{MS-YOLO} (\textbf{M}obileNetv4
and \textbf{S}lideLoss based on YOLO), which replaces YOLOv8's CSPDarknet
backbone with the more efficient MobileNetV4, reducing computational overhead
by \textbf{1.5%} while sustaining high accuracy. In addition, we introduce
\emph{SlideLoss}, a novel loss function that dynamically emphasizes
under-represented and occluded samples, boosting precision without sacrificing
recall. Experiments on the FLIR ADAS V2 benchmark show that \texttt{MS-YOLO}
attains competitive mAP and superior precision while operating at only
\textbf{6.7 GFLOPs}. These results demonstrate that \texttt{MS-YOLO}
effectively addresses the dual challenge of maintaining high detection quality

TL;DR: MATR introduces motion-aware transformer for multi-object tracking that explicitly predicts object movements to update track queries, reducing conflicts in DETR-based frameworks and achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DETR-based MOT frameworks process detection and tracking queries jointly in single Transformer layers, causing conflicts and degraded association accuracy due to complex object motions and crowded scenes.

Method: Motion-Aware Transformer (MATR) explicitly predicts object movements across frames to update track queries in advance, reducing query collisions and enabling more consistent training for both detection and association.

Result: MATR achieves significant improvements: 71.3 HOTA on DanceTrack (9+ points over MOTR), 72.2 HOTA on SportsMOT, and 54.7 mTETA/41.6 mHOTA on BDD100k without external datasets, setting new state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling motion within end-to-end Transformers provides a simple yet highly effective approach to advancing multi-object tracking, demonstrating substantial performance gains across multiple challenging benchmarks.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in videos remains challenging due to complex
object motions and crowded scenes. Recent DETR-based frameworks offer
end-to-end solutions but typically process detection and tracking queries
jointly within a single Transformer Decoder layer, leading to conflicts and
degraded association accuracy. We introduce the Motion-Aware Transformer
(MATR), which explicitly predicts object movements across frames to update
track queries in advance. By reducing query collisions, MATR enables more
consistent training and improves both detection and association. Extensive
experiments on DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BDD100k show that MATR delivers
significant gains across standard metrics. On DanceTrack, MATR improves HOTA by
more than 9 points over MOTR without additional data and reaches a new
state-of-the-art score of 71.3 with supplementary data. MATR also achieves
state-of-the-art results on SportsMOT (72.2 HOTA) and BDD100k (54.7 mTETA, 41.6
mHOTA) without relying on external datasets. These results demonstrate that
explicitly modeling motion within end-to-end Transformers offers a simple yet
highly effective approach to advancing multi-object tracking.

Conclusion: DynaNav effectively addresses computational efficiency and interpretability challenges in visual navigation, making it suitable for resource-tight deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Visual navigation is essential for robotics and embodied AI. However,
existing foundation models, particularly those with transformer decoders,
suffer from high computational overhead and lack interpretability, limiting
their deployment in resource-tight scenarios. To address this, we propose
DynaNav, a Dynamic Visual Navigation framework that adapts feature and layer
selection based on scene complexity. It employs a trainable hard feature

### [48] [DeLiVR: Differential Spatiotemporal Lie Bias for Efficient Video Deraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21719)
*Shuning Sun,Jialang Lu,Xiang Chen,Jichao Wang,Dianjie Lu,Guijuan Zhang,Guangwei Gao,Zhuoran Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeLiVR is an efficient video deraining method that uses Lie-group differential biases in attention scores to address rain streaks, blur, and noise while maintaining spatiotemporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video deraining methods rely on computationally expensive optical flow or heuristic alignment, which are less robust to camera pose changes that cause cross-frame mismatches and temporal artifacts.

Method: Proposes two components: 1) rotation-bounded Lie relative bias that predicts in-plane angles for geometry-consistent alignment, and 2) differential group displacement that computes angular differences between frames to estimate velocity, combining temporal decay and attention masks.

Result: Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate the method's effectiveness in video deraining.

Conclusion: Lie groups provide a principled approach for enforcing spatiotemporal consistency in video modeling, enabling efficient and robust video deraining through differential geometric transformations.

Abstract: Videos captured in the wild often suffer from rain streaks, blur, and noise.
In addition, even slight changes in camera pose can amplify cross-frame
mismatches and temporal artifacts. Existing methods rely on optical flow or
heuristic alignment, which are computationally expensive and less robust. To
address these challenges, Lie groups provide a principled way to represent
continuous geometric transformations, making them well-suited for enforcing
spatial and temporal consistency in video modeling. Building on this insight,
we propose DeLiVR, an efficient video deraining method that injects
spatiotemporal Lie-group differential biases directly into attention scores of
the network. Specifically, the method introduces two complementary components.
First, a rotation-bounded Lie relative bias predicts the in-plane angle of each
frame using a compact prediction module, where normalized coordinates are
rotated and compared with base coordinates to achieve geometry-consistent
alignment before feature aggregation. Second, a differential group displacement
computes angular differences between adjacent frames to estimate a velocity.
This bias computation combines temporal decay and attention masks to focus on
inter-frame relationships while precisely matching the direction of rain
streaks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on publicly available benchmarks.

### [50] [On the Status of Foundation Models for SAR Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21722)
*Nathan Inkawhich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates applying foundational AI/ML models to SAR object recognition, showing that self-supervised fine-tuning of existing SSL models with SAR data significantly outperforms current SAR-domain models and sets new state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to leverage the success of foundational AI models from natural image domains (like DINOv2, DINOv3, PE-Core) for SAR object recognition, as these models offer benefits including adaptation with limited labeled data, robustness to distribution shifts, and highly transferable features.

Method: The method involves testing existing visual foundational models on SAR data, then performing self-supervised fine-tuning of publicly available SSL models (creating AFRL-DINOv2 variants) with SAR data, and analyzing performance trade-offs across different backbones and downstream adaptation recipes.

Result: The results show that self-supervised fine-tuning with SAR data creates state-of-the-art SAR foundation models that significantly outperform the current best SAR-domain model SARATR-X, while also analyzing performance in challenging downstream environments like extended operating conditions and low labeled data scenarios.

Conclusion: While the work demonstrates the viability of foundational models for SAR object recognition and sets new benchmarks, the authors conclude that there is still significant progress needed in developing SAR foundation models, and hope this work inspires future research in this direction.

Abstract: In this work we investigate the viability of foundational AI/ML models for
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object recognition tasks. We are inspired by the
tremendous progress being made in the wider community, particularly in the
natural image domain where frontier labs are training huge models on web-scale
datasets with unprecedented computing budgets. It has become clear that these
models, often trained with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), will transform how
we develop AI/ML solutions for object recognition tasks - they can be adapted
downstream with very limited labeled data, they are more robust to many forms
of distribution shift, and their features are highly transferable
out-of-the-box. For these reasons and more, we are motivated to apply this
technology to the SAR domain. In our experiments we first run tests with
today's most powerful visual foundational models, including DINOv2, DINOv3 and
PE-Core and observe their shortcomings at extracting semantically-interesting
discriminative SAR target features when used off-the-shelf. We then show that
Self-Supervised finetuning of publicly available SSL models with SAR data is a
viable path forward by training several AFRL-DINOv2s and setting a new
state-of-the-art for SAR foundation models, significantly outperforming today's
best SAR-domain model SARATR-X. Our experiments further analyze the performance
trade-off of using different backbones with different downstream
task-adaptation recipes, and we monitor each model's ability to overcome
challenges within the downstream environments (e.g., extended operating
conditions and low amounts of labeled data). We hope this work will inform and
inspire future SAR foundation model builders, because despite our positive
results, we still have a long way to go.

TL;DR: UISim is an image-based UI simulator that predicts and synthesizes next UI states from screen images and user actions, enabling realistic UI transitions without physical devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for UI testing and AI agent training rely on physical devices or static screenshots, which limit scalability and dynamic interaction capabilities.

Method: Two-stage approach: first predicts abstract layout of next UI state from initial screen and user action, then synthesizes visually consistent image based on predicted layout.

Result: Outperforms end-to-end UI generation baselines in generating realistic and coherent subsequent UI states, demonstrating high fidelity.

Conclusion: UISim enables scalable UI testing, rapid prototyping, synthetic data generation, and paves the way for advanced AI agent training in UI navigation tasks.

Abstract: Developing and testing user interfaces (UIs) and training AI agents to
interact with them are challenging due to the dynamic and diverse nature of
real-world mobile environments. Existing methods often rely on cumbersome
physical devices or limited static analysis of screenshots, which hinders
scalable testing and the development of intelligent UI agents. We introduce
UISim, a novel image-based UI simulator that offers a dynamic and interactive
platform for exploring mobile phone environments purely from screen images. Our
system employs a two-stage method: given an initial phone screen image and a
user action, it first predicts the abstract layout of the next UI state, then
synthesizes a new, visually consistent image based on this predicted layout.
This approach enables the realistic simulation of UI transitions. UISim
provides immediate practical benefits for UI testing, rapid prototyping, and
synthetic data generation. Furthermore, its interactive capabilities pave the
way for advanced applications, such as UI navigation task planning for AI
agents. Our experimental results show that UISim outperforms end-to-end UI
generation baselines in generating realistic and coherent subsequent UI states,
highlighting its fidelity and potential to streamline UI development and
enhance AI agent training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for creating tabletop scenes rely on manual layout design or randomized layouts, which are limited in plausibility and task alignment. There's a substantial gap between high-level task instructions and tabletop scenes that needs to be bridged.

Method: Proposes Spatial Reasoning Chain that decomposes generation into object inference, spatial interrelation reasoning, and scene graph construction. Uses LLM-based framework enhanced with DPO algorithms to generate physically plausible tabletop scenes.

Result: Exhaustive experiments demonstrate superior performance compared to baselines in generating task-conforming tabletop scenes with realistic layouts. Created MesaTask-10K dataset with 10,700 synthetic tabletop scenes.

Conclusion: The MesaTask framework successfully bridges the gap between task instructions and tabletop scenes, generating physically plausible layouts that align well with given task descriptions.

Abstract: The ability of robots to interpret human instructions and execute
manipulation tasks necessitates the availability of task-relevant tabletop
scenes for training. However, traditional methods for creating these scenes
rely on time-consuming manual layout design or purely randomized layouts, which
are limited in terms of plausibility or alignment with the tasks. In this
paper, we formulate a novel task, namely task-oriented tabletop scene
generation, which poses significant challenges due to the substantial gap
between high-level task instructions and the tabletop scenes. To support
research on such a challenging task, we introduce MesaTask-10K, a large-scale
dataset comprising approximately 10,700 synthetic tabletop scenes with manually
crafted layouts that ensure realistic layouts and intricate inter-object
relations. To bridge the gap between tasks and scenes, we propose a Spatial
Reasoning Chain that decomposes the generation process into object inference,
spatial interrelation reasoning, and scene graph construction for the final 3D
layout. We present MesaTask, an LLM-based framework that utilizes this
reasoning chain and is further enhanced with DPO algorithms to generate
physically plausible tabletop scenes that align well with given task
descriptions. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of
MesaTask compared to baselines in generating task-conforming tabletop scenes
with realistic layouts. Project page is at https://mesatask.github.io/

Conclusion: LFA-Net provides an efficient and lightweight solution for retinal vessel segmentation suitable for resource-constrained clinical environments, with superior performance and minimal computational requirements.

Abstract: Lightweight retinal vessel segmentation is important for the early diagnosis

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel GER framework that integrates visual scene context and label-guided semantic information using multi-scale scene encoding and LLM-generated emotion lexicons refined through a structured emotion tree.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GER methods underestimate visual scene contextual information for modeling individual relationships and overlook semantic information from emotional labels for complete emotion understanding.

Method: Uses visual context encoding module with multi-scale scene information, emotion semantic encoding module with LLM-generated emotion lexicons refined via structured emotion tree, and similarity-aware interaction to align visual and semantic information.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on three widely adopted GER datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively improves GER performance by incorporating both visual scene context and label-guided semantic information through novel encoding and integration mechanisms.

Abstract: Group-level emotion recognition (GER) aims to identify holistic emotions
within a scene involving multiple individuals. Current existed methods
underestimate the importance of visual scene contextual information in modeling
individual relationships. Furthermore, they overlook the crucial role of
semantic information from emotional labels for complete understanding of
emotions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that
incorporates visual scene context and label-guided semantic information to
improve GER performance. It involves the visual context encoding module that
leverages multi-scale scene information to diversely encode individual
relationships. Complementarily, the emotion semantic encoding module utilizes
group-level emotion labels to prompt a large language model to generate nuanced
emotion lexicons. These lexicons, in conjunction with the emotion labels, are
then subsequently refined into comprehensive semantic representations through
the utilization of a structured emotion tree. Finally, similarity-aware
interaction is proposed to align and integrate visual and semantic information,
thereby generating enhanced group-level emotion representations and
subsequently improving the performance of GER. Experiments on three widely
adopted GER datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Shuang Zeng,Dekang Qi,Xinyuan Chang,Feng Xiong,Shichao Xie,Xiaolong Wu,Shiyi Liang,Mu Xu,Xing Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JanusVLN proposes a dual implicit neural memory framework for Vision-and-Language Navigation that models spatial-geometric and visual-semantic memory as compact neural representations, avoiding the limitations of explicit semantic memory methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLN methods relying on explicit semantic memory suffer from spatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat. The paper is inspired by human navigation's implicit scene representation, analogous to left brain semantic understanding and right brain spatial cognition.

Method: Extends MLLM with 3D prior knowledge from spatial-geometric encoder, constructs dual implicit memory using historical key-value caches from spatial-geometric and visual-semantic encoders, and uses sliding window approach with only initial and current KVs to enable efficient incremental updates.

Result: Outperforms over 20 recent methods to achieve SOTA performance, with success rate improvements of 10.5-35.5 compared to methods using multiple data types and 3.6-10.8 compared to methods using more RGB training data.

Conclusion: The dual implicit neural memory represents a novel paradigm that explores promising new directions for future VLN research by addressing key limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation requires an embodied agent to navigate through
unseen environments, guided by natural language instructions and a continuous
video stream. Recent advances in VLN have been driven by the powerful semantic
understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, these methods
typically rely on explicit semantic memory, such as building textual cognitive
maps or storing historical visual frames. This type of method suffers from
spatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat, which
impede efficient navigation. Inspired by the implicit scene representation in
human navigation, analogous to the left brain's semantic understanding and the
right brain's spatial cognition, we propose JanusVLN, a novel VLN framework
featuring a dual implicit neural memory that models spatial-geometric and
visual-semantic memory as separate, compact, and fixed-size neural
representations. This framework first extends the MLLM to incorporate 3D prior
knowledge from the spatial-geometric encoder, thereby enhancing the spatial
reasoning capabilities of models based solely on RGB input. Then, the
historical key-value caches from the spatial-geometric and visual-semantic
encoders are constructed into a dual implicit memory. By retaining only the KVs
of tokens in the initial and sliding window, redundant computation is avoided,
enabling efficient incremental updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
JanusVLN outperforms over 20 recent methods to achieve SOTA performance. For
example, the success rate improves by 10.5-35.5 compared to methods using
multiple data types as input and by 3.6-10.8 compared to methods using more RGB
training data. This indicates that the proposed dual implicit neural memory, as
a novel paradigm, explores promising new directions for future VLN research.

Conclusion: KG-SAM establishes itself as a robust and generalizable framework that significantly advances medical image segmentation by addressing key limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has achieved remarkable success in
image segmentation, its direct application to medical imaging remains hindered
by fundamental challenges, including ambiguous boundaries, insufficient
modeling of anatomical relationships, and the absence of uncertainty
quantification. To address these limitations, we introduce KG-SAM, a
knowledge-guided framework that synergistically integrates anatomical priors
with boundary refinement and uncertainty estimation. Specifically, KG-SAM
incorporates (i) a medical knowledge graph to encode fine-grained anatomical
relationships, (ii) an energy-based Conditional Random Field (CRF) to enforce
anatomically consistent predictions, and (iii) an uncertainty-aware fusion
module to enhance reliability in high-stakes clinical scenarios. Extensive
experiments across multi-center medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach: KG-SAM achieves an average Dice score of 82.69% on prostate
segmentation and delivers substantial gains in abdominal segmentation, reaching
78.05% on MRI and 79.68% on CT. These results establish KG-SAM as a robust and
generalizable framework for advancing medical image segmentation.

### [57] [UniVid: Unifying Vision Tasks with Pre-trained Video Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21760)
*Lan Chen,Yuchao Gu,Qi Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniVid is a framework that fine-tunes a pre-trained video diffusion transformer to handle diverse vision tasks without task-specific modifications, using visual sentences to represent tasks and enabling cross-modal inference and cross-source generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether pre-trained video generation models can adapt to diverse image and video tasks more scalably than current approaches that require costly task-specific pre-training across modalities and sources.

Method: Fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer to handle various vision tasks by representing tasks as visual sentences, where context sequences define both the task and expected output modality. Tasks can switch between understanding and generation by reversing visual sentence order.

Result: UniVid generalizes well to cross-modal inference (images and videos) and cross-source tasks (natural to annotated data) despite being trained only on natural video data, demonstrating the potential of video generation models as unified vision foundations.

Conclusion: Pre-trained video generation models can serve as scalable and unified foundations for vision modeling, enabling generalization across modalities and sources without multi-source pre-training.

Abstract: Large language models, trained on extensive corpora, successfully unify
diverse linguistic tasks within a single generative framework. Inspired by
this, recent works like Large Vision Model (LVM) extend this paradigm to vision
by organizing tasks into sequential visual sentences, where visual prompts
serve as the context to guide outputs. However, such modeling requires
task-specific pre-training across modalities and sources, which is costly and
limits scalability to unseen tasks. Given that pre-trained video generation
models inherently capture temporal sequence dependencies, we explore a more
unified and scalable alternative: can a pre-trained video generation model
adapt to diverse image and video tasks? To answer this, we propose UniVid, a
framework that fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer to handle various
vision tasks without task-specific modifications. Tasks are represented as
visual sentences, where the context sequence defines both the task and the
expected output modality. We evaluate the generalization of UniVid from two
perspectives: (1) cross-modal inference with contexts composed of both images
and videos, extending beyond LVM's uni-modal setting; (2) cross-source tasks
from natural to annotated data, without multi-source pre-training. Despite
being trained solely on natural video data, UniVid generalizes well in both
settings. Notably, understanding and generation tasks can easily switch by
simply reversing the visual sentence order in this paradigm. These findings
highlight the potential of pre-trained video generation models to serve as a
scalable and unified foundation for vision modeling. Our code will be released
at https://github.com/CUC-MIPG/UniVid.

*Wenyi Gong,Mieszko Lis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A token merging method that maintains spatial integrity for modern ViT backbones with spatial architectures like window attention and RoPE, achieving speedups with minimal performance drop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token reduction methods fail to preserve spatial structure required by modern ViT architectures with spatial designs like window attention and relative positional embeddings.

Method: 2D reduction strategy for structured token layouts, spatial-aware merging algorithm to maintain relative positions, and max-magnitude-per-dimension token representation to preserve salient features.

Result: 1.25x speedup on SAM-H with only 0.7% mIOU drop on COCO, and 1.15x speedup on DeiT-B with no accuracy drop on ImageNet after one epoch fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables effective token reduction while maintaining spatial compatibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various vision tasks and architectures.

Abstract: Many modern ViT backbones adopt spatial architectural designs, such as window
attention, decomposed relative positional embeddings in SAM, and RoPE in
DINOv3. Such architectures impose new challenges on token reduction, as the
vast majority of existing methods fail to preserve the spatial structure these
architectures depend on. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective
token merging method that maintains spatial integrity, enabling seamless
compatibility with spatial architectures. We reconcile two seemingly
conflicting requirements: (i)exploiting the uneven information distribution
across the spatial layout while (ii)preserving the spatial structure
post-merging. Our approach employs (i)a 2D reduction strategy to enforce
structured token layouts, (ii)a spatial-aware merging algorithm that maintains
relative token positions, and (iii)a novel max-magnitude-per-dimension token
representation that preserves salient features. Our method demonstrates strong
performance both off-the-shelf and with fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art
results on spatial and non-spatial architectures across various vision tasks.
Specifically, we achieve 1.25x speedup on SAM-H with only 0.7% mIOU drop
evaluated on COCO off-the-shelf, and 1.15x speedup on DeiT-B with no top-1
accuracy drop on ImageNet within just one epoch of fine-tuning.

TL;DR: GASP-ICL is a training-free framework that enhances multimodal deepfake detection by using in-context learning with LVLMs, featuring adaptive scoring and propagation mechanisms to select optimal demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs struggle with capturing subtle forgery cues, resolving cross-modal inconsistencies, and performing task-aligned retrieval in multimodal deepfake detection, limiting their effectiveness despite strong multimodal reasoning capabilities.

Method: Proposes GASP-ICL framework with: 1) MDD-adapted feature extractor for aligned image-text pair retrieval, 2) Graph-Structured Taylor Adaptive Scorer (GSTAS) to capture cross-sample relations and propagate query-aligned signals, 3) Pipeline to inject task-aware knowledge into LVLMs while preserving semantic relevance.

Result: Experiments on four forgery types show GASP-ICL surpasses strong baselines and delivers performance gains without requiring LVLM fine-tuning.

Conclusion: GASP-ICL effectively enhances LVLMs for robust multimodal deepfake detection through training-free in-context learning with adaptive scoring and propagation mechanisms.

Abstract: Multimodal deepfake detection (MDD) aims to uncover manipulations across
visual, textual, and auditory modalities, thereby reinforcing the reliability
of modern information systems. Although large vision-language models (LVLMs)
exhibit strong multimodal reasoning, their effectiveness in MDD is limited by
challenges in capturing subtle forgery cues, resolving cross-modal
inconsistencies, and performing task-aligned retrieval. To this end, we propose
Guided Adaptive Scorer and Propagation In-Context Learning (GASP-ICL), a
training-free framework for MDD. GASP-ICL employs a pipeline to preserve
semantic relevance while injecting task-aware knowledge into LVLMs. We leverage
an MDD-adapted feature extractor to retrieve aligned image-text pairs and build
a candidate set. We further design the Graph-Structured Taylor Adaptive Scorer
(GSTAS) to capture cross-sample relations and propagate query-aligned signals,
producing discriminative exemplars. This enables precise selection of
semantically aligned, task-relevant demonstrations, enhancing LVLMs for robust
MDD. Experiments on four forgery types show that GASP-ICL surpasses strong
baselines, delivering gains without LVLM fine-tuning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods extract unified features for all actions in a video, which struggles to model interactions between different objects in multi-action scenarios. The paper aims to address this by disentangling specified actions from complex scenes.

Method: ProDA uses Spatio-temporal Scene Graphs (SSGs) and introduces a Dynamic Prompt Module (DPM) to guide a Graph Parsing Neural Network (GPNN) in generating action-specific representations. The GPNN aggregates information using dynamic weights.

Result: Experiments in video action recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of ProDA when compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed ProDA framework successfully disentangles specified actions from multi-action scenes and shows improved performance in action recognition tasks compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Action recognition is a fundamental task in video understanding. Existing
methods typically extract unified features to process all actions in one video,
which makes it challenging to model the interactions between different objects
in multi-action scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we explore disentangling
any specified actions from complex scenes as an effective solution. In this
paper, we propose Prompt-guided Disentangled Representation for Action
Recognition (ProDA), a novel framework that disentangles any specified actions
from a multi-action scene. ProDA leverages Spatio-temporal Scene Graphs (SSGs)
and introduces Dynamic Prompt Module (DPM) to guide a Graph Parsing Neural
Network (GPNN) in generating action-specific representations. Furthermore, we
design a video-adapted GPNN that aggregates information using dynamic weights.

Abstract: The rise in harmful online content not only distorts public discourse but
also poses significant challenges to maintaining a healthy digital environment.
In response to this, we introduce a multimodal dataset uniquely crafted for
identifying hate in digital content. Central to our methodology is the
innovative application of watermarked, stability-enhanced, stable diffusion
techniques combined with the Digital Attention Analysis Module (DAAM). This
combination is instrumental in pinpointing the hateful elements within images,
thereby generating detailed hate attention maps, which are used to blur these
regions from the image, thereby removing the hateful sections of the image. We
release this data set as a part of the dehate shared task. This paper also
describes the details of the shared task. Furthermore, we present DeHater, a
vision-language model designed for multimodal dehatification tasks. Our
approach sets a new standard in AI-driven image hate detection given textual

Conclusion: MIRG-RL effectively addresses cross-image reasoning challenges through its unified framework and achieves superior performance in multi-image grounding tasks.

Abstract: Multi-image reasoning and grounding require understanding complex cross-image
relationships at both object levels and image levels. Current Large Visual
Language Models (LVLMs) face two critical challenges: the lack of cross-image
reasoning capabilities and insufficient cross-image reference reward modeling.
To address these issues, we propose a unified framework - Multi-Image Reasoning
and Grounding with Reinforcement Learning (MIRG-RL). Specifically, our
two-stage training paradigm combines supervised fine-tuning with annotated
trajectories and image-aware reinforcement learning optimization, progressively
developing multi-image reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we innovatively
propose a method for constructing the trajectory data, which integrates
object-level and image-level annotation information, and use this method to
generate a lightweight reasoning-enhanced dataset. To effectively resolve
cross-image ambiguities, we design an image-aware RL policy with dual reward
functions for objects and images. Experiments demonstrate that MIRG-RL achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multi-image grounding benchmarks,
attaining 64.82% on cross-image reasoning tasks - exceeding the previous best
method by 1%. The code and dataset have been released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongScape is a hybrid video generation framework that combines diffusion denoising with autoregressive generation using action-guided chunking and Context-aware Mixture-of-Experts to achieve stable long-horizon video generation for embodied manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation methods struggle with stable long-horizon generation - diffusion-based approaches suffer from temporal inconsistency and visual drift, while autoregressive methods compromise visual detail, limiting their effectiveness for generating high-quality embodied manipulation data.

Method: Hybrid framework combining intra-chunk diffusion denoising with inter-chunk autoregressive causal generation, featuring action-guided variable-length chunking that partitions video based on robotic action semantic context, and a Context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (CMoE) framework that adaptively activates specialized experts for each chunk.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate stable and consistent long-horizon generation over extended rollouts, achieving improved temporal consistency and visual quality compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: LongScape effectively addresses the limitations of current video generation methods by combining the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive approaches through intelligent chunking and expert specialization, enabling reliable long-horizon video generation for embodied manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Video-based world models hold significant potential for generating
high-quality embodied manipulation data. However, current video generation
methods struggle to achieve stable long-horizon generation: classical
diffusion-based approaches often suffer from temporal inconsistency and visual
drift over multiple rollouts, while autoregressive methods tend to compromise
on visual detail. To solve this, we introduce LongScape, a hybrid framework
that adaptively combines intra-chunk diffusion denoising with inter-chunk
autoregressive causal generation. Our core innovation is an action-guided,
variable-length chunking mechanism that partitions video based on the semantic
context of robotic actions. This ensures each chunk represents a complete,
coherent action, enabling the model to flexibly generate diverse dynamics. We
further introduce a Context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (CMoE) framework that
adaptively activates specialized experts for each chunk during generation,
guaranteeing high visual quality and seamless chunk transitions. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves stable and consistent
long-horizon generation over extended rollouts. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation world models suffer from visual redundancies that hinder action decoding, while latent world models overlook fine-grained details needed for precise manipulation. The paper aims to overcome these limitations by combining the strengths of both approaches.

Method: Proposes MoWM framework that uses motion-aware representations from a latent model as high-level prior to guide extraction of fine-grained visual features from pixel space model, enabling better highlighting of informative details for action decoding.

Result: Extensive evaluations on CALVIN benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art task success rates and superior generalization compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The fusion of hybrid world model representations enables effective embodied action planning, with comprehensive analysis providing insights for future research in this domain.

Abstract: Embodied action planning is a core challenge in robotics, requiring models to
generate precise actions from visual observations and language instructions.
While video generation world models are promising, their reliance on
pixel-level reconstruction often introduces visual redundancies that hinder
action decoding and generalization. Latent world models offer a compact,
motion-aware representation, but overlook the fine-grained details critical for
precise manipulation. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoWM, a
mixture-of-world-model framework that fuses representations from hybrid world
models for embodied action planning. Our approach uses motion-aware
representations from a latent model as a high-level prior, which guides the
extraction of fine-grained visual features from the pixel space model. This
design allows MoWM to highlight the informative visual details needed for
action decoding. Extensive evaluations on the CALVIN benchmark demonstrate that
our method achieves state-of-the-art task success rates and superior

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiTraj is a training-free framework for trajectory control in text-to-video generation using Diffusion Transformers (DiT), featuring foreground-background separation guidance and inter-frame Spatial-Temporal Decoupled 3D-RoPE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing trajectory control methods either require substantial training resources or are designed for U-Net, not taking advantage of DiT's superior performance in video generation.

Method: Uses LLM to separate foreground/background prompts, analyzes 3D attention correlation with position embedding, and proposes STD-RoPE to modify foreground tokens' position embedding for enhanced trajectory control.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method outperforms previous approaches in both video quality and trajectory controllability.

Conclusion: DiTraj provides an effective training-free solution for trajectory control in DiT-based video generation, achieving superior performance without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT)-based video generation models with 3D full
attention exhibit strong generative capabilities. Trajectory control represents
a user-friendly task in the field of controllable video generation. However,
existing methods either require substantial training resources or are
specifically designed for U-Net, do not take advantage of the superior
performance of DiT. To address these issues, we propose DiTraj, a simple but
effective training-free framework for trajectory control in text-to-video
generation, tailored for DiT. Specifically, first, to inject the object's
trajectory, we propose foreground-background separation guidance: we use the
Large Language Model (LLM) to convert user-provided prompts into foreground and
background prompts, which respectively guide the generation of foreground and
background regions in the video. Then, we analyze 3D full attention and explore
the tight correlation between inter-token attention scores and position
embedding. Based on this, we propose inter-frame Spatial-Temporal Decoupled
3D-RoPE (STD-RoPE). By modifying only foreground tokens' position embedding,
STD-RoPE eliminates their cross-frame spatial discrepancies, strengthening
cross-frame attention among them and thus enhancing trajectory control.
Additionally, we achieve 3D-aware trajectory control by regulating the density
of position embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms previous methods in both video quality and trajectory
controllability.

Result: Hybrid approach achieves 50% relative improvement in exact match and 47% in F1 score compared to cosine similarity, with improved entity recall and evidence complementarity.

Conclusion: Hybrid retrieval-augmented generation provides practical zero-shot solution for multi-hop QA, balancing accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability, though limitations remain in handling distractors and temporal reasoning.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have advanced the field of question answering, but
multi-hop reasoning, where answers require combining evidence across multiple
passages, remains difficult. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of
retrieval strategies for multi-hop question answering within a
retrieval-augmented generation framework. We compare cosine similarity, maximal
marginal relevance, and a hybrid method that integrates dense embeddings with
lexical overlap and re-ranking. To further improve retrieval, we adapt the
EfficientRAG pipeline for query optimization, introducing token labeling and
iterative refinement while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on the HotpotQA
dataset show that the hybrid approach substantially outperforms baseline
methods, achieving a relative improvement of 50 percent in exact match and 47
percent in F1 score compared to cosine similarity. Error analysis reveals that
hybrid retrieval improves entity recall and evidence complementarity, while
remaining limited in handling distractors and temporal reasoning. Overall, the
results suggest that hybrid retrieval-augmented generation provides a practical
zero-shot solution for multi-hop question answering, balancing accuracy,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HDR-4DGS enables high dynamic range novel view synthesis for dynamic scenes by jointly modeling temporal radiance variations and 3D translation between LDR and HDR domains using Gaussian Splatting with dynamic tone-mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HDR NVS methods focus only on static scenes, but real-world scenarios contain dynamic elements like moving objects and varying lighting, creating a more challenging problem that requires joint modeling of temporal radiance variations.

Method: HDR-4DGS uses Gaussian Splatting architecture with a dynamic tone-mapping module that explicitly connects HDR and LDR domains, maintaining temporal radiance coherence by adapting tone-mapping functions according to evolving radiance distributions across time.

Result: The method achieves temporal radiance consistency and spatially accurate color translation, enabling photorealistic HDR renderings from arbitrary viewpoints and time instances, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative performance and visual fidelity.

Conclusion: HDR-4DGS successfully addresses the challenging HDR Dynamic Novel View Synthesis problem by jointly modeling temporal dynamics and radiance variations, providing a comprehensive solution for realistic dynamic scene rendering.

Abstract: High Dynamic Range Novel View Synthesis (HDR NVS) seeks to learn an HDR 3D
model from Low Dynamic Range (LDR) training images captured under conventional
imaging conditions. Current methods primarily focus on static scenes,
implicitly assuming all scene elements remain stationary and non-living.
However, real-world scenarios frequently feature dynamic elements, such as
moving objects, varying lighting conditions, and other temporal events, thereby
presenting a significantly more challenging scenario. To address this gap, we
propose a more realistic problem named HDR Dynamic Novel View Synthesis (HDR
DNVS), where the additional dimension ``Dynamic'' emphasizes the necessity of
jointly modeling temporal radiance variations alongside sophisticated 3D
translation between LDR and HDR. To tackle this complex, intertwined challenge,
we introduce HDR-4DGS, a Gaussian Splatting-based architecture featured with an
innovative dynamic tone-mapping module that explicitly connects HDR and LDR
domains, maintaining temporal radiance coherence by dynamically adapting
tone-mapping functions according to the evolving radiance distributions across
the temporal dimension. As a result, HDR-4DGS achieves both temporal radiance
consistency and spatially accurate color translation, enabling photorealistic
HDR renderings from arbitrary viewpoints and time instances. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that HDR-4DGS surpasses existing state-of-the-art
methods in both quantitative performance and visual fidelity. Source code will

TL;DR: SRHand is a method that reconstructs detailed 3D hand geometry and textured images from low-resolution inputs by combining implicit image representation with explicit hand meshes, achieving superior results compared to existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods for hand reconstruction rely on high-resolution multi-view images and fail on low-resolution inputs. Existing super-resolution methods work only for static scenes, not articulated hands.

Method: Proposes SRHand with a geometric-aware implicit image function (GIIF) that learns hand priors by upsampling coarse images. Jointly optimizes implicit image function and explicit 3D hand shapes to maintain multi-view and pose consistency.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art image upsampling and 3D hand reconstruction methods on InterHand2.6M and Goliath datasets, achieving fine-detailed reconstruction including wrinkles and nails.

Conclusion: SRHand successfully reconstructs detailed 3D hand geometry from low-resolution images by leveraging implicit-explicit representation fusion, overcoming limitations of previous methods.

Abstract: Reconstructing detailed hand avatars plays a crucial role in various
applications. While prior works have focused on capturing high-fidelity hand
geometry, they heavily rely on high-resolution multi-view image inputs and
struggle to generalize on low-resolution images. Multi-view image
super-resolution methods have been proposed to enforce 3D view consistency.
These methods, however, are limited to static objects/scenes with fixed
resolutions and are not applicable to articulated deformable hands. In this
paper, we propose SRHand (Super-Resolution Hand), the method for reconstructing
detailed 3D geometry as well as textured images of hands from low-resolution
images. SRHand leverages the advantages of implicit image representation with
explicit hand meshes. Specifically, we introduce a geometric-aware implicit
image function (GIIF) that learns detailed hand prior by upsampling the coarse
input images. By jointly optimizing the implicit image function and explicit 3D
hand shapes, our method preserves multi-view and pose consistency among
upsampled hand images, and achieves fine-detailed 3D reconstruction (wrinkles,
nails). In experiments using the InterHand2.6M and Goliath datasets, our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art image upsampling methods adapted to
hand datasets, and 3D hand reconstruction methods, quantitatively and
qualitatively. Project page: https://yunminjin2.github.io/projects/srhand

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper argues that current fake image detection research focuses too much on generative models while neglecting proper definition and data collection of "real" images, questioning whether fake detection is even a sound objective given modern smartphone photography's use of neural networks similar to fake generators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings in current fake image detection research, which relies on outdated low-resolution datasets of "real" images while modern photography uses neural network-based algorithms similar to fake image generators.

Method: Position paper that analyzes current practices in fake detection research, highlighting the reliance on old datasets like ImageNet and the evolution of smartphone photography technology that uses neural networks to compute images from multiple inputs.

Result: The analysis reveals that current fake detection methods are built on outdated concepts of "real" images, as modern photography itself uses algorithms closely related to fake image generators, blurring the line between real and fake.

Conclusion: The research community needs to re-think the concept of "real" images, develop clear technical definitions, create new benchmark datasets, and question whether fake image detection is a sound objective given the technological evolution of image acquisition.

Abstract: The wide availability and low usability barrier of modern image generation
models has triggered the reasonable fear of criminal misconduct and negative
social implications. The machine learning community has been engaging this
problem with an extensive series of publications proposing algorithmic
solutions for the detection of "fake", e.g. entirely generated or partially
manipulated images. While there is undoubtedly some progress towards technical
solutions of the problem, we argue that current and prior work is focusing too
much on generative algorithms and "fake" data-samples, neglecting a clear
definition and data collection of "real" images. The fundamental question "what
is a real image?" might appear to be quite philosophical, but our analysis
shows that the development and evaluation of basically all current
"fake"-detection methods is relying on only a few, quite old low-resolution
datasets of "real" images like ImageNet. However, the technology for the
acquisition of "real" images, aka taking photos, has drastically evolved over
the last decade: Today, over 90% of all photographs are produced by smartphones
which typically use algorithms to compute an image from multiple inputs (over
time) from multiple sensors. Based on the fact that these image formation
algorithms are typically neural network architectures which are closely related
to "fake"-image generators, we state the position that today, we need to
re-think the concept of "real" images. The purpose of this position paper is to
raise the awareness of the current shortcomings in this active field of
research and to trigger an open discussion whether the detection of "fake"
images is a sound objective at all. At the very least, we need a clear
technical definition of "real" images and new benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: Aes-R1 is a comprehensive aesthetic reasoning framework that uses reinforcement learning to improve multimodal large language models' ability to generate accurate aesthetic judgments with interpretable rationales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs are well-suited for image aesthetic assessment but struggle due to scarcity of multimodal aesthetic reasoning data and the subjective nature of aesthetic judgment.

Method: Proposes Aes-R1 framework with AesCoT pipeline for constructing high-quality chain-of-thought data, and RAPO RL algorithm that jointly optimizes absolute score regression and relative ranking order.

Result: Improves backbone's average PLCC/SRCC by 47.9%/34.8%, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines of similar size, with robust generalization in limited supervision and out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: Aes-R1 enables MLLMs to generate grounded explanations alongside faithful scores, enhancing aesthetic scoring and reasoning in a unified framework.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are well suited to image aesthetic
assessment, as they can capture high-level aesthetic features leveraging their
cross-modal understanding capacity. However, the scarcity of multimodal
aesthetic reasoning data and the inherently subjective nature of aesthetic
judgment make it difficult for MLLMs to generate accurate aesthetic judgments
with interpretable rationales. To this end, we propose Aes-R1, a comprehensive
aesthetic reasoning framework with reinforcement learning (RL). Concretely,
Aes-R1 integrates a pipeline, AesCoT, to construct and filter high-quality
chain-of-thought aesthetic reasoning data used for cold-start. After teaching
the model to generate structured explanations prior to scoring, we then employ
the Relative-Absolute Policy Optimization (RAPO), a novel RL algorithm that
jointly optimizes absolute score regression and relative ranking order,
improving both per-image accuracy and cross-image preference judgments. Aes-R1
enables MLLMs to generate grounded explanations alongside faithful scores,
thereby enhancing aesthetic scoring and reasoning in a unified framework.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Aes-R1 improves the backbone's average
PLCC/SRCC by 47.9%/34.8%, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines of similar
size. More ablation studies validate Aes-R1's robust generalization under
limited supervision and in out-of-distribution scenarios.

*Liyang Chen,Tianze Zhou,Xu He,Boshi Tang,Zhiyong Wu,Yang Huang,Yang Wu,Zhongqian Sun,Wei Yang,Helen Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StableDub is a visual dubbing framework that improves lip synchronization and handles occlusions better than previous methods by combining lip-habit modeling with occlusion-robust synthesis using Stable Diffusion and a hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual dubbing methods have two main problems: audio-only driving fails to capture speaker-specific lip habits, and conventional inpainting methods produce artifacts when handling occlusions like microphones or hands, limiting practical deployment.

Method: Built on Stable Diffusion, the framework uses a lip-habit-modulated mechanism to jointly model phonemic audio-visual synchronization and speaker-specific orofacial dynamics. It employs occlusion-aware training by explicitly exposing occlusion objects during inpainting, and uses a hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture for better training efficiency.

Result: StableDub achieves superior performance in lip habit resemblance, occlusion robustness, audio-lip sync, video quality, and resolution consistency compared to other methods, while requiring less computational resources.

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses key limitations in visual dubbing by integrating lip-habit modeling with occlusion-robust synthesis, making it more practical for real-world applications with improved efficiency and performance.

Abstract: The visual dubbing task aims to generate mouth movements synchronized with
the driving audio, which has seen significant progress in recent years.
However, two critical deficiencies hinder their wide application: (1)
Audio-only driving paradigms inadequately capture speaker-specific lip habits,
which fail to generate lip movements similar to the target avatar; (2)
Conventional blind-inpainting approaches frequently produce visual artifacts
when handling obstructions (e.g., microphones, hands), limiting practical
deployment. In this paper, we propose StableDub, a novel and concise framework
integrating lip-habit-aware modeling with occlusion-robust synthesis.
Specifically, building upon the Stable-Diffusion backbone, we develop a
lip-habit-modulated mechanism that jointly models phonemic audio-visual
synchronization and speaker-specific orofacial dynamics. To achieve plausible
lip geometries and object appearances under occlusion, we introduce the
occlusion-aware training strategy by explicitly exposing the occlusion objects
to the inpainting process. By incorporating the proposed designs, the model
eliminates the necessity for cost-intensive priors in previous methods, thereby
exhibiting superior training efficiency on the computationally intensive
diffusion-based backbone. To further optimize training efficiency from the
perspective of model architecture, we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer
architecture, which demonstrates the enhanced applicability in low-resource
research scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that StableDub
achieves superior performance in lip habit resemblance and occlusion
robustness. Our method also surpasses other methods in audio-lip sync, video
quality, and resolution consistency. We expand the applicability of visual
dubbing methods from comprehensive aspects, and demo videos can be found at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Drag4D is an interactive framework that enables users to define 3D trajectories for objects generated from a single image and integrate them into high-quality 3D backgrounds through a three-stage pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an integrated system that allows interactive control of object motion within text-driven 3D scene generation, addressing the need for precise spatial and temporal alignment of animated objects in 3D environments.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) Enhanced text-to-3D background generation using 2D Gaussian Splatting with panoramic images; 2) 3D copy-and-paste approach with physics-aware object position learning; 3) Temporal animation using part-augmented, motion-conditioned video diffusion model with multiview image pairs.

Result: The framework successfully achieves harmonized alignment of user-controlled object motion within high-quality 3D backgrounds, demonstrating effectiveness through evaluations at each stage and in final results.

Conclusion: Drag4D provides a unified architecture for integrating object motion control in 3D scene generation, effectively mitigating motion hallucination and ensuring view-consistent temporal alignment through its innovative pipeline.

Abstract: We introduce Drag4D, an interactive framework that integrates object motion
control within text-driven 3D scene generation. This framework enables users to
define 3D trajectories for the 3D objects generated from a single image,
seamlessly integrating them into a high-quality 3D background. Our Drag4D
pipeline consists of three stages. First, we enhance text-to-3D background
generation by applying 2D Gaussian Splatting with panoramic images and
inpainted novel views, resulting in dense and visually complete 3D
reconstructions. In the second stage, given a reference image of the target
object, we introduce a 3D copy-and-paste approach: the target instance is
extracted in a full 3D mesh using an off-the-shelf image-to-3D model and
seamlessly composited into the generated 3D scene. The object mesh is then
positioned within the 3D scene via our physics-aware object position learning,
ensuring precise spatial alignment. Lastly, the spatially aligned object is
temporally animated along a user-defined 3D trajectory. To mitigate motion
hallucination and ensure view-consistent temporal alignment, we develop a
part-augmented, motion-conditioned video diffusion model that processes
multiview image pairs together with their projected 2D trajectories. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our unified architecture through evaluations
at each stage and in the final results, showcasing the harmonized alignment of
user-controlled object motion within a high-quality 3D background.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Syncphony is an audio-to-video generation model that creates 380x640 resolution, 24fps videos synchronized with audio inputs using motion-aware loss and audio sync guidance to improve temporal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-video and image-to-video models lack precise timing control, while audio provides natural temporal cues for video motion synchronization. Current audio-to-video models struggle with fine-grained synchronization due to indirect conditioning or limited temporal modeling.

Method: Builds on pre-trained video backbone with two key components: (1) Motion-aware Loss that emphasizes learning at high-motion regions, and (2) Audio Sync Guidance that uses a visually aligned off-sync model without audio layers to guide the full model at inference while maintaining visual quality.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on AVSync15 and The Greatest Hits datasets in both synchronization accuracy and visual quality. Introduces CycleSync metric for evaluating synchronization by measuring motion cues in generated videos to reconstruct original audio.

Conclusion: Syncphony successfully addresses the challenge of fine-grained audio-video synchronization through motion-aware training and audio-guided inference, demonstrating superior performance in temporal alignment while maintaining high visual quality.

Abstract: Text-to-video and image-to-video generation have made rapid progress in
visual quality, but they remain limited in controlling the precise timing of
motion. In contrast, audio provides temporal cues aligned with video motion,
making it a promising condition for temporally controlled video generation.
However, existing audio-to-video (A2V) models struggle with fine-grained
synchronization due to indirect conditioning mechanisms or limited temporal
modeling capacity. We present Syncphony, which generates 380x640 resolution,
24fps videos synchronized with diverse audio inputs. Our approach builds upon a
pre-trained video backbone and incorporates two key components to improve
synchronization: (1) Motion-aware Loss, which emphasizes learning at
high-motion regions; (2) Audio Sync Guidance, which guides the full model using
a visually aligned off-sync model without audio layers to better exploit audio
cues at inference while maintaining visual quality. To evaluate
synchronization, we propose CycleSync, a video-to-audio-based metric that
measures the amount of motion cues in the generated video to reconstruct the
original audio. Experiments on AVSync15 and The Greatest Hits datasets
demonstrate that Syncphony outperforms existing methods in both synchronization
accuracy and visual quality. Project page is available at:

*Yixiao Liu,Yizhou Yang,Jinwen Li,Jun Tao,Ruoyu Li,Xiangkun Wang,Min Zhu,Junlong Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed LG-CD model uses language prompts to guide change detection in remote sensing images, leveraging multimodal data (vision + text) to improve accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most deep learning methods focus only on visual information and neglect rich semantic information from multimodal data like text, limiting change detection performance.

Method: Uses SAM2 visual foundation model for feature extraction, multi-layer adapters for fine-tuning, Text Fusion Attention Module for vision-text alignment, and Vision-Semantic Fusion Decoder with cross-attention for final mask generation.

Result: LG-CD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three datasets (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, SYSU-CD), demonstrating superior change detection accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach provides new insights for generalized change detection by effectively leveraging multimodal information, showing language guidance significantly enhances change detection performance.

Abstract: Remote Sensing Change Detection (RSCD) typically identifies changes in land
cover or surface conditions by analyzing multi-temporal images. Currently, most
deep learning-based methods primarily focus on learning unimodal visual
information, while neglecting the rich semantic information provided by
multimodal data such as text. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
Language-Guided Change Detection model (LG-CD). This model leverages natural
language prompts to direct the network's attention to regions of interest,
significantly improving the accuracy and robustness of change detection.
Specifically, LG-CD utilizes a visual foundational model (SAM2) as a feature
extractor to capture multi-scale pyramid features from high-resolution to
low-resolution across bi-temporal remote sensing images. Subsequently,
multi-layer adapters are employed to fine-tune the model for downstream tasks,
ensuring its effectiveness in remote sensing change detection. Additionally, we
design a Text Fusion Attention Module (TFAM) to align visual and textual
information, enabling the model to focus on target change regions using text
prompts. Finally, a Vision-Semantic Fusion Decoder (V-SFD) is implemented,
which deeply integrates visual and semantic information through a
cross-attention mechanism to produce highly accurate change detection masks.
Our experiments on three datasets (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and SYSU-CD) demonstrate
that LG-CD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art change detection methods.
Furthermore, our approach provides new insights into achieving generalized
change detection by leveraging multimodal information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-driven methods lack precise spatial control while drag-driven approaches miss fine-grained texture guidance. The paper aims to address these complementary limitations by integrating both paradigms.

Method: Proposes two key innovations: Point-Cloud Deterministic Drag for enhanced latent-space layout control via 3D feature mapping, and Drag-Text Guided Denoising that dynamically balances drag and text conditions during denoising. Supports flexible editing modes (text-only, drag-only, or combined).

Result: Extensive experiments show the method achieves high-fidelity joint editing and matches or surpasses specialized text-only or drag-only approaches, establishing a versatile solution for controllable image manipulation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully integrates text and drag interactions, providing a generalizable solution that overcomes the limitations of individual approaches while maintaining strong performance across all editing modes.

Abstract: This paper explores image editing under the joint control of text and drag
interactions. While recent advances in text-driven and drag-driven editing have
achieved remarkable progress, they suffer from complementary limitations:
text-driven methods excel in texture manipulation but lack precise spatial
control, whereas drag-driven approaches primarily modify shape and structure
without fine-grained texture guidance. To address these limitations, we propose
a unified diffusion-based framework for joint drag-text image editing,
integrating the strengths of both paradigms. Our framework introduces two key
innovations: (1) Point-Cloud Deterministic Drag, which enhances latent-space
layout control through 3D feature mapping, and (2) Drag-Text Guided Denoising,
dynamically balancing the influence of drag and text conditions during
denoising. Notably, our model supports flexible editing modes - operating with
text-only, drag-only, or combined conditions - while maintaining strong
performance in each setting. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that our method not only achieves high-fidelity joint editing but
also matches or surpasses the performance of specialized text-only or drag-only
approaches, establishing a versatile and generalizable solution for
controllable image manipulation. Code will be made publicly available to
reproduce all results presented in this work.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vehicle detection from UAV images in Nordic regions faces visibility challenges and domain shifts from snow coverage. While annotated data is expensive, unannotated data is cheaper to obtain, creating an opportunity to leverage unlabeled data for performance improvement.

Method: Train a CNN-based representation extractor through contrastive learning on unannotated data in pretraining, then sideload it to a frozen YOLO11n backbone during fine-tuning. Extensive experiments compared various fusion methods and granularity.

Result: The proposed sideload-CL-adaptation model improves detection performance by 3.8% to 9.5% in terms of mAP50 on the NVD dataset.

Conclusion: The framework successfully leverages unannotated data to enhance vehicle detection performance in challenging Nordic conditions, demonstrating the effectiveness of contrastive learning and representation transfer for domain adaptation.

Abstract: Aside from common challenges in remote sensing like small, sparse targets and
computation cost limitations, detecting vehicles from UAV images in the Nordic
regions faces strong visibility challenges and domain shifts caused by diverse
levels of snow coverage. Although annotated data are expensive, unannotated
data is cheaper to obtain by simply flying the drones. In this work, we
proposed a sideload-CL-adaptation framework that enables the use of unannotated
data to improve vehicle detection using lightweight models. Specifically, we
propose to train a CNN-based representation extractor through contrastive
learning on the unannotated data in the pretraining stage, and then sideload it
to a frozen YOLO11n backbone in the fine-tuning stage. To find a robust
sideload-CL-adaptation, we conducted extensive experiments to compare various
fusion methods and granularity. Our proposed sideload-CL-adaptation model
improves the detection performance by 3.8% to 9.5% in terms of mAP50 on the NVD

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video editing methods require inversion with model-specific design or extensive optimization, limiting their ability to leverage up-to-date image-to-video models for transferring image editing capabilities to video domain.

Method: Uses Vector Field Rectification with Sample Deviation to incorporate source video information into denoising process, Structure-and-Motion-Preserving Initialization for motion-aware noise generation, and Deviation Caching to minimize computational costs.

Result: Achieves superior editing quality and consistency over existing approaches with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: IF-V2V provides a lightweight plug-and-play solution for video editing that effectively transfers image editing capabilities to video domain without inversion requirements.

Abstract: Although image editing techniques have advanced significantly, video editing,
which aims to manipulate videos according to user intent, remains an emerging
challenge. Most existing image-conditioned video editing methods either require
inversion with model-specific design or need extensive optimization, limiting
their capability of leveraging up-to-date image-to-video (I2V) models to
transfer the editing capability of image editing models to the video domain. To
this end, we propose IF-V2V, an Inversion-Free method that can adapt
off-the-shelf flow-matching-based I2V models for video editing without
significant computational overhead. To circumvent inversion, we devise Vector
Field Rectification with Sample Deviation to incorporate information from the
source video into the denoising process by introducing a deviation term into
the denoising vector field. To further ensure consistency with the source video
in a model-agnostic way, we introduce Structure-and-Motion-Preserving
Initialization to generate motion-aware temporally correlated noise with
structural information embedded. We also present a Deviation Caching mechanism
to minimize the additional computational cost for denoising vector
rectification without significantly impacting editing quality. Evaluations
demonstrate that our method achieves superior editing quality and consistency
over existing approaches, offering a lightweight plug-and-play solution to
realize visual creativity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most multi-view counting methods rely on fully supervised learning which requires large amounts of annotated data, creating a significant data dependency problem that limits practical applications.

Method: The framework learns an implicit scene representation using neural volumetric rendering, enabling reconstruction of continuous geometry shape and view-dependent appearance through differential neural rendering.

Result: SSLCounter achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple MVC benchmarks and delivers competitive results using only 70% of training data, demonstrating superior data efficiency.

Conclusion: The self-supervised learning approach with neural volumetric rendering effectively reduces reliance on large annotated datasets while maintaining high performance, making it a promising solution for data-efficient multi-view counting.

Abstract: Multi-view counting (MVC) methods have attracted significant research
attention and stimulated remarkable progress in recent years. Despite their
success, most MVC methods have focused on improving performance by following
the fully supervised learning (FSL) paradigm, which often requires large
amounts of annotated data. In this work, we propose SSLCounter, a novel
self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for MVC that leverages neural
volumetric rendering to alleviate the reliance on large-scale annotated
datasets. SSLCounter learns an implicit representation w.r.t. the scene,
enabling the reconstruction of continuous geometry shape and the complex,
view-dependent appearance of their 2D projections via differential neural
rendering. Owing to its inherent flexibility, the key idea of our method can be
seamlessly integrated into exsiting frameworks. Notably, extensive experiments
demonstrate that SSLCounter not only demonstrates state-of-the-art performances
but also delivers competitive performance with only using 70% proportion of
training data, showcasing its superior data efficiency across multiple MVC
benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper presents a systematic benchmark for evaluating object-centric spatial reasoning in vision foundation models, revealing a trade-off between precise localization in detectors and relational reasoning in VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision foundation models focus on localization accuracy but lack true spatial understanding of how objects are arranged and related within scenes, which is crucial for effective scene understanding.

Method: Used a controlled synthetic dataset to evaluate state-of-the-art vision models and VLMs across three tasks: spatial localization, spatial reasoning, and downstream retrieval tasks.

Result: Found a stable trade-off: detectors (GroundingDINO, OWLv2) provide precise bounding boxes but limited relational reasoning, while VLMs (SmolVLM, GPT-4o) offer coarse layout cues and fluent captions but struggle with fine-grained spatial context.

Conclusion: There is a significant gap between localization and true spatial understanding, highlighting the need for developing spatially-aware foundation models in the computer vision community.

Abstract: Spatial understanding is a critical capability for vision foundation models.
While recent advances in large vision models or vision-language models (VLMs)
have expanded recognition capabilities, most benchmarks emphasize localization
accuracy rather than whether models capture how objects are arranged and
related within a scene. This gap is consequential; effective scene
understanding requires not only identifying objects, but reasoning about their
relative positions, groupings, and depth. In this paper, we present a
systematic benchmark for object-centric spatial reasoning in foundation models.
Using a controlled synthetic dataset, we evaluate state-of-the-art vision
models (e.g., GroundingDINO, Florence-2, OWLv2) and large VLMs (e.g., InternVL,
LLaVA, GPT-4o) across three tasks: spatial localization, spatial reasoning, and
downstream retrieval tasks. We find a stable trade-off: detectors such as
GroundingDINO and OWLv2 deliver precise boxes with limited relational
reasoning, while VLMs like SmolVLM and GPT-4o provide coarse layout cues and
fluent captions but struggle with fine-grained spatial context. Our study
highlights the gap between localization and true spatial understanding, and
pointing toward the need for spatially-aware foundation models in the
community.

TL;DR: PANICL is a training-free framework that improves visual in-context learning by using multiple in-context pairs instead of relying on a single pair, reducing bias and improving stability across various vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) suffers from over-reliance on single in-context pairs, leading to biased and unstable predictions.

Method: PAtch-based k-Nearest neighbor visual In-Context Learning (PANICL) leverages multiple in-context pairs to smooth assignment scores across pairs without requiring additional training.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent improvements across tasks including foreground segmentation, object detection, colorization, multi-object segmentation, and keypoint detection. PANICL also demonstrates strong robustness to domain shifts and generalizes well to other VICL models.

Conclusion: PANICL is a versatile and broadly applicable training-free framework that effectively mitigates bias and instability in visual in-context learning.

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) uses input-output image pairs, referred to
as in-context pairs (or examples), as prompts alongside query images to guide
models in performing diverse vision tasks. However, VICL often suffers from
over-reliance on a single in-context pair, which can lead to biased and
unstable predictions. We introduce PAtch-based $k$-Nearest neighbor visual
In-Context Learning (PANICL), a general training-free framework that mitigates
this issue by leveraging multiple in-context pairs. PANICL smooths assignment
scores across pairs, reducing bias without requiring additional training.
Extensive experiments on a variety of tasks, including foreground segmentation,
single object detection, colorization, multi-object segmentation, and keypoint
detection, demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Moreover,
PANICL exhibits strong robustness to domain shifts, including dataset-level
shift (e.g., from COCO to Pascal) and label-space shift (e.g., FSS-1000), and
generalizes well to other VICL models such as SegGPT, Painter, and LVM,
highlighting its versatility and broad applicability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SingRef6D is a lightweight 6D pose estimation pipeline that uses only a single RGB reference image, eliminating the need for depth sensors or multi-view setups. It improves depth prediction accuracy by 14.41% and achieves 6.1% better average recall than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 6D pose estimation methods have practical limitations: depth-based methods fail with transparent/reflective surfaces, while RGB-based methods struggle in low-light/texture-less scenes due to lack of geometry information.

Method: Two key innovations: 1) Token-scaler-based fine-tuning mechanism with novel optimization loss on Depth-Anything v2 for better depth prediction, 2) Depth-aware matching process that integrates spatial relationships within LoFTR for challenging materials and lighting conditions.

Result: 14.41% improvement in depth prediction on REAL275 compared to Depth-Anything v2, and 6.1% improvement in average recall for pose estimation on REAL275, ClearPose, and Toyota-Light datasets.

Conclusion: SingRef6D provides a robust and capable 6D pose estimation solution that works effectively even in resource-limited settings without requiring depth sensors or dense templates.

Abstract: Recent 6D pose estimation methods demonstrate notable performance but still
face some practical limitations. For instance, many of them rely heavily on
sensor depth, which may fail with challenging surface conditions, such as
transparent or highly reflective materials. In the meantime, RGB-based
solutions provide less robust matching performance in low-light and
texture-less scenes due to the lack of geometry information. Motivated by
these, we propose SingRef6D, a lightweight pipeline requiring only a single RGB
image as a reference, eliminating the need for costly depth sensors, multi-view
image acquisition, or training view synthesis models and neural fields. This
enables SingRef6D to remain robust and capable even under resource-limited
settings where depth or dense templates are unavailable. Our framework
incorporates two key innovations. First, we propose a token-scaler-based
fine-tuning mechanism with a novel optimization loss on top of Depth-Anything
v2 to enhance its ability to predict accurate depth, even for challenging
surfaces. Our results show a 14.41% improvement (in $\delta_{1.05}$) on REAL275
depth prediction compared to Depth-Anything v2 (with fine-tuned head). Second,
benefiting from depth availability, we introduce a depth-aware matching process
that effectively integrates spatial relationships within LoFTR, enabling our
system to handle matching for challenging materials and lighting conditions.
Evaluations of pose estimation on the REAL275, ClearPose, and Toyota-Light
datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving a
6.1% improvement in average recall.

*Woosung Joung,Daewon Chae,Jinkyu Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SemanticControl is a training-free method that enables text-to-image diffusion models to effectively use loosely aligned visual conditions (like human poses for animal scenes) by adaptively suppressing conflicting visual guidance and strengthening text guidance using attention masks from surrogate prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ControlNet's effectiveness depends on precisely aligned visual conditions, which are often unavailable for uncommon or imaginative scenes. Existing methods struggle with loosely aligned conditions, leading to low text fidelity or visual artifacts.

Method: The method runs an auxiliary denoising process using a surrogate prompt aligned with the visual condition to extract attention masks, then uses these masks during denoising of the actual target prompt to suppress conflicting visual guidance and strengthen text guidance.

Result: Experimental results show improved performance under loosely aligned conditions across various visual conditions (depth maps, edge maps, human skeletons), outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: SemanticControl effectively addresses the limitation of requiring precisely aligned visual conditions in ControlNet, enabling better utilization of semantically relevant but misaligned visual guides for text-to-image generation.

Abstract: ControlNet has enabled detailed spatial control in text-to-image diffusion
models by incorporating additional visual conditions such as depth or edge
maps. However, its effectiveness heavily depends on the availability of visual
conditions that are precisely aligned with the generation goal specified by
text prompt-a requirement that often fails in practice, especially for uncommon
or imaginative scenes. For example, generating an image of a cat cooking in a
specific pose may be infeasible due to the lack of suitable visual conditions.
In contrast, structurally similar cues can often be found in more common
settings-for instance, poses of humans cooking are widely available and can
serve as rough visual guides. Unfortunately, existing ControlNet models
struggle to use such loosely aligned visual conditions, often resulting in low
text fidelity or visual artifacts. To address this limitation, we propose
SemanticControl, a training-free method for effectively leveraging misaligned
but semantically relevant visual conditions. Our approach adaptively suppresses
the influence of the visual condition where it conflicts with the prompt, while
strengthening guidance from the text. The key idea is to first run an auxiliary
denoising process using a surrogate prompt aligned with the visual condition
(e.g., "a human playing guitar" for a human pose condition) to extract
informative attention masks, and then utilize these masks during the denoising
of the actual target prompt (e.g., cat playing guitar). Experimental results
demonstrate that our method improves performance under loosely aligned
conditions across various conditions, including depth maps, edge maps, and
human skeletons, outperforming existing baselines. Our code is available at

*Daiqing Wu,Dongbao Yang,Sicheng Zhao,Can Ma,Yu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an Emotion Statement Judgment task and automated pipeline to evaluate MLLMs' visual emotion perception, revealing performance gaps compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for MLLMs' emotion perception have limitations including oversight of plausible responses, limited emotional taxonomies, neglect of contextual factors, and labor-intensive annotations.

Method: Developed an Emotion Statement Judgment task and automated pipeline to efficiently construct emotion-centric statements with minimal human effort for systematic MLLM evaluation.

Result: MLLMs show stronger performance in emotion interpretation and context-based emotion judgment, but have limitations in comprehending perception subjectivity. Even top-performing MLLMs like GPT4o demonstrate significant performance gaps compared to humans.

Conclusion: The study provides a fundamental evaluation framework that contributes to advancing emotional intelligence in MLLMs by identifying key areas for future improvement.

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved exceptional
performance across diverse tasks, continually surpassing previous expectations
regarding their capabilities. Nevertheless, their proficiency in perceiving
emotions from images remains debated, with studies yielding divergent results
in zero-shot scenarios. We argue that this inconsistency stems partly from
constraints in existing evaluation methods, including the oversight of
plausible responses, limited emotional taxonomies, neglect of contextual
factors, and labor-intensive annotations. To facilitate customized visual
emotion evaluation for MLLMs, we propose an Emotion Statement Judgment task
that overcomes these constraints. Complementing this task, we devise an
automated pipeline that efficiently constructs emotion-centric statements with
minimal human effort. Through systematically evaluating prevailing MLLMs, our
study showcases their stronger performance in emotion interpretation and
context-based emotion judgment, while revealing relative limitations in
comprehending perception subjectivity. When compared to humans, even
top-performing MLLMs like GPT4o demonstrate remarkable performance gaps,
underscoring key areas for future improvement. By developing a fundamental
evaluation framework and conducting a comprehensive MLLM assessment, we hope
this work contributes to advancing emotional intelligence in MLLMs. Project

*Tao Wu,Yibo Jiang,Yehao Lu,Zhizhong Wang,Zeyi Huang,Zequn Qin,Xi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiCrafter is a framework for multi-subject image generation that addresses attribute leakage through explicit positional supervision, uses Mixture-of-Experts for scenario planning, and employs reinforcement learning for human preference alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from severe attribute leakage that compromises subject fidelity and fail to align with nuanced human preferences due to reliance on simple reconstruction-based objectives.

Method: 1) Explicit positional supervision to separate attention regions and mitigate attribute leakage; 2) Mixture-of-Experts architecture for planning attention regions in diverse scenarios; 3) Online reinforcement learning framework with specialized scoring and training strategy for MoE.

Result: The framework significantly improves subject fidelity while better aligning with human preferences compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: MultiCrafter effectively addresses the core challenges in multi-subject image generation by tackling attention entanglement, enhancing model capacity, and aligning with human preferences through a comprehensive approach.

Abstract: Multi-subject image generation aims to synthesize user-provided subjects in a
single image while preserving subject fidelity, ensuring prompt consistency,
and aligning with human aesthetic preferences. However, existing methods,
particularly those built on the In-Context-Learning paradigm, are limited by
their reliance on simple reconstruction-based objectives, leading to both
severe attribute leakage that compromises subject fidelity and failing to align
with nuanced human preferences. To address this, we propose MultiCrafter, a
framework that ensures high-fidelity, preference-aligned generation. First, we
find that the root cause of attribute leakage is a significant entanglement of
attention between different subjects during the generation process. Therefore,
we introduce explicit positional supervision to explicitly separate attention
regions for each subject, effectively mitigating attribute leakage. To enable
the model to accurately plan the attention region of different subjects in
diverse scenarios, we employ a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to enhance the
model's capacity, allowing different experts to focus on different scenarios.
Finally, we design a novel online reinforcement learning framework to align the
model with human preferences, featuring a scoring mechanism to accurately
assess multi-subject fidelity and a more stable training strategy tailored for
the MoE architecture. Experiments validate that our framework significantly
improves subject fidelity while aligning with human preferences better.

*Javad Hassannataj Joloudari,Bita Mesbahzadeh,Omid Zare,Emrah Arslan,Roohallah Alizadehsani,Hossein Moosaei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep learning framework for blind contrast quality assessment by fine-tuning EfficientNet B0, ResNet18, and MobileNetV2 with contrast-aware regression heads, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) models struggle to accurately evaluate contrast distortions under diverse real-world conditions, despite contrast being a fundamental factor in visual perception and image quality.

Method: Customized and fine-tuned three pre-trained architectures (EfficientNet B0, ResNet18, MobileNetV2) with contrast-aware regression heads, plus a Siamese network model. Used targeted data augmentations and trained end-to-end on CID2013 and CCID2014 datasets containing synthetic and authentic contrast distortions.

Result: EfficientNet B0 achieved state-of-the-art performance with PLCC=0.9286/SRCC=0.9178 on CCID2014 and PLCC=0.9581/SRCC=0.9369 on CID2013, surpassing traditional methods and other deep baselines. The Siamese network showed limited ability to capture perceptual contrast distortions.

Conclusion: Contrast-aware adaptation of lightweight pre-trained networks provides a high-performing, scalable solution for no-reference contrast quality assessment suitable for real-time and resource-constrained applications.

Abstract: Image contrast was a fundamental factor in visual perception and played a
vital role in overall image quality. However, most no reference image quality
assessment NR IQA models struggled to accurately evaluate contrast distortions
under diverse real world conditions. In this study, we proposed a deep learning
based framework for blind contrast quality assessment by customizing and
fine-tuning three pre trained architectures, EfficientNet B0, ResNet18, and
MobileNetV2, for perceptual Mean Opinion Score, along with an additional model
built on a Siamese network, which indicated a limited ability to capture
perceptual contrast distortions. Each model is modified with a contrast-aware
regression head and trained end to end using targeted data augmentations on two
benchmark datasets, CID2013 and CCID2014, containing synthetic and authentic
contrast distortions. Performance is evaluated using Pearson Linear Correlation
Coefficient and Spearman Rank Order Correlation Coefficient, which assess the
alignment between predicted and human rated scores. Among these three models,
our customized EfficientNet B0 model achieved state-of-the-art performance with
PLCC = 0.9286 and SRCC = 0.9178 on CCID2014 and PLCC = 0.9581 and SRCC = 0.9369
on CID2013, surpassing traditional methods and outperforming other deep
baselines. These results highlighted the models robustness and effectiveness in
capturing perceptual contrast distortion. Overall, the proposed method
demonstrated that contrast aware adaptation of lightweight pre trained networks
can yield a high performing, scalable solution for no reference contrast
quality assessment suitable for real time and resource constrained
applications.

*Zhe Zhu,Le Wan,Rui Xu,Yiheng Zhang,Honghua Chen,Zhiyang Dou,Cheng Lin,Yuan Liu,Mingqiang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PartSAM is the first promptable 3D part segmentation model trained on large-scale 3D data, using a triplane-based dual-branch encoder to achieve accurate part identification and decomposition of both surface and internal structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-world part segmentation methods transfer supervision from 2D foundation models like SAM, but this indirect approach fails to capture intrinsic geometry, leading to surface-only understanding, uncontrolled decomposition, and limited generalization.

Method: PartSAM employs an encoder-decoder architecture with a triplane-based dual-branch encoder for scalable part-aware representation learning. The model is trained on over five million 3D shape-part pairs curated through a model-in-the-loop annotation pipeline from online assets.

Result: PartSAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins across multiple benchmarks, achieving highly accurate part identification with a single prompt and automatically decomposing shapes into both surface and internal structures in Segment-Every-Part mode.

Conclusion: PartSAM represents a decisive step toward foundation models for 3D part understanding, demonstrating emergent open-world capabilities through the combination of scalable architecture and diverse 3D data.

Abstract: Segmenting 3D objects into parts is a long-standing challenge in computer
vision. To overcome taxonomy constraints and generalize to unseen 3D objects,
recent works turn to open-world part segmentation. These approaches typically
transfer supervision from 2D foundation models, such as SAM, by lifting
multi-view masks into 3D. However, this indirect paradigm fails to capture
intrinsic geometry, leading to surface-only understanding, uncontrolled
decomposition, and limited generalization. We present PartSAM, the first
promptable part segmentation model trained natively on large-scale 3D data.
Following the design philosophy of SAM, PartSAM employs an encoder-decoder
architecture in which a triplane-based dual-branch encoder produces spatially
structured tokens for scalable part-aware representation learning. To enable
large-scale supervision, we further introduce a model-in-the-loop annotation
pipeline that curates over five million 3D shape-part pairs from online assets,
providing diverse and fine-grained labels. This combination of scalable
architecture and diverse 3D data yields emergent open-world capabilities: with
a single prompt, PartSAM achieves highly accurate part identification, and in a
Segment-Every-Part mode, it automatically decomposes shapes into both surface
and internal structures. Extensive experiments show that PartSAM outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by large margins across multiple benchmarks, marking a
decisive step toward foundation models for 3D part understanding. Our code and
model will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geo-R1 is a reasoning-centric reinforcement fine-tuning paradigm for few-shot geospatial referring that generates explicit reasoning chains before localizing objects, outperforming supervised fine-tuning baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised fine-tuning struggles in data-scarce scenarios for referring expression understanding in remote sensing, leading to poor generalization despite strong performance with massive datasets.

Method: Proposes Geo-R1 with a "reason first, then act" process: generates explicit, interpretable reasoning chains to decompose referring expressions, then leverages these rationales to localize target objects using reinforcement fine-tuning.

Result: Geo-R1 consistently and substantially outperforms SFT baselines on three few-shot geospatial referring benchmarks and demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization, highlighting its robustness.

Conclusion: The reasoning-centric reinforcement fine-tuning paradigm enables more effective use of limited annotations, enhances generalization, and provides interpretability for geospatial referring tasks.

Abstract: Referring expression understanding in remote sensing poses unique challenges,
as it requires reasoning over complex object-context relationships. While
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on multimodal large language models achieves
strong performance with massive labeled datasets, they struggle in data-scarce
scenarios, leading to poor generalization. To address this limitation, we
propose Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) paradigm
for few-shot geospatial referring. Geo-R1 enforces the model to first generate
explicit, interpretable reasoning chains that decompose referring expressions,
and then leverage these rationales to localize target objects. This "reason
first, then act" process enables the model to make more effective use of
limited annotations, enhances generalization, and provides interpretability. We
validate Geo-R1 on three carefully designed few-shot geospatial referring
benchmarks, where our model consistently and substantially outperforms SFT
baselines. It also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization,
highlighting its robustness. Code and data will be released at

*Zikun Guo,Xinyue Xu,Pei Xiang,Shu Yang,Xin Han,Di Wang,Lijie Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates sycophantic behavior in clinical vision language models (VLMs) and proposes VIPER, a lightweight mitigation framework that filters non-evidentiary content to generate evidence-first responses, reducing sycophancy while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs are increasingly used in clinical workflows but exhibit sycophantic behavior that prioritizes alignment with user phrasing and social cues over evidence-based reasoning, which poses risks in medical applications where evidence-based decisions are critical.

Method: Created a medical sycophancy benchmark from PathVQA, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD datasets, using psychologically motivated pressure templates. Proposed VIPER framework that filters non-evidentiary content and generates constrained evidence-first answers.

Result: VLMs were found vulnerable to sycophancy with significant variations in adversarial responses, weakly correlated to model accuracy or size. Imitation and expert-provided corrections were most effective triggers, indicating bias mechanisms independent of visual evidence. VIPER framework reduced sycophancy by an average amount while outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: The benchmark analysis and VIPER mitigation framework provide groundwork for robust deployment of medical VLMs in real-world clinician interactions, emphasizing the need for evidence-anchored defenses against sycophantic behavior.

Abstract: Vision language models(VLMs) are increasingly integrated into clinical
workflows, but they often exhibit sycophantic behavior prioritizing alignment
with user phrasing social cues or perceived authority over evidence based
reasoning. This study evaluate clinical sycophancy in medical visual question
answering through a novel clinically grounded benchmark. We propose a medical
sycophancy dataset construct from PathVQA, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD stratified by
different type organ system and modality. Using psychologically motivated
pressure templates including various sycophancy. In our adversarial experiments
on various VLMs, we found that these models are generally vulnerable,
exhibiting significant variations in the occurrence of adversarial responses,
with weak correlations to the model accuracy or size. Imitation and expert
provided corrections were found to be the most effective triggers, suggesting
that the models possess a bias mechanism independent of visual evidence. To
address this, we propose Visual Information Purification for Evidence based
Response (VIPER) a lightweight mitigation strategy that filters non evidentiary
content for example social pressures and then generates constrained evidence
first answers. This framework reduces sycophancy by an average amount
outperforming baselines while maintaining interpretability. Our benchmark
analysis and mitigation framework lay the groundwork for robust deployment of
medical VLMs in real world clinician interactions emphasizing the need for
evidence anchored defenses.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLARIFY is a novel method that leverages spatiotemporal gaze information to enhance Vision-Language Models' effectiveness in handling ambiguous queries by addressing noisy gaze patterns and complex spatiotemporal relationships with spoken questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With smart glasses gaining popularity, integrating users' attention into VLMs is crucial for multi-modal querying. However, gaze data introduces ambiguity challenges: verbal questions become ambiguous using pronouns or skipping context, and human gaze patterns are noisy with complex spatiotemporal relationships.

Method: GLARIFY analyzes gaze patterns, uses GPT-4o to create an automatic data synthesis pipeline generating the GLARIFY-Ambi dataset with chain-of-thought processing for noisy gaze patterns, and implements a heatmap module to incorporate gaze information into VLMs while preserving pretrained knowledge.

Result: Experiments on a hold-out test set demonstrate that GLARIFY significantly outperforms baseline methods, showing improved performance in handling ambiguous queries with gaze data.

Conclusion: GLARIFY enables robust alignment of VLMs with human attention, paving the way for usable and intuitive interaction paradigms with visual assistants by effectively handling noisy gaze patterns and ambiguous queries.

Abstract: With the rise in popularity of smart glasses, users' attention has been
integrated into Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to streamline multi-modal
querying in daily scenarios. However, leveraging gaze data to model users'
attention may introduce ambiguity challenges: (1) users' verbal questions
become ambiguous by using pronouns or skipping context, (2) humans' gaze
patterns can be noisy and exhibit complex spatiotemporal relationships with
their spoken questions. Previous works only consider single image as visual
modality input, failing to capture the dynamic nature of the user's attention.
In this work, we introduce GLARIFY, a novel method to leverage spatiotemporal
gaze information to enhance the model's effectiveness in real-world
applications. Initially, we analyzed hundreds of querying samples with the gaze
modality to demonstrate the noisy nature of users' gaze patterns. We then
utilized GPT-4o to design an automatic data synthesis pipeline to generate the
GLARIFY-Ambi dataset, which includes a dedicated chain-of-thought (CoT) process
to handle noisy gaze patterns. Finally, we designed a heatmap module to
incorporate gaze information into cutting-edge VLMs while preserving their
pretrained knowledge. We evaluated GLARIFY using a hold-out test set.
Experiments demonstrate that GLARIFY significantly outperforms baselines. By
robustly aligning VLMs with human attention, GLARIFY paves the way for a usable
and intuitive interaction paradigm with a visual assistant.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERGO is an efficient vision-language model that uses a coarse-to-fine reasoning pipeline to reduce computational costs by processing only task-relevant image regions at full resolution while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Large Vision-Language Models incur substantial computational overhead due to processing large numbers of vision tokens, especially for high-resolution images. There's a need for more efficient processing while preserving fine-grained visual details.

Method: Two-stage coarse-to-fine reasoning pipeline: 1) Analyze downsampled image to identify task-relevant regions, 2) Crop and process only these regions at full resolution. Uses reasoning-driven perception with reinforcement learning to handle perceptual uncertainty and expand cropped regions for ambiguous areas.

Result: ERGO achieves higher accuracy than original models and competitive methods with greater efficiency. It surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-7B on V* benchmark by 4.7 points while using only 23% of vision tokens, achieving 3x inference speedup.

Conclusion: The proposed ERGO framework effectively reduces computational costs in vision-language models through selective high-resolution processing while maintaining or improving accuracy, demonstrating the viability of reasoning-driven perception for efficient multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Efficient processing of high-resolution images is crucial for real-world
vision-language applications. However, existing Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) incur substantial computational overhead due to the large number of
vision tokens. With the advent of "thinking with images" models, reasoning now
extends beyond text to the visual domain. This capability motivates our
two-stage "coarse-to-fine" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is
analyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are
cropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This
approach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual
details where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are
truly relevant to a given query. Recent related methods often fail in the first
stage after input-image downsampling, due to perception-driven reasoning, where
clear visual information is required for effective reasoning. To address this
issue, we propose ERGO (Efficient Reasoning & Guided Observation) that performs
reasoning-driven perception-leveraging multimodal context to determine where to
focus. Our model can account for perceptual uncertainty, expanding the cropped
region to cover visually ambiguous areas for answering questions. To this end,
we develop simple yet effective reward components in a reinforcement learning
framework for coarse-to-fine perception. Across multiple datasets, our approach
delivers higher accuracy than the original model and competitive methods, with
greater efficiency. For instance, ERGO surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the V*
benchmark by 4.7 points while using only 23% of the vision tokens, achieving a
3x inference speedup. The code and models can be found at:

*Yingjie Zhu,Xuefeng Bai,Kehai Chen,Yang Xiang,Weili Guan,Jun Yu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVLMs exhibit spatial bias where identical visual information placed at different image positions produces inconsistent outputs, due to unbalanced position embeddings in the language model component.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically study and address the spatial bias in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) where models produce inconsistent outputs when key visual information is placed at different locations within images.

Method: Proposed Balanced Position Assignment (BaPA) - a mechanism that assigns identical position embeddings to all image tokens to promote balanced integration of visual information, addressing the imbalance caused by traditional position embedding strategies like RoPE.

Result: BaPA enhances spatial robustness of LVLMs without retraining and boosts performance across diverse multimodal benchmarks when combined with lightweight fine-tuning. Analysis shows BaPA yields balanced attention for more holistic visual understanding.

Conclusion: Spatial bias in LVLMs stems from unbalanced position embeddings in the language model, not the vision encoder. BaPA effectively mitigates this issue by promoting balanced cross-modal interaction and improves model robustness and performance.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable success across
a wide range of multimodal tasks, yet their robustness to spatial variations
remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a systematic study
of the spatial bias of LVLMs, focusing on how models respond when identical key
visual information is placed at different locations within an image. Through a
carefully designed probing dataset, we demonstrate that current LVLMs often
produce inconsistent outputs under such spatial shifts, revealing a fundamental
limitation in their spatial-semantic understanding. Further analysis shows that
this phenomenon originates not from the vision encoder, which reliably
perceives and interprets visual content across positions, but from the
unbalanced design of position embeddings in the language model component. In
particular, the widely adopted position embedding strategies, such as RoPE,
introduce imbalance during cross-modal interaction, leading image tokens at
different positions to exert unequal influence on semantic understanding. To
mitigate this issue, we introduce Balanced Position Assignment (BaPA), a simple
yet effective mechanism that assigns identical position embeddings to all image
tokens, promoting a more balanced integration of visual information. Extensive
experiments show that BaPA enhances the spatial robustness of LVLMs without
retraining and further boosts their performance across diverse multimodal
benchmarks when combined with lightweight fine-tuning. Further analysis of
information flow reveals that BaPA yields balanced attention, enabling more
holistic visual understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method to disentangle visual and semantic features from diffusion models, enabling visual correspondence analysis and a new metric (VSM) for quantifying visual inconsistencies in subject-driven image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models encode both semantic and visual features for image synthesis, but isolating visual features is challenging due to lack of annotated datasets. Existing methods struggle to quantify and localize visual inconsistencies in generated images.

Method: An automated pipeline that constructs image pairs with annotated semantic/visual correspondences from subject-driven generation datasets, using a contrastive architecture to separate visual and semantic features.

Result: The proposed VSM metric outperforms CLIP, DINO, and vision-language models in quantifying visual inconsistencies while enabling spatial localization of inconsistent regions in generated images.

Conclusion: This is the first method that supports both quantification and localization of inconsistencies in subject-driven generation, providing a valuable tool for advancing this task.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for disentangling visual and semantic features
from the backbones of pre-trained diffusion models, enabling visual
correspondence in a manner analogous to the well-established semantic
correspondence. While diffusion model backbones are known to encode
semantically rich features, they must also contain visual features to support
their image synthesis capabilities. However, isolating these visual features is
challenging due to the absence of annotated datasets. To address this, we
introduce an automated pipeline that constructs image pairs with annotated
semantic and visual correspondences based on existing subject-driven image
generation datasets, and design a contrastive architecture to separate the two
feature types. Leveraging the disentangled representations, we propose a new
metric, Visual Semantic Matching (VSM), that quantifies visual inconsistencies
in subject-driven image generation. Empirical results show that our approach
outperforms global feature-based metrics such as CLIP, DINO, and
vision--language models in quantifying visual inconsistencies while also
enabling spatial localization of inconsistent regions. To our knowledge, this
is the first method that supports both quantification and localization of
inconsistencies in subject-driven generation, offering a valuable tool for
advancing this task. Project

Conclusion: WAVE opens up broad possibilities for cross-modal, any-to-any applications and validates the effectiveness of joint training across all modalities through ablation studies.

Abstract: While embeddings from multimodal large language models (LLMs) excel as
general-purpose representations, their application to dynamic modalities like
audio and video remains underexplored. We introduce WAVE (\textbf{u}nified \&

sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB-v2 video benchmark and achieves
superior results in audio and video-to-audio retrieval. Its prompt-aware nature

Motivation: Address the high resource demands of conditional image generation models and scarcity of well-annotated data, which hinder deployment on edge devices and raise privacy concerns when user data is sent to third parties.

Method: Proposes a semi-supervised distillation framework with tri-level knowledge fusion loss to transfer different levels of knowledge, utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data to enhance generalization and alleviate dataset scarcity.

Result: Achieves significant reductions in computational cost and latency while maintaining high-fidelity generation capabilities and controllability, as quantified by comparative metrics.

Conclusion: Refine-Control effectively addresses resource constraints and data scarcity issues in conditional image generation, enabling more efficient deployment on edge devices while preserving performance and privacy.

Abstract: Conditional image generation models have achieved remarkable results by
leveraging text-based control to generate customized images. However, the high
resource demands of these models and the scarcity of well-annotated data have
hindered their deployment on edge devices, leading to enormous costs and

overcome these challenges, we propose Refine-Control, a semi-supervised

we introduce a semi-supervised distillation method utilizing both labeled and

TL;DR: DualFocus is a novel Depth-from-Focus framework that uses dual constraints (spatial and focal) to improve depth estimation accuracy in complex scenes with fine textures or abrupt depth changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based DFF methods struggle in complex scenes where focus cues become ambiguous due to fine textures or abrupt depth changes, leading to inaccurate depth estimation.

Method: DualFocus introduces a variational formulation with dual constraints: spatial constraints analyze gradient pattern changes across focus levels to distinguish depth edges from texture artifacts, and focal constraints enforce unimodal, monotonic focus probabilities aligned with physical focus behavior.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on four public datasets show that DualFocus consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both depth accuracy and perceptual quality.

Conclusion: The dual constraint approach provides effective inductive biases that improve robustness and accuracy in challenging regions, making DualFocus a superior DFF framework for complex scenes.

Abstract: Depth-from-Focus (DFF) enables precise depth estimation by analyzing focus
cues across a stack of images captured at varying focal lengths. While recent
learning-based approaches have advanced this field, they often struggle in
complex scenes with fine textures or abrupt depth changes, where focus cues may
become ambiguous or misleading. We present DualFocus, a novel DFF framework
that leverages the focal stack's unique gradient patterns induced by focus
variation, jointly modeling focus changes over spatial and focal dimensions.
Our approach introduces a variational formulation with dual constraints
tailored to DFF: spatial constraints exploit gradient pattern changes across
focus levels to distinguish true depth edges from texture artifacts, while
focal constraints enforce unimodal, monotonic focus probabilities aligned with
physical focus behavior. These inductive biases improve robustness and accuracy
in challenging regions. Comprehensive experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate that DualFocus consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both depth accuracy and perceptual quality.

### [96] [Rate-Distortion Optimized Communication for Collaborative Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21994)
*Genjia Liu,Anning Hu,Yue Hu,Wenjun Zhang,Siheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RDcomm, a communication-efficient collaborative perception framework that uses information theory to optimize the trade-off between task performance and communication volume in multi-agent systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work lacked theoretical foundation for analyzing performance-communication trade-offs in collaborative perception. This paper aims to fill that gap using information theory principles.

Method: Proposes RDcomm framework with two key innovations: 1) task entropy discrete coding that assigns task-relevant codeword-lengths, and 2) mutual-information-driven message selection to eliminate redundancy.

Result: RDcomm achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on DAIR-V2X and OPV2V datasets while reducing communication volume by up to 108 times compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The proposed rate-distortion theory provides a solid theoretical foundation for collaborative perception, and RDcomm demonstrates practical effectiveness in balancing performance and communication efficiency.

Abstract: Collaborative perception emphasizes enhancing environmental understanding by
enabling multiple agents to share visual information with limited bandwidth
resources. While prior work has explored the empirical trade-off between task
performance and communication volume, a significant gap remains in the
theoretical foundation. To fill this gap, we draw on information theory and
introduce a pragmatic rate-distortion theory for multi-agent collaboration,
specifically formulated to analyze performance-communication trade-off in
goal-oriented multi-agent systems. This theory concretizes two key conditions
for designing optimal communication strategies: supplying pragmatically
relevant information and transmitting redundancy-less messages. Guided by these
two conditions, we propose RDcomm, a communication-efficient collaborative
perception framework that introduces two key innovations: i) task entropy
discrete coding, which assigns features with task-relevant codeword-lengths to
maximize the efficiency in supplying pragmatic information; ii)
mutual-information-driven message selection, which utilizes mutual information
neural estimation to approach the optimal redundancy-less condition.
Experiments on 3D object detection and BEV segmentation demonstrate that RDcomm
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on DAIR-V2X and OPV2V, while reducing
communication volume by up to 108 times. The code will be released.

*Jiayu Ding,Xinpeng Liu,Zhiyi Pan,Shiqiang Long,Ge Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MUSplat is a training-free framework that lifts 2D open-vocabulary understanding into 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes without per-scene retraining, addressing semantic inconsistency and monosemous limitations through multi-granularity mask lifting and semantic entropy optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing methods that require costly per-scene retraining, suffer from monosemous design failing to represent complex multi-concept semantics, and are vulnerable to cross-view semantic inconsistencies.

Method: Leverages pre-trained 2D segmentation model to generate and lift multi-granularity 2D masks into 3D, estimates foreground probability for each Gaussian point, optimizes ambiguous boundaries using semantic entropy and geometric opacity, and uses Vision-Language Model to distill robust textual features for open-vocabulary querying.

Result: Reduces scene adaptation time from hours to minutes, outperforms established training-based frameworks on open-vocabulary 3D object selection and semantic segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: MUSplat provides an effective training-free solution for 3D open-vocabulary understanding that addresses key limitations of existing methods while achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Lifting 2D open-vocabulary understanding into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
scenes is a critical challenge. However, mainstream methods suffer from three
key flaws: (i) their reliance on costly per-scene retraining prevents
plug-and-play application; (ii) their restrictive monosemous design fails to
represent complex, multi-concept semantics; and (iii) their vulnerability to
cross-view semantic inconsistencies corrupts the final semantic representation.
To overcome these limitations, we introduce MUSplat, a training-free framework
that abandons feature optimization entirely. Leveraging a pre-trained 2D
segmentation model, our pipeline generates and lifts multi-granularity 2D masks
into 3D, where we estimate a foreground probability for each Gaussian point to
form initial object groups. We then optimize the ambiguous boundaries of these
initial groups using semantic entropy and geometric opacity. Subsequently, by
interpreting the object's appearance across its most representative viewpoints,
a Vision-Language Model (VLM) distills robust textual features that reconciles
visual inconsistencies, enabling open-vocabulary querying via semantic
matching. By eliminating the costly per-scene training process, MUSplat reduces
scene adaptation time from hours to mere minutes. On benchmark tasks for
open-vocabulary 3D object selection and semantic segmentation, MUSplat
outperforms established training-based frameworks while simultaneously
addressing their monosemous limitations.

Abstract: Static benchmarks have provided a valuable foundation for comparing
Text-to-Image (T2I) models. However, their passive design offers limited
diagnostic power, struggling to uncover the full landscape of systematic
failures or isolate their root causes. We argue for a complementary paradigm:
active exploration. We introduce FailureAtlas, the first framework designed to
autonomously explore and map the vast failure landscape of T2I models at scale.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Neural-MedBench is a compact reasoning-intensive benchmark for neurology that reveals significant performance drops in state-of-the-art VLMs compared to conventional datasets, highlighting reasoning failures as the dominant limitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical benchmarks create an evaluation illusion where models appear proficient but fail at high-stakes diagnostic reasoning, necessitating a more rigorous assessment of clinical reasoning abilities.

Method: Developed Neural-MedBench integrating multi-sequence MRI scans, EHRs, and clinical notes with three core tasks: differential diagnosis, lesion recognition, and rationale generation, evaluated using a hybrid scoring pipeline combining LLM graders, clinician validation, and semantic similarity metrics.

Result: Systematic evaluation of VLMs (GPT-4o, Claude-4, MedGemma) showed sharp performance drops compared to conventional datasets, with reasoning failures dominating model shortcomings rather than perceptual errors.

Conclusion: Proposes a Two-Axis Evaluation Framework requiring both breadth-oriented datasets for statistical generalization and depth-oriented compact benchmarks like Neural-MedBench for reasoning fidelity, released as an open diagnostic testbed for clinically trustworthy AI assessment.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance on standard medical benchmarks, yet their true clinical reasoning
ability remains unclear. Existing datasets predominantly emphasize
classification accuracy, creating an evaluation illusion in which models appear
proficient while still failing at high-stakes diagnostic reasoning. We
introduce Neural-MedBench, a compact yet reasoning-intensive benchmark
specifically designed to probe the limits of multimodal clinical reasoning in
neurology. Neural-MedBench integrates multi-sequence MRI scans, structured
electronic health records, and clinical notes, and encompasses three core task
families: differential diagnosis, lesion recognition, and rationale generation.
To ensure reliable evaluation, we develop a hybrid scoring pipeline that
combines LLM-based graders, clinician validation, and semantic similarity
metrics. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs, including
GPT-4o, Claude-4, and MedGemma, we observe a sharp performance drop compared to
conventional datasets. Error analysis shows that reasoning failures, rather
than perceptual errors, dominate model shortcomings. Our findings highlight the
necessity of a Two-Axis Evaluation Framework: breadth-oriented large datasets
for statistical generalization, and depth-oriented, compact benchmarks such as
Neural-MedBench for reasoning fidelity. We release Neural-MedBench at
https://neuromedbench.github.io/ as an open and extensible diagnostic testbed,
which guides the expansion of future benchmarks and enables rigorous yet
cost-effective assessment of clinically trustworthy AI.

### [100] [Exposing Hallucinations To Suppress Them: VLMs Representation Editing With Generative Anchors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21997)
*Youxu Shi,Suorong Yang,Dong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free self-supervised method reduces hallucinations in multimodal LLMs by projecting captions to visual space as negative anchors and using original images as positive anchors to edit decoder hidden states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs suffer from hallucinations producing content inconsistent with visual evidence, and existing mitigation approaches require additional finetuning, handcrafted priors, or compromise informativeness and scalability.

Method: Introduces hallucination amplification: projects captions into visual space via text-to-image model as negative anchors, uses original images as positive anchors, then edits decoder hidden states by pulling toward faithful semantics and pushing away from hallucination directions.

Result: Significantly reduces hallucinations at object, attribute, and relation levels while preserving recall and caption richness, achieving over 5% hallucination reduction on CHAIR with LLaVA-v1.5-7B, and shows strong cross-architecture generalization.

Conclusion: The training-free method effectively mitigates hallucinations without side effects on hallucination-free captions, demonstrating robustness and practical plug-and-play applicability.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse vision-language tasks, yet they remain highly susceptible to
hallucinations, producing content that is fluent but inconsistent with visual
evidence. Such hallucinations, spanning objects, attributes, and relations,
persist even in larger models, while existing mitigation approaches often
require additional finetuning, handcrafted priors, or trade-offs that
compromise informativeness and scalability. To address this limitation, we
propose a training-free, self-supervised method for hallucination mitigation.
Our approach introduces a novel hallucination amplification mechanism: a
caption is projected into the visual space via a text-to-image model to reveal
implicit hallucination signals, serving as a negative anchor, while the
original image provides a positive anchor. Leveraging these dual anchors, we
edit decoder hidden states by pulling representations toward faithful semantics
and pushing them away from hallucination directions. This correction requires
no human priors or additional training costs, ensuring both effectiveness and
efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our
method significantly reduces hallucinations at the object, attribute, and
relation levels while largely preserving recall and caption richness, e.g.,
achieving a hallucination reduction by over 5% using LLaVA-v1.5-7B on CHAIR.
Furthermore, results on diverse architectures, including LLaVA-NEXT-7B,
Cambrian-8B, and InstructBLIP-7B, validate strong cross-architecture
generalization. More importantly, when applied to hallucination-free captions,
our method introduces almost no side effects, underscoring its robustness and
practical plug-and-play applicability. The implementation will be publicly
available.

### [101] [CoFFT: Chain of Foresight-Focus Thought for Visual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22010)
*Xinyu Zhang,Yuxuan Dong,Lingling Zhang,Chengyou Jia,Zhuohang Dang,Basura Fernando,Jun Liu,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoFFT is a training-free method that enhances VLMs' visual reasoning by mimicking human visual cognition through iterative cycles of generating diverse reasoning samples, evaluating them based on visual focus and reasoning progression, and adjusting visual focus for future reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with complex and redundant visual inputs, leading to interference, excessive irrelevant reasoning, and hallucinations due to their inability to precisely discover and process required regions during reasoning.

Method: CoFFT uses iterative Foresight-Focus Thought cycles with three stages: (1) Diverse Sample Generation to explore reasoning paths, (2) Dual Foresight Decoding to evaluate samples based on visual focus and reasoning progression, and (3) Visual Focus Adjustment to refine focus for future reasoning.

Result: Empirical results across multiple benchmarks using Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL-2.5, and Llava-Next show consistent performance improvements of 3.1-5.8% with controllable computational overhead.

Conclusion: CoFFT effectively enhances VLMs' visual reasoning by creating an interdependent cycle where reasoning guides visual focus and visual focus informs subsequent reasoning, addressing limitations in handling complex visual inputs.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs), they remain
constrained by the complexity and redundancy of visual input. When images
contain large amounts of irrelevant information, VLMs are susceptible to
interference, thus generating excessive task-irrelevant reasoning processes or
even hallucinations. This limitation stems from their inability to discover and
process the required regions during reasoning precisely. To address this
limitation, we present the Chain of Foresight-Focus Thought (CoFFT), a novel
training-free approach that enhances VLMs' visual reasoning by emulating human
visual cognition. Each Foresight-Focus Thought consists of three stages: (1)
Diverse Sample Generation: generates diverse reasoning samples to explore
potential reasoning paths, where each sample contains several reasoning steps;
(2) Dual Foresight Decoding: rigorously evaluates these samples based on both
visual focus and reasoning progression, adding the first step of optimal sample
to the reasoning process; (3) Visual Focus Adjustment: precisely adjust visual
focus toward regions most beneficial for future reasoning, before returning to
stage (1) to generate subsequent reasoning samples until reaching the final
answer. These stages function iteratively, creating an interdependent cycle
where reasoning guides visual focus and visual focus informs subsequent
reasoning. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks using Qwen2.5-VL,
InternVL-2.5, and Llava-Next demonstrate consistent performance improvements of
3.1-5.8\% with controllable increasing computational overhead.

### [102] [Jailbreaking on Text-to-Video Models via Scene Splitting Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22292)
*Wonjun Lee,Haon Park,Doehyeon Lee,Bumsub Ham,Suhyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneSplit is a black-box jailbreak method that fragments harmful narratives into multiple benign scenes to bypass Text-to-Video model safety filters, achieving high attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-Video models have significant safety risks that remain largely unexplored compared to other AI models like LLMs and T2I models, creating a critical safety gap that needs addressing.

Method: SceneSplit fragments harmful narratives into multiple individually benign scenes, constrains the generative output space through sequential scene combination, uses iterative scene manipulation to bypass filters, and employs a strategy library for pattern reuse.

Result: Achieved average Attack Success Rates of 77.2% on Luma Ray2, 84.1% on Hailuo, and 78.2% on Veo2 across 11 safety categories, significantly outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: Current T2V safety mechanisms are vulnerable to narrative structure exploitation, providing new insights for understanding and improving T2V model safety.

Abstract: Along with the rapid advancement of numerous Text-to-Video (T2V) models,
growing concerns have emerged regarding their safety risks. While recent
studies have explored vulnerabilities in models like LLMs, VLMs, and
Text-to-Image (T2I) models through jailbreak attacks, T2V models remain largely
unexplored, leaving a significant safety gap. To address this gap, we introduce
SceneSplit, a novel black-box jailbreak method that works by fragmenting a
harmful narrative into multiple scenes, each individually benign. This approach
manipulates the generative output space, the abstract set of all potential
video outputs for a given prompt, using the combination of scenes as a powerful
constraint to guide the final outcome. While each scene individually
corresponds to a wide and safe space where most outcomes are benign, their
sequential combination collectively restricts this space, narrowing it to an
unsafe region and significantly increasing the likelihood of generating a
harmful video. This core mechanism is further enhanced through iterative scene
manipulation, which bypasses the safety filter within this constrained unsafe
region. Additionally, a strategy library that reuses successful attack patterns
further improves the attack's overall effectiveness and robustness. To validate
our method, we evaluate SceneSplit across 11 safety categories on T2V models.
Our results show that it achieves a high average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of
77.2% on Luma Ray2, 84.1% on Hailuo, and 78.2% on Veo2, significantly
outperforming the existing baseline. Through this work, we demonstrate that
current T2V safety mechanisms are vulnerable to attacks that exploit narrative
structure, providing new insights for understanding and improving the safety of
T2V models.

*Seyedmorteza Sadat,Farnood Salehi,Romann M. Weber*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiGS is a momentum-based sampling technique that improves diffusion model outputs by integrating recent predictions, achieving better image quality with fewer sampling steps and no extra computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models often produce unrealistic outputs with poor details when using fewer neural function evaluations or lower guidance scales, limiting their practical efficiency.

Method: History-guided sampling (HiGS) leverages the difference between current predictions and weighted averages of past predictions to steer sampling toward more realistic outputs with better details and structure.

Result: HiGS achieves state-of-the-art FID of 1.61 for unguided ImageNet generation at 256×256 with only 30 sampling steps (vs standard 250), and consistently improves image quality across diverse models and sampling budgets.

Conclusion: HiGS serves as a plug-and-play enhancement that enables faster diffusion sampling with higher fidelity, requiring no extra training or fine-tuning.

Abstract: While diffusion models have made remarkable progress in image generation,
their outputs can still appear unrealistic and lack fine details, especially
when using fewer number of neural function evaluations (NFEs) or lower guidance
scales. To address this issue, we propose a novel momentum-based sampling
technique, termed history-guided sampling (HiGS), which enhances quality and
efficiency of diffusion sampling by integrating recent model predictions into
each inference step. Specifically, HiGS leverages the difference between the
current prediction and a weighted average of past predictions to steer the
sampling process toward more realistic outputs with better details and
structure. Our approach introduces practically no additional computation and
integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion frameworks, requiring neither
extra training nor fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that HiGS
consistently improves image quality across diverse models and architectures and
under varying sampling budgets and guidance scales. Moreover, using a
pretrained SiT model, HiGS achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.61 for
unguided ImageNet generation at 256$\times$256 with only 30 sampling steps
(instead of the standard 250). We thus present HiGS as a plug-and-play
enhancement to standard diffusion sampling that enables faster generation with
higher fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new egocentric video dataset for analyzing face-to-face instructional interactions, addressing the lack of suitable datasets and analytical techniques in computer vision. It benchmarks multimodal large language models (MLLMs) against conventional models for procedural step segmentation and conversation-state classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face-to-face instructional interactions are critical for educational support and skill transfer but have not been systematically studied in computer vision due to lack of suitable datasets and limited analytical techniques.

Method: Created a new egocentric video dataset with ground-truth annotations for procedural step segmentation and conversation-state classification. Benchmarked multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that jointly process images, audio, and text against conventional task-specific models.

Result: MLLMs outperformed specialized baselines even without task-specific fine-tuning, demonstrating their promise for holistic understanding of instructional interactions that involve multiple modalities including speech content and prosody, gaze and body motion, and visual context.

Conclusion: The study shows that current MLLMs have strong potential for understanding face-to-face instructional scenes by effectively handling both verbal and nonverbal communication in an integrated manner, advancing the field of instructional interaction analysis in computer vision.

Abstract: Analyzing instructional interactions between an instructor and a learner who
are co-present in the same physical space is a critical problem for educational
support and skill transfer. Yet such face-to-face instructional scenes have not
been systematically studied in computer vision. We identify two key reasons: i)
the lack of suitable datasets and ii) limited analytical techniques. To address
this gap, we present a new egocentric video dataset of face-to-face instruction
and provide ground-truth annotations for two fundamental tasks that serve as a
first step toward a comprehensive understanding of instructional interactions:
procedural step segmentation and conversation-state classification. Using this
dataset, we benchmark multimodal large language models (MLLMs) against
conventional task-specific models. Since face-to-face instruction involves
multiple modalities (speech content and prosody, gaze and body motion, and
visual context), effective understanding requires methods that handle verbal
and nonverbal communication in an integrated manner. Accordingly, we evaluate
recently introduced MLLMs that jointly process images, audio, and text. This
evaluation quantifies the extent to which current machine learning models
understand face-to-face instructional scenes. In experiments, MLLMs outperform
specialized baselines even without task-specific fine-tuning, suggesting their
promise for holistic understanding of instructional interactions.

*Xiao Wang,Shujuan Wu,Xiaoxia Cheng,Changwei Bi,Jin Tang,Bin Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-modal knowledge graph approach for pedestrian attribute recognition that mines relationships between visual features and text attributes, using a knowledge graph-guided cross-modal hypergraph learning framework to improve recognition accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PAR methods fail to fully exploit attribute knowledge and contextual information, and while recent works use attribute text as additional input, these approaches are still in their infancy and don't effectively model the complex relationships between visual features and semantic attributes.

Method: Constructs a multi-modal knowledge graph that considers relationships among attributes and between attributes and vision tokens, then uses a knowledge graph-guided cross-modal hypergraph learning framework to enhance standard pedestrian attribute recognition.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on multiple PAR benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed knowledge graph approach for pedestrian attribute recognition tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method establishes a strong foundation for knowledge-guided pedestrian attribute recognition by effectively modeling relationships between visual features and semantic attributes through multi-modal knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Current Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) algorithms typically focus on
mapping visual features to semantic labels or attempt to enhance learning by
fusing visual and attribute information. However, these methods fail to fully
exploit attribute knowledge and contextual information for more accurate
recognition. Although recent works have started to consider using attribute
text as additional input to enhance the association between visual and semantic
information, these methods are still in their infancy. To address the above
challenges, this paper proposes the construction of a multi-modal knowledge
graph, which is utilized to mine the relationships between local visual
features and text, as well as the relationships between attributes and
extensive visual context samples. Specifically, we propose an effective
multi-modal knowledge graph construction method that fully considers the
relationships among attributes and the relationships between attributes and
vision tokens. To effectively model these relationships, this paper introduces
a knowledge graph-guided cross-modal hypergraph learning framework to enhance
the standard pedestrian attribute recognition framework. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple PAR benchmark datasets have thoroughly demonstrated the
effectiveness of our proposed knowledge graph for the PAR task, establishing a
strong foundation for knowledge-guided pedestrian attribute recognition. The

*Chao Huang,Susan Liang,Yapeng Tian,Anurag Kumar,Chenliang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAVIS is a generative audio-visual separation framework that uses diffusion models (DDPM and Flow Matching) to directly synthesize separated sound spectrograms from noise, conditioned on mixed audio and visual inputs, achieving superior separation quality across diverse sound categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mask-based regression methods for audio-visual sound separation have limitations in capturing complex data distributions needed for high-quality separation of diverse sound categories. Generative approaches can better model these distributions.

Method: Uses Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and Flow Matching integrated within a Separation U-Net architecture. The framework synthesizes separated sound spectrograms directly from noise distribution, conditioned on mixed audio and visual information.

Result: Both DDPM and Flow Matching variants of DAVIS surpass existing methods on standard AVE and MUSIC datasets, demonstrating superior separation quality across diverse sound categories.

Conclusion: Generative modeling paradigms like diffusion models are highly effective for audio-visual source separation, producing higher quality results than traditional mask-based regression approaches.

Abstract: We propose DAVIS, a Diffusion-based Audio-VIsual Separation framework that
solves the audio-visual sound source separation task through generative
learning. Existing methods typically frame sound separation as a mask-based
regression problem, achieving significant progress. However, they face
limitations in capturing the complex data distribution required for
high-quality separation of sounds from diverse categories. In contrast, DAVIS
circumvents these issues by leveraging potent generative modeling paradigms,
specifically Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and the more
recent Flow Matching (FM), integrated within a specialized Separation U-Net
architecture. Our framework operates by synthesizing the desired separated
sound spectrograms directly from a noise distribution, conditioned concurrently
on the mixed audio input and associated visual information. The inherent nature
of its generative objective makes DAVIS particularly adept at producing
high-quality sound separations for diverse sound categories. We present
comparative evaluations of DAVIS, encompassing both its DDPM and Flow Matching
variants, against leading methods on the standard AVE and MUSIC datasets. The
results affirm that both variants surpass existing approaches in separation
quality, highlighting the efficacy of our generative framework for tackling the
audio-visual source separation task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAU is a framework that uses vision-language models for reference-based anatomical understanding in medical imaging, enabling identification, localization, and segmentation of anatomical structures by leveraging spatial reasoning between reference and target images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anatomical understanding in medical imaging is crucial for automated clinical workflows but faces challenges due to scarcity of expert-labeled data. Current vision-language models have limited reference-based understanding and fine-grained localization capabilities.

Method: RAU combines VLM-based relative spatial reasoning between reference and target images with SAM2's fine-grained segmentation capability. The VLM learns anatomical region identification through spatial reasoning, and these spatial cues are integrated with SAM2 for pixel-level segmentation.

Result: RAU consistently outperforms SAM2 fine-tuning baselines across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets, achieving more accurate segmentations and reliable localization. It demonstrates strong generalization ability to out-of-distribution datasets.

Conclusion: RAU is the first framework to explore VLM capabilities for reference-based anatomical understanding in medical images, showing promising performance and highlighting the potential of VLM-driven approaches for automated clinical workflows.

Abstract: Anatomical understanding through deep learning is critical for automatic
report generation, intra-operative navigation, and organ localization in
medical imaging; however, its progress is constrained by the scarcity of
expert-labeled data. A promising remedy is to leverage an annotated reference
image to guide the interpretation of an unlabeled target. Although recent
vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit non-trivial visual reasoning, their
reference-based understanding and fine-grained localization remain limited. We
introduce RAU, a framework for reference-based anatomical understanding with
VLMs. We first show that a VLM learns to identify anatomical regions through
relative spatial reasoning between reference and target images, trained on a
moderately sized dataset. We validate this capability through visual question
answering (VQA) and bounding box prediction. Next, we demonstrate that the
VLM-derived spatial cues can be seamlessly integrated with the fine-grained
segmentation capability of SAM2, enabling localization and pixel-level
segmentation of small anatomical regions, such as vessel segments. Across two
in-distribution and two out-of-distribution datasets, RAU consistently
outperforms a SAM2 fine-tuning baseline using the same memory setup, yielding
more accurate segmentations and more reliable localization. More importantly,
its strong generalization ability makes it scalable to out-of-distribution
datasets, a property crucial for medical image applications. To the best of our
knowledge, RAU is the first to explore the capability of VLMs for
reference-based identification, localization, and segmentation of anatomical
structures in medical images. Its promising performance highlights the
potential of VLM-driven approaches for anatomical understanding in automated
clinical workflows.

TL;DR: SpecXNet is a dual-domain deepfake detection architecture that combines spatial and spectral features using Dual-Domain Feature Coupler and Dual Fourier Attention modules to achieve robust performance across various manipulation types.


<details>

Conclusion: Unified spatial-spectral learning is effective for robust and generalizable deepfake detection, with the approach showing strong performance across various test conditions.

Abstract: The increasing realism of content generated by GANs and diffusion models has
made deepfake detection significantly more challenging. Existing approaches
often focus solely on spatial or frequency-domain features, limiting their
generalization to unseen manipulations. We propose the Spectral
Cross-Attentional Network (SpecXNet), a dual-domain architecture for robust
deepfake detection. The core \textbf{Dual-Domain Feature Coupler (DDFC)}
decomposes features into a local spatial branch for capturing texture-level
anomalies and a global spectral branch that employs Fast Fourier Transform to
model periodic inconsistencies. This dual-domain formulation allows SpecXNet to
jointly exploit localized detail and global structural coherence, which are
critical for distinguishing authentic from manipulated images. We also
introduce the \textbf{Dual Fourier Attention (DFA)} module, which dynamically
fuses spatial and spectral features in a content-aware manner. Built atop a
modified XceptionNet backbone, we embed the DDFC and DFA modules within a
separable convolution block. Extensive experiments on multiple deepfake
benchmarks show that SpecXNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, particularly
under cross-dataset and unseen manipulation scenarios, while maintaining
real-time feasibility. Our results highlight the effectiveness of unified
spatial-spectral learning for robust and generalizable deepfake detection. To
ensure reproducibility, we released the full code on

### [109] [Explaining multimodal LLMs via intra-modal token interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22415)
*Jiawei Liang,Ruoyu Chen,Xianghao Jiao,Siyuan Liang,Shiming Liu,Qunli Zhang,Zheng Hu,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods to improve interpretability of Multimodal Large Language Models by addressing intra-modal dependencies in both visual and textual modalities, resulting in more faithful explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current interpretability research for MLLMs focuses mainly on cross-modal attribution but overlooks intra-modal dependencies, leading to fragmented visual explanations and spurious textual activations that compromise attribution fidelity.

Method: Two main approaches: 1) Multi-Scale Explanation Aggregation (MSEA) for visual branch - aggregates attributions over multi-scale inputs to adjust receptive fields dynamically; 2) Activation Ranking Correlation (ARC) for textual branch - measures relevance of contextual tokens via alignment of top-k prediction rankings to suppress spurious activations.

Result: Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLLMs and benchmark datasets show the approach consistently outperforms existing interpretability methods, producing more faithful and fine-grained explanations of model behavior.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively enhance MLLM interpretability by leveraging intra-modal interactions, addressing limitations of current approaches and providing more holistic visual explanations and semantically coherent textual attributions.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse vision-language tasks, yet their internal decision-making
mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. Existing interpretability research
has primarily focused on cross-modal attribution, identifying which image
regions the model attends to during output generation. However, these
approaches often overlook intra-modal dependencies. In the visual modality,
attributing importance to isolated image patches ignores spatial context due to
limited receptive fields, resulting in fragmented and noisy explanations. In
the textual modality, reliance on preceding tokens introduces spurious
activations. Failing to effectively mitigate these interference compromises
attribution fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose enhancing
interpretability by leveraging intra-modal interaction. For the visual branch,
we introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Explanation Aggregation} (MSEA), which
aggregates attributions over multi-scale inputs to dynamically adjust receptive
fields, producing more holistic and spatially coherent visual explanations. For
the textual branch, we propose \textit{Activation Ranking Correlation} (ARC),
which measures the relevance of contextual tokens to the current token via
alignment of their top-$k$ prediction rankings. ARC leverages this relevance to
suppress spurious activations from irrelevant contexts while preserving
semantically coherent ones. Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art MLLMs
and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
existing interpretability methods, yielding more faithful and fine-grained
explanations of model behavior.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGM generates 3D assets with PBR materials (albedo, roughness, metallic) using a fine-tuned multiview material diffusion model and Gaussian material representation, enabling dynamic relighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D reconstruction models fail to produce material properties needed for realistic rendering in diverse lighting environments, limiting their practical applications.

Method: Fine-tune multiview material diffusion model conditioned on depth/normal maps, then use Gaussian material representation to model PBR channels and reconstruct point clouds with PBR attributes.

Result: Produces visually appealing materials that enhance material modeling and enable practical downstream rendering applications with dynamic relighting capabilities.

Conclusion: MGM successfully generates high-quality 3D content with PBR materials, overcoming limitations of existing RGB-only approaches and enabling realistic rendering in various lighting conditions.

Abstract: The increasing demand for 3D assets across various industries necessitates
efficient and automated methods for 3D content creation. Leveraging 3D Gaussian
Splatting, recent large reconstruction models (LRMs) have demonstrated the
ability to efficiently achieve high-quality 3D rendering by integrating
multiview diffusion for generation and scalable transformers for
reconstruction. However, existing models fail to produce the material
properties of assets, which is crucial for realistic rendering in diverse
lighting environments. In this paper, we introduce the Large Material Gaussian
Model (MGM), a novel framework designed to generate high-quality 3D content
with Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials, ie, albedo, roughness, and
metallic properties, rather than merely producing RGB textures with
uncontrolled light baking. Specifically, we first fine-tune a new multiview
material diffusion model conditioned on input depth and normal maps. Utilizing
the generated multiview PBR images, we explore a Gaussian material
representation that not only aligns with 2D Gaussian Splatting but also models
each channel of the PBR materials. The reconstructed point clouds can then be
rendered to acquire PBR attributes, enabling dynamic relighting by applying
various ambient light maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
materials produced by our method not only exhibit greater visual appeal
compared to baseline methods but also enhance material modeling, thereby
enabling practical downstream rendering applications.

*Jingjing Lu,Huilong Pi,Yunchuan Qin,Zhuo Tang,Ruihui Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel self-supervised point cloud completion method that uses multi-view augmentations and incorporates Mamba architecture to overcome limitations of existing supervised, unsupervised, and weakly-supervised approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current point cloud completion methods have limitations: supervised methods rely on ground truth and suffer from synthetic-to-real domain gap; unsupervised methods need complete point clouds; weakly-supervised methods require multi-view observations; existing self-supervised methods produce unsatisfactory predictions due to limited self-supervised signals.

Method: Proposes a self-supervised approach using multi-view augmentations of single partial point clouds as novel self-supervised signals, and incorporates Mamba architecture to enhance learning capability for better quality point cloud generation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed self-supervised method with multi-view augmentations and Mamba architecture effectively overcomes the limitations of existing approaches and achieves excellent performance in point cloud completion tasks.

Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to reconstruct complete shapes from partial
observations. Although current methods have achieved remarkable performance,
they still have some limitations: Supervised methods heavily rely on ground
truth, which limits their generalization to real-world datasets due to the
synthetic-to-real domain gap. Unsupervised methods require complete point
clouds to compose unpaired training data, and weakly-supervised methods need
multi-view observations of the object. Existing self-supervised methods
frequently produce unsatisfactory predictions due to the limited capabilities
of their self-supervised signals. To overcome these challenges, we propose a
novel self-supervised point cloud completion method. We design a set of novel
self-supervised signals based on multi-view augmentations of the single partial
point cloud. Additionally, to enhance the model's learning ability, we first
incorporate Mamba into self-supervised point cloud completion task, encouraging
the model to generate point clouds with better quality. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art results.

### [112] [Vision-Language Alignment from Compressed Image Representations using 2D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22615)
*Yasmine Omri,Connor Ding,Tsachy Weissman,Thierry Tambe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) is proposed as an alternative visual representation to RGB images for vision-language pipelines, offering 3-20x compression and faster processing while maintaining semantic alignment capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RGB-based vision pipelines have structural inefficiencies: (i) high transmission costs from edge devices, and (ii) patch-based tokenization creates long sequences that stress attention mechanisms and context limits.

Method: Developed scalable 2DGS pipeline with structured initialization, luminance-aware pruning, and optimized CUDA kernels. Adapted CLIP training by reusing frozen RGB transformer backbone with lightweight splat-aware input stem and perceiver resampler, training only 7% of parameters.

Result: Achieved 90x faster fitting and 97% GPU utilization compared to prior implementations. On DataComp subsets, GS encoders achieved meaningful zero-shot ImageNet-1K performance with 3-20x input compression relative to pixels. Accuracy currently trails RGB encoders but establishes viability.

Conclusion: 2D Gaussian Splatting is established as a viable multimodal substrate that addresses transmission efficiency for edge-cloud learning, though further work is needed to close the accuracy gap with RGB encoders.

Abstract: Modern vision language pipelines are driven by RGB vision encoders trained on
massive image text corpora. While these pipelines have enabled impressive zero
shot capabilities and strong transfer across tasks, they still inherit two
structural inefficiencies from the pixel domain: (i) transmitting dense RGB
images from edge devices to the cloud is energy intensive and costly, and (ii)
patch based tokenization explodes sequence length, stressing attention budgets
and context limits. We explore 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) as an alternative
visual substrate for alignment: a compact, spatially adaptive representation
that parameterizes images by a set of colored anisotropic Gaussians. We develop
a scalable 2DGS pipeline with structured initialization, luminance aware
pruning, and batched CUDA kernels, achieving over 90x faster fitting and about
97% GPU utilization compared to prior implementations. We further adapt
contrastive language image pretraining (CLIP) to 2DGS by reusing a frozen
RGB-based transformer backbone with a lightweight splat aware input stem and a
perceiver resampler, training only about 7% of the total parameters. On large
DataComp subsets, GS encoders yield meaningful zero shot ImageNet-1K
performance while compressing inputs 3 to 20x relative to pixels. While
accuracy currently trails RGB encoders, our results establish 2DGS as a viable
multimodal substrate, pinpoint architectural bottlenecks, and open a path
toward representations that are both semantically powerful and transmission
efficient for edge cloud learning.

TL;DR: JGEKD is a classification strategy for non-IID 3D point cloud data that uses joint graph entropy knowledge distillation to capture class correlations and improve robustness against corruption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional classification assumes IID data, which destroys class correlations in 3D point clouds. This paper addresses the need to handle non-IID data while preserving class relationships.

Method: Uses joint graphs to capture hidden class relationships, constructs loss functions based on joint graph entropy for knowledge distillation, employs Siamese structures for spatial transformation invariance, and develops self-knowledge and teacher-knowledge distillation frameworks.

Result: Extensive experiments on ScanObject, ModelNet40, ScanntV2_cls and ModelNet-C demonstrate competitive performance.

### [114] [Hierarchical Representation Matching for CLIP-based Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22645)
*Zhen-Hao Wen,Yan Wang,Ji Feng,Han-Jia Ye,De-Chuan Zhan,Da-Wei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HERMAN introduces hierarchical representation matching for CLIP-based class-incremental learning, using LLMs to generate discriminative textual descriptors that capture hierarchical visual concepts and match them to different semantic levels in CLIP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based CIL approaches use simplistic templates like 'a photo of a [CLASS]' that ignore the hierarchical nature of visual concepts, and rely only on last-layer representations, missing hierarchical information from earlier layers.

Method: Leverages LLMs to recursively generate discriminative textual descriptors that augment semantic space with hierarchical cues, matches descriptors to different semantic hierarchy levels, and adaptively routes them based on task requirements.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving precise discrimination while alleviating catastrophic forgetting in incremental tasks.

Conclusion: HERMAN effectively addresses hierarchical visual concept recognition in CLIP-based CIL by incorporating hierarchical representation matching, significantly improving performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to endow models with the ability to
continuously adapt to evolving data streams. Recent advances in pre-trained
vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) provide a powerful foundation for this
task. However, existing approaches often rely on simplistic templates, such as
"a photo of a [CLASS]", which overlook the hierarchical nature of visual
concepts. For example, recognizing "cat" versus "car" depends on coarse-grained
cues, while distinguishing "cat" from "lion" requires fine-grained details.
Similarly, the current feature mapping in CLIP relies solely on the
representation from the last layer, neglecting the hierarchical information
contained in earlier layers. In this work, we introduce HiErarchical
Representation MAtchiNg (HERMAN) for CLIP-based CIL. Our approach leverages
LLMs to recursively generate discriminative textual descriptors, thereby
augmenting the semantic space with explicit hierarchical cues. These
descriptors are matched to different levels of the semantic hierarchy and
adaptively routed based on task-specific requirements, enabling precise
discrimination while alleviating catastrophic forgetting in incremental tasks.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

*Jonas Belouadi,Tamy Boubekeur,Adrien Kaiser*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiMat is a multimodal program synthesis framework that uses large multimodal models to generate procedural material graphs by processing both visual and textual representations, outperforming text-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Material node graphs are essential for procedural material creation in computer graphics but require professional training. Current neural program synthesis methods only use textual representations, missing the visual-spatial nature that makes node graphs intuitive for humans.

Method: Combines large multimodal models trained on production-quality procedural materials with a constrained tree search inference algorithm that ensures syntactic validity while efficiently exploring the program space.

Result: MultiMat achieves higher efficiency in both unconditional and conditional graph synthesis with superior visual quality and fidelity compared to text-only baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Multimodal program synthesis that leverages both visual and textual representations significantly improves procedural material graph generation over text-only approaches.

Abstract: Material node graphs are programs that generate the 2D channels of procedural
materials, including geometry such as roughness and displacement maps, and
reflectance such as albedo and conductivity maps. They are essential in
computer graphics for representing the appearance of virtual 3D objects
parametrically and at arbitrary resolution. In particular, their directed
acyclic graph structures and intermediate states provide an intuitive
understanding and workflow for interactive appearance modeling. Creating such
graphs is a challenging task and typically requires professional training.
While recent neural program synthesis approaches attempt to simplify this
process, they solely represent graphs as textual programs, failing to capture
the inherently visual-spatial nature of node graphs that makes them accessible
to humans. To address this gap, we present MultiMat, a multimodal program
synthesis framework that leverages large multimodal models to process both
visual and textual graph representations for improved generation of procedural
material graphs. We train our models on a new dataset of production-quality
procedural materials and combine them with a constrained tree search inference
algorithm that ensures syntactic validity while efficiently navigating the
program space. Our experimental results show that our multimodal program
synthesis method is more efficient in both unconditional and conditional graph
synthesis with higher visual quality and fidelity than text-only baselines,
establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: DeeptraceReward is the first benchmark for fine-grained detection of AI-generated video artifacts, featuring 4.3K annotations across 3.3K videos with spatial, temporal, and explanatory annotations. A 7B reward model trained on this data outperforms GPT-5 by 34.7% in detecting fake traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models have advanced rapidly, but there's been little research on whether humans can detect deepfake traces - spatiotemporal visual artifacts that reveal videos as machine-generated. The authors aim to address this gap by creating a benchmark for human-perceived fake traces.

Method: Created DeeptraceReward dataset with 4.3K detailed annotations across 3.3K high-quality generated videos. Each annotation includes natural-language explanations, bounding-box regions, and precise timestamps. Consolidated annotations into 9 categories of deepfake traces and trained multimodal language models as reward models to mimic human judgments.

Result: The 7B reward model outperformed GPT-5 by 34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation tasks. Found consistent difficulty gradient: binary classification is easier than fine-grained detection, with performance degrading from explanations (easiest) to spatial grounding to temporal labeling (hardest).

Conclusion: DeeptraceReward provides a rigorous testbed and training signal for socially aware and trustworthy video generation by foregrounding human-perceived deepfake traces, enabling better detection and understanding of AI-generated video artifacts.

Abstract: Can humans identify AI-generated (fake) videos and provide grounded reasons?
While video generation models have advanced rapidly, a critical dimension --
whether humans can detect deepfake traces within a generated video, i.e.,
spatiotemporal grounded visual artifacts that reveal a video as machine
generated -- has been largely overlooked. We introduce DeeptraceReward, the
first fine-grained, spatially- and temporally- aware benchmark that annotates
human-perceived fake traces for video generation reward. The dataset comprises
4.3K detailed annotations across 3.3K high-quality generated videos. Each
annotation provides a natural-language explanation, pinpoints a bounding-box
region containing the perceived trace, and marks precise onset and offset
timestamps. We consolidate these annotations into 9 major categories of
deepfake traces that lead humans to identify a video as AI-generated, and train
multimodal language models (LMs) as reward models to mimic human judgments and
localizations. On DeeptraceReward, our 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by
34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation.
Interestingly, we observe a consistent difficulty gradient: binary fake v.s.
real classification is substantially easier than fine-grained deepfake trace
detection; within the latter, performance degrades from natural language
explanations (easiest), to spatial grounding, to temporal labeling (hardest).
By foregrounding human-perceived deepfake traces, DeeptraceReward provides a
rigorous testbed and training signal for socially aware and trustworthy video
generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the latent space efficiency and controllability of GAN-generated images by combining structured latent spaces, intuitive manipulation, and dimensionality reduction for more streamlined exploration.

Method: Integrates StyleGAN for structured latent space, DragGAN for intuitive image manipulation, and PCA for dimensionality reduction and cross-model alignment. Applied to AFHQ dataset with PCA-based dimensionality reduction in DragGAN's latent W+ layers.

Result: PCA integration reduces total optimization time while maintaining good visual quality and even boosting SSIM, especially in shallower latent spaces (W+ layers = 3). Successfully aligned AFHQ-Dog and AFHQ-Cat models for intuitive cross-domain manipulation.

Conclusion: The approach enables efficient and interpretable latent space control for image synthesis and editing applications, demonstrating the potential for streamlined cross-model alignment and manipulation.

Abstract: This work integrates StyleGAN, DragGAN and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
to enhance the latent space efficiency and controllability of GAN-generated
images. Style-GAN provides a structured latent space, DragGAN enables intuitive
image manipulation, and PCA reduces dimensionality and facilitates cross-model
alignment for more streamlined and interpretable exploration of latent spaces.
We apply our techniques to the Animal Faces High Quality (AFHQ) dataset, and
find that our approach of integrating PCA-based dimensionality reduction with
the Drag-GAN framework for image manipulation retains performance while
improving optimization efficiency. Notably, introducing PCA into the latent W+
layers of DragGAN can consistently reduce the total optimization time while
maintaining good visual quality and even boosting the Structural Similarity
Index Measure (SSIM) of the optimized image, particularly in shallower latent
spaces (W+ layers = 3). We also demonstrate capability for aligning images
generated by two StyleGAN models trained on similar but distinct data domains
(AFHQ-Dog and AFHQ-Cat), and show that we can control the latent space of these
aligned images to manipulate the images in an intuitive and interpretable
manner. Our findings highlight the possibility for efficient and interpretable
latent space control for a wide range of image synthesis and editing
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CapRL is a novel reinforcement learning framework for image captioning that uses vision-free LLMs to evaluate caption quality based on their ability to enable accurate question answering, overcoming limitations of supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SFT-based captioning models rely on expensive human-annotated data and tend to memorize specific answers rather than generating diverse, creative descriptions, limiting their generality.

Method: CapRL uses a two-stage pipeline: an LVLM generates captions, and a separate vision-free LLM evaluates them by answering multiple-choice questions based solely on the caption. The accuracy of these answers serves as the reward signal for reinforcement learning.

Result: CapRL significantly improves performance across 12 benchmarks. Pretraining on CapRL-5M dataset achieves performance comparable to Qwen2.5-VL-72B and exceeds baseline by average 8.4% in Prism Framework evaluation.

Conclusion: CapRL successfully applies RLVR to subjective image captioning by redefining caption quality through utility, demonstrating substantial improvements over SFT-based approaches while being more scalable and cost-effective.

Abstract: Image captioning is a fundamental task that bridges the visual and linguistic
domains, playing a critical role in pre-training Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs). Current state-of-the-art captioning models are typically trained with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), a paradigm that relies on expensive, non-scalable
data annotated by humans or proprietary models. This approach often leads to
models that memorize specific ground-truth answers, limiting their generality
and ability to generate diverse, creative descriptions. To overcome the
limitation of SFT, we propose applying the Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) paradigm to the open-ended task of image captioning.
A primary challenge, however, is designing an objective reward function for the
inherently subjective nature of what constitutes a "good" caption. We introduce
Captioning Reinforcement Learning (CapRL), a novel training framework that
redefines caption quality through its utility: a high-quality caption should
enable a non-visual language model to accurately answer questions about the
corresponding image. CapRL employs a decoupled two-stage pipeline where an LVLM
generates a caption, and the objective reward is derived from the accuracy of a
separate, vision-free LLM answering Multiple-Choice Questions based solely on
that caption. As the first study to apply RLVR to the subjective image
captioning task, we demonstrate that CapRL significantly enhances multiple
settings. Pretraining on the CapRL-5M caption dataset annotated by CapRL-3B
results in substantial gains across 12 benchmarks. Moreover, within the Prism
Framework for caption quality evaluation, CapRL achieves performance comparable
to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, while exceeding the baseline by an average margin of 8.4%.

Motivation: To develop an efficient document parsing model that can handle high-resolution inputs without computational overhead while maintaining accuracy for complex elements like dense text, formulas, and tables.

Method: Two-stage parsing strategy: 1) Layout analysis on downsampled images for structural elements, 2) Targeted content recognition on native-resolution crops guided by global layout. Uses comprehensive data engine for training corpus generation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing both general-purpose and domain-specific models across various recognition tasks with significantly lower computational overhead.

Conclusion: MinerU2.5 demonstrates strong document parsing ability with exceptional computational efficiency through its coarse-to-fine two-stage approach and comprehensive training data generation.

Abstract: We introduce MinerU2.5, a 1.2B-parameter document parsing vision-language
model that achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy while maintaining
exceptional computational efficiency. Our approach employs a coarse-to-fine,
two-stage parsing strategy that decouples global layout analysis from local
content recognition. In the first stage, the model performs efficient layout
analysis on downsampled images to identify structural elements, circumventing
the computational overhead of processing high-resolution inputs. In the second
stage, guided by the global layout, it performs targeted content recognition on
native-resolution crops extracted from the original image, preserving
fine-grained details in dense text, complex formulas, and tables. To support
this strategy, we developed a comprehensive data engine that generates diverse,
large-scale training corpora for both pretraining and fine-tuning. Ultimately,
MinerU2.5 demonstrates strong document parsing ability, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing both
general-purpose and domain-specific models across various recognition tasks,
while maintaining significantly lower computational overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs in remote sensing fail at complex analytical tasks due to end-to-end training that bypasses reasoning steps and produces unverifiable outputs.

Method: Two-stage alignment: supervised fine-tuning to instill cognitive architecture, then Group Reward Policy Optimization to refine reasoning policy; uses Geo-CoT380k dataset of structured rationales.

Result: RSThinker model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models across comprehensive tasks while providing verifiable analytical traces.

Conclusion: Geo-CoT framework enables structured, verifiable reasoning in Earth Observation, moving from opaque perception to transparent analysis.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing often fail at complex
analytical tasks, a limitation stemming from their end-to-end training paradigm
that bypasses crucial reasoning steps and leads to unverifiable outputs. To
address this limitation, we introduce the Perceptually-Grounded Geospatial

a verifiable, multi-step process. We instill this analytical process through a
two-stage alignment strategy, leveraging Geo-CoT380k, the first large-scale
dataset of structured Geo-CoT rationales. This strategy first employs
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill the foundational cognitive
architecture, then leverages Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine
the model's reasoning policy towards factual correctness. The resulting model,
RSThinker, outputs both a final answer and its justifying, verifiable
analytical trace. This capability yields dominant performance, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art models across a comprehensive range of tasks.
The public release of our Geo-CoT380k dataset and RSThinker model upon
publication serves as a concrete pathway from opaque perception towards
structured, verifiable reasoning for Earth Observation.

### [121] [UrbanFeel: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Temporal and Perceptual Understanding of City Scenes through Human Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22228)
*Jun He,Yi Lin,Zilong Huang,Jiacong Yin,Junyan Ye,Yuchuan Zhou,Weijia Li,Xiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UrbanFeel is a comprehensive benchmark with 14.3K visual questions across three dimensions to evaluate MLLMs' urban development understanding and subjective environmental perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for MLLMs in urban environments lack systematic exploration of temporal evolution and subjective perception aligned with human perception, despite urban development impacting over half the global population.

Method: Collected multi-temporal street-view images from 11 cities worldwide and generated question-answer pairs through spatial clustering, rule-based generation, model-assisted prompting, and manual annotation across three dimensions: Static Scene Perception, Temporal Change Understanding, and Subjective Environmental Perception.

Result: Gemini-2.5 Pro achieved best overall performance, approaching human expert levels with only 1.5% gap. Models perform well on scene understanding tasks (some surpass humans in pixel-level change detection) but struggle with temporal reasoning. Several models reach human-level consistency in subjective perception dimensions like beauty and safety.

Conclusion: MLLMs show strong capabilities in urban scene understanding and subjective perception, but temporal reasoning remains challenging. The UrbanFeel benchmark enables systematic evaluation of MLLMs' urban development understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Urban development impacts over half of the global population, making
human-centered understanding of its structural and perceptual changes essential
for sustainable development. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, existing benchmarks
that explore their performance in urban environments remain limited, lacking
systematic exploration of temporal evolution and subjective perception of urban
environment that aligns with human perception. To address these limitations, we
propose UrbanFeel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
performance of MLLMs in urban development understanding and subjective
environmental perception. UrbanFeel comprises 14.3K carefully constructed
visual questions spanning three cognitively progressive dimensions: Static
Scene Perception, Temporal Change Understanding, and Subjective Environmental
Perception. We collect multi-temporal single-view and panoramic street-view
images from 11 representative cities worldwide, and generate high-quality
question-answer pairs through a hybrid pipeline of spatial clustering,
rule-based generation, model-assisted prompting, and manual annotation. Through
extensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.5
Pro achieves the best overall performance, with its accuracy approaching human
expert levels and narrowing the average gap to just 1.5\%. Most models perform
well on tasks grounded in scene understanding. In particular, some models even
surpass human annotators in pixel-level change detection. However, performance
drops notably in tasks requiring temporal reasoning over urban development.
Additionally, in the subjective perception dimension, several models reach
human-level or even higher consistency in evaluating dimension such as
beautiful and safety.

*Jiaping Yu,Muli Yang,Jiapeng Ji,Jiexi Yan,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EXCL proposes a dual experts framework with retrieval-augmentation-interaction pipeline for source-free unsupervised domain adaptation, achieving state-of-the-art performance without accessing source data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy and cost concerns in domain adaptation by adapting source-trained models to target domains without accessing source data, overcoming limitations of existing methods that neglect complementary insights and latent structure.

Method: Dual Experts framework with frozen source-domain model (Conv-Adapter) and pretrained vision-language model (trainable text prompt), plus Retrieval-Augmented-Interaction pipeline for collaborative sample retrieval, separate expert fine-tuning, and learning consistency enforcement.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the approach matches state-of-the-art performance in source-free unsupervised domain adaptation.

Conclusion: EXCL effectively addresses SFUDA challenges by leveraging dual experts and retrieval-augmented interaction, providing a robust solution for domain adaptation without source data access.

Abstract: Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA) addresses the realistic
challenge of adapting a source-trained model to a target domain without access
to the source data, driven by concerns over privacy and cost. Existing SFUDA
methods either exploit only the source model's predictions or fine-tune large
multimodal models, yet both neglect complementary insights and the latent
structure of target data. In this paper, we propose the Experts Cooperative
Learning (EXCL). EXCL contains the Dual Experts framework and
Retrieval-Augmentation-Interaction optimization pipeline. The Dual Experts
framework places a frozen source-domain model (augmented with Conv-Adapter) and
a pretrained vision-language model (with a trainable text prompt) on equal
footing to mine consensus knowledge from unlabeled target samples. To
effectively train these plug-in modules under purely unsupervised conditions,
we introduce Retrieval-Augmented-Interaction(RAIN), a three-stage pipeline that
(1) collaboratively retrieves pseudo-source and complex target samples, (2)
separately fine-tunes each expert on its respective sample set, and (3)
enforces learning object consistency via a shared learning result. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach matches
state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: FlashEdit is a real-time image editing framework using diffusion models that achieves 150x speedup through one-step processing, background preservation, and localized attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-guided image editing with diffusion models has high latency that prevents real-world applications, creating a need for faster editing solutions.

Method: Uses three key innovations: One-Step Inversion-and-Editing pipeline, Background Shield technique for selective feature modification, and Sparsified Spatial Cross-Attention mechanism to prevent semantic leakage.

Result: Achieves edits in under 0.2 seconds with superior background consistency and structural integrity, representing over 150x speedup compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: FlashEdit enables high-fidelity, real-time image editing while maintaining quality, making diffusion-based editing practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Text-guided image editing with diffusion models has achieved remarkable
quality but suffers from prohibitive latency, hindering real-world
applications. We introduce FlashEdit, a novel framework designed to enable
high-fidelity, real-time image editing. Its efficiency stems from three key
innovations: (1) a One-Step Inversion-and-Editing (OSIE) pipeline that bypasses
costly iterative processes; (2) a Background Shield (BG-Shield) technique that
guarantees background preservation by selectively modifying features only
within the edit region; and (3) a Sparsified Spatial Cross-Attention (SSCA)
mechanism that ensures precise, localized edits by suppressing semantic leakage
to the background. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlashEdit maintains
superior background consistency and structural integrity, while performing
edits in under 0.2 seconds, which is an over 150$\times$ speedup compared to
prior multi-step methods. Our code will be made publicly available at

*Yujian Yuan,Changjie Wu,Xinyuan Chang,Sijin Wang,Hang Zhang,Shiyi Liang,Shuang Zeng,Mu Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniMapGen is a generative framework for large-scale map construction that represents lane lines as discrete sequences, supports multi-modal inputs (BEV, PV, text), and uses state update strategies to create complete, smooth maps while overcoming satellite data limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional map construction relies on costly special vehicles and labor-intensive processes. Satellite-based methods have efficiency advantages but suffer from data issues (occlusions, outdatedness) and produce rough, discontinuous roads requiring extensive post-processing.

Method: Represents lane lines as discrete sequences with iterative generation, supports multi-modal inputs (BEV, PV, text prompts) for flexibility, and implements state update strategies for global continuity and consistency in large-scale map construction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on OpenSatMap dataset, can infer occluded roads and predict missing roads from dataset annotations, and generates more complete and smooth map vectors than traditional perception-based methods.

Conclusion: UniMapGen provides an effective generative framework that overcomes satellite data limitations and inefficient vectorization issues, enabling efficient large-scale map construction with improved quality and coverage.

Abstract: Large-scale map construction is foundational for critical applications such
as autonomous driving and navigation systems. Traditional large-scale map
construction approaches mainly rely on costly and inefficient special data
collection vehicles and labor-intensive annotation processes. While existing
satellite-based methods have demonstrated promising potential in enhancing the
efficiency and coverage of map construction, they exhibit two major
limitations: (1) inherent drawbacks of satellite data (e.g., occlusions,
outdatedness) and (2) inefficient vectorization from perception-based methods,
resulting in discontinuous and rough roads that require extensive
post-processing. This paper presents a novel generative framework, UniMapGen,
for large-scale map construction, offering three key innovations: (1)
representing lane lines as \textbf{discrete sequence} and establishing an
iterative strategy to generate more complete and smooth map vectors than
traditional perception-based methods. (2) proposing a flexible architecture
that supports \textbf{multi-modal} inputs, enabling dynamic selection among
BEV, PV, and text prompt, to overcome the drawbacks of satellite data. (3)
developing a \textbf{state update} strategy for global continuity and
consistency of the constructed large-scale map. UniMapGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the OpenSatMap dataset. Furthermore, UniMapGen
can infer occluded roads and predict roads missing from dataset annotations.

*Dinh Minh Nguyen,Malte Avenhaus,Thomas Lindemeier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GS-2M is a unified framework that jointly performs mesh reconstruction and material decomposition from multi-view images using 3D Gaussian Splatting, eliminating the need for neural components through a novel roughness supervision strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods handle mesh reconstruction and material decomposition separately, struggle with reflective surfaces, and rely on external priors. Existing joint approaches use complex neural networks that limit scalability.

Method: Joint optimization of depth and normal attributes using 3D Gaussian Splatting, with a novel roughness supervision strategy based on multi-view photometric variation and carefully designed loss functions.

Result: Produces reconstruction results comparable to state-of-the-art methods, delivering triangle meshes and associated material components while being resilient to reflective surfaces.

Conclusion: GS-2M provides an effective unified solution that maintains geometric details, handles reflective surfaces well, and eliminates neural components for better scalability.

Abstract: We propose a unified solution for mesh reconstruction and material
decomposition from multi-view images based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, referred
to as GS-2M. Previous works handle these tasks separately and struggle to
reconstruct highly reflective surfaces, often relying on priors from external
models to enhance the decomposition results. Conversely, our method addresses
these two problems by jointly optimizing attributes relevant to the quality of
rendered depth and normals, maintaining geometric details while being resilient
to reflective surfaces. Although contemporary works effectively solve these
tasks together, they often employ sophisticated neural components to learn
scene properties, which hinders their performance at scale. To further
eliminate these neural components, we propose a novel roughness supervision
strategy based on multi-view photometric variation. When combined with a
carefully designed loss and optimization process, our unified framework
produces reconstruction results comparable to state-of-the-art methods,
delivering triangle meshes and their associated material components for
downstream tasks. We validate the effectiveness of our approach with widely
used datasets from previous works and qualitative comparisons with
state-of-the-art surface reconstruction methods.

*Michael Jungo,Andreas Fischer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rule-based reinforcement learning improves document image classification, showing better generalization to out-of-distribution data across images, classes, and modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the benefits of rule-based reinforcement learning in document analysis, particularly for enhanced reasoning capabilities and generalization, inspired by DeepSeek-R1's success.

Method: Applied rule-based reinforcement learning to document image classification, testing generalization in three scenarios: out-of-distribution images, unseen classes, and different modalities.

Result: Reinforcement learning demonstrated superior generalization capabilities compared to traditional methods in all three out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: Rule-based reinforcement learning is effective for document analysis tasks, offering improved generalization to diverse data distributions and modalities.

Abstract: Rule-based reinforcement learning has been gaining popularity ever since
DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated its success through simple verifiable rewards. In
the domain of document analysis, reinforcement learning is not as prevalent,
even though many downstream tasks may benefit from the emerging properties of
reinforcement learning, particularly the enhanced reason capabilities. We study
the effects of rule-based reinforcement learning with the task of Document
Image Classification which is one of the most commonly studied downstream tasks
in document analysis. We find that reinforcement learning tends to have better
generalisation capabilities to out-of-distritbution data, which we examine in
three different scenarios, namely out-of-distribution images, unseen classes
and different modalities. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VeloxSeg is a lightweight 3D medical image segmentation method that addresses the efficiency/robustness conflict through a dual-stream CNN-Transformer architecture with Paired Window Attention and Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma-guided convolution, achieving significant performance improvements and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the fundamental 'efficiency/robustness conflict' in lightweight 3D medical image segmentation, particularly when dealing with complex anatomical structures and heterogeneous modalities, by redesigning the framework based on high-dimensional 3D image characteristics.

Method: Uses a dual-stream CNN-Transformer architecture with Paired Window Attention (PWA) for multi-scale information retrieval and Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma-guided convolution (JLC) for robust local feature extraction. Implements 'glance-and-focus' principle, modal interaction for heterogeneous modalities, and Spatially Decoupled Knowledge Transfer (SDKT) via Gram matrices to inject texture priors.

Result: Achieves 26% Dice improvement on multimodal benchmarks, increases GPU throughput by 11x and CPU throughput by 48x compared to baselines.

Conclusion: VeloxSeg successfully addresses the efficiency/robustness trade-off in lightweight 3D medical image segmentation, providing substantial performance gains and computational efficiency without extra inference cost.

Abstract: Lightweight 3D medical image segmentation remains constrained by a
fundamental "efficiency / robustness conflict", particularly when processing
complex anatomical structures and heterogeneous modalities. In this paper, we
study how to redesign the framework based on the characteristics of
high-dimensional 3D images, and explore data synergy to overcome the fragile
representation of lightweight methods. Our approach, VeloxSeg, begins with a
deployable and extensible dual-stream CNN-Transformer architecture composed of
Paired Window Attention (PWA) and Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma-guided
convolution (JLC). For each 3D image, we invoke a "glance-and-focus" principle,
where PWA rapidly retrieves multi-scale information, and JLC ensures robust
local feature extraction with minimal parameters, significantly enhancing the
model's ability to operate with low computational budget. Followed by an
extension of the dual-stream architecture that incorporates modal interaction
into the multi-scale image-retrieval process, VeloxSeg efficiently models
heterogeneous modalities. Finally, Spatially Decoupled Knowledge Transfer
(SDKT) via Gram matrices injects the texture prior extracted by a
self-supervised network into the segmentation network, yielding stronger
representations than baselines at no extra inference cost. Experimental results
on multimodal benchmarks show that VeloxSeg achieves a 26% Dice improvement,
alongside increasing GPU throughput by 11x and CPU by 48x. Codes are available
at https://github.com/JinPLu/VeloxSeg.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of both neural-based and patch-based texture synthesis methods, particularly poor initialization and visual artifacts in patch-based approaches.

Method: Non-parametric flow-matching model built on non-local patch matching, combining diffusion model insights with classical patch optimization techniques without requiring neural network training.

Conclusion: NIFTY provides an effective hybrid approach that leverages strengths of both diffusion models and patch-based methods while avoiding their respective limitations.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of exemplar-based texture synthesis. We
introduce NIFTY, a hybrid framework that combines recent insights on diffusion
models trained with convolutional neural networks, and classical patch-based
texture optimization techniques. NIFTY is a non-parametric flow-matching model
built on non-local patch matching, which avoids the need for neural network
training while alleviating common shortcomings of patch-based methods, such as
poor initialization or visual artifacts. Experimental results demonstrate the

*Wangbo Zhao,Yizeng Han,Zhiwei Tang,Jiasheng Tang,Pengfei Zhou,Kai Wang,Bohan Zhuang,Zhangyang Wang,Fan Wang,Yang You*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAPID3 is a framework that enables 3x faster sampling for Diffusion Transformers without updating the base generator, using three lightweight policy heads trained via reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing acceleration methods for Diffusion Transformers use uniform heuristics that sacrifice quality, while dynamic neural networks require expensive fine-tuning. RAPID3 aims to provide per-image adaptive acceleration with zero generator updates.

Method: Uses three policy heads (Step-Skip, Cache-Reuse, Sparse-Attention) that observe denoising state and make independent speed-up decisions. Trained via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with frozen generator, augmented by an adversarial discriminator to prevent reward hacking.

Result: Achieves nearly 3x faster sampling across state-of-the-art DiT backbones (Stable Diffusion 3, FLUX) while maintaining competitive generation quality.

Conclusion: RAPID3 successfully enables image-wise adaptive acceleration for Diffusion Transformers without modifying the base generator, balancing speed and quality through reinforcement learning policies.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) excel at visual generation yet remain hampered
by slow sampling. Existing training-free accelerators - step reduction, feature
caching, and sparse attention - enhance inference speed but typically rely on a
uniform heuristic or a manually designed adaptive strategy for all images,
leaving quality on the table. Alternatively, dynamic neural networks offer
per-image adaptive acceleration, but their high fine-tuning costs limit broader
applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce RAPID3: Tri-Level
Reinforced Acceleration Policies for Diffusion Transformers, a framework that
delivers image-wise acceleration with zero updates to the base generator.
Specifically, three lightweight policy heads - Step-Skip, Cache-Reuse, and
Sparse-Attention - observe the current denoising state and independently decide
their corresponding speed-up at each timestep. All policy parameters are
trained online via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) while the
generator remains frozen. Meanwhile, an adversarially learned discriminator
augments the reward signal, discouraging reward hacking by boosting returns
only when generated samples stay close to the original model's distribution.
Across state-of-the-art DiT backbones, including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX,
RAPID3 achieves nearly 3x faster sampling with competitive generation quality.

TL;DR: CircuitSense is a benchmark for evaluating circuit understanding in MLLMs across hierarchical engineering design workflows, revealing major gaps in visual-to-mathematical reasoning despite strong performance on perception tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Engineering design requires hierarchical abstraction from system specifications to components, combining visual understanding with mathematical reasoning. While MLLMs excel at natural images, their ability to extract mathematical models from technical diagrams remains unexplored.

Method: Created CircuitSense benchmark with 8,006+ problems spanning component-level schematics to system-level block diagrams. Introduced hierarchical synthetic generation pipeline with grid-based schematic generator and block diagram generator with auto-derived symbolic equation labels. Evaluated six state-of-the-art MLLMs across Perception, Analysis, and Design tasks.

Result: Closed-source models achieved >85% accuracy on perception tasks (component recognition, topology identification) but <19% on symbolic derivation and analytical reasoning. Models with stronger symbolic reasoning capabilities consistently achieved higher design task accuracy.

Conclusion: There is a critical gap between visual parsing and symbolic reasoning in current MLLMs. Symbolic reasoning is identified as the key metric for engineering competence, with mathematical understanding being fundamental to circuit synthesis and design tasks.

Abstract: Engineering design operates through hierarchical abstraction from system
specifications to component implementations, requiring visual understanding
coupled with mathematical reasoning at each level. While Multi-modal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) excel at natural image tasks, their ability to extract
mathematical models from technical diagrams remains unexplored. We present
\textbf{CircuitSense}, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating circuit
understanding across this hierarchy through 8,006+ problems spanning
component-level schematics to system-level block diagrams. Our benchmark
uniquely examines the complete engineering workflow: Perception, Analysis, and
Design, with a particular emphasis on the critical but underexplored capability
of deriving symbolic equations from visual inputs. We introduce a hierarchical
synthetic generation pipeline consisting of a grid-based schematic generator
and a block diagram generator with auto-derived symbolic equation labels.
Comprehensive evaluation of six state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both
closed-source and open-source models, reveals fundamental limitations in
visual-to-mathematical reasoning. Closed-source models achieve over 85\%
accuracy on perception tasks involving component recognition and topology
identification, yet their performance on symbolic derivation and analytical
reasoning falls below 19\%, exposing a critical gap between visual parsing and
symbolic reasoning. Models with stronger symbolic reasoning capabilities
consistently achieve higher design task accuracy, confirming the fundamental
role of mathematical understanding in circuit synthesis and establishing
symbolic reasoning as the key metric for engineering competence.

Method: Proposes Hierarchical Extended Path Aggregation Network (HEPAN) for multi-scale feature fusion, plus lightweight modules (IRDCB and LDown) to reduce parameters/computational complexity, and a specialized small object detection head.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on VisDrone2019 benchmark through comparison experiments and ablation studies.

Conclusion: HierLight-YOLO effectively addresses the dual challenges of detecting small objects while maintaining real-time efficiency in drone-based detection scenarios.

Abstract: The real-time detection of small objects in complex scenes, such as the
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photography captured by drones, has dual
challenges of detecting small targets (<32 pixels) and maintaining real-time
efficiency on resource-constrained platforms. While YOLO-series detectors have
achieved remarkable success in real-time large object detection, they suffer
from significantly higher false negative rates for drone-based detection where
small objects dominate, compared to large object scenarios. This paper proposes
HierLight-YOLO, a hierarchical feature fusion and lightweight model that
enhances the real-time detection of small objects, based on the YOLOv8
architecture. We propose the Hierarchical Extended Path Aggregation Network
(HEPAN), a multi-scale feature fusion method through hierarchical cross-level
connections, enhancing the small object detection accuracy. HierLight-YOLO
includes two innovative lightweight modules: Inverted Residual Depthwise
Convolution Block (IRDCB) and Lightweight Downsample (LDown) module, which
significantly reduce the model's parameters and computational complexity
without sacrificing detection capabilities. Small object detection head is
designed to further enhance spatial resolution and feature fusion to tackle the
tiny object (4 pixels) detection. Comparison experiments and ablation studies
on the VisDrone2019 benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of
HierLight-YOLO.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using GPT-4 with specialized prompts to predict occlusion order relationships between objects in images, achieving zero-shot performance without training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Occlusion poses a major challenge for vision models in interpreting complex real-world scenes, requiring robust methods to predict object occlusion order.

Method: Leverage pre-trained GPT-4 with designed prompts to analyze images and generate occlusion order predictions, then parse responses to construct occlusion matrices.

Result: Evaluation on COCOA and InstaOrder datasets shows improved accuracy by using semantic context, visual patterns, and commonsense knowledge compared to baselines.

Conclusion: GPT-4 enables zero-shot occlusion reasoning without annotated training data, making it easily integrable into existing occlusion handling frameworks.

Abstract: Occlusion remains a significant challenge for current vision models to
robustly interpret complex and dense real-world images and scenes. To address
this limitation and to enable accurate prediction of the occlusion order
relationship between objects, we propose leveraging the advanced capability of
a pre-trained GPT-4 model to deduce the order. By providing a specifically
designed prompt along with the input image, GPT-4 can analyze the image and
generate order predictions. The response can then be parsed to construct an
occlusion matrix which can be utilized in assisting with other occlusion
handling tasks and image understanding. We report the results of evaluating the
model on COCOA and InstaOrder datasets. The results show that by using semantic
context, visual patterns, and commonsense knowledge, the model can produce more
accurate order predictions. Unlike baseline methods, the model can reason about
occlusion relationships in a zero-shot fashion, which requires no annotated
training data and can easily be integrated into occlusion handling frameworks.

*Haoyu Li,XiaoSong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-focus image fusion method that enhances boundary quality through gradient-domain modeling and Tenengrad gradient detection to preserve sharp focus-defocus transitions and focused details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-focus image fusion methods struggle to preserve sharp focus-defocus boundaries, often resulting in blurred transitions and loss of focused details, which limits their effectiveness in applications like surveillance, microscopy, and computational photography.

Method: The method uses a gradient-domain-based model to obtain initial fusion results with complete boundaries, Tenengrad gradient detection to extract salient features and generate saliency maps, and a focus metric based on gradient and complementary information for boundary refinement.

Result: Extensive experiments on four public datasets show the method consistently outperforms 12 state-of-the-art methods in both subjective and objective evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed boundary enhancement approach effectively generates high-quality fused boundaries while preserving focus information, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) aims to yield an all-focused image from
multiple partially focused inputs, which is crucial in applications cover
sur-veillance, microscopy, and computational photography. However, existing
methods struggle to preserve sharp focus-defocus boundaries, often resulting in
blurred transitions and focused details loss. To solve this problem, we propose
a MFIF method based on significant boundary enhancement, which generates
high-quality fused boundaries while effectively detecting focus in-formation.
Particularly, we propose a gradient-domain-based model that can obtain initial
fusion results with complete boundaries and effectively pre-serve the boundary
details. Additionally, we introduce Tenengrad gradient detection to extract
salient features from both the source images and the ini-tial fused image,
generating the corresponding saliency maps. For boundary refinement, we develop

### [135] [Text Adversarial Attacks with Dynamic Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22393)
*Wenqiang Wang,Siyuan Liang,Xiao Yan,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TDOA is a text adversarial attack method that handles dynamic output scenarios using clustering-based surrogate training and farthest-label targeting, achieving up to 50.81% attack success rate with single queries and extending to generative tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text adversarial attack methods are designed for static scenarios with fixed label spaces, creating a gap for dynamic-output scenarios where the number of output labels and label space can change.

Method: Uses clustering-based surrogate model training to convert dynamic-output scenarios into static single-output scenarios, and employs farthest-label targeted attack strategy to select adversarial vectors that deviate most from model's coarse-grained labels.

Result: Achieves maximum attack success rate of 50.81% with single query per text on dynamic scenarios, and 82.68% on static scenarios. Also extends to generative tasks, surpassing prior results by up to 0.64 RDBLEU and 0.62 RDchrF.

Conclusion: TDOA effectively addresses dynamic-output text adversarial attacks, demonstrates strong performance in compromising large language models with limited access, and shows versatility by extending to generative settings with improved results.

Abstract: Text adversarial attack methods are typically designed for static scenarios
with fixed numbers of output labels and a predefined label space, relying on
extensive querying of the victim model (query-based attacks) or the surrogate
model (transfer-based attacks). To address this gap, we introduce the Textual
Dynamic Outputs Attack (TDOA) method, which employs a clustering-based
surrogate model training approach to convert the dynamic-output scenario into a
static single-output scenario. To improve attack effectiveness, we propose the
farthest-label targeted attack strategy, which selects adversarial vectors that
deviate most from the model's coarse-grained labels, thereby maximizing
disruption. We extensively evaluate TDOA on four datasets and eight victim
models (e.g., ChatGPT-4o, ChatGPT-4.1), showing its effectiveness in crafting
adversarial examples and its strong potential to compromise large language
models with limited access. With a single query per text, TDOA achieves a
maximum attack success rate of 50.81\%. Additionally, we find that TDOA also
achieves state-of-the-art performance in conventional static output scenarios,
reaching a maximum ASR of 82.68\%. Meanwhile, by conceptualizing translation
tasks as classification problems with unbounded output spaces, we extend the
TDOA framework to generative settings, surpassing prior results by up to 0.64
RDBLEU and 0.62 RDchrF.

### [136] [Integrating Background Knowledge in Medical Semantic Segmentation with Logic Tensor Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22399)
*Luca Bergamin,Giovanna Maria Dimitri,Fabio Aiolli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs) to incorporate medical background knowledge via first-order logic rules into semantic segmentation models, showing improved performance especially with limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning systems for medical semantic segmentation are not yet perfected, and performance can be improved by incorporating common medical knowledge into the model's loss function.

Method: Introduce Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs) to encode medical background knowledge using first-order logic rules, applied in an end-to-end framework with SwinUNETR for semantic segmentation of hippocampus in brain MRI scans.

Result: LTNs improve baseline segmentation performance, especially when training data is scarce, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating medical knowledge constraints.

Conclusion: Despite being preliminary, neurosymbolic methods like LTNs are general enough to be adapted and applied to other medical semantic segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image analysis, aiding
medical decision-making by helping radiologists distinguish objects in an
image. Research in this field has been driven by deep learning applications,
which have the potential to scale these systems even in the presence of noise
and artifacts. However, these systems are not yet perfected. We argue that
performance can be improved by incorporating common medical knowledge into the
segmentation model's loss function. To this end, we introduce Logic Tensor
Networks (LTNs) to encode medical background knowledge using first-order logic
(FOL) rules. The encoded rules span from constraints on the shape of the
produced segmentation, to relationships between different segmented areas. We
apply LTNs in an end-to-end framework with a SwinUNETR for semantic
segmentation. We evaluate our method on the task of segmenting the hippocampus
in brain MRI scans. Our experiments show that LTNs improve the baseline
segmentation performance, especially when training data is scarce. Despite
being in its preliminary stages, we argue that neurosymbolic methods are
general enough to be adapted and applied to other medical semantic segmentation
tasks.

*Xinhao Zhong,Yimin Zhou,Zhiqi Zhang,Junhao Li,Yi Sun,Bin Chen,Shu-Tao Xia,Ke Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VARE framework enables stable concept erasure in visual autoregressive models using auxiliary visual tokens to reduce fine-tuning intensity, while S-VARE incorporates filtered cross entropy loss and preservation loss for precise unsafe token adjustment and semantic fidelity maintenance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept erasure techniques designed for diffusion models fail to generalize to visual autoregressive (VAR) models due to their next-scale token prediction paradigm, creating safety gaps in text-to-image generation.

Method: Proposed VARE framework leverages auxiliary visual tokens to reduce fine-tuning intensity, and S-VARE method incorporates filtered cross entropy loss to identify/adjust unsafe visual tokens and preservation loss to maintain semantic fidelity.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate surgical concept erasure while preserving generation quality, addressing issues like language drift and reduced diversity from naive fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The approach successfully closes the safety gap in autoregressive text-to-image generation that earlier methods failed to address.

Abstract: The rapid progress of visual autoregressive (VAR) models has brought new
opportunities for text-to-image generation, but also heightened safety
concerns. Existing concept erasure techniques, primarily designed for diffusion
models, fail to generalize to VARs due to their next-scale token prediction
paradigm. In this paper, we first propose a novel VAR Erasure framework VARE
that enables stable concept erasure in VAR models by leveraging auxiliary
visual tokens to reduce fine-tuning intensity. Building upon this, we introduce
S-VARE, a novel and effective concept erasure method designed for VAR, which
incorporates a filtered cross entropy loss to precisely identify and minimally
adjust unsafe visual tokens, along with a preservation loss to maintain
semantic fidelity, addressing the issues such as language drift and reduced
diversity introduce by na\"ive fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves surgical concept erasure while preserving generation
quality, thereby closing the safety gap in autoregressive text-to-image
generation by earlier methods.

*Hossein Kashiani,Niloufar Alipour Talemi,Fatemeh Afghah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreqDebias is a frequency debiasing framework that addresses spectral bias in deepfake detectors through Forgery Mixup augmentation and dual consistency regularization, significantly improving cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake detectors often fail to generalize to novel forgery types due to spectral bias - over-reliance on specific frequency bands learned from limited training data, which restricts their generalization capability.

Method: Proposes FreqDebias framework with two strategies: 1) Forgery Mixup (Fo-Mixup) augmentation to diversify frequency characteristics, and 2) dual consistency regularization using class activation maps for local consistency and von Mises-Fisher distribution on hyperspherical embedding space for global consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments show FreqDebias significantly enhances cross-domain generalization and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both cross-domain and in-domain settings.

Conclusion: The proposed frequency debiasing framework effectively mitigates spectral bias in deepfake detectors, leading to improved generalization across different forgery types and domains.

Abstract: Deepfake detectors often struggle to generalize to novel forgery types due to
biases learned from limited training data. In this paper, we identify a new
type of model bias in the frequency domain, termed spectral bias, where
detectors overly rely on specific frequency bands, restricting their ability to
generalize across unseen forgeries. To address this, we propose FreqDebias, a
frequency debiasing framework that mitigates spectral bias through two
complementary strategies. First, we introduce a novel Forgery Mixup (Fo-Mixup)
augmentation, which dynamically diversifies frequency characteristics of
training samples. Second, we incorporate a dual consistency regularization
(CR), which enforces both local consistency using class activation maps (CAMs)
and global consistency through a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution on a
hyperspherical embedding space. This dual CR mitigates over-reliance on certain
frequency components by promoting consistent representation learning under both
local and global supervision. Extensive experiments show that FreqDebias
significantly enhances cross-domain generalization and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both cross-domain and in-domain settings.

*Song Fei,Tian Ye,Lujia Wang,Lei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LucidFlux is a caption-free universal image restoration framework that adapts Flux.1 diffusion transformer without needing image captions, using a dual-branch conditioner and adaptive modulation to preserve structure while recovering texture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing universal image restoration methods often oversmooth, hallucinate, or drift when dealing with unknown degradation mixtures, and typically rely on image captions which introduce latency and instability.

Method: Uses lightweight dual-branch conditioner to inject degraded input and lightly restored proxy signals; employs timestep- and layer-adaptive modulation schedule; enforces caption-free semantic alignment via SigLIP features; implements scalable curation pipeline for structure-rich supervision.

Result: Consistently outperforms strong open-source and commercial baselines across synthetic and in-the-wild benchmarks; ablation studies verify necessity of each component.

Conclusion: For large diffusion transformers, the key to robust caption-free universal image restoration is determining when, where, and what to condition on, rather than adding parameters or relying on text prompts.

Abstract: Universal image restoration (UIR) aims to recover images degraded by unknown
mixtures while preserving semantics -- conditions under which discriminative
restorers and UNet-based diffusion priors often oversmooth, hallucinate, or
drift. We present LucidFlux, a caption-free UIR framework that adapts a large
diffusion transformer (Flux.1) without image captions. LucidFlux introduces a
lightweight dual-branch conditioner that injects signals from the degraded
input and a lightly restored proxy to respectively anchor geometry and suppress
artifacts. Then, a timestep- and layer-adaptive modulation schedule is designed
to route these cues across the backbone's hierarchy, in order to yield
coarse-to-fine and context-aware updates that protect the global structure
while recovering texture. After that, to avoid the latency and instability of
text prompts or MLLM captions, we enforce caption-free semantic alignment via
SigLIP features extracted from the proxy. A scalable curation pipeline further
filters large-scale data for structure-rich supervision. Across synthetic and
in-the-wild benchmarks, LucidFlux consistently outperforms strong open-source
and commercial baselines, and ablation studies verify the necessity of each
component. LucidFlux shows that, for large DiTs, when, where, and what to
condition on -- rather than adding parameters or relying on text prompts -- is
the governing lever for robust and caption-free universal image restoration in
the wild.

*Bohan Huang,Qianyun Bao,Haoyuan Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: U-MAN enhances medical image segmentation by replacing U-Net's simple skip connections with attention-based feature fusion and adding multi-scale adaptive processing using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, achieving superior boundary accuracy and detail preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional U-Net architectures struggle with preserving fine-grained details and precise boundaries in medical images due to semantic gaps in skip connections and lack of multi-scale feature extraction in deep layers.

Method: Proposed U-MAN architecture with two modules: Progressive Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (PAGF) replaces simple skip connections using attention mechanisms, and Multi-scale Adaptive KAN (MAN) enables adaptive multi-scale feature processing.

Result: Experiments on BUSI, GLAS, and CVC datasets show U-MAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in defining accurate boundaries and preserving fine details.

Conclusion: U-MAN effectively addresses U-Net limitations through attention-based feature fusion and multi-scale adaptive processing, demonstrating superior performance in medical image segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation faces significant challenges in preserving
fine-grained details and precise boundaries due to complex anatomical
structures and pathological regions. These challenges primarily stem from two
key limitations of conventional U-Net architectures: (1) their simple skip
connections ignore the encoder-decoder semantic gap between various features,
and (2) they lack the capability for multi-scale feature extraction in deep
layers. To address these challenges, we propose the U-Net with Multi-scale
Adaptive KAN (U-MAN), a novel architecture that enhances the emerging
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with two specialized modules: Progressive
Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (PAGF) and the Multi-scale Adaptive KAN (MAN).
Our PAGF module replaces the simple skip connection, using attention to fuse
features from the encoder and decoder. The MAN module enables the network to
adaptively process features at multiple scales, improving its ability to
segment objects of various sizes. Experiments on three public datasets (BUSI,
GLAS, and CVC) show that U-MAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
particularly in defining accurate boundaries and preserving fine details.

### [141] [$γ$-Quant: Towards Learnable Quantization for Low-bit Pattern Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22448)
*Mishal Fatima,Shashank Agnihotri,Marius Bock,Kanchana Vaishnavi Gandikota,Kristof Van Laerhoven,Michael Moeller,Margret Keuper*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes γ-Quant, a method for learning task-specific non-linear quantization that enables pattern recognition models to work effectively with low-bit-depth data (as few as 4 bits) while maintaining performance comparable to using higher-bit data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pattern recognition models use pre-processed data optimized for human perception (e.g., ISP-processed RGB images, normalized floating-point sensor data), which is inefficient for automated systems and energy-constrained devices. There's a need for more efficient data representation that maintains performance while reducing bandwidth and energy consumption.

Method: The authors propose γ-Quant, which learns a non-linear quantization specifically for pattern recognition tasks. The approach is demonstrated on raw-image object detection and human activity recognition (HAR) from wearable sensor data, using learnable quantization with as few as 4 bits.

Result: The method shows that raw data with learnable quantization using only 4 bits can perform on par with using raw 12-bit data, achieving comparable performance while significantly reducing data requirements.

Conclusion: Task-specific learned quantization enables efficient pattern recognition in low-bandwidth and energy-constrained settings, allowing models to work effectively with low-bit-depth data without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Most pattern recognition models are developed on pre-proce\-ssed data. In
computer vision, for instance, RGB images processed through image signal
processing (ISP) pipelines designed to cater to human perception are the most
frequent input to image analysis networks. However, many modern vision tasks
operate without a human in the loop, raising the question of whether such
pre-processing is optimal for automated analysis. Similarly, human activity
recognition (HAR) on body-worn sensor data commonly takes normalized
floating-point data arising from a high-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC)
as an input, despite such an approach being highly inefficient in terms of data
transmission, significantly affecting the battery life of wearable devices. In
this work, we target low-bandwidth and energy-constrained settings where
sensors are limited to low-bit-depth capture. We propose $\gamma$-Quant,
i.e.~the task-specific learning of a non-linear quantization for pattern
recognition. We exemplify our approach on raw-image object detection as well as
HAR of wearable data, and demonstrate that raw data with a learnable
quantization using as few as 4-bits can perform on par with the use of raw
12-bit data. All code to reproduce our experiments is publicly available via

### [142] [SSVIF: Self-Supervised Segmentation-Oriented Visible and Infrared Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22450)
*Zixian Zhao,Xingchen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes SSVIF, a self-supervised framework for segmentation-oriented visible-infrared image fusion that eliminates the need for segmentation labels by leveraging consistency between feature-level and pixel-level fusion-based segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Application-oriented VIF methods require expensive labeled datasets for downstream tasks like segmentation. This paper aims to develop a self-supervised approach that achieves similar performance without segmentation supervision.

Method: Uses cross-segmentation consistency between feature-level and pixel-level fusion-based segmentation as self-supervised task. Implements two-stage training strategy with dynamic weight adjustment for effective joint learning.

Result: Extensive experiments show SSVIF outperforms traditional VIF methods and rivals supervised segmentation-oriented methods, despite being trained only on unlabeled visible-infrared image pairs.

Conclusion: The proposed self-supervised framework successfully enables segmentation-oriented VIF without requiring segmentation labels, making it more practical and cost-effective while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) has gained significant attention in
recent years due to its wide application in tasks such as scene segmentation
and object detection. VIF methods can be broadly classified into traditional
VIF methods and application-oriented VIF methods. Traditional methods focus
solely on improving the quality of fused images, while application-oriented VIF
methods additionally consider the performance of downstream tasks on fused
images by introducing task-specific loss terms during training. However,
compared to traditional methods, application-oriented VIF methods require
datasets labeled for downstream tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation or object
detection), making data acquisition labor-intensive and time-consuming. To
address this issue, we propose a self-supervised training framework for
segmentation-oriented VIF methods (SSVIF). Leveraging the consistency between
feature-level fusion-based segmentation and pixel-level fusion-based
segmentation, we introduce a novel self-supervised task-cross-segmentation
consistency-that enables the fusion model to learn high-level semantic features
without the supervision of segmentation labels. Additionally, we design a
two-stage training strategy and a dynamic weight adjustment method for
effective joint learning within our self-supervised framework. Extensive
experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
SSVIF. Remarkably, although trained only on unlabeled visible-infrared image
pairs, our SSVIF outperforms traditional VIF methods and rivals supervised
segmentation-oriented ones. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

*Chen Li,Meilong Xu,Xiaoling Hu,Weimin Lyu,Chao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes B\'ezier Meets Diffusion framework for cross-domain medical image generation using B\'ezier-curve style transfer and conditional diffusion models to improve segmentation across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training robust learning algorithms across different medical imaging modalities is challenging due to large domain gaps. Existing GAN-based style transfer methods struggle with high variability regions.

Method: Uses B\'ezier-curve style transfer to reduce domain gap, trains segmentation model on transferred images, generates pseudo-labels, then trains conditional diffusion model with uncertainty-guided score matching to synthesize labeled target-domain images.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach generates realistic labeled images, significantly augments target domain, and improves segmentation performance on public datasets.

Conclusion: The unified framework effectively addresses cross-domain medical image generation challenges and enhances segmentation robustness across different imaging modalities.

Abstract: Training robust learning algorithms across different medical imaging
modalities is challenging due to the large domain gap. Unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) mitigates this problem by using annotated images from the
source domain and unlabeled images from the target domain to train the deep
models. Existing approaches often rely on GAN-based style transfer, but these
methods struggle to capture cross-domain mappings in regions with high
variability. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, B\'ezier Meets
Diffusion, for cross-domain image generation. First, we introduce a
B\'ezier-curve-based style transfer strategy that effectively reduces the
domain gap between source and target domains. The transferred source images
enable the training of a more robust segmentation model across domains.
Thereafter, using pseudo-labels generated by this segmentation model on the
target domain, we train a conditional diffusion model (CDM) to synthesize
high-quality, labeled target-domain images. To mitigate the impact of noisy
pseudo-labels, we further develop an uncertainty-guided score matching method
that improves the robustness of CDM training. Extensive experiments on public
datasets demonstrate that our approach generates realistic labeled images,
significantly augmenting the target domain and improving segmentation
performance.

### [144] [PSTTS: A Plug-and-Play Token Selector for Efficient Event-based Spatio-temporal Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22481)
*Xiangmo Zhao,Nan Yang,Yang Wang,Zhanwen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSTTS is a plug-and-play module that reduces computational overhead in event-based vision by identifying and removing spatio-temporal redundant tokens from event frame sequences, achieving significant efficiency improvements without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing event-based methods convert event streams into event frame sequences but neglect their high spatial sparsity and inter-frame motion redundancy, leading to unnecessary computational costs. Current token sparsification methods designed for RGB videos are ineffective for event data due to unreliable intermediate representations and event noise.

Method: PSTTS consists of two stages: Spatial Token Purification (removes noise and non-event regions by assessing spatio-temporal consistency) and Temporal Token Selection (identifies redundant temporal information by evaluating motion pattern similarity between adjacent frames). The method leverages raw event data characteristics without adding parameters.

Result: Applied to four backbones (UniformerV2, VideoSwin, EVMamba, ExACT) on three datasets (HARDVS, DailyDVS-200, SeACT), PSTTS achieved 29-43.6% FLOPs reduction and 21.6-41.3% FPS increase on DailyDVS-200 while maintaining task accuracy.

Conclusion: PSTTS effectively addresses spatio-temporal redundancy in event data, providing an optimal accuracy-efficiency trade-off through progressive token selection that leverages inherent event distribution characteristics.

Abstract: Mainstream event-based spatio-temporal representation learning methods
typically process event streams by converting them into sequences of event
frames, achieving remarkable performance. However, they neglect the high
spatial sparsity and inter-frame motion redundancy inherent in event frame
sequences, leading to significant computational overhead. Existing token
sparsification methods for RGB videos rely on unreliable intermediate token
representations and neglect the influence of event noise, making them
ineffective for direct application to event data. In this paper, we propose
Progressive Spatio-Temporal Token Selection (PSTTS), a Plug-and-Play module for
event data without introducing any additional parameters. PSTTS exploits the
spatio-temporal distribution characteristics embedded in raw event data to
effectively identify and discard spatio-temporal redundant tokens, achieving an
optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, PSTTS consists
of two stages, Spatial Token Purification and Temporal Token Selection. Spatial
Token Purification discards noise and non-event regions by assessing the
spatio-temporal consistency of events within each event frame to prevent
interference with subsequent temporal redundancy evaluation. Temporal Token
Selection evaluates the motion pattern similarity between adjacent event
frames, precisely identifying and removing redundant temporal information. We
apply PSTTS to four representative backbones UniformerV2, VideoSwin, EVMamba,
and ExACT on the HARDVS, DailyDVS-200, and SeACT datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that PSTTS achieves significant efficiency improvements.
Specifically, PSTTS reduces FLOPs by 29-43.6% and increases FPS by 21.6-41.3%
on the DailyDVS-200 dataset, while maintaining task accuracy. Our code will be
available.

*Guohui Zhang,Hu Yu,Xiaoxiao Ma,JingHao Zhang,Yaning Pan,Mingde Yao,Jie Xiao,Linjiang Huang,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GCPO is a novel method that identifies critical tokens in autoregressive visual generation and implements token-wise policy optimization, achieving better performance using only 30% of image tokens compared to full-token approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods apply uniform optimization across all image tokens, ignoring the varying contributions of different tokens. The key challenge is identifying and effectively optimizing critical tokens during AR generation.

Method: GCPO identifies critical tokens from three perspectives: causal dependency (early tokens determine later ones), entropy-induced spatial structure (high entropy gradient tokens), and RLVR-focused token diversity (low visual similarity tokens). It introduces dynamic token-wise advantage weights based on confidence divergence between policy and reference models.

Result: GCPO achieves better performance than GRPO with full tokens while using only 30% of image tokens. Extensive experiments on multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate effectiveness for both AR models and unified multimodal models.

Conclusion: GCPO successfully addresses the challenge of identifying and optimizing critical tokens in RLVR-based AR visual generation, providing more efficient and effective training through targeted token-wise optimization.

Abstract: Recent studies have extended Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) to autoregressive (AR) visual generation and achieved promising
progress. However, existing methods typically apply uniform optimization across
all image tokens, while the varying contributions of different image tokens for
RLVR's training remain unexplored. In fact, the key obstacle lies in how to
identify more critical image tokens during AR generation and implement
effective token-wise optimization for them. To tackle this challenge, we
propose $\textbf{G}$roup $\textbf{C}$ritical-token $\textbf{P}$olicy
$\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{GCPO}$), which facilitates effective policy
optimization on critical tokens. We identify the critical tokens in RLVR-based
AR generation from three perspectives, specifically: $\textbf{(1)}$ Causal
dependency: early tokens fundamentally determine the later tokens and final
image effect due to unidirectional dependency; $\textbf{(2)}$ Entropy-induced
spatial structure: tokens with high entropy gradients correspond to image
structure and bridges distinct visual regions; $\textbf{(3)}$ RLVR-focused
token diversity: tokens with low visual similarity across a group of sampled
images contribute to richer token-level diversity. For these identified
critical tokens, we further introduce a dynamic token-wise advantage weight to
encourage exploration, based on confidence divergence between the policy model
and reference model. By leveraging 30\% of the image tokens, GCPO achieves
better performance than GRPO with full tokens. Extensive experiments on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks for both AR models and unified multimodal
models demonstrate the effectiveness of GCPO for AR visual generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EAGLE is a lightweight black-box framework that explains token generation in multimodal LLMs by attributing tokens to compact perceptual regions and quantifying language vs. visual influence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack understanding of how generated tokens depend on visual modalities, limiting interpretability and reliability.

Method: Uses an objective function unifying sufficiency and indispensability scores, optimized via greedy search over sparsified image regions for efficient attribution.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in faithfulness, localization, and hallucination diagnosis while requiring substantially less GPU memory.

Conclusion: EAGLE effectively advances MLLM interpretability through fine-grained modality-aware analysis and practical efficiency.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in aligning visual inputs with natural language outputs. Yet, the
extent to which generated tokens depend on visual modalities remains poorly
understood, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this work, we present
EAGLE, a lightweight black-box framework for explaining autoregressive token
generation in MLLMs. EAGLE attributes any selected tokens to compact perceptual
regions while quantifying the relative influence of language priors and
perceptual evidence. The framework introduces an objective function that
unifies sufficiency (insight score) and indispensability (necessity score),
optimized via greedy search over sparsified image regions for faithful and
efficient attribution. Beyond spatial attribution, EAGLE performs
modality-aware analysis that disentangles what tokens rely on, providing
fine-grained interpretability of model decisions. Extensive experiments across
open-source MLLMs show that EAGLE consistently outperforms existing methods in
faithfulness, localization, and hallucination diagnosis, while requiring
substantially less GPU memory. These results highlight its effectiveness and
practicality for advancing the interpretability of MLLMs. The code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents the first systematic evaluation of color naming capabilities in vision-language models (VLMs), showing they perform well on prototypical colors but struggle with non-prototypical ones, with significant cross-linguistic imbalances favoring English and Chinese.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding whether VLMs name colors like humans is crucial for effective human-AI interaction, as color is a fundamental dimension of visual perception and communication.

Method: Replicated classic color naming methodologies using 957 color samples across five representative VLMs, conducted cross-linguistic analysis across nine languages, and performed ablation studies to examine architectural influences.

Result: VLMs achieve high accuracy on prototypical colors but performance drops significantly on expanded, non-prototypical color sets. Models identified 21 common color terms consistently, with two distinct approaches: constrained (basic terms) vs expansive (lightness modifiers). Cross-linguistic analysis revealed severe training imbalances favoring English and Chinese, with hue as primary driver of color naming decisions.

Conclusion: Language model architecture significantly influences color naming independent of visual processing capabilities, highlighting the need for more balanced training and better understanding of how VLMs process color information.

Abstract: Color serves as a fundamental dimension of human visual perception and a
primary means of communicating about objects and scenes. As vision-language
models (VLMs) become increasingly prevalent, understanding whether they name
colors like humans is crucial for effective human-AI interaction. We present
the first systematic evaluation of color naming capabilities across VLMs,
replicating classic color naming methodologies using 957 color samples across
five representative models. Our results show that while VLMs achieve high
accuracy on prototypical colors from classical studies, performance drops
significantly on expanded, non-prototypical color sets. We identify 21 common
color terms that consistently emerge across all models, revealing two distinct
approaches: constrained models using predominantly basic terms versus expansive
models employing systematic lightness modifiers. Cross-linguistic analysis
across nine languages demonstrates severe training imbalances favoring English
and Chinese, with hue serving as the primary driver of color naming decisions.
Finally, ablation studies reveal that language model architecture significantly
influences color naming independent of visual processing capabilities.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to or better than state-of-the-art models with significantly reduced computational resources.

Conclusion: EfficientDepth successfully addresses the limitations of existing MDE methods by providing geometrically consistent, detailed depth estimation while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for edge devices.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) plays a pivotal role in various computer
vision applications, such as robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous
driving. Despite recent advancements, existing methods often fail to meet key
requirements for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis, including geometric
consistency, fine details, robustness to real-world challenges like reflective
surfaces, and efficiency for edge devices. To address these challenges, we
introduce a novel MDE system, called EfficientDepth, which combines a
transformer architecture with a lightweight convolutional decoder, as well as a
bimodal density head that allows the network to estimate detailed depth maps.
We train our model on a combination of labeled synthetic and real images, as
well as pseudo-labeled real images, generated using a high-performing MDE
method. Furthermore, we employ a multi-stage optimization strategy to improve
training efficiency and produce models that emphasize geometric consistency and
fine detail. Finally, in addition to commonly used objectives, we introduce a
loss function based on LPIPS to encourage the network to produce detailed depth
maps. Experimental results demonstrate that EfficientDepth achieves performance
comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-art models, with
significantly reduced computational resources.

*Zhenqi He,Yuanpei Liu,Kai Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper is a comprehensive survey on category discovery (CD), an open-world learning task that automatically categorizes unlabeled data from unseen classes using labeled data from seen classes. It reviews literature, analyzes methods across different settings, benchmarks approaches, and discusses future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Category discovery has emerged as an important open-world learning task with significant attention in recent years, but lacks a systematic review and analysis of the diverse methods and settings developed across the literature.

Method: The survey introduces a taxonomy with base settings (NCD and GCD) and derived settings for real-world scenarios, analyzes methods across three fundamental components (representation learning, label assignment, class number estimation), and benchmarks all approaches to distill key insights.

Result: Key findings show that large-scale pretrained backbones, hierarchical and auxiliary cues, and curriculum-style training benefit category discovery, while challenges remain in label assignment design, class number estimation, and scaling to complex multi-object scenarios.

Conclusion: The survey provides a living resource for the category discovery community, identifies current limitations, and points to promising future research directions including improved label assignment strategies, better class number estimation, and handling complex multi-object scenarios.

Abstract: Category discovery (CD) is an emerging open-world learning task, which aims
at automatically categorizing unlabelled data containing instances from unseen
classes, given some labelled data from seen classes. This task has attracted
significant attention over the years and leads to a rich body of literature
trying to address the problem from different perspectives. In this survey, we
provide a comprehensive review of the literature, and offer detailed analysis
and in-depth discussion on different methods. Firstly, we introduce a taxonomy
for the literature by considering two base settings, namely novel category
discovery (NCD) and generalized category discovery (GCD), and several derived
settings that are designed to address the extra challenges in different
real-world application scenarios, including continual category discovery,
skewed data distribution, federated category discovery, etc. Secondly, for each
setting, we offer a detailed analysis of the methods encompassing three
fundamental components, representation learning, label assignment, and
estimation of class number. Thirdly, we benchmark all the methods and distill
key insights showing that large-scale pretrained backbones, hierarchical and
auxiliary cues, and curriculum-style training are all beneficial for category
discovery, while challenges remain in the design of label assignment, the
estimation of class numbers, and scaling to complex multi-object
scenarios.Finally, we discuss the key insights from the literature so far and
point out promising future research directions. We compile a living survey of
the category discovery literature at

### [150] [HyCoVAD: A Hybrid SSL-LLM Model for Complex Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22544)
*Mohammad Mahdi Hemmatyar,Mahdi Jafari,Mohammad Amin Yousefi,Mohammad Reza Nemati,Mobin Azadani,Hamid Reza Rastad,Amirmohammad Akbari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyCoVAD is a hybrid SSL-LLM model for complex video anomaly detection that combines self-supervised learning for temporal analysis with LLM semantic validation, achieving 72.5% AUC on ComplexVAD dataset while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSL methods struggle with semantic understanding of complex anomalies defined by intricate relationships and temporal dependencies, while LLMs lack spatial localization and are computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis.

Method: Hybrid approach combining multi-task SSL temporal analyzer (nnFormer backbone) with LLM validator. SSL module identifies suspicious frames through multiple proxy tasks, then LLM applies structured rule-based reasoning for semantic validation.

Result: Achieves 72.5% frame-level AUC on ComplexVAD dataset, outperforming baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation.

Conclusion: HyCoVAD effectively bridges the gap between low-level pattern modeling and semantic reasoning for complex video anomaly detection, providing a computationally efficient solution with improved performance.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for intelligent surveillance, but a
significant challenge lies in identifying complex anomalies, which are events
defined by intricate relationships and temporal dependencies among multiple
entities rather than by isolated actions. While self-supervised learning (SSL)
methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often
struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large
language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are
computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained
spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly
Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal
analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone
which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with
multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of
anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the
analysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to
validate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD
dataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming
existing baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation. We release our
interaction anomaly taxonomy, adaptive thresholding protocol, and code to
facilitate future research in complex VAD scenarios.

TL;DR: SpikeMatch is the first semi-supervised learning framework for spiking neural networks (SNNs) that uses temporal dynamics and co-training to generate reliable pseudo-labels from unlabeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semi-supervised learning methods for SNNs are underexplored compared to artificial neural networks, despite SNNs' biological plausibility and energy efficiency advantages.

Method: Leverages temporal dynamics through SNN leakage factors for diverse pseudo-labeling in a co-training framework. Uses agreement among multiple predictions from a single SNN to generate reliable pseudo-labels from weakly-augmented unlabeled samples for training on strongly-augmented ones.

Result: Outperforms existing SSL methods adapted to SNN backbones across various standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: SpikeMatch effectively mitigates confirmation bias by capturing discriminative features with limited labels, demonstrating the viability of SSL for SNNs.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently been attracting significant
attention for their biological plausibility and energy efficiency, but
semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods for SNN-based models remain
underexplored compared to those for artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this
paper, we introduce SpikeMatch, the first SSL framework for SNNs that leverages
the temporal dynamics through the leakage factor of SNNs for diverse
pseudo-labeling within a co-training framework. By utilizing agreement among
multiple predictions from a single SNN, SpikeMatch generates reliable
pseudo-labels from weakly-augmented unlabeled samples to train on
strongly-augmented ones, effectively mitigating confirmation bias by capturing
discriminative features with limited labels. Experiments show that SpikeMatch
outperforms existing SSL methods adapted to SNN backbones across various
standard benchmarks.

### [152] [LongLive: Real-time Interactive Long Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22622)
*Shuai Yang,Wei Huang,Ruihang Chu,Yicheng Xiao,Yuyang Zhao,Xianbang Wang,Muyang Li,Enze Xie,Yingcong Chen,Yao Lu,Song Han,Yukang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongLive is a frame-level autoregressive framework for real-time long video generation that addresses efficiency and quality challenges through KV-recache mechanism, streaming long tuning, and short window attention with frame sink.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long video generation faces efficiency issues with diffusion models and quality degradation with causal attention AR models. Interactive capabilities like streaming prompt inputs are needed for dynamic content creation but increase complexity for visual consistency and semantic coherence.

Method: Causal frame-level AR design with KV-recache mechanism for prompt switching, streaming long tuning for long video training, and short window attention with frame sink for long-range consistency and faster generation.

Result: Fine-tunes 1.3B-parameter model to minute-long generation in 32 GPU-days, achieves 20.7 FPS on single H100, strong VBench performance on short/long videos, supports up to 240-second videos, and INT8-quantized inference with minimal quality loss.

Conclusion: LongLive successfully addresses long video generation challenges by combining efficient AR inference with quality preservation through novel mechanisms for prompt switching and long-range consistency.

Abstract: We present LongLive, a frame-level autoregressive (AR) framework for
real-time and interactive long video generation. Long video generation presents
challenges in both efficiency and quality. Diffusion and Diffusion-Forcing
models can produce high-quality videos but suffer from low efficiency due to
bidirectional attention. Causal attention AR models support KV caching for
faster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory
challenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-based
generation, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are
critical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in
real time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity,
especially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt
transitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level
AR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states
with new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable
long video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long);
and short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as
frame sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation.
With these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model
to minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains
20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in both
short and long videos. LongLive supports up to 240-second videos on a single
H100 GPU. LongLive further supports INT8-quantized inference with only marginal
quality loss.

### [153] [SPARK: Synergistic Policy And Reward Co-Evolving Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22624)
*Ziyu Liu,Yuhang Zang,Shengyuan Ding,Yuhang Cao,Xiaoyi Dong,Haodong Duan,Dahua Lin,Jiaqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPARK is a synergistic framework that recycles rollouts and correctness data from RLVR to train the model itself as a generative reward model, eliminating the need for separate reward models and human preference data while creating a co-evolving feedback loop between policy and reward.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high costs and potential reward-policy mismatch in RLHF, and the wasted supervision in RLVR where rollouts and correctness signals are discarded after each update.

Method: SPARK recycles rollouts and correctness data to simultaneously train the model as a generative reward model using mixed objectives (pointwise reward score, pairwise comparison, evaluation conditioned on further-reflection responses), creating a co-evolving feedback loop between policy and reward.

Result: SPARK achieves significant performance gains: SPARK-VL-7B shows 9.7% average gain on 7 reasoning benchmarks, 12.1% on 2 reward benchmarks, and 1.5% on 8 general benchmarks over baselines.

Conclusion: SPARK provides an efficient, on-policy, and stable alternative to RLHF and RLVR that eliminates the need for separate reward models and costly human preference data while demonstrating robust performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
increasingly use Reinforcement Learning (RL) for post-pretraining, such as RL
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for objective tasks and RL from Human Feedback
(RLHF) for subjective tasks. However, RLHF incurs high costs and potential
reward-policy mismatch due to reliance on human preferences, while RLVR still
wastes supervision by discarding rollouts and correctness signals after each
update. To address these challenges, we introduce the Synergistic Policy And
Reward Co-Evolving Framework (SPARK), an efficient, on-policy, and stable
method that builds on RLVR. Instead of discarding rollouts and correctness
data, SPARK recycles this valuable information to simultaneously train the
model itself as a generative reward model. This auxiliary training uses a mix
of objectives, such as pointwise reward score, pairwise comparison, and
evaluation conditioned on further-reflection responses, to teach the model to
evaluate and improve its own responses. Our process eliminates the need for a
separate reward model and costly human preference data. SPARK creates a
positive co-evolving feedback loop: improved reward accuracy yields better
policy gradients, which in turn produce higher-quality rollouts that further
refine the reward model. Our unified framework supports test-time scaling via
self-reflection without external reward models and their associated costs. We
show that SPARK achieves significant performance gains on multiple LLM and LVLM
models and multiple reasoning, reward models, and general benchmarks. For
example, SPARK-VL-7B achieves an average 9.7% gain on 7 reasoning benchmarks,
12.1% on 2 reward benchmarks, and 1.5% on 8 general benchmarks over the
baselines, demonstrating robustness and broad generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CCNeXt is a novel self-supervised CNN architecture for depth estimation that outperforms state-of-the-art CNNs and ViTs while being computationally efficient, achieving 10.18× faster inference than current best models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth estimation is crucial for robotics, autonomous vehicles, and AR applications that operate under computational constraints. Stereo image pairs provide an effective solution, and self-supervised techniques are needed due to difficulty acquiring reliable ground-truth depth data across diverse scenarios.

Method: Proposes CCNeXt architecture with modern CNN feature extractor, novel windowed epipolar cross-attention module in encoder, and comprehensive redesign of depth estimation decoder for self-supervised learning from stereo image pairs.

Result: Achieves competitive metrics on KITTI Eigen Split test data while being 10.18× faster than current best model. Achieves state-of-the-art results in all metrics on KITTI Eigen Split Improved Ground Truth and Driving Stereo datasets compared to recent techniques.

Conclusion: CCNeXt provides an efficient and effective self-supervised solution for depth estimation that balances computational cost with performance, making it suitable for real-world applications with computational constraints.

Abstract: Depth Estimation plays a crucial role in recent applications in robotics,
autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality. These scenarios commonly operate
under constraints imposed by computational power. Stereo image pairs offer an
effective solution for depth estimation since it only needs to estimate the
disparity of pixels in image pairs to determine the depth in a known rectified
system. Due to the difficulty in acquiring reliable ground-truth depth data
across diverse scenarios, self-supervised techniques emerge as a solution,
particularly when large unlabeled datasets are available. We propose a novel
self-supervised convolutional approach that outperforms existing
state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers
(ViTs) while balancing computational cost. The proposed CCNeXt architecture
employs a modern CNN feature extractor with a novel windowed epipolar
cross-attention module in the encoder, complemented by a comprehensive redesign
of the depth estimation decoder. Our experiments demonstrate that CCNeXt
achieves competitive metrics on the KITTI Eigen Split test data while being
10.18$\times$ faster than the current best model and achieves state-of-the-art
results in all metrics in the KITTI Eigen Split Improved Ground Truth and
Driving Stereo datasets when compared to recently proposed techniques. To

*Hongyu Chen,Guangrun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UML-CoT is a structured reasoning framework that uses Unified Modeling Language diagrams to create interpretable and executable action plans, outperforming traditional Chain-of-Thought prompting in embodied tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Chain-of-Thought prompting relies on unstructured text, limiting interpretability and executability in embodied tasks. Existing structured approaches only model low-order relations and lack constructs for inheritance, behavioral abstraction, and standardized planning semantics.

Method: Proposes UML-CoT framework using UML class diagrams for compositional object semantics and activity diagrams for procedural control flow. Uses three-stage training pipeline with supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), including reward learning from answer-only data.

Result: Evaluated on MRoom-30k benchmark of cluttered room-cleaning scenarios. UML-CoT outperforms unstructured CoTs in interpretability, planning coherence, and execution success.

Conclusion: UML provides a more expressive and actionable structured reasoning formalism compared to traditional Chain-of-Thought approaches, enabling better performance in embodied reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language models
(LLMs), but its reliance on unstructured text limits interpretability and
executability in embodied tasks. Prior work has explored structured CoTs using
scene or logic graphs, yet these remain fundamentally limited: they model only
low-order relations, lack constructs like inheritance or behavioral
abstraction, and provide no standardized semantics for sequential or
conditional planning. We propose UML-CoT, a structured reasoning and planning
framework that leverages Unified Modeling Language (UML) to generate symbolic
CoTs and executable action plans. UML class diagrams capture compositional
object semantics, while activity diagrams model procedural control flow. Our
three-stage training pipeline combines supervised fine-tuning with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), including reward learning from answer-only
data. We evaluate UML-CoT on MRoom-30k, a new benchmark of cluttered
room-cleaning scenarios. UML-CoT outperforms unstructured CoTs in
interpretability, planning coherence, and execution success, highlighting UML
as a more expressive and actionable structured reasoning formalism.

TL;DR: Labeling Copilot is an AI agent that automates computer vision dataset curation through three core capabilities: discovering relevant data, generating synthetic data for rare scenarios, and producing accurate annotations via consensus mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality domain-specific dataset curation is a major bottleneck for vision systems, requiring complex trade-offs between data quality, diversity, and cost when dealing with large unlabeled data repositories.

Method: A central orchestrator agent powered by a large multimodal language model uses multi-step reasoning to execute specialized tools: Calibrated Discovery for sourcing relevant data, Controllable Synthesis for generating novel data with filtering, and Consensus Annotation using multiple foundation models with non-maximum suppression and voting mechanisms.

Result: On COCO dataset: averaged 14.2 candidate proposals per image (vs 7.4 ground-truth), achieving 37.1% mAP. On Open Images: discovered 903 new bounding box categories (total >1500). Calibrated Discovery was 40x more computationally efficient than alternatives at 10-million sample scale.

Conclusion: Agentic workflow with optimized, scalable tools provides robust foundation for curating industrial-scale datasets, proving effective for large-scale vision data curation.

Abstract: Curating high-quality, domain-specific datasets is a major bottleneck for
deploying robust vision systems, requiring complex trade-offs between data
quality, diversity, and cost when researching vast, unlabeled data lakes. We
introduce Labeling Copilot, the first data curation deep research agent for
computer vision. A central orchestrator agent, powered by a large multimodal
language model, uses multi-step reasoning to execute specialized tools across
three core capabilities: (1) Calibrated Discovery sources relevant,
in-distribution data from large repositories; (2) Controllable Synthesis
generates novel data for rare scenarios with robust filtering; and (3)
Consensus Annotation produces accurate labels by orchestrating multiple
foundation models via a novel consensus mechanism incorporating non-maximum
suppression and voting. Our large-scale validation proves the effectiveness of
Labeling Copilot's components. The Consensus Annotation module excels at object
discovery: on the dense COCO dataset, it averages 14.2 candidate proposals per
image-nearly double the 7.4 ground-truth objects-achieving a final annotation
mAP of 37.1%. On the web-scale Open Images dataset, it navigated extreme class
imbalance to discover 903 new bounding box categories, expanding its capability
to over 1500 total. Concurrently, our Calibrated Discovery tool, tested at a
10-million sample scale, features an active learning strategy that is up to 40x
more computationally efficient than alternatives with equivalent sample
efficiency. These experiments validate that an agentic workflow with optimized,
scalable tools provides a robust foundation for curating industrial-scale
datasets.

TL;DR: DIPSY is a training-free approach for few-shot image classification that uses IP-Adapter for image-to-image translation to generate discriminative synthetic images without model fine-tuning or external tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot image classification is challenging due to limited labeled examples, and existing methods require extensive model fine-tuning or external information sources.

Method: Uses IP-Adapter for image-to-image translation with three innovations: extended classifier-free guidance for independent positive/negative conditioning, class similarity-based sampling for contrastive examples, and a simple pipeline requiring no fine-tuning or external tools.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performance across ten benchmark datasets, particularly effective for fine-grained classification tasks.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the effectiveness of dual image prompting with positive-negative guidance for generating class-discriminative features without generative model adaptation or external tools.

Abstract: Few-shot image classification remains challenging due to the limited
availability of labeled examples. Recent approaches have explored generating
synthetic training data using text-to-image diffusion models, but often require
extensive model fine-tuning or external information sources. We present a novel
training-free approach, called DIPSY, that leverages IP-Adapter for
image-to-image translation to generate highly discriminative synthetic images
using only the available few-shot examples. DIPSY introduces three key
innovations: (1) an extended classifier-free guidance scheme that enables
independent control over positive and negative image conditioning; (2) a class
similarity-based sampling strategy that identifies effective contrastive
examples; and (3) a simple yet effective pipeline that requires no model
fine-tuning or external captioning and filtering. Experiments across ten
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art or
comparable performance, while eliminating the need for generative model
adaptation or reliance on external tools for caption generation and image
filtering. Our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging dual image
prompting with positive-negative guidance for generating class-discriminative
features, particularly for fine-grained classification tasks.

*Amandeep Kumar,Nithin Gopalakrishnan Nair,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper shows that VAR transformers with Markovian attention masks are mathematically equivalent to discrete diffusion models, leading to a new framework called SRDD that combines AR transformers' efficiency with diffusion models' iterative refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge autoregressive transformers and diffusion models by uncovering their mathematical equivalence, enabling the combination of VAR's computational efficiency with diffusion's advantages like iterative refinement.

Method: Reinterpret VAR with Markovian attention masks as discrete diffusion (SRDD framework), allowing direct import of diffusion techniques like iterative refinement while reducing architectural inefficiencies.

Result: The diffusion-based perspective of VAR leads to faster convergence, lower inference cost, improved zero-shot reconstruction, and consistent gains in efficiency and generation across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The theoretical equivalence between VAR and discrete diffusion provides a principled bridge that enables combining the best of both approaches - AR transformers' efficiency and diffusion models' refinement capabilities.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) transformers have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
visual generation, largely due to their scalability, computational efficiency
and unified architecture with language and vision. Among them, next scale
prediction Visual Autoregressive Generation (VAR) has recently demonstrated
remarkable performance, even surpassing diffusion-based models. In this work,
we revisit VAR and uncover a theoretical insight: when equipped with a
Markovian attention mask, VAR is mathematically equivalent to a discrete
diffusion. We term this reinterpretation as Scalable Visual Refinement with
Discrete Diffusion (SRDD), establishing a principled bridge between AR
transformers and diffusion models. Leveraging this new perspective, we show how
one can directly import the advantages of diffusion such as iterative
refinement and reduce architectural inefficiencies into VAR, yielding faster
convergence, lower inference cost, and improved zero-shot reconstruction.
Across multiple datasets, we show that the diffusion based perspective of VAR
leads to consistent gains in efficiency and generation.

*Anna Kukleva,Enis Simsar,Alessio Tonioni,Muhammad Ferjad Naeem,Federico Tombari,Jan Eric Lenssen,Bernt Schiele*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RefAM is a training-free grounding framework that leverages diffusion transformer features and attention mechanisms for zero-shot referring segmentation, outperforming prior methods without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing referring segmentation approaches require fine-tuning or multiple pre-trained models with additional training and architectural modifications. Diffusion models encode rich semantic information that can be exploited for downstream tasks without modifications.

Method: Uses diffusion transformer features and attention scores directly. Identifies stop words as attention magnets and global attention sinks (GAS) in deeper layers. Proposes attention redistribution strategy where appended stop words partition background activations. Combines cross-attention maps, GAS handling, and redistribution in RefAM framework.

Result: Consistently outperforms prior methods across zero-shot referring image and video segmentation benchmarks, establishing new state-of-the-art performance without fine-tuning or additional components.

Conclusion: Diffusion transformers provide powerful features for grounding tasks that can be effectively leveraged through attention analysis and redistribution strategies, enabling training-free state-of-the-art performance in referring segmentation.

Abstract: Most existing approaches to referring segmentation achieve strong performance
only through fine-tuning or by composing multiple pre-trained models, often at
the cost of additional training and architectural modifications. Meanwhile,
large-scale generative diffusion models encode rich semantic information,
making them attractive as general-purpose feature extractors. In this work, we
introduce a new method that directly exploits features, attention scores, from
diffusion transformers for downstream tasks, requiring neither architectural
modifications nor additional training. To systematically evaluate these
features, we extend benchmarks with vision-language grounding tasks spanning
both images and videos. Our key insight is that stop words act as attention
magnets: they accumulate surplus attention and can be filtered to reduce noise.
Moreover, we identify global attention sinks (GAS) emerging in deeper layers
and show that they can be safely suppressed or redirected onto auxiliary
tokens, leading to sharper and more accurate grounding maps. We further propose
an attention redistribution strategy, where appended stop words partition
background activations into smaller clusters, yielding sharper and more
localized heatmaps. Building on these findings, we develop RefAM, a simple
training-free grounding framework that combines cross-attention maps, GAS
handling, and redistribution. Across zero-shot referring image and video
segmentation benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms prior methods,
establishing a new state of the art without fine-tuning or additional
components.

### [160] [Towards mitigating information leakage when evaluating safety monitors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21344)
*Gerard Boxo,Aman Neelappa,Shivam Raval*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: White box monitors for detecting harmful behaviors in LLMs face evaluation challenges due to data leakage from elicitation methods. The paper proposes a framework and three strategies (content filtering, score filtering, and fine-tuned model organisms) to evaluate monitors' genuine detection capabilities, revealing significant performance drops when mitigating leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for white box monitors are inflated because the same information used to elicit harmful behaviors leaks into the data monitors analyze, making it unclear whether monitors detect genuine model behavior or just superficial artifacts from the elicitation process.

Method: Proposed a systematic evaluation framework with three mitigation strategies: content filtering (removing deception-related text), score filtering (aggregating only task-relevant tokens), and prompt-distilled fine-tuned model organisms (models trained to be deceptive without explicit prompting). Applied these to deception detection benchmarks.

Result: Experiments revealed two types of leakage (elicitation and reasoning leakage) that inflate monitor performance. Content filtering decreased AUROC by 30%, score filtering by 15%, and fine-tuned model organisms reduced performance by up to 40% even when monitors were retrained.

Conclusion: Current white box monitor evaluations are significantly inflated by data leakage from elicitation methods. The proposed mitigation strategies reveal that monitors' true detection capabilities are substantially lower than reported, highlighting the need for more rigorous evaluation frameworks that account for these artifacts.

Abstract: White box monitors that analyze model internals offer promising advantages
for detecting potentially harmful behaviors in large language models, including
lower computational costs and integration into layered defense systems.However,
training and evaluating these monitors requires response exemplars that exhibit
the target behaviors, typically elicited through prompting or fine-tuning. This
presents a challenge when the information used to elicit behaviors inevitably
leaks into the data that monitors ingest, inflating their effectiveness. We
present a systematic framework for evaluating a monitor's performance in terms
of its ability to detect genuine model behavior rather than superficial
elicitation artifacts. Furthermore, we propose three novel strategies to
evaluate the monitor: content filtering (removing deception-related text from
inputs), score filtering (aggregating only over task-relevant tokens), and
prompt distilled fine-tuned model organisms (models trained to exhibit
deceptive behavior without explicit prompting). Using deception detection as a
representative case study, we identify two forms of leakage that inflate
monitor performance: elicitation leakage from prompts that explicitly request
harmful behavior, and reasoning leakage from models that verbalize their
deceptive actions. Through experiments on multiple deception benchmarks, we
apply our proposed mitigation strategies and measure performance retention. Our
evaluation of the monitors reveal three crucial findings: (1) Content filtering

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes decision pivots as verifiable checkpoints for chain-of-thought reasoning, with a self-training pipeline that mines pivots from diverse reasoning paths and compresses them into pivot-focused short paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-thought reasoning exposes LLM thinking processes but lacks scalable verification methods for reasoning traces.

Method: Self-training pipeline that samples diverse reasoning paths, mines shared decision pivots, compresses traces into pivot-focused short-path reasoning using auxiliary verifier, and post-trains model with self-generated outputs.

Result: Effective performance on standard benchmarks including LogiQA, MedQA, and MATH500.

Conclusion: The method successfully aligns reasoning without requiring ground truth reasoning data or external metrics.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning exposes the intermediate thinking process of
large language models (LLMs), yet verifying those traces at scale remains
unsolved. In response, we introduce the idea of decision pivots-minimal,
verifiable checkpoints that any correct reasoning path must visit. We
hypothesize that correct reasoning, though stylistically diverse, converge on
the same pivot set, while incorrect ones violate at least one pivot. Leveraging
this property, we propose a self-training pipeline that (i) samples diverse
reasoning paths and mines shared decision pivots, (ii) compresses each trace
into pivot-focused short-path reasoning using an auxiliary verifier, and (iii)
post-trains the model using its self-generated outputs. The proposed method
aligns reasoning without ground truth reasoning data or external metrics.
Experiments on standard benchmarks such as LogiQA, MedQA, and MATH500 show the
effectiveness of our method.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address fragmented data sources, heterogeneous formats, and technical expertise requirements that limit participation and reproducibility in climate data science.

Method: Combine a curated knowledge graph that organizes datasets, tools, and workflows with AI agents powered by generative AI for natural language interaction and automated data access.

Result: Drastically lowers technical threshold for non-specialist users to identify and analyze relevant datasets through scalable agentic workflows.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a pathway toward democratizing access to climate data and establishing a reproducible, extensible framework for human-AI collaboration in scientific research.

Abstract: Climate data science faces persistent barriers stemming from the fragmented
nature of data sources, heterogeneous formats, and the steep technical
expertise required to identify, acquire, and process datasets. These challenges
limit participation, slow discovery, and reduce the reproducibility of
scientific workflows. In this paper, we present a proof of concept for
addressing these barriers through the integration of a curated knowledge graph
(KG) with AI agents designed for cloud-native scientific workflows. The KG
provides a unifying layer that organizes datasets, tools, and workflows, while
AI agents -- powered by generative AI services -- enable natural language
interaction, automated data access, and streamlined analysis. Together, these
components drastically lower the technical threshold for engaging in climate
data science, enabling non-specialist users to identify and analyze relevant
datasets. By leveraging existing cloud-ready API data portals, we demonstrate
that "a knowledge graph is all you need" to unlock scalable and agentic
workflows for scientific inquiry. The open-source design of our system further
supports community contributions, ensuring that the KG and associated tools can
evolve as a shared commons. Our results illustrate a pathway toward
democratizing access to climate data and establishing a reproducible,
extensible framework for human--AI collaboration in scientific research.

*Mohammad Parsa Afshar,Aryan Azimi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Comparative study using EEG data and machine learning models to predict consumer behavior, with GNN models showing better performance in some criteria compared to classical models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To predict consumer behavior using EEG data for applications in marketing, cognitive neuroscience, and human-computer interaction by analyzing brain neural activity during decision processes.

Method: Extracted and cleaned EEG features from NeuMa dataset, created brain connectivity features for GNN models, and compared various machine learning models including classical models (ensemble models, SVM) and Graph Neural Networks with different architectures.

Result: No significant overall performance difference between models, but GNN models generally performed better in some basic criteria where classical models were unsatisfactory.

Conclusion: Combining EEG signal analysis with machine learning provides deeper understanding of consumer behavior, and GNN models show promise as an alternative to traditional approaches in EEG-based neuromarketing.

Abstract: Prediction of consumer behavior is one of the important purposes in
marketing, cognitive neuroscience, and human-computer interaction. The
electroencephalography (EEG) data can help analyze the decision process by
providing detailed information about the brain's neural activity. In this
research, a comparative approach is utilized for predicting consumer behavior
by EEG data. In the first step, the features of the EEG data from the NeuMa
dataset were extracted and cleaned. For the Graph Neural Network (GNN) models,
the brain connectivity features were created. Different machine learning
models, such as classical models and Graph Neural Networks, are used and
compared. The GNN models with different architectures are implemented to have a
comprehensive comparison; furthermore, a wide range of classical models, such
as ensemble models, are applied, which can be very helpful to show the
difference and performance of each model on the dataset. Although the results
did not show a significant difference overall, the GNN models generally
performed better in some basic criteria where classical models were not
satisfactory. This study not only shows that combining EEG signal analysis and
machine learning models can provide an approach to deeper understanding of
consumer behavior, but also provides a comprehensive comparison between the
machine learning models that have been widely used in previous studies in the
EEG-based neuromarketing such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the models
which are not used or rarely used in the field, like Graph Neural Networks.

*Peng Luo,Xiayin Lou,Yu Zheng,Zhuo Zheng,Stefano Ermon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GeoEvolve is a multi-agent LLM framework that combines evolutionary search with geospatial domain knowledge to automatically design and refine geospatial algorithms, achieving significant improvements in spatial interpolation and uncertainty quantification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based algorithm discovery frameworks lack domain knowledge and multi-step reasoning required for complex geospatial problems, while geospatial modeling is critical for addressing global challenges like sustainability and climate change.

Method: Two nested loops: inner loop uses code evolver to generate/mutate candidate solutions, outer agentic controller evaluates elites and queries GeoKnowRAG module (structured geospatial knowledge base) to inject theoretical priors from geography, enabling knowledge-guided evolution.

Result: Reduced spatial interpolation error (RMSE) by 13-21%, enhanced uncertainty estimation performance by 17%, and automatically discovered new algorithms incorporating geospatial theory on classical models for spatial interpolation and uncertainty quantification tasks.

Conclusion: GeoEvolve provides a scalable path toward automated, knowledge-driven geospatial modeling, opening new opportunities for trustworthy and efficient AI-for-Science discovery, with domain-guided retrieval being essential for stable, high-quality evolution.

Abstract: Geospatial modeling provides critical solutions for pressing global
challenges such as sustainability and climate change. Existing large language
model (LLM)-based algorithm discovery frameworks, such as AlphaEvolve, excel at
evolving generic code but lack the domain knowledge and multi-step reasoning
required for complex geospatial problems. We introduce GeoEvolve, a multi-agent
LLM framework that couples evolutionary search with geospatial domain knowledge
to automatically design and refine geospatial algorithms. GeoEvolve operates in
two nested loops: an inner loop leverages a code evolver to generate and mutate
candidate solutions, while an outer agentic controller evaluates global elites
and queries a GeoKnowRAG module -- a structured geospatial knowledge base that
injects theoretical priors from geography. This knowledge-guided evolution
steers the search toward theoretically meaningful and computationally efficient
algorithms. We evaluate GeoEvolve on two fundamental and classical tasks:
spatial interpolation (kriging) and spatial uncertainty quantification
(geospatial conformal prediction). Across these benchmarks, GeoEvolve
automatically improves and discovers new algorithms, incorporating geospatial
theory on top of classical models. It reduces spatial interpolation error
(RMSE) by 13-21% and enhances uncertainty estimation performance by 17\%.
Ablation studies confirm that domain-guided retrieval is essential for stable,
high-quality evolution. These results demonstrate that GeoEvolve provides a
scalable path toward automated, knowledge-driven geospatial modeling, opening
new opportunities for trustworthy and efficient AI-for-Science discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MultiFIX is an interpretable multimodal AI framework that integrates clinical variables and CT imaging for survival analysis in head and neck cancer, achieving superior performance (C-index 0.838) while maintaining transparency through feature explanation and Cox regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate and interpretable survival analysis in oncology is growing with increasing multimodal data and clinical requirements for transparent models that support validation and trust.

Method: Uses deep learning to infer survival-relevant features from multimodal data (clinical variables + CT imaging), with imaging features interpreted via Grad-CAM and clinical variables modeled as symbolic expressions through genetic programming. Risk estimation employs transparent Cox regression for patient stratification.

Result: Achieved C-index of 0.838 for prediction and 0.826 for stratification on RADCURE head and neck cancer dataset, outperforming clinical and academic baseline approaches and aligning with known prognostic markers.

Conclusion: MultiFIX demonstrates the promise of interpretable multimodal AI for precision oncology by providing both high accuracy and transparency in survival analysis.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable survival analysis remains a core challenge in
oncology. With growing multimodal data and the clinical need for transparent
models to support validation and trust, this challenge increases in complexity.
We propose an interpretable multimodal AI framework to automate survival
analysis by integrating clinical variables and computed tomography imaging. Our
MultiFIX-based framework uses deep learning to infer survival-relevant features
that are further explained: imaging features are interpreted via Grad-CAM,
while clinical variables are modeled as symbolic expressions through genetic
programming. Risk estimation employs a transparent Cox regression, enabling
stratification into groups with distinct survival outcomes. Using the
open-source RADCURE dataset for head and neck cancer, MultiFIX achieves a
C-index of 0.838 (prediction) and 0.826 (stratification), outperforming the
clinical and academic baseline approaches and aligning with known prognostic
markers. These results highlight the promise of interpretable multimodal AI for
precision oncology with MultiFIX.

### [166] [Semantic F1 Scores: Fair Evaluation Under Fuzzy Class Boundaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21633)
*Georgios Chochlakis,Jackson Trager,Vedant Jhaveri,Nikhil Ravichandran,Alexandros Potamianos,Shrikanth Narayanan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Semantic F1 Scores are novel evaluation metrics for subjective multi-label classification that quantify semantic relatedness between predicted and gold labels using a similarity matrix, providing partial credit for semantically related predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional F1 metrics treat semantically related predictions as complete failures, which doesn't reflect the realities of domains with human disagreement or fuzzy category boundaries where categories overlap and annotators disagree.

Method: Semantic F1 incorporates a label similarity matrix to compute soft precision-like and recall-like scores through a novel two-step precision-recall formulation that enables comparison of label sets of arbitrary sizes without discarding labels or forcing matches.

Result: Semantic F1 demonstrates greater interpretability and ecological validity through theoretical justification and empirical validation on synthetic and real data, providing fairer evaluations that recognize similar predictions lead to similar outcomes.

Conclusion: Semantic F1 is applicable across tasks and modalities as it requires only a domain-appropriate similarity matrix (robust to misspecification) rather than a rigid ontology, better reflecting real-world scenarios with subjective classification.

Abstract: We propose Semantic F1 Scores, novel evaluation metrics for subjective or
fuzzy multi-label classification that quantify semantic relatedness between
predicted and gold labels. Unlike the conventional F1 metrics that treat
semantically related predictions as complete failures, Semantic F1 incorporates
a label similarity matrix to compute soft precision-like and recall-like
scores, from which the Semantic F1 scores are derived. Unlike existing
similarity-based metrics, our novel two-step precision-recall formulation
enables the comparison of label sets of arbitrary sizes without discarding
labels or forcing matches between dissimilar labels. By granting partial credit
for semantically related but nonidentical labels, Semantic F1 better reflects
the realities of domains marked by human disagreement or fuzzy category
boundaries. In this way, it provides fairer evaluations: it recognizes that
categories overlap, that annotators disagree, and that downstream decisions
based on similar predictions lead to similar outcomes. Through theoretical
justification and extensive empirical validation on synthetic and real data, we
show that Semantic F1 demonstrates greater interpretability and ecological
validity. Because it requires only a domain-appropriate similarity matrix,
which is robust to misspecification, and not a rigid ontology, it is applicable
across tasks and modalities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper develops a scalable benchmark for evaluating physical safety understanding in Embodied AI systems, analyzes foundation models' safety perception capabilities, and introduces a post-training method to improve safety reasoning with interpretable thinking traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical safety challenges when AI interacts with the physical world, where potential for physical harm is direct and immediate, and assess whether state-of-the-art foundation models understand common-sense physical safety facts.

Method: Created a scalable physical safety benchmarking approach using real-world injury narratives and safety constraints, converted into photorealistic images/videos via generative models. Analyzed major foundation models' risk perception and safety reasoning capabilities, and developed a post-training paradigm to teach explicit safety constraint reasoning.

Result: Comprehensive analysis revealed multi-faceted insights into foundation models' deployment readiness for safety-critical applications. The post-training approach achieved state-of-the-art performance in constraint satisfaction evaluations while generating interpretable safety reasoning traces.

Conclusion: The work provides a robust framework for continuous physical safety benchmarking of Embodied AI systems and demonstrates effective methods to enhance safety reasoning transparency and performance in foundation models for real-world deployment.

Abstract: When AI interacts with the physical world -- as a robot or an assistive agent
-- new safety challenges emerge beyond those of purely ``digital AI". In such
interactions, the potential for physical harm is direct and immediate. How well
do state-of-the-art foundation models understand common-sense facts about
physical safety, e.g. that a box may be too heavy to lift, or that a hot cup of
coffee should not be handed to a child? In this paper, our contributions are
three-fold: first, we develop a highly scalable approach to continuous physical
safety benchmarking of Embodied AI systems, grounded in real-world injury
narratives and operational safety constraints. To probe multi-modal safety
understanding, we turn these narratives and constraints into photorealistic
images and videos capturing transitions from safe to unsafe states, using
advanced generative models. Secondly, we comprehensively analyze the ability of
major foundation models to perceive risks, reason about safety, and trigger
interventions; this yields multi-faceted insights into their deployment
readiness for safety-critical agentic applications. Finally, we develop a
post-training paradigm to teach models to explicitly reason about
embodiment-specific safety constraints provided through system instructions.
The resulting models generate thinking traces that make safety reasoning
interpretable and transparent, achieving state of the art performance in
constraint satisfaction evaluations. The benchmark will be released at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to adapt multilingual TTS models to low-resource languages using limited paired data and unpaired text with speaker prompts, outperforming fine-tuning alone and achieving better results than DPO in high-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing TTS for low-resource languages is challenging due to scarce paired text-speech data, while ASR models are more accessible through multilingual pre-training.

Method: Three-stage approach: 1) Train multilingual TTS baseline with IPA tokens, 2) Fine-tune on limited paired data for target language prosody, 3) Apply GRPO optimization using unpaired text and speaker prompts guided by multi-objective rewards from ASR, speaker verification, and audio quality models.

Result: Produces intelligible and speaker-consistent speech in low-resource languages, substantially outperforming fine-tuning alone. Also improves TTS in high-resource languages, surpassing DPO with superior intelligibility, speaker similarity, and audio quality.

Conclusion: The GRPO-based framework effectively adapts TTS models to low-resource languages using limited resources and improves performance across both low-resource and high-resource language scenarios.

Abstract: Developing high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) systems for low-resource
languages is challenging due to the scarcity of paired text and speech data. In
contrast, automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for such languages are
often more accessible, owing to large-scale multilingual pre-training efforts.
We propose a framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to
adapt an autoregressive, multilingual TTS model to new languages. Our method
first establishes a language-agnostic foundation for TTS synthesis by training
a multilingual baseline with International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) tokens.
Next, we fine-tune this model on limited paired data of the new languages to
capture the target language's prosodic features. Finally, we apply GRPO to
optimize the model using only unpaired text and speaker prompts, guided by a
multi-objective reward from pretrained ASR, speaker verification, and audio
quality estimation models. Experiments demonstrate that this pipeline produces
intelligible and speaker-consistent speech in low-resource languages,
substantially outperforming fine-tuning alone. Furthermore, our GRPO-based
framework also improves TTS performance in high-resource languages, surpassing
offline alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) yielding
superior intelligibility, speaker similarity, and audio quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models produce long reasoning traces that inflate latency and cost, creating a need for inference-time efficiency improvements.

Method: Organizes reasoning steps into a thought graph with sequential and semantic edges, retrieves query-relevant nodes, and applies reward-guided traversal to assemble problem-specific templates that guide generation.

Result: Substantial efficiency gains with small prompt growth: 40% reduction in output tokens, 82% reduction in inference latency, and 59% cost reduction while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: RoT establishes a scalable paradigm for efficient large reasoning model reasoning via dynamic template construction through retrieval.

Abstract: Large reasoning models improve accuracy by producing long reasoning traces,
but this inflates latency and cost, motivating inference-time efficiency. We
propose Retrieval-of-Thought (RoT), which reuses prior reasoning as composable
``thought" steps to guide new problems. RoT organizes steps into a thought
graph with sequential and semantic edges to enable fast retrieval and flexible
recombination. At inference, RoT retrieves query-relevant nodes and applies
reward-guided traversal to assemble a problem-specific template that guides
generation. This dynamic template reuse reduces redundant exploration and,
therefore, reduces output tokens while preserving accuracy. We evaluate RoT on
reasoning benchmarks with multiple models, measuring accuracy, token usage,
latency, and memory overhead. Findings show small prompt growth but substantial
efficiency gains, with RoT reducing output tokens by up to 40%, inference
latency by 82%, and cost by 59% while maintaining accuracy. RoT establishes a
scalable paradigm for efficient LRM reasoning via dynamic template construction
through retrieval.

TL;DR: The paper proposes LLR-BC, a lifelong learning framework for neural VRP solvers that addresses catastrophic forgetting by consolidating prior knowledge through behavior alignment and confidence-based weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural solvers struggle with new tasks - either poor zero-shot generalization due to distribution discrepancies or catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuning on new tasks. A lifelong learning approach is needed to maintain performance on previous tasks while learning new ones.

Method: Proposed LLR-BC framework that consolidates prior knowledge by aligning behaviors of solvers trained on new tasks with buffered ones in a decision-seeking way, using greater consolidated weights for decisions with lower confidence.

Result: Extensive experiments on capacitated vehicle routing problems and traveling salesman problems show LLR-BC effectively trains high-performance neural solvers, addresses catastrophic forgetting, maintains plasticity, and improves zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: LLR-BC provides an effective lifelong learning solution for neural VRP solvers, enabling continuous learning across multiple tasks with diverse distributions and scales while preserving previously acquired knowledge.

Abstract: Recent neural solvers have demonstrated promising performance in learning to
solve routing problems. However, existing studies are primarily based on
one-off training on one or a set of predefined problem distributions and
scales, i.e., tasks. When a new task arises, they typically rely on either
zero-shot generalization, which may be poor due to the discrepancies between
the new task and the training task(s), or fine-tuning the pretrained solver on
the new task, which possibly leads to catastrophic forgetting of knowledge
acquired from previous tasks. This paper explores a novel lifelong learning
paradigm for neural VRP solvers, where multiple tasks with diverse
distributions and scales arise sequentially over time. Solvers are required to
effectively and efficiently learn to solve new tasks while maintaining their
performance on previously learned tasks. Consequently, a novel framework called
Lifelong Learning Router with Behavior Consolidation (LLR-BC) is proposed.
LLR-BC consolidates prior knowledge effectively by aligning behaviors of the
solver trained on a new task with the buffered ones in a decision-seeking way.
To encourage more focus on crucial experiences, LLR-BC assigns greater
consolidated weights to decisions with lower confidence. Extensive experiments
on capacitated vehicle routing problems and traveling salesman problems
demonstrate LLR-BC's effectiveness in training high-performance neural solvers
in a lifelong learning setting, addressing the catastrophic forgetting issue,
maintaining their plasticity, and improving zero-shot generalization ability.

TL;DR: UltraHorizon is a benchmark for evaluating autonomous agents in long-horizon, partially observable tasks, revealing significant performance gaps between LLM-agents and humans despite extensive tool usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on short-horizon, fully observable tasks, while real-world challenges like software development and scientific discovery require sustained reasoning in long-horizon, partially observable scenarios.

Method: The benchmark uses exploration across three environments to test core competencies: sustained reasoning, planning, memory management, and tool use in long-horizon discovery tasks where agents uncover hidden rules iteratively.

Result: LLM-agents consistently underperform compared to humans, with trajectories averaging 200k+ tokens and 400+ tool calls in heavy settings. Simple scaling fails, and analysis reveals eight error types attributed to in-context locking and functional capability gaps.

Conclusion: There is a persistent gap in agents' long-horizon abilities, highlighting the need for improved benchmarks and agent capabilities for complex real-world tasks.

Abstract: Autonomous agents have recently achieved remarkable progress across diverse
domains, yet most evaluations focus on short-horizon, fully observable tasks.
In contrast, many critical real-world tasks, such as large-scale software
development, commercial investment, and scientific discovery, unfold in
long-horizon and partially observable scenarios where success hinges on
sustained reasoning, planning, memory management, and tool use. Existing
benchmarks rarely capture these long-horizon challenges, leaving a gap in
systematic evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{UltraHorizon} a
novel benchmark that measures the foundational capabilities essential for
complex real-world challenges. We use exploration as a unifying task across
three distinct environments to validate these core competencies. Agents are
designed in long-horizon discovery tasks where they must iteratively uncover
hidden rules through sustained reasoning, planning, memory and tools
management, and interaction with environments. Under the heaviest scale
setting, trajectories average \textbf{200k+} tokens and \textbf{400+} tool
calls, whereas in standard configurations they still exceed \textbf{35k} tokens
and involve more than \textbf{60} tool calls on average. Our extensive
experiments reveal that LLM-agents consistently underperform in these settings,
whereas human participants achieve higher scores, underscoring a persistent gap
in agents' long-horizon abilities. We also observe that simple scaling fails in
our task. To better illustrate the failure of agents, we conduct an in-depth
analysis of collected trajectories. We identify eight types of errors and
attribute them to two primary causes: in-context locking and functional
fundamental capability gaps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus too much on visual perception or UI code generation, lacking evaluation of reasoning, robustness, and safety capabilities needed for end-to-end web applications.

Method: Constructed benchmark from 729 websites with 3799 question-answer pairs across 8 tasks, using standardized prompts, deterministic evaluation scripts, and multi-stage quality control with automatic checks and human verification.

Result: Evaluation of 12 MLLMs reveals significant gaps: models struggle with compositional and cross-element reasoning, show limited robustness to UI perturbations, and are overly conservative in safety-critical action recognition.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs have substantial limitations in web understanding capabilities, particularly in reasoning, robustness, and safety aspects, highlighting the need for improved models for real-world web applications.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly positioned as AI
collaborators for building complex web-related applications like GUI agents and
front-end code generation. However, existing benchmarks largely emphasize
visual perception or UI code generation, showing insufficient evaluation on the
reasoning, robustness and safety capability required for end-to-end web
applications. To bridge the gap, we introduce a comprehensive web understanding
benchmark, named WebRSSBench, that jointly evaluates Reasoning, Robustness, and
Safety across eight tasks, such as position relationship reasoning, color
robustness, and safety critical detection, etc. The benchmark is constructed
from 729 websites and contains 3799 question answer pairs that probe multi-step
inference over page structure, text, widgets, and safety-critical interactions.
To ensure reliable measurement, we adopt standardized prompts, deterministic
evaluation scripts, and multi-stage quality control combining automatic checks
with targeted human verification. We evaluate 12 MLLMs on WebRSSBench. The
results reveal significant gaps, models still struggle with compositional and
cross-element reasoning over realistic layouts, show limited robustness when
facing perturbations in user interfaces and content such as layout
rearrangements or visual style shifts, and are rather conservative in
recognizing and avoiding safety critical or irreversible actions. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI agents face challenges including data bottlenecks in end-to-end training, high costs of delayed error detection, and risk of contradictory guidance. The framework aims to overcome these limitations by emulating human cognitive processes.

Method: D-Artemis employs a fine-grained app-specific tip retrieval mechanism, proactive Pre-execution Alignment with Thought-Action Consistency Check and Action Correction Agent, and post-execution Status Reflection Agent to complete the cognitive loop.

Result: D-Artemis achieves state-of-the-art results with 75.8% success rate on AndroidWorld and 96.8% on ScreenSpot-V2 benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization without training on complex trajectory datasets.

Conclusion: The framework significantly enhances MLLM capabilities for GUI tasks through its deliberative cognitive approach, with each component contributing meaningfully to overall performance as shown in ablation studies.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents aim to automate a wide spectrum of
human tasks by emulating user interaction. Despite rapid advancements, current
approaches are hindered by several critical challenges: data bottleneck in
end-to-end training, high cost of delayed error detection, and risk of
contradictory guidance. Inspired by the human cognitive loop of Thinking,
Alignment, and Reflection, we present D-Artemis -- a novel deliberative
framework in this paper. D-Artemis leverages a fine-grained, app-specific tip
retrieval mechanism to inform its decision-making process. It also employs a
proactive Pre-execution Alignment stage, where Thought-Action Consistency (TAC)
Check module and Action Correction Agent (ACA) work in concert to mitigate the
risk of execution failures. A post-execution Status Reflection Agent (SRA)
completes the cognitive loop, enabling strategic learning from experience.
Crucially, D-Artemis enhances the capabilities of general-purpose Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) for GUI tasks without the need for training on
complex trajectory datasets, demonstrating strong generalization. D-Artemis
establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across both major benchmarks,
achieving a 75.8% success rate on AndroidWorld and 96.8% on ScreenSpot-V2.
Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the significant contribution of
each component to the framework.

Motivation: Existing reward methods struggle with GUI agents due to lack of ground-truth trajectories or application databases, and static trajectory-based LLM-as-a-Judge approaches have limited accuracy.

Method: Uses a general-purpose reasoner to schedule targeted state probing tasks, which domain-specific evaluator agents execute by actively interacting with the environment to collect additional observations for more accurate reward assignment.

Result: Empirical results on 3K+ trajectories show ProRe improves reward accuracy by up to 5.3% and F1 score by up to 19.4%. Integration with state-of-the-art policy agents yields success rate improvement of up to 22.4%.

Conclusion: ProRe effectively addresses the limitations of existing reward methods for GUI agents through proactive environment interaction, significantly improving reward accuracy and agent performance.

Abstract: Reward is critical to the evaluation and training of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing rule-based or model-based reward methods struggle to
generalize to GUI agents, where access to ground-truth trajectories or
application databases is often unavailable, and static trajectory-based
LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from limited accuracy. To address these
challenges, we propose ProRe, a proactive reward system that leverages a
general-purpose reasoner and domain-specific evaluator agents (actors). The
reasoner schedules targeted state probing tasks, which the evaluator agents
then execute by actively interacting with the environment to collect additional
observations. This enables the reasoner to assign more accurate and verifiable
rewards to GUI agents. Empirical results on over 3K trajectories demonstrate
that ProRe improves reward accuracy and F1 score by up to 5.3% and 19.4%,
respectively. Furthermore, integrating ProRe with state-of-the-art policy
agents yields a success rate improvement of up to 22.4%.

*Jaehyun Nam,Jinsung Yoon,Jiefeng Chen,Jinwoo Shin,Tomas Pfister*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DS-STAR is a novel data science agent that overcomes LLM limitations in handling heterogeneous data formats and generating optimal analysis plans through automated data exploration, iterative plan verification, and sequential refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data science tasks are complex and involve exploring multiple data sources, but LLMs struggle with heterogeneous data formats and generating sufficient analysis plans without ground-truth labels for open-ended tasks.

Method: DS-STAR introduces: (1) automated data file analysis for diverse formats including unstructured data, (2) LLM-based verification of analysis plan sufficiency at each stage, and (3) sequential planning starting with simple executable plans and iteratively refining based on feedback until verified.

Result: DS-STAR achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmarks (DABStep, KramaBench, DA-Code) and particularly outperforms baselines on hard tasks requiring processing multiple heterogeneous data files.

Conclusion: The iterative refinement approach allows DS-STAR to reliably navigate complex analyses involving diverse data sources, demonstrating superior performance in automated data science tasks.

Abstract: Data science, which transforms raw data into actionable insights, is critical
for data-driven decision-making. However, these tasks are often complex,
involving steps for exploring multiple data sources and synthesizing findings
to deliver insightful answers. While large language models (LLMs) show
significant promise in automating this process, they often struggle with
heterogeneous data formats and generate sub-optimal analysis plans, as
verifying plan sufficiency is inherently difficult without ground-truth labels
for such open-ended tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DS-STAR,
a novel data science agent. Specifically, DS-STAR makes three key
contributions: (1) a data file analysis module that automatically explores and
extracts context from diverse data formats, including unstructured types; (2) a
verification step where an LLM-based judge evaluates the sufficiency of the
analysis plan at each stage; and (3) a sequential planning mechanism that
starts with a simple, executable plan and iteratively refines it based on the
DS-STAR's feedback until its sufficiency is verified. This iterative refinement
allows DS-STAR to reliably navigate complex analyses involving diverse data
sources. Our experiments show that DS-STAR achieves state-of-the-art
performance across three challenging benchmarks: DABStep, KramaBench, and
DA-Code. Moreover, DS-STAR particularly outperforms baselines on hard tasks
that require processing multiple data files with heterogeneous formats.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for modeling decisions with axioms (ethical constraints) and identifies a Decision-Evaluation Paradox showing tension between using axioms to make vs evaluate decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a systematic framework for understanding how axioms (ethical constraints) affect decision-making processes and to reveal fundamental tensions in their application.

Method: Developed a framework for modeling decisions with axioms, defined a taxonomy of decision axioms based on structural properties, and demonstrated the Decision-Evaluation Paradox.

Result: Identified that the Decision-Evaluation Paradox arises with realistic axiom structures, highlighting critical challenges in training models on decision data and applying axioms.

Conclusion: Researchers must be exceptionally careful when training models on decision data or applying axioms to make and evaluate decisions due to the inherent Decision-Evaluation Paradox.

Abstract: We introduce a framework for modeling decisions with axioms that are
statements about decisions, e.g., ethical constraints. Using our framework we
define a taxonomy of decision axioms based on their structural properties and
demonstrate a tension between the use of axioms to make decisions and the use
of axioms to evaluate decisions which we call the Decision-Evaluation Paradox.
We argue that the Decision-Evaluation Paradox arises with realistic axiom
structures, and the paradox illuminates why one must be exceptionally careful
when training models on decision data or applying axioms to make and evaluate
decisions.

*Yansong Ning,Rui Liu,Jun Wang,Kai Chen,Wei Li,Jun Fang,Kan Zheng,Naiqiang Tan,Hao Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepTravel is an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that enables autonomous travel planning agents to plan, execute tools, and refine actions through multi-step reasoning, outperforming frontier LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing travel planning agents rely on hand-crafted prompts and fixed workflows, limiting their flexibility and autonomy in generating travel itineraries.

Method: The framework includes a sandbox environment with cached data, hierarchical reward modeling with trajectory and turn-level verifiers, and reply-augmented reinforcement learning that replays from failure experiences.

Result: DeepTravel enables small LLMs (e.g., Qwen3 32B) to significantly outperform frontier LLMs like OpenAI o1, o3 and DeepSeek R1 in travel planning tasks, as validated through online and offline evaluations on DiDi Enterprise Solutions App.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully builds autonomous travel planning agents capable of flexible and efficient itinerary generation through reinforcement learning and hierarchical verification.

Abstract: Travel planning (TP) agent has recently worked as an emerging building block
to interact with external tools and resources for travel itinerary generation,
ensuring enjoyable user experience. Despite its benefits, existing studies rely
on hand craft prompt and fixed agent workflow, hindering more flexible and
autonomous TP agent. This paper proposes DeepTravel, an end to end agentic
reinforcement learning framework for building autonomous travel planning agent,
capable of autonomously planning, executing tools, and reflecting on tool
responses to explore, verify, and refine intermediate actions in multi step
reasoning. To achieve this, we first construct a robust sandbox environment by
caching transportation, accommodation and POI data, facilitating TP agent
training without being constrained by real world APIs limitations (e.g.,
inconsistent outputs). Moreover, we develop a hierarchical reward modeling
system, where a trajectory level verifier first checks spatiotemporal
feasibility and filters unsatisfied travel itinerary, and then the turn level
verifier further validate itinerary detail consistency with tool responses,
enabling efficient and precise reward service. Finally, we propose the reply
augmented reinforcement learning method that enables TP agent to periodically
replay from a failures experience buffer, emerging notable agentic capacity. We
deploy trained TP agent on DiDi Enterprise Solutions App and conduct
comprehensive online and offline evaluations, demonstrating that DeepTravel
enables small size LLMs (e.g., Qwen3 32B) to significantly outperform existing
frontier LLMs such as OpenAI o1, o3 and DeepSeek R1 in travel planning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of principled methodologies for controlled experimentation in studying emergent behaviors in large language model-driven multi-agent systems, which limits research progress.

Method: Introduces Shachi framework that decomposes agent policies into three core cognitive components: Configuration (intrinsic traits), Memory (contextual persistence), and Tools (expanded capabilities), all orchestrated by an LLM reasoning engine.

Result: Validated on 10-task benchmark; demonstrated external validity by modeling real-world U.S. tariff shock - agent behaviors aligned with observed market reactions only when cognitive architecture was properly configured with memory and tools.

Conclusion: Provides a rigorous, open-source foundation for building and evaluating LLM agents to foster more cumulative and scientifically grounded research in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: The study of emergent behaviors in large language model (LLM)-driven
multi-agent systems is a critical research challenge, yet progress is limited
by a lack of principled methodologies for controlled experimentation. To
address this, we introduce Shachi, a formal methodology and modular framework
that decomposes an agent's policy into core cognitive components: Configuration
for intrinsic traits, Memory for contextual persistence, and Tools for expanded
capabilities, all orchestrated by an LLM reasoning engine. This principled
architecture moves beyond brittle, ad-hoc agent designs and enables the
systematic analysis of how specific architectural choices influence collective
behavior. We validate our methodology on a comprehensive 10-task benchmark and
demonstrate its power through novel scientific inquiries. Critically, we
establish the external validity of our approach by modeling a real-world U.S.
tariff shock, showing that agent behaviors align with observed market reactions
only when their cognitive architecture is appropriately configured with memory
and tools. Our work provides a rigorous, open-source foundation for building
and evaluating LLM agents, aimed at fostering more cumulative and
scientifically grounded research.

*Ziyang Zheng,Jiaying Zhu,Jingyi Zhou,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRACE introduces a hierarchical transformer architecture and function shift learning objective to better model computational graphs, outperforming previous methods on electronic circuit benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph neural networks have architectural mismatches that prevent them from capturing the position-aware, hierarchical nature of computation in computational graphs.

Method: Uses Hierarchical Transformer to mirror step-by-step computation flow and introduces function shift learning that predicts only the discrepancy between true global function and local approximation.

Result: Substantially outperforms all prior architectures across comprehensive benchmarks on electronic circuits.

Conclusion: The architecturally-aligned backbone and decoupled learning objective form a more robust paradigm for learning to compute on graphs.

Abstract: Learning to compute, the ability to model the functional behavior of a
computational graph, is a fundamental challenge for graph representation
learning. Yet, the dominant paradigm is architecturally mismatched for this
task. This flawed assumption, central to mainstream message passing neural
networks (MPNNs) and their conventional Transformer-based counterparts,
prevents models from capturing the position-aware, hierarchical nature of
computation. To resolve this, we introduce \textbf{TRACE}, a new paradigm built
on an architecturally sound backbone and a principled learning objective.
First, TRACE employs a Hierarchical Transformer that mirrors the step-by-step
flow of computation, providing a faithful architectural backbone that replaces
the flawed permutation-invariant aggregation. Second, we introduce
\textbf{function shift learning}, a novel objective that decouples the learning
problem. Instead of predicting the complex global function directly, our model
is trained to predict only the \textit{function shift}, the discrepancy between
the true global function and a simple local approximation that assumes input
independence. We validate this paradigm on electronic circuits, one of the most
complex and economically critical classes of computational graphs. Across a
comprehensive suite of benchmarks, TRACE substantially outperforms all prior
architectures. These results demonstrate that our architecturally-aligned
backbone and decoupled learning objective form a more robust paradigm for the
fundamental challenge of learning to compute on graphs.

TL;DR: DyRo-MCTS integrates action robustness estimation into Monte Carlo Tree Search to improve dynamic job shop scheduling by guiding decisions toward states that are both high-performing and adaptable to future job arrivals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing offline scheduling policies are imperfect and vulnerable to disruptions from new job arrivals, while vanilla MCTS struggles with online planning under incomplete problem information.

Method: Dynamic Robust MCTS (DyRo-MCTS) that incorporates action robustness estimation into the MCTS framework to identify scheduling decisions that maintain good performance while being resilient to future disturbances.

Result: DyRo-MCTS significantly improves offline-learned policies with minimal additional planning time, consistently outperforms vanilla MCTS across various scenarios, and achieves sustainable long-term performance gains under disturbances.

Conclusion: Integrating robustness estimation into online planning enables more resilient dynamic scheduling decisions that adapt well to unpredictable job arrivals, providing substantial performance improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Dynamic job shop scheduling, a fundamental combinatorial optimisation problem
in various industrial sectors, poses substantial challenges for effective
scheduling due to frequent disruptions caused by the arrival of new jobs.
State-of-the-art methods employ machine learning to learn scheduling policies
offline, enabling rapid responses to dynamic events. However, these offline
policies are often imperfect, necessitating the use of planning techniques such
as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to improve performance at online decision
time. The unpredictability of new job arrivals complicates online planning, as
decisions based on incomplete problem information are vulnerable to
disturbances. To address this issue, we propose the Dynamic Robust MCTS
(DyRo-MCTS) approach, which integrates action robustness estimation into MCTS.
DyRo-MCTS guides the production environment toward states that not only yield
good scheduling outcomes but are also easily adaptable to future job arrivals.
Extensive experiments show that DyRo-MCTS significantly improves the
performance of offline-learned policies with negligible additional online
planning time. Moreover, DyRo-MCTS consistently outperforms vanilla MCTS across
various scheduling scenarios. Further analysis reveals that its ability to make
robust scheduling decisions leads to long-term, sustainable performance gains
under disturbances.

TL;DR: This study compares Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) and explainable machine learning (CNN with SHAP) for outlier detection in plantar pressure data, finding ML outperforms SPM while both methods provide interpretable explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Plantar pressure mapping datasets often contain outliers from technical errors or procedural inconsistencies, but current methods like SPM are sensitive to alignment and their outlier detection capabilities are unclear.

Method: Used a dataset of 798 valid samples and 2000 outliers from multiple centers, comparing (i) non-parametric, registration-dependent SPM approach and (ii) convolutional neural network explained using SHAP. Evaluated via nested cross-validation and expert survey.

Result: ML model reached high accuracy and outperformed SPM, which misclassified clinically meaningful variations and missed true outliers. Both SPM and SHAP explanations were perceived as clear and trustworthy by experts, though SPM was less complex.

Conclusion: SPM and explainable ML have complementary potential for automated outlier detection in plantar pressure data, with explainability being crucial for translating complex model outputs into interpretable insights for decision-making.

Abstract: Plantar pressure mapping is essential in clinical diagnostics and sports
science, yet large heterogeneous datasets often contain outliers from technical
errors or procedural inconsistencies. Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM)
provides interpretable analyses but is sensitive to alignment and its capacity
for robust outlier detection remains unclear. This study compares an SPM
approach with an explainable machine learning (ML) approach to establish
transparent quality-control pipelines for plantar pressure datasets. Data from
multiple centers were annotated by expert consensus and enriched with synthetic
anomalies resulting in 798 valid samples and 2000 outliers. We evaluated (i) a
non-parametric, registration-dependent SPM approach and (ii) a convolutional
neural network (CNN), explained using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP).
Performance was assessed via nested cross-validation; explanation quality via a
semantic differential survey with domain experts. The ML model reached high
accuracy and outperformed SPM, which misclassified clinically meaningful
variations and missed true outliers. Experts perceived both SPM and SHAP
explanations as clear, useful, and trustworthy, though SPM was assessed less
complex. These findings highlight the complementary potential of SPM and
explainable ML as approaches for automated outlier detection in plantar
pressure data, and underscore the importance of explainability in translating
complex model outputs into interpretable insights that can effectively inform
decision-making.

TL;DR: CoBel-World is a framework that enables LLM agents to model collaborators' mental states and physical environment through a collaborative belief world, reducing communication costs by 22-60% and improving task efficiency by 4-28% compared to baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM collaboration frameworks overlook dynamic intent inference, leading to inconsistent plans and redundant communication that reduces collaboration efficiency in partially observable environments.

Method: Proposes CoBel-World framework with a collaborative belief world that uses symbolic belief language to parse task knowledge and performs zero-shot Bayesian-style belief updates through LLM reasoning for proactive miscoordination detection and adaptive communication.

Result: Significantly reduces communication costs by 22-60% and improves task completion efficiency by 4-28% on TDW-MAT and C-WAH benchmarks compared to strongest baselines.

Conclusion: Explicit, intent-aware belief modeling is essential for efficient and human-like collaboration in LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Effective real-world multi-agent collaboration requires not only accurate
planning but also the ability to reason about collaborators' intents -- a
crucial capability for avoiding miscoordination and redundant communication
under partial observable environments. Due to their strong planning and
reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising
autonomous agents for collaborative task solving. However, existing
collaboration frameworks for LLMs overlook their reasoning potential for
dynamic intent inference, and thus produce inconsistent plans and redundant
communication, reducing collaboration efficiency. To bridge this gap, we
propose CoBel-World, a novel framework that equips LLM agents with a
collaborative belief world -- an internal representation jointly modeling the
physical environment and collaborators' mental states. CoBel-World enables
agents to parse open-world task knowledge into structured beliefs via a
symbolic belief language, and perform zero-shot Bayesian-style belief updates
through LLM reasoning. This allows agents to proactively detect potential
miscoordination (e.g., conflicting plans) and communicate adaptively. Evaluated
on challenging embodied benchmarks (i.e., TDW-MAT and C-WAH), CoBel-World
significantly reduces communication costs by 22-60% and improves task
completion efficiency by 4-28% compared to the strongest baseline. Our results
show that explicit, intent-aware belief modeling is essential for efficient and
human-like collaboration in LLM-based multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional scraping methods and existing GUI agents are limited to single-step tasks and cannot handle the dynamic, interactive content needed for effective e-commerce risk management, which requires aggregating diverse web data through multi-step interactions.

Method: RISK framework includes: (1) RISK-Data dataset with 8,492 single-step and 2,386 multi-step interaction trajectories; (2) RISK-Bench benchmark for evaluation; (3) RISK-R1 reinforcement fine-tuning framework with four aspects: output format reward, stepwise accuracy reward, process reweight for multi-step sequences, and level reweight for task difficulty.

Result: RISK-R1 outperforms existing baselines with 6.8% improvement in offline single-step and 8.8% improvement in offline multi-step tasks. It achieves a top task success rate of 70.5% in online evaluation.

Conclusion: RISK provides a scalable, domain-specific solution for automating complex web interactions and advances the state of the art in e-commerce risk management.

Abstract: E-commerce risk management requires aggregating diverse, deeply embedded web
data through multi-step, stateful interactions, which traditional scraping
methods and most existing Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents cannot handle.
These agents are typically limited to single-step tasks and lack the ability to
manage dynamic, interactive content critical for effective risk assessment. To
address this challenge, we introduce RISK, a novel framework designed to build
and deploy GUI agents for this domain. RISK integrates three components: (1)
RISK-Data, a dataset of 8,492 single-step and 2,386 multi-step interaction
trajectories, collected through a high-fidelity browser framework and a
meticulous data curation process; (2) RISK-Bench, a benchmark with 802
single-step and 320 multi-step trajectories across three difficulty levels for
standardized evaluation; and (3) RISK-R1, a R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning
framework considering four aspects: (i) Output Format: Updated format reward to
enhance output syntactic correctness and task comprehension, (ii) Single-step
Level: Stepwise accuracy reward to provide granular feedback during early
training stages, (iii) Multi-step Level: Process reweight to emphasize critical
later steps in interaction sequences, and (iv) Task Level: Level reweight to
focus on tasks of varying difficulty. Experiments show that RISK-R1 outperforms
existing baselines, achieving a 6.8% improvement in offline single-step and an
8.8% improvement in offline multi-step. Moreover, it attains a top task success
rate of 70.5% in online evaluation. RISK provides a scalable, domain-specific
solution for automating complex web interactions, advancing the state of the

*Dong-Kyum Kim,Minsung Kim,Jea Kwon,Nakyeong Yang,Meeyoung Cha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The reversal curse in language models is not inherent but stems from knowledge encoding methods. Training on relational knowledge graphs induces bilinear representations that alleviate the curse and enable consistent model editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the view that the reversal curse is a fundamental limitation of language models and investigate whether it's an artifact of knowledge encoding rather than an inherent failure.

Method: Training language models from scratch on synthetic relational knowledge graphs to observe the emergence of bilinear relational structure in hidden representations.

Result: Models with bilinear structure can infer unseen reverse facts and maintain logical consistency during editing, while models lacking this structure suffer from the reversal curse and introduce inconsistencies.

Conclusion: The success of model editing depends on the underlying representational geometry, and training on relational knowledge induces bilinear representations that enable logically consistent behavior.

Abstract: The reversal curse -- a language model's (LM) inability to infer an unseen
fact ``B is A'' from a learned fact ``A is B'' -- is widely considered a
fundamental limitation. We show that this is not an inherent failure but an
artifact of how models encode knowledge. By training LMs from scratch on a
synthetic dataset of relational knowledge graphs, we demonstrate that bilinear
relational structure emerges in their hidden representations. This structure
substantially alleviates the reversal curse, enabling LMs to infer unseen
reverse facts. Crucially, we also find that this bilinear structure plays a key
role in consistent model editing. When a fact is updated in a LM with this
structure, the edit correctly propagates to its reverse and other logically
dependent facts. In contrast, models lacking this representation not only
suffer from the reversal curse but also fail to generalize edits, further
introducing logical inconsistencies. Our results establish that training on a
relational knowledge dataset induces the emergence of bilinear internal
representations, which in turn enable LMs to behave in a logically consistent
manner after editing. This implies that the success of model editing depends
critically not just on editing algorithms but on the underlying
representational geometry of the knowledge being modified.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GSM-Agent benchmark tests LLM agents' ability to solve grade-school math problems by proactively gathering missing information through tool use, revealing limitations in agentic reasoning even in frontier models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent benchmarks mix agentic reasoning with other advanced capabilities, making it hard to isolate and evaluate the specific skill of combining tool use with reasoning.

Method: Created GSM-Agent benchmark where LLMs must solve grade-school math problems but need to proactively collect missing premises using tools; proposed agentic reasoning graphs to analyze patterns and developed tool-augmented test-time scaling to improve performance.

Result: Even frontier models like GPT-5 only achieve 67% accuracy; analysis revealed models often lack the ability to revisit previously visited nodes in reasoning paths, which is crucial for agentic reasoning.

Conclusion: The benchmark and agentic reasoning framework provide tools for better understanding and improving LLM agents' reasoning capabilities, particularly in information-gathering scenarios.

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, agentic reasoning - the ability
to combine tool use, especially search, and reasoning - becomes a critical
skill. However, it is hard to disentangle agentic reasoning when evaluated in
complex environments and tasks. Current agent benchmarks often mix agentic
reasoning with challenging math reasoning, expert-level knowledge, and other
advanced capabilities. To fill this gap, we build a novel benchmark, GSM-Agent,
where an LLM agent is required to solve grade-school-level reasoning problems,
but is only presented with the question in the prompt without the premises that
contain the necessary information to solve the task, and needs to proactively
collect that information using tools. Although the original tasks are
grade-school math problems, we observe that even frontier models like GPT-5
only achieve 67% accuracy. To understand and analyze the agentic reasoning
patterns, we propose the concept of agentic reasoning graph: cluster the
environment's document embeddings into nodes, and map each tool call to its
nearest node to build a reasoning path. Surprisingly, we identify that the
ability to revisit a previously visited node, widely taken as a crucial pattern
in static reasoning, is often missing for agentic reasoning for many models.
Based on the insight, we propose a tool-augmented test-time scaling method to
improve LLM's agentic reasoning performance by adding tools to encourage models
to revisit. We expect our benchmark and the agentic reasoning framework to aid
future studies of understanding and pushing the boundaries of agentic
reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's growing demand for LLMs with adjustable reasoning capabilities that balance performance and computational cost, but existing methods lack fine-grained control over this trade-off.

Method: Conducted large-scale empirical study evaluating various model merging techniques across reasoning benchmarks, systematically varying merging strengths to create accuracy-efficiency curves.

Result: Model merging effectively calibrates reasoning accuracy vs. token efficiency trade-offs, even with divergent parent models, and achieves Pareto Improvements where merged models outperform parents in both accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: Model merging provides practical method for creating LLMs with specific reasoning profiles, offering comprehensive guidelines for meeting diverse application demands through tunable performance landscapes.

Abstract: The growing demand for large language models (LLMs) with tunable reasoning
capabilities in many real-world applications highlights a critical need for
methods that can efficiently produce a spectrum of models balancing reasoning
depth and computational cost. Model merging has emerged as a promising,
training-free technique to address this challenge by arithmetically combining
the weights of a general-purpose model with a specialized reasoning model.
While various merging techniques exist, their potential to create a spectrum of
models with fine-grained control over reasoning abilities remains largely
unexplored. This work presents a large-scale empirical study evaluating a range
of model merging techniques across multiple reasoning benchmarks. We
systematically vary merging strengths to construct accuracy-efficiency curves,
providing the first comprehensive view of the tunable performance landscape.
Our findings reveal that model merging offers an effective and controllable
method for calibrating the trade-off between reasoning accuracy and token
efficiency, even when parent models have highly divergent weight spaces.
Crucially, we identify instances of Pareto Improvement, where a merged model
achieves both higher accuracy and lower token consumption than one of its
parents. Our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of this tunable
space, offering practical guidelines for creating LLMs with specific reasoning

### [188] [A2R: An Asymmetric Two-Stage Reasoning Framework for Parallel Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22044)
*Ziqi Wang,Boye Niu,Zhongli Li,Linghui Meng,Jing Liu,Zhi Zheng,Tong Xu,Hua Wu,Haifeng Wang,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A2R is an asymmetric two-stage reasoning framework that uses an explorer model to generate multiple solutions in parallel, then a synthesizer model to integrate them, achieving significant performance improvements and cost efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between a model's potential capabilities and its actual performance in single attempts, especially as reasoning models advance but still show disparities between realized and inherent capabilities.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) Explorer model generates multiple potential solutions through parallel sampling, (2) Synthesizer model integrates these references for refined reasoning. Allows orthogonal computation scaling to existing sequential methods.

Result: Qwen3-8B-distill model achieved 75% performance improvement over self-consistency baseline. A2R-Efficient variant (Qwen3-4B explorer + Qwen3-8B synthesizer) surpassed monolithic Qwen3-32B performance at 30% lower cost.

Conclusion: A2R is both a performance-boosting framework and an efficient practical solution for real-world applications, demonstrating effective asymmetric scaling paradigm.

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models have achieved significant improvements in
complex task-solving capabilities by allocating more computation at the
inference stage with a "thinking longer" paradigm. Even as the foundational
reasoning capabilities of models advance rapidly, the persistent gap between a
model's performance in a single attempt and its latent potential, often
revealed only across multiple solution paths, starkly highlights the disparity
between its realized and inherent capabilities. To address this, we present
A2R, an Asymmetric Two-Stage Reasoning framework designed to explicitly bridge
the gap between a model's potential and its actual performance. In this
framework, an "explorer" model first generates potential solutions in parallel
through repeated sampling. Subsequently,a "synthesizer" model integrates these
references for a more refined, second stage of reasoning. This two-stage
process allows computation to be scaled orthogonally to existing sequential
methods. Our work makes two key innovations: First, we present A2R as a
plug-and-play parallel reasoning framework that explicitly enhances a model's
capabilities on complex questions. For example, using our framework, the
Qwen3-8B-distill model achieves a 75% performance improvement compared to its
self-consistency baseline. Second, through a systematic analysis of the
explorer and synthesizer roles, we identify an effective asymmetric scaling
paradigm. This insight leads to A2R-Efficient, a "small-to-big" variant that
combines a Qwen3-4B explorer with a Qwen3-8B synthesizer. This configuration
surpasses the average performance of a monolithic Qwen3-32B model at a nearly
30% lower cost. Collectively, these results show that A2R is not only a
performance-boosting framework but also an efficient and practical solution for
real-world applications.

*Hadar Peer,Eyal Weiss,Ron Alterovitz,Oren Salzman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a generalized multi-objective search formulation that uses aggregation functions to optimize solution objectives from hidden search objectives, enabling standard MOS algorithms to handle complex robotics problems with improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world robotic systems need to balance multiple conflicting objectives, but recent complex problem formulations prevent direct use of state-of-the-art multi-objective search algorithms.

Method: Proposed a generalized formulation using aggregation functions of hidden objectives, requiring only extension of core operations in standard MOS algorithms to handle specific aggregation functions.

Result: Applied to diverse robotics planning problems including navigation, manipulation, medical systems under uncertainty, inspection planning, and route planning, showing orders of magnitude improvement over vanilla algorithms without aggregation.

Conclusion: The generalized formulation successfully enables standard MOS algorithms to solve complex robotics problems by properly extending core operations for objective aggregation, demonstrating significant performance gains.

Abstract: Multi-objective search (MOS) has become essential in robotics, as real-world
robotic systems need to simultaneously balance multiple, often conflicting
objectives. Recent works explore complex interactions between objectives,
leading to problem formulations that do not allow the usage of out-of-the-box
state-of-the-art MOS algorithms. In this paper, we suggest a generalized
problem formulation that optimizes solution objectives via aggregation
functions of hidden (search) objectives. We show that our formulation supports
the application of standard MOS algorithms, necessitating only to properly
extend several core operations to reflect the specific aggregation functions
employed. We demonstrate our approach in several diverse robotics planning
problems, spanning motion-planning for navigation, manipulation and planning fr
medical systems under obstacle uncertainty as well as inspection planning, and
route planning with different road types. We solve the problems using
state-of-the-art MOS algorithms after properly extending their core operations,
and provide empirical evidence that they outperform by orders of magnitude the
vanilla versions of the algorithms applied to the same problems but without
objective aggregation.

Abstract: Although machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) present
fascinating opportunities for innovation, their rapid development is also
significantly impacting our environment. In response to growing
resource-awareness in the field, quantification tools such as the ML Emissions
Calculator and CodeCarbon were developed to estimate the energy consumption and
carbon emissions of running AI models. They are easy to incorporate into AI
projects, however also make pragmatic assumptions and neglect important
factors, raising the question of estimation accuracy. This study systematically
evaluates the reliability of static and dynamic energy estimation approaches
through comparisons with ground-truth measurements across hundreds of AI
experiments. Based on the proposed validation framework, investigative insights
into AI energy demand and estimation inaccuracies are provided. While generally
following the patterns of AI energy consumption, the established estimation
approaches are shown to consistently make errors of up to 40%. By providing
empirical evidence on energy estimation quality and errors, this study
establishes transparency and validates widely used tools for sustainable AI
development. It moreover formulates guidelines for improving the
state-of-the-art and offers code for extending the validation to other domains
and tools, thus making important contributions to resource-aware ML and AI

*Seoyoung Lee,Seonbin Yoon,Seongbeen Lee,Hyesoo Kim,Joo Yong Sim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Log2Plan is a GUI task automation system that uses two-level planning and task mining from user logs to overcome limitations of existing LLM/VLM-based agents, achieving robust performance on complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM/VLM-based planner-executor agents for GUI automation suffer from brittle generalization, high latency, limited long-horizon coherence, and fragility under UI changes or complex tasks.

Method: Combines structured two-level planning framework with task mining from user behavior logs. Constructs high-level plans using task dictionary mapping, then grounds them into low-level action sequences by interpreting real-time GUI context.

Result: Evaluated on 200 real-world tasks, showing significant improvements in task success rate and execution time. Maintains over 60.0% success rate on long-horizon task sequences.

Conclusion: Log2Plan enables robust and adaptable GUI automation through its planning framework and task mining approach, demonstrating strong performance in complex, multi-step workflows.

Abstract: GUI task automation streamlines repetitive tasks, but existing LLM or
VLM-based planner-executor agents suffer from brittle generalization, high
latency, and limited long-horizon coherence. Their reliance on single-shot
reasoning or static plans makes them fragile under UI changes or complex tasks.
Log2Plan addresses these limitations by combining a structured two-level
planning framework with a task mining approach over user behavior logs,
enabling robust and adaptable GUI automation. Log2Plan constructs high-level
plans by mapping user commands to a structured task dictionary, enabling
consistent and generalizable automation. To support personalization and reuse,
it employs a task mining approach from user behavior logs that identifies
user-specific patterns. These high-level plans are then grounded into low-level
action sequences by interpreting real-time GUI context, ensuring robust
execution across varying interfaces. We evaluated Log2Plan on 200 real-world
tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in task success rate and
execution time. Notably, it maintains over 60.0% success rate even on
long-horizon task sequences, highlighting its robustness in complex, multi-step
workflows.

*Simone Lionetti,Fabian Gröger,Philippe Gottfrois,Alvaro Gonzalez-Jimenez,Ludovic Amruthalingam,Alexander A. Navarini,Marc Pouly*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues for using probabilistic metrics that account for annotation uncertainty in medical imaging evaluations, as traditional methods like majority voting obscure label variability and can significantly impact model rankings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical dataset labels are uncertain due to annotator disagreement and varying confidence levels, but typical aggregation methods like majority voting hide this variability, potentially misleading model evaluations.

Method: Proposes probabilistic metrics that operate directly on label distributions, applicable regardless of annotation generation process (counting, confidence ratings, or probabilistic models), with computationally efficient linear-time implementations.

Result: Experiments on medical imaging benchmarks show that accounting for label confidence significantly impacts model rankings, demonstrating the importance of uncertainty-aware evaluation.

Conclusion: The community should release raw annotations and adopt uncertainty-aware evaluation methods to better reflect the reality of clinical data and improve performance estimates.

Abstract: Clinical dataset labels are rarely certain as annotators disagree and
confidence is not uniform across cases. Typical aggregation procedures, such as
majority voting, obscure this variability. In simple experiments on medical
imaging benchmarks, accounting for the confidence in binary labels
significantly impacts model rankings. We therefore argue that machine-learning
evaluations should explicitly account for annotation uncertainty using
probabilistic metrics that directly operate on distributions. These metrics can
be applied independently of the annotations' generating process, whether
modeled by simple counting, subjective confidence ratings, or probabilistic
response models. They are also computationally lightweight, as closed-form
expressions have linear-time implementations once examples are sorted by model
score. We thus urge the community to release raw annotations for datasets and
to adopt uncertainty-aware evaluation so that performance estimates may better
reflect clinical data.

TL;DR: InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B and InfiMed-Foundation-4B are medical-specific multimodal large language models that address challenges in medical AI by improving data quality, training efficiency, and domain knowledge extraction, achieving state-of-the-art performance in medical visual question answering and diagnostic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose MLLMs lack specialized medical knowledge and produce uncertain/hallucinatory responses, knowledge distillation fails to capture domain expertise, and computational costs of continual pretraining with medical data are prohibitive.

Method: Combined general-purpose and medical multimodal data with a five-dimensional quality assessment framework, employed low-to-high image resolution and multimodal sequence packing for efficiency, and used three-stage supervised fine-tuning for complex medical tasks.

Result: InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B outperforms Qwen2.5VL-3B, while InfiMed-Foundation-4B surpasses HuatuoGPT-V-7B and MedGemma-27B-IT on MedEvalKit framework, demonstrating superior performance in medical visual question answering and diagnostic tasks.

Conclusion: The work addresses key challenges in data quality, training efficiency, and domain-specific knowledge extraction, paving the way for more reliable and effective AI-driven healthcare solutions.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential in
various domains, yet their application in the medical field is hindered by
several challenges. General-purpose MLLMs often lack the specialized knowledge
required for medical tasks, leading to uncertain or hallucinatory responses.
Knowledge distillation from advanced models struggles to capture
domain-specific expertise in radiology and pharmacology. Additionally, the
computational cost of continual pretraining with large-scale medical data poses
significant efficiency challenges. To address these issues, we propose
InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B and InfiMed-Foundation-4B, two medical-specific MLLMs
designed to deliver state-of-the-art performance in medical applications. We
combined high-quality general-purpose and medical multimodal data and proposed
a novel five-dimensional quality assessment framework to curate high-quality
multimodal medical datasets. We employ low-to-high image resolution and
multimodal sequence packing to enhance training efficiency, enabling the
integration of extensive medical data. Furthermore, a three-stage supervised
fine-tuning process ensures effective knowledge extraction for complex medical
tasks. Evaluated on the MedEvalKit framework, InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B
outperforms Qwen2.5VL-3B, while InfiMed-Foundation-4B surpasses HuatuoGPT-V-7B
and MedGemma-27B-IT, demonstrating superior performance in medical visual
question answering and diagnostic tasks. By addressing key challenges in data
quality, training efficiency, and domain-specific knowledge extraction, our
work paves the way for more reliable and effective AI-driven solutions in

### [195] [Structured Sparse Transition Matrices to Enable State Tracking in State-Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22284)
*Aleksandar Terzić,Nicolas Menet,Michael Hersche,Thomas Hofmann,Abbas Rahimi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PD-SSM is a structured sparse parametrization for state-space models that enables optimal finite-state automata tracking with linear computational cost, outperforming existing SSM variants while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-space models use transition matrices that enable efficient computation but restrict expressivity in emulating finite-state automata. Unstructured matrices are expressive but computationally prohibitive.

Method: PD-SSM parametrizes the transition matrix as the product of a column one-hot matrix (P) and a complex-valued diagonal matrix (D), enabling linear computational cost scaling with state size while maintaining optimal expressivity.

Result: The model significantly outperforms modern SSM variants on FSA state tracking tasks, achieves comparable performance to neural controlled differential equations on time-series classification, and effectively tracks complex FSA states with variable-length English sentence transitions.

Conclusion: PD-SSM provides an optimal balance between expressivity and computational efficiency for state-space models, enabling effective finite-state automata tracking with linear computational cost scaling.

Abstract: Modern state-space models (SSMs) often utilize transition matrices which
enable efficient computation but pose restrictions on the model's expressivity,
as measured in terms of the ability to emulate finite-state automata (FSA).
While unstructured transition matrices are optimal in terms of expressivity,
they come at a prohibitively high compute and memory cost even for moderate
state sizes. We propose a structured sparse parametrization of transition
matrices in SSMs that enables FSA state tracking with optimal state size and
depth, while keeping the computational cost of the recurrence comparable to
that of diagonal SSMs. Our method, PD-SSM, parametrizes the transition matrix
as the product of a column one-hot matrix ($P$) and a complex-valued diagonal
matrix ($D$). Consequently, the computational cost of parallel scans scales
linearly with the state size. Theoretically, the model is BIBO-stable and can
emulate any $N$-state FSA with one layer of dimension $N$ and a linear readout
of size $N \times N$, significantly improving on all current structured SSM
guarantees. Experimentally, the model significantly outperforms a wide
collection of modern SSM variants on various FSA state tracking tasks. On
multiclass time-series classification, the performance is comparable to that of
neural controlled differential equations, a paradigm explicitly built for
time-series analysis. Finally, we integrate PD-SSM into a hybrid
Transformer-SSM architecture and demonstrate that the model can effectively
track the states of a complex FSA in which transitions are encoded as a set of
variable-length English sentences. The code is available at

### [196] [Large Language Models as Nondeterministic Causal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22297)
*Sander Beckers*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A simpler method for generating counterfactuals in LLMs is proposed that treats LLMs as nondeterministic causal models, making it applicable to any black-box LLM without modification, unlike existing methods that require implementation changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for generating counterfactuals in LLMs are ambiguous - they don't interpret LLMs literally (require changing sampling implementation) or as intended (represent nondeterministic LLMs as deterministic models). A simpler, more direct approach is needed.

Method: Proposes representing LLMs as nondeterministic causal models rather than deterministic ones, creating a method that works with any black-box LLM without needing to modify its implementation details.

Result: The new method is simpler and directly applicable to any black-box LLM, while the existing method is useful for generating specific types of counterfactuals for particular applications.

Conclusion: Both methods have their place - the new method provides a general foundation for counterfactual reasoning in LLMs based on intended semantics, while the existing method serves specific application needs. This lays groundwork for novel application-specific counterfactual generation methods.

Abstract: Recent work by Chatzi et al. and Ravfogel et al. has developed, for the first
time, a method for generating counterfactuals of probabilistic Large Language
Models. Such counterfactuals tell us what would - or might - have been the
output of an LLM if some factual prompt ${\bf x}$ had been ${\bf x}^*$ instead.
The ability to generate such counterfactuals is an important necessary step
towards explaining, evaluating, and comparing, the behavior of LLMs. I argue,
however, that the existing method rests on an ambiguous interpretation of LLMs:
it does not interpret LLMs literally, for the method involves the assumption
that one can change the implementation of an LLM's sampling process without
changing the LLM itself, nor does it interpret LLMs as intended, for the method
involves explicitly representing a nondeterministic LLM as a deterministic
causal model. I here present a much simpler method for generating
counterfactuals that is based on an LLM's intended interpretation by
representing it as a nondeterministic causal model instead. The advantage of my
simpler method is that it is directly applicable to any black-box LLM without
modification, as it is agnostic to any implementation details. The advantage of
the existing method, on the other hand, is that it directly implements the
generation of a specific type of counterfactuals that is useful for certain
purposes, but not for others. I clarify how both methods relate by offering a
theoretical foundation for reasoning about counterfactuals in LLMs based on
their intended semantics, thereby laying the groundwork for novel
application-specific methods for generating counterfactuals.

Motivation: Inspired by human dual-process cognition theory from 'Thinking, Fast and Slow', the authors aim to create a framework that mimics human cognitive processes to enhance LLM reasoning efficiency and accuracy.

Method: PRIME uses a Quick Thinking Agent (System 1) for rapid answers, then triggers a structured System 2 pipeline with specialized agents for planning, hypothesis generation, retrieval, information integration, and decision-making when uncertainty is detected.

Result: Experiments with LLaMA 3 models show PRIME enables open-source LLMs to perform competitively with GPT-4 and GPT-4o on multi-hop and knowledge-grounded reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: PRIME establishes a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains requiring complex, knowledge-intensive reasoning by faithfully mimicking human cognitive processes.

Abstract: Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition from \textit{Thinking,
Fast and Slow}, we introduce \textbf{PRIME} (Planning and Retrieval-Integrated
Memory for Enhanced Reasoning), a multi-agent reasoning framework that
dynamically integrates \textbf{System 1} (fast, intuitive thinking) and
\textbf{System 2} (slow, deliberate thinking). PRIME first employs a Quick

detected, it then triggers a structured System 2 reasoning pipeline composed of
specialized agents for \textit{planning}, \textit{hypothesis generation},
\textit{retrieval}, \textit{information integration}, and
\textit{decision-making}. This multi-agent design faithfully mimics human
cognitive processes and enhances both efficiency and accuracy. Experimental
results with LLaMA 3 models demonstrate that PRIME enables open-source LLMs to
perform competitively with state-of-the-art closed-source models like GPT-4 and
GPT-4o on benchmarks requiring multi-hop and knowledge-grounded reasoning. This
research establishes PRIME as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains

Motivation: Current evaluations of LLM search agents focus only on final answer accuracy, ignoring how they reason with and act on external evidence, which is crucial for understanding their true capabilities.

Method: Created SeekBench with 190 expert-annotated traces containing over 1,800 response steps from LLM search agents, enriched with evidence annotations for granular analysis of reasoning grounding, search adaptation, and evidence calibration.

Result: The benchmark enables evaluation of three key epistemic competencies: whether agents ground reasoning in observed evidence, adapt searches when results are poor, and properly assess evidence sufficiency for answering questions.

Conclusion: SeekBench provides the first comprehensive framework for assessing LLM search agents' epistemic competence through detailed step-level analysis of their reasoning processes and evidence utilization.

Abstract: Recent work has explored training Large Language Model (LLM) search agents

observed evidence, (2) adaptively reformulate searches to recover from
low-quality results, and (3) have proper calibration to correctly assess
whether the current evidence is sufficient for providing an answer.

TL;DR: EMMA is a VLA policy enhancement framework that uses DreamTransfer for generating multi-view consistent robot manipulation videos and AdaMix for hard-sample-aware training, achieving significant performance gains in robotic manipulation generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting large-scale real-world robot manipulation data across varied conditions is expensive and time-consuming, creating a bottleneck for training robust vision-language-action models.

Method: Proposes EMMA framework with DreamTransfer (diffusion Transformer-based video generation) for text-controlled visual editing of robot videos, and AdaMix training strategy that dynamically reweights batches to focus on challenging samples.

Result: DreamTransfer outperforms prior methods in multi-view consistency, geometric fidelity, and text-conditioning accuracy. VLAs trained with generated data achieve over 200% relative performance gain in zero-shot visual domains compared to real data alone, with additional 13% improvement using AdaMix.

Conclusion: The approach effectively boosts policy generalization by enabling robots to handle unseen object categories and novel visual domains using only single-appearance demonstrations, overcoming data collection bottlenecks.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models increasingly rely on diverse training
data to achieve robust generalization. However, collecting large-scale
real-world robot manipulation data across varied object appearances and
environmental conditions remains prohibitively time-consuming and expensive. To
overcome this bottleneck, we propose Embodied Manipulation Media Adaptation
(EMMA), a VLA policy enhancement framework that integrates a generative data
engine with an effective training pipeline. We introduce DreamTransfer, a
diffusion Transformer-based framework for generating multi-view consistent,
geometrically grounded embodied manipulation videos. DreamTransfer enables
text-controlled visual editing of robot videos, transforming foreground,
background, and lighting conditions without compromising 3D structure or
geometrical plausibility. Furthermore, we explore hybrid training with real and
generated data, and introduce AdaMix, a hard-sample-aware training strategy
that dynamically reweights training batches to focus optimization on
perceptually or kinematically challenging samples. Extensive experiments show
that videos generated by DreamTransfer significantly outperform prior video
generation methods in multi-view consistency, geometric fidelity, and
text-conditioning accuracy. Crucially, VLAs trained with generated data enable
robots to generalize to unseen object categories and novel visual domains using
only demonstrations from a single appearance. In real-world robotic
manipulation tasks with zero-shot visual domains, our approach achieves over a
200% relative performance gain compared to training on real data alone, and
further improves by 13% with AdaMix, demonstrating its effectiveness in
boosting policy generalization.

Motivation: Foundation models provide powerful tools to automate search through ALife simulations, building on previous work that aligns simulations with natural language prompts using vision-language models.

Method: Uses a second foundation model (Gemma-3) to propose new evolutionary targets based on simulation visual history. Tests two strategies: Evolved Supervised Targets (EST) evolving to match single new prompts, and Evolved Temporal Targets (ETT) evolving to match entire sequences of generated prompts.

Result: Empirical testing in Lenia substrate shows EST promotes greater visual novelty while ETT fosters more coherent and interpretable evolutionary sequences.

Conclusion: ASAL++ points towards new directions for FM-driven ALife discovery with open-ended characteristics.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have recently opened up new frontiers in the field of
artificial life (ALife) by providing powerful tools to automate search through
ALife simulations. Previous work aligns ALife simulations with natural language
target prompts using vision-language models (VLMs). We build on Automated
Search for Artificial Life (ASAL) by introducing ASAL++, a method for
open-ended-like search guided by multimodal FMs. We use a second FM to propose
new evolutionary targets based on a simulation's visual history. This induces
an evolutionary trajectory with increasingly complex targets.
  We explore two strategies: (1) evolving a simulation to match a single new
prompt at each iteration (Evolved Supervised Targets: EST) and (2) evolving a
simulation to match the entire sequence of generated prompts (Evolved Temporal
Targets: ETT). We test our method empirically in the Lenia substrate using
Gemma-3 to propose evolutionary targets, and show that EST promotes greater
visual novelty, while ETT fosters more coherent and interpretable evolutionary
sequences.
  Our results suggest that ASAL++ points towards new directions for FM-driven
ALife discovery with open-ended characteristics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs process diagrams as static images and lack the capacity for dynamic manipulation, which is essential for human geometric reasoning involving auxiliary line construction and transformations.

Method: Integrates three modules: Perception (abstracts diagrams into structured logic), Symbolic Reasoning (applies geometric theorems), and Sketch Action (executes operations like drawing lines). Uses two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning with symbolic rewards.

Result: Significantly improves stepwise reasoning accuracy and problem-solving success over static perception methods on the GeoSketch Benchmark of 390 geometry problems requiring auxiliary construction or transformations.

Conclusion: GeoSketch advances multimodal reasoning from static interpretation to dynamic, verifiable interaction, establishing a new foundation for solving complex visuospatial problems through hierarchical decision-making and executable visual actions.

Abstract: Geometric Problem Solving (GPS) poses a unique challenge for Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), requiring not only the joint interpretation of text
and diagrams but also iterative visuospatial reasoning. While existing
approaches process diagrams as static images, they lack the capacity for
dynamic manipulation - a core aspect of human geometric reasoning involving
auxiliary line construction and affine transformations. We present GeoSketch, a
neural-symbolic framework that recasts geometric reasoning as an interactive
perception-reasoning-action loop. GeoSketch integrates: (1) a Perception module
that abstracts diagrams into structured logic forms, (2) a Symbolic Reasoning
module that applies geometric theorems to decide the next deductive step, and
(3) a Sketch Action module that executes operations such as drawing auxiliary
lines or applying transformations, thereby updating the diagram in a closed
loop. To train this agent, we develop a two-stage pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning on 2,000 symbolic-curated trajectories followed by reinforcement
learning with dense, symbolic rewards to enhance robustness and strategic
exploration. To evaluate this paradigm, we introduce the GeoSketch Benchmark, a
high-quality set of 390 geometry problems requiring auxiliary construction or
affine transformations. Experiments on strong MLLM baselines demonstrate that
GeoSketch significantly improves stepwise reasoning accuracy and
problem-solving success over static perception methods. By unifying
hierarchical decision-making, executable visual actions, and symbolic
verification, GeoSketch advances multimodal reasoning from static
interpretation to dynamic, verifiable interaction, establishing a new
foundation for solving complex visuospatial problems.

*Chenglin Yu,Yang Yu,Songmiao Wang,Yucheng Wang,Yifan Yang,Jinjia Li,Ming Li,Hongxia Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InfiAgent is a pyramid-like DAG-based multi-agent framework that automatically decomposes complex tasks into hierarchical multi-agent systems, featuring agent self-evolution, dual-audit mechanisms, and atomic task parallelism for improved efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agent development requires extensive manual design, iterative tuning, and domain expertise, which limits scalability and cost-effectiveness across industries.

Method: Proposes a Pyramid-like DAG-based Multi-Agent Framework with: agent-as-a-tool mechanism for automatic decomposition, dual-audit for quality assurance, agent routing for efficient matching, self-evolution for autonomous restructuring, and atomic task parallelism.

Result: Achieves 9.9% higher performance than ADAS framework; case study shows InfiHelper generates scientific papers recognized by human reviewers at top-tier IEEE conferences.

Conclusion: InfiAgent provides a scalable, efficient framework that can autonomously evolve to handle infinite scenarios, overcoming limitations of hand-crafted LLM agents.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in organizing and executing complex tasks, and many such agents are now widely
used in various application scenarios. However, developing these agents
requires carefully designed workflows, carefully crafted prompts, and iterative
tuning, which requires LLM techniques and domain-specific expertise. These
hand-crafted limitations hinder the scalability and cost-effectiveness of LLM
agents across a wide range of industries. To address these challenges, we
propose \textbf{InfiAgent}, a Pyramid-like DAG-based Multi-Agent Framework that
can be applied to \textbf{infi}nite scenarios, which introduces several key
innovations: a generalized "agent-as-a-tool" mechanism that automatically
decomposes complex agents into hierarchical multi-agent systems; a dual-audit
mechanism that ensures the quality and stability of task completion; an agent
routing function that enables efficient task-agent matching; and an agent
self-evolution mechanism that autonomously restructures the agent DAG based on
new tasks, poor performance, or optimization opportunities. Furthermore,
InfiAgent's atomic task design supports agent parallelism, significantly
improving execution efficiency. This framework evolves into a versatile
pyramid-like multi-agent system capable of solving a wide range of problems.
Evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that InfiAgent achieves 9.9\%
higher performance compared to ADAS (similar auto-generated agent framework),
while a case study of the AI research assistant InfiHelper shows that it
generates scientific papers that have received recognition from human reviewers
at top-tier IEEE conferences.

### [203] [Estimating the Empowerment of Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22504)
*Jinyeop Song,Jeff Gore,Max Kleiman-Weiner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes empowerment (mutual information between agent actions and future states) as an open-ended evaluation metric for language model agents, introducing EELMA algorithm to estimate empowerment from text interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional benchmark evaluations are costly and require human-designed tasks, creating a need for scalable, general-purpose evaluation frameworks for increasingly capable language model agents with real-world tool access.

Method: Introduces EELMA (Estimating Empowerment of Language Model Agents) algorithm to approximate effective empowerment from multi-turn text interactions, validated on language games and realistic web-browsing scenarios.

Result: Empowerment strongly correlates with average task performance, characterizes impact of environmental complexity and agentic factors (chain-of-thought, model scale, memory length), and high empowerment states/actions are pivotal for general capabilities.

Conclusion: Empowerment serves as an appealing general-purpose metric for evaluating and monitoring language model agents in complex, open-ended settings.

Abstract: As language model (LM) agents become more capable and gain broader access to
real-world tools, there is a growing need for scalable evaluation frameworks of
agentic capability. However, conventional benchmark-centric evaluations are
costly to design and require human designers to come up with valid tasks that
translate into insights about general model capabilities. In this work, we
propose information-theoretic evaluation based on empowerment, the mutual
information between an agent's actions and future states, as an open-ended
method for evaluating LM agents. We introduce EELMA (Estimating Empowerment of
Language Model Agents), an algorithm for approximating effective empowerment
from multi-turn text interactions. We validate EELMA on both language games and
scaled-up realistic web-browsing scenarios. We find that empowerment strongly
correlates with average task performance, characterize the impact of
environmental complexity and agentic factors such as chain-of-thought, model
scale, and memory length on estimated empowerment, and that high empowerment
states and actions are often pivotal moments for general capabilities.
Together, these results demonstrate empowerment as an appealing general-purpose
metric for evaluating and monitoring LM agents in complex, open-ended settings.

Abstract: This paper introduces TrueGradeAI, an AI-driven digital examination framework
designed to overcome the shortcomings of traditional paper-based assessments,
including excessive paper usage, logistical complexity, grading delays, and
evaluator bias. The system preserves natural handwriting by capturing stylus
input on secure tablets and applying transformer-based optical character
recognition for transcription. Evaluation is conducted through a
retrieval-augmented pipeline that integrates faculty solutions, cache layers,

explicit, evidence-linked reasoning. Unlike prior tablet-based exam systems
that primarily digitize responses, TrueGradeAI advances the field by
incorporating explainable automation, bias mitigation, and auditable grading
trails. By uniting handwriting preservation with scalable and transparent
evaluation, the framework reduces environmental costs, accelerates feedback
cycles, and progressively builds a reusable knowledge base, while actively
working to mitigate grading bias and ensure fairness in assessment.

### [205] [REMA: A Unified Reasoning Manifold Framework for Interpreting Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22518)
*Bo Li,Guanzhi Deng,Ronghao Chen,Junrong Yue,Shuo Zhang,Qinghua Zhao,Linqi Song,Lijie Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the concept of Reasoning Manifold - a low-dimensional geometric structure formed by internal representations of correct reasoning, and presents REMA framework to analyze reasoning failures by measuring geometric deviations of erroneous representations from this manifold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs perform complex reasoning and their failure mechanisms through measurable geometric analysis, connecting abstract reasoning failures to geometric deviations in representations.

Method: Define Reasoning Manifold concept, build REMA framework that quantifies geometric deviation of erroneous representations using k-nearest neighbors distance to correct manifold, and localizes divergence points by tracking deviations across model layers.

Result: Experiments show low-dimensional nature of reasoning manifold and high separability between erroneous and correct reasoning representations, validating REMA's effectiveness in analyzing reasoning failure origins.

Conclusion: This research provides measurable geometric perspective for understanding LLM reasoning failures, enabling in-depth diagnosis of black-box models' internal computational processes.

Abstract: Understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) perform complex reasoning and
their failure mechanisms is a challenge in interpretability research. To
provide a measurable geometric analysis perspective, we define the concept of
the Reasoning Manifold, a latent low-dimensional geometric structure formed by
the internal representations corresponding to all correctly reasoned
generations. This structure can be conceptualized as the embodiment of the
effective thinking paths that the model has learned to successfully solve a
given task. Based on this concept, we build REMA, a framework that explains the
origins of failures by quantitatively comparing the spatial relationships of
internal model representations corresponding to both erroneous and correct
reasoning samples. Specifically, REMA first quantifies the geometric deviation
of each erroneous representation by calculating its k-nearest neighbors
distance to the approximated manifold formed by correct representations,
thereby providing a unified failure signal. It then localizes the divergence
points where these deviations first become significant by tracking this
deviation metric across the model's layers and comparing it against a baseline
of internal fluctuations from correct representations, thus identifying where
the reasoning chain begins to go off-track. Our extensive experiments on
diverse language and multimodal models and tasks demonstrate the
low-dimensional nature of the reasoning manifold and the high separability
between erroneous and correct reasoning representations. The results also
validate the effectiveness of the REMA framework in analyzing the origins of
reasoning failures. This research connects abstract reasoning failures to
measurable geometric deviations in representations, providing new avenues for
in-depth understanding and diagnosis of the internal computational processes of
black-box models.

### [206] [The Emergence of Altruism in Large-Language-Model Agents Society](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22537)
*Haoyang Li,Xiao Jia,Zhanzhan Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates how LLMs exhibit different social tendencies in large-scale simulations, identifying two archetypes: "Adaptive Egoists" that prioritize self-interest but can be influenced by social norms, and "Altruistic Optimizers" that inherently prioritize collective benefit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research has focused on cooperation in small-scale, task-oriented games, overlooking how altruism emerges in large-scale agent societies. Understanding the social logics embodied by LLMs is critical for computational social science.

Method: Introduced a Schelling-variant urban migration model creating a social dilemma for over 200 LLM agents, forcing them to navigate conflicts between egoistic and altruistic goals. Used Grounded Theory-inspired method to systematically code agent reasoning.

Result: Found fundamental differences in LLM social tendencies: "Adaptive Egoists" default to self-interest but increase altruism with social norms; "Altruistic Optimizers" consistently prioritize collective benefit even at personal cost. First evidence of intrinsic heterogeneity in LLM egoistic/altruistic tendencies.

Conclusion: Model selection for social simulation should consider intrinsic social action logic, not just reasoning capability. "Adaptive Egoists" better simulate complex human societies, while "Altruistic Optimizers" suit idealized pro-social scenarios.

Abstract: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for social simulation is a frontier
in computational social science. Understanding the social logics these agents
embody is critical to this attempt. However, existing research has primarily
focused on cooperation in small-scale, task-oriented games, overlooking how
altruism, which means sacrificing self-interest for collective benefit, emerges
in large-scale agent societies. To address this gap, we introduce a
Schelling-variant urban migration model that creates a social dilemma,
compelling over 200 LLM agents to navigate an explicit conflict between
egoistic (personal utility) and altruistic (system utility) goals. Our central
finding is a fundamental difference in the social tendencies of LLMs. We
identify two distinct archetypes: "Adaptive Egoists", which default to
prioritizing self-interest but whose altruistic behaviors significantly
increase under the influence of a social norm-setting message board; and
"Altruistic Optimizers", which exhibit an inherent altruistic logic,
consistently prioritizing collective benefit even at a direct cost to
themselves. Furthermore, to qualitatively analyze the cognitive underpinnings
of these decisions, we introduce a method inspired by Grounded Theory to
systematically code agent reasoning. In summary, this research provides the
first evidence of intrinsic heterogeneity in the egoistic and altruistic
tendencies of different LLMs. We propose that for social simulation, model
selection is not merely a matter of choosing reasoning capability, but of
choosing an intrinsic social action logic. While "Adaptive Egoists" may offer a
more suitable choice for simulating complex human societies, "Altruistic
Optimizers" are better suited for modeling idealized pro-social actors or
scenarios where collective welfare is the primary consideration.

### [207] [StepORLM: A Self-Evolving Framework With Generative Process Supervision For Operations Research Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22558)
*Chenyu Zhou,Tianyi Xu,Jianghao Lin,Dongdong Ge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StepORLM is a self-evolving framework that uses generative process supervision to train LLMs on OR problems, addressing limitations of traditional reinforcement learning methods through a co-evolutionary loop between policy and reward models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM training methods for OR problems face two key issues: outcome reward suffers from credit assignment problems (reinforcing flawed reasoning), and conventional process supervision is myopic and fails to evaluate interdependent steps holistically.

Method: StepORLM features a co-evolutionary loop where a policy model and generative process reward model (GenPRM) iteratively improve each other using dual-feedback: outcome-based verification from external solvers and holistic process evaluation from GenPRM, aligned via Weighted Direct Preference Optimization.

Result: The 8B-parameter StepORLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across six benchmarks, outperforming larger generalist models, agentic methods, and specialized baselines. The co-evolved GenPRM also serves as a powerful universal process verifier, boosting inference scaling for both StepORLM and other LLMs.

Conclusion: StepORLM's generative process supervision and co-evolutionary framework effectively addresses limitations of traditional OR training methods, demonstrating superior performance and creating universally applicable process verification capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities for solving
Operations Research (OR) problems. While reinforcement learning serves as a
powerful paradigm for LLM training on OR problems, existing works generally
face two key limitations. First, outcome reward suffers from the credit
assignment problem, where correct final answers can reinforce flawed reasoning.
Second, conventional discriminative process supervision is myopic, failing to
evaluate the interdependent steps of OR modeling holistically. To this end, we
introduce StepORLM, a novel self-evolving framework with generative process
supervision. At its core, StepORLM features a co-evolutionary loop where a
policy model and a generative process reward model (GenPRM) iteratively improve
on each other. This loop is driven by a dual-feedback mechanism: definitive,
outcome-based verification from an external solver, and nuanced, holistic
process evaluation from the GenPRM. The combined signal is used to align the
policy via Weighted Direct Preference Optimization (W-DPO) and simultaneously
refine the GenPRM. Our resulting 8B-parameter StepORLM establishes a new
state-of-the-art across six benchmarks, significantly outperforming vastly
larger generalist models, agentic methods, and specialized baselines. Moreover,
the co-evolved GenPRM is able to act as a powerful and universally applicable
process verifier, substantially boosting the inference scaling performance of
both our own model and other existing LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UniMIC is a unified token-based multimodal interactive coding framework that enables efficient communication between edge devices and cloud AI agents using compact tokenized representations instead of raw pixels or text, achieving substantial bitrate savings while maintaining task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing codecs are optimized for unimodal, one-way communication and suffer from degradation in bidirectional multimodal interactions between humans and AI agents, creating a need for more efficient communication frameworks.

Method: UniMIC uses compact tokenized representations as communication medium and employs lightweight Transformer-based entropy models (generic, masked, and text-conditioned) to minimize inter-token redundancy and enhance compression.

Result: Extensive experiments show UniMIC achieves substantial bitrate savings and remains robust even at ultra-low bitrates (<0.05bpp) across text-to-image generation, text-guided inpainting, outpainting, and visual question answering tasks without compromising downstream performance.

Conclusion: UniMIC establishes a practical and forward-looking paradigm for next-generation multimodal interactive communication, bridging edge devices and cloud AI agents efficiently.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and cloud-based AI
agents is transforming human-AI collaboration into bidirectional, multimodal
interaction. However, existing codecs remain optimized for unimodal, one-way
communication, resulting in repeated degradation under conventional
compress-transmit-reconstruct pipelines. To address this limitation, we propose
UniMIC, a Unified token-based Multimodal Interactive Coding framework that
bridges edge devices and cloud AI agents. Instead of transmitting raw pixels or
plain text, UniMIC employs compact tokenized representations as the
communication medium, enabling efficient low-bitrate transmission while
maintaining compatibility with LMMs. To further enhance compression,
lightweight Transformer-based entropy models with scenario-specific
designs-generic, masked, and text-conditioned-effectively minimize inter-token
redundancy. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation, text-guided
inpainting, outpainting, and visual question answering show that UniMIC
achieves substantial bitrate savings and remains robust even at ultra-low
bitrates (<0.05bpp), without compromising downstream task performance. These
results establish UniMIC as a practical and forward-looking paradigm for
next-generation multimodal interactive communication.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Dynamic Experts Search (DES) is a test-time scaling strategy that leverages Mixture-of-Experts architecture to generate diverse reasoning paths by controlling expert activation counts during inference, improving accuracy and stability without extra computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time scaling approaches focus on output-level sampling but ignore model architecture. The authors observed that varying activated expert counts in MoE LLMs creates complementary solution sets with stable accuracy, revealing an underexplored source of diversity.

Method: DES consists of two components: (1) Dynamic MoE - enables direct control of expert counts during inference to generate diverse reasoning trajectories, (2) Expert Configuration Inheritance - maintains consistent expert counts within reasoning paths while varying them across runs to balance stability and diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments across MoE architectures, verifiers, and reasoning benchmarks (math, code, knowledge) show DES reliably outperforms TTS baselines, enhancing accuracy and stability without additional computational cost.

Conclusion: DES represents a practical and scalable architecture-aware test-time scaling approach, demonstrating how structural flexibility in modern LLMs can advance reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) enhances the reasoning ability of large language
models (LLMs) by allocating additional computation during inference. However,
existing approaches primarily rely on output-level sampling while overlooking
the role of model architecture. In mainstream Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs, we
observe that varying the number of activated experts yields complementary
solution sets with stable accuracy, revealing a new and underexplored source of
diversity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Dynamic Experts Search
(DES), a TTS strategy that elevates expert activation into a controllable
dimension of the search space. DES integrates two key components: (1) Dynamic
MoE, which enables direct control of expert counts during inference to generate
diverse reasoning trajectories without additional cost; and (2) Expert
Configuration Inheritance, which preserves consistent expert counts within a
reasoning path while varying them across runs, thereby balancing stability and
diversity throughout the search. Extensive experiments across MoE
architectures, verifiers and reasoning benchmarks (i.e., math, code and
knowledge) demonstrate that DES reliably outperforms TTS baselines, enhancing
accuracy and stability without additional cost. These results highlight DES as
a practical and scalable form of architecture-aware TTS, illustrating how
structural flexibility in modern LLMs can advance reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the theoretical basis for RL methods in LLM planning, revealing that RL achieves correct planning through exploration while avoiding spurious solutions from SFT, but PG suffers from diversity collapse while Q-learning preserves diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the theoretical basis for why RL methods enhance LLM planning capabilities, as current understanding of their effectiveness remains elusive despite practical successes.

Method: Theoretical analysis using a tractable graph-based abstraction, focusing on policy gradient and Q-learning methods, with application to the Blocksworld planning benchmark.

Result: SFT introduces co-occurrence-based spurious solutions while RL achieves correct planning through exploration. PG suffers from diversity collapse, but Q-learning preserves diversity through off-policy learning and careful reward design prevents reward hacking.

Conclusion: RL's effectiveness in LLM planning stems from exploration, with Q-learning offering advantages over PG in diversity preservation, though careful reward design is crucial to prevent exploitation.

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) methods have substantially enhanced the
planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the theoretical
basis for their effectiveness remains elusive. In this work, we investigate
RL's benefits and limitations through a tractable graph-based abstraction,
focusing on policy gradient (PG) and Q-learning methods. Our theoretical
analyses reveal that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may introduce
co-occurrence-based spurious solutions, whereas RL achieves correct planning
primarily through exploration, underscoring exploration's role in enabling
better generalization. However, we also show that PG suffers from diversity
collapse, where output diversity decreases during training and persists even
after perfect accuracy is attained. By contrast, Q-learning provides two key
advantages: off-policy learning and diversity preservation at convergence. We
further demonstrate that careful reward design is necessary to prevent reward
hacking in Q-learning. Finally, applying our framework to the real-world
planning benchmark Blocksworld, we confirm that these behaviors manifest in
practice.

TL;DR: VISION is an autonomous inspection system that uses vision-language models and constrained viewpoint planning to inspect culverts, achieving 80% expert agreement after re-imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human inspection of culverts is challenging due to age, geometry, poor illumination, weather, and lack of easy access, necessitating an autonomous solution.

Method: Couples web-scale vision-language models with constrained viewpoint planning, using prompts to solicit ROI proposals, stereo depth for scale recovery, and a planner for repositioning to capture targeted close-ups.

Result: Achieved 61.4% initial agreement with experts and 80% after re-imaging, demonstrating conversion of tentative hypotheses into expert-aligned findings.

Conclusion: VISION successfully closes the see, decide, move, re-image loop for autonomous culvert inspection without domain-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: Culverts on canals such as the Erie Canal, built originally in 1825, require
frequent inspections to ensure safe operation. Human inspection of culverts is
challenging due to age, geometry, poor illumination, weather, and lack of easy
access. We introduce VISION, an end-to-end, language-in-the-loop autonomy
system that couples a web-scale vision-language model (VLM) with constrained
viewpoint planning for autonomous inspection of culverts. Brief prompts to the
VLM solicit open-vocabulary ROI proposals with rationales and confidences,
stereo depth is fused to recover scale, and a planner -- aware of culvert
constraints -- commands repositioning moves to capture targeted close-ups.
Deployed on a quadruped in a culvert under the Erie Canal, VISION closes the
see, decide, move, re-image loop on-board and produces high-resolution images
for detailed reporting without domain-specific fine-tuning. In an external
evaluation by New York Canal Corporation personnel, initial ROI proposals
achieved 61.4\% agreement with subject-matter experts, and final
post-re-imaging assessments reached 80\%, indicating that VISION converts
tentative hypotheses into grounded, expert-aligned findings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create robots that can change shape to access different environments and use shape transformation for locomotion, while addressing the challenge of high degrees of freedom in origami surfaces that typically require many actuators.

Method: Combines origami surface compliance with geometric compliant skeleton, uses mono-actuated design with central gearbox mechanism, and explores alternative cable-driven actuation methods for surface transformation.

Result: Developed a functional GeoGami platform capable of shape transformation and rolling locomotion using a single actuator, with demonstrated capabilities and stiffness modeling.

Conclusion: The GeoGami platform enables new robotic capabilities for shape-changing robots that can adapt to different environments and use transformation for locomotion, achieved through innovative origami-compliant skeleton integration.

Abstract: This paper presents the design of a new soft-rigid robotic platform,
"GeoGami". We leverage origami surface capabilities to achieve shape
contraction and to support locomotion with underactuated forms. A key challenge
is that origami surfaces have high degrees of freedom and typically require
many actuators; we address repeatability by integrating surface compliance. We
propose a mono-actuated GeoGami mobile platform that combines origami surface
compliance with a geometric compliant skeleton, enabling the robot to transform
and locomote using a single actuator. We demonstrate the robot, develop a
stiffness model, and describe the central gearbox mechanism. We also analyze
alternative cable-driven actuation methods for the skeleton to enable surface
transformation. Finally, we evaluate the GeoGami platform for capabilities,
including shape transformation and rolling. This platform opens new
capabilities for robots that change shape to access different environments and
that use shape transformation for locomotion.

*Peiwen Yang,Weisong Wen,Runqiu Yang,Yingming Chen,Cheuk Chi Tsang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a suction-compensated model predictive control (SC-MPC) framework for quadrotors operating near walls, addressing aerodynamic suction forces that cause destabilization. The solution includes a physics-based suction force model and SC-MPC controller that significantly improves trajectory tracking accuracy compared to PID and standard MPC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quadrotors operating near walls in urban/indoor environments face unmodeled aerodynamic effects from wall-proximity, generating complex vortices and destabilizing suction forces that can lead to hazardous vibrations or collisions during inspection and search-and-rescue missions.

Method: Developed a physics-based suction force model characterizing dependency on rotor speed and wall distance, and a suction-compensated MPC (SC-MPC) framework using factor graph optimization that integrates system dynamics, trajectory tracking, control smoothness, and actuator limits. Model parameters were identified through extensive experimental measurements.

Result: SC-MPC achieved 2.1 cm RMSE in X-axis and 2.0 cm RMSE in Y-axis position control - representing 74% and 79% improvements over PID control, and 60% and 53% improvements over standard MPC. MAE metrics (1.2 cm X-axis, 1.4 cm Y-axis) similarly outperformed both baselines.

Conclusion: The SC-MPC framework effectively addresses wall-proximity aerodynamic challenges, significantly improving quadrotor stability and trajectory tracking accuracy. The complete implementation has been open-sourced to facilitate community adoption and reproducibility.

Abstract: The safe operation of quadrotors in near-wall urban or indoor environments
(e.g., inspection and search-and-rescue missions) is challenged by unmodeled
aerodynamic effects arising from wall-proximity. It generates complex vortices
that induce destabilizing suction forces, potentially leading to hazardous
vibrations or collisions. This paper presents a comprehensive solution
featuring (1) a physics-based suction force model that explicitly characterizes
the dependency on both rotor speed and wall distance, and (2) a
suction-compensated model predictive control (SC-MPC) framework designed to
ensure accurate and stable trajectory tracking during wall-proximity
operations. The proposed SC-MPC framework incorporates an enhanced dynamics
model that accounts for suction force effects, formulated as a factor graph
optimization problem integrating system dynamics constraints, trajectory
tracking objectives, control input smoothness requirements, and actuator
physical limitations. The suction force model parameters are systematically
identified through extensive experimental measurements across varying
operational conditions. Experimental validation demonstrates SC-MPC's superior
performance, achieving 2.1 cm root mean squared error (RMSE) in X-axis and 2.0
cm RMSE in Y-axis position control - representing 74% and 79% improvements over
cascaded proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, and 60% and 53%
improvements over standard MPC respectively. The corresponding mean absolute
error (MAE) metrics (1.2 cm X-axis, 1.4 cm Y-axis) similarly outperform both
baselines. The evaluation platform employs a ducted quadrotor design that
provides collision protection while maintaining aerodynamic efficiency. To
facilitate reproducibility and community adoption, we have open-sourced our
complete implementation, available at

*Xiaofan Yu,Yuwei Wu,Katherine Mao,Ye Tian,Vijay Kumar,Tajana Rosing*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DroneFL is the first federated learning framework for multi-UAV target tracking that uses lightweight local models with frozen YOLO backbone and shallow transformer, addresses data heterogeneity through position-invariant architecture, and achieves real-time performance with minimal cloud data transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-robot target tracking is crucial for applications like precision agriculture and surveillance, but existing approaches face challenges with limited computational resources, data heterogeneity in FL, and tight coupling between prediction and planning.

Method: Developed DroneFL with lightweight local models using frozen YOLO backbone and shallow transformer for onboard training, position-invariant architecture with altitude-based adaptive instance normalization to handle data heterogeneity, and cloud-based model aggregation and trajectory optimization.

Result: DroneFL reduces prediction error by 6%-83% and tracking distance by 0.4%-4.6% compared to non-FL approaches, runs in real-time on Raspberry Pi 5, and maintains only 1.56 KBps average data rate to cloud.

Conclusion: DroneFL successfully addresses key challenges in multi-UAV target tracking through efficient federated learning, demonstrating significant performance improvements while maintaining practical computational and communication efficiency.

Abstract: Multi-robot target tracking is a fundamental problem that requires
coordinated monitoring of dynamic entities in applications such as precision
agriculture, environmental monitoring, disaster response, and security
surveillance. While Federated Learning (FL) has the potential to enhance
learning across multiple robots without centralized data aggregation, its use
in multi-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) target tracking remains largely
underexplored. Key challenges include limited onboard computational resources,
significant data heterogeneity in FL due to varying targets and the fields of
view, and the need for tight coupling between trajectory prediction and
multi-robot planning. In this paper, we introduce DroneFL, the first federated
learning framework specifically designed for efficient multi-UAV target
tracking. We design a lightweight local model to predict target trajectories
from sensor inputs, using a frozen YOLO backbone and a shallow transformer for
efficient onboard training. The updated models are periodically aggregated in
the cloud for global knowledge sharing. To alleviate the data heterogeneity
that hinders FL convergence, DroneFL introduces a position-invariant model
architecture with altitude-based adaptive instance normalization. Finally, we
fuse predictions from multiple UAVs in the cloud and generate optimal
trajectories that balance target prediction accuracy and overall tracking
performance. Our results show that DroneFL reduces prediction error by 6%-83%
and tracking distance by 0.4%-4.6% compared to a distributed non-FL framework.
In terms of efficiency, DroneFL runs in real time on a Raspberry Pi 5 and has
on average just 1.56 KBps data rate to the cloud.

*Jinbang Huang,Zhiyuan Li,Zhanguang Zhang,Xingyue Quan,Jianye Hao,Yingxue Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Plan2Evolve is an LLM self-evolving framework that generates planning domains to create reasoning data for fine-tuning, improving robotic task planning without human supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches treat planning domains as search utilities rather than scalable reasoning data sources, and progress in reasoning LLMs relies on costly human-curated datasets.

Method: The base LLM generates planning domains that produce symbolic problem-plan pairs, which are transformed into chain-of-thought trajectories through natural-language explanations, aligning symbolic planning with language reasoning.

Result: The framework enables model fine-tuning that yields improved planning success, stronger cross-task generalization, and reduced inference costs.

Conclusion: Plan2Evolve demonstrates that LLMs can self-evolve by generating their own reasoning data, achieving better planning performance without human supervision.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown strong potential in robotic
task planning, particularly through automatic planning domain generation that
integrates symbolic search. Prior approaches, however, have largely treated
these domains as search utilities, with limited attention to their potential as
scalable sources of reasoning data. At the same time, progress in reasoning
LLMs has been driven by chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision, whose application
in robotics remains dependent on costly, human-curated datasets. We propose
Plan2Evolve, an LLM self-evolving framework in which the base model generates
planning domains that serve as engines for producing symbolic problem-plan
pairs as reasoning traces. These pairs are then transformed into extended CoT
trajectories by the same model through natural-language explanations, thereby
explicitly aligning symbolic planning structures with natural language
reasoning. The resulting data extend beyond the model's intrinsic planning
capacity, enabling model fine-tuning that yields a planning-enhanced LLM with
improved planning success, stronger cross-task generalization, and reduced
inference costs.

Conclusion: PL-VIWO2 provides a robust solution for visual-inertial-wheel odometry that maintains real-time performance while achieving superior accuracy and robustness in complex urban environments for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Vision-based odometry has been widely adopted in autonomous driving owing to
its low cost and lightweight setup; however, its performance often degrades in
complex outdoor urban environments. To address these challenges, we propose
PL-VIWO2, a filter-based visual-inertial-wheel odometry system that integrates

*HaoZhe Xu,Cheng Cheng,HongRui Sang,Zhipeng Wang,Qiyong He,Xiuxian Li,Bin He*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes an autonomous UAV-quadruped docking framework for GPS-denied environments that enables UAVs to land on quadruped robots in complex terrains through active torso stabilization and a three-phase docking strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing docking approaches primarily target wheeled platforms with limited mobility in complex terrains, while quadruped robots offer superior adaptability but suffer from frequent posture variations that make them unstable landing surfaces for UAVs.

Method: Uses a Hybrid Internal Model with Horizontal Alignment (HIM-HA) learned via deep reinforcement learning to stabilize the quadruped's torso, and a three-phase UAV strategy: long-range acquisition with YOLOv8 detector, close-range tracking with NFTSMC and barrier functions under FOV constraints, and terminal descent with Safety Period mechanism.

Result: Successfully validated in simulation and real-world scenarios, achieving docking on outdoor staircases higher than 17 cm and rough slopes steeper than 30 degrees.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables reliable autonomous docking between UAVs and quadruped robots in challenging GPS-denied environments with complex terrain conditions.

Abstract: Autonomous docking between Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and ground robots
is essential for heterogeneous systems, yet most existing approaches target
wheeled platforms whose limited mobility constrains exploration in complex
terrains. Quadruped robots offer superior adaptability but undergo frequent
posture variations, making it difficult to provide a stable landing surface for
UAVs. To address these challenges, we propose an autonomous UAV-quadruped
docking framework for GPS-denied environments. On the quadruped side, a Hybrid
Internal Model with Horizontal Alignment (HIM-HA), learned via deep
reinforcement learning, actively stabilizes the torso to provide a level
platform. On the UAV side, a three-phase strategy is adopted, consisting of
long-range acquisition with a median-filtered YOLOv8 detector, close-range
tracking with a constraint-aware controller that integrates a Nonsingular Fast
Terminal Sliding Mode Controller (NFTSMC) and a logarithmic Barrier Function
(BF) to guarantee finite-time error convergence under field-of-view (FOV)
constraints, and terminal descent guided by a Safety Period (SP) mechanism that
jointly verifies tracking accuracy and platform stability. The proposed
framework is validated in both simulation and real-world scenarios,
successfully achieving docking on outdoor staircases higher than 17 cm and
rough slopes steeper than 30 degrees. Supplementary materials and videos are

*Yang Jiao,Yiding Qiu,Henrik I. Christensen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes using LLMs to provide commonsense geometric priors (size and orientation) for object-level SLAM, improving accuracy by 36.8% when object observations are sparse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object-level SLAM faces under-constrained optimization due to sparse observations. Traditional commonsense knowledge priors are labor-intensive to obtain and lack generalizability across diverse object categories.

Method: Leverage large language models to provide commonsense knowledge of object geometric attributes (size and orientation) as prior factors in a graph-based SLAM framework, integrated with a complete pipeline for robust data association on sparse object-level features.

Result: Evaluation on TUM RGB-D and 3RScan datasets shows 36.8% improvement in mapping accuracy over the latest baseline. Real-world experiments demonstrate real-time performance.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively provide commonsense geometric priors that significantly improve object-level SLAM performance, especially during initial phases with limited object observations.

Abstract: Object-level Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), which incorporates
semantic information for high-level scene understanding, faces challenges of
under-constrained optimization due to sparse observations. Prior work has
introduced additional constraints using commonsense knowledge, but obtaining
such priors has traditionally been labor-intensive and lacks generalizability
across diverse object categories. We address this limitation by leveraging
large language models (LLMs) to provide commonsense knowledge of object
geometric attributes, specifically size and orientation, as prior factors in a
graph-based SLAM framework. These priors are particularly beneficial during the
initial phase when object observations are limited. We implement a complete
pipeline integrating these priors, achieving robust data association on sparse
object-level features and enabling real-time object SLAM. Our system, evaluated
on the TUM RGB-D and 3RScan datasets, improves mapping accuracy by 36.8\% over
the latest baseline. Additionally, we present real-world experiments in the
supplementary video, demonstrating its real-time performance.

### [219] [Generating Stable Placements via Physics-guided Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21664)
*Philippe Nadeau,Miguel Rogel,Ivan Bilić,Ivan Petrović,Jonathan Kelly*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a diffusion model-based approach for stable object placement in robotic manipulation that integrates stability directly into the sampling process, achieving 56% more robust placements and 47% runtime reduction compared to state-of-the-art geometric methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for assessing object placement stability rely on simulation engines or heuristic appearance-based assessments, which can be inefficient or inaccurate. The authors aim to directly incorporate stability considerations into the placement generation process.

Method: The approach trains a diffusion model conditioned on scene and object point clouds to generate stable placements. It uses an offline sampling-based planner to gather multi-modal placement labels and leverages the compositional nature of score-based generative models to combine the learned prior with a stability-aware loss.

Result: The method achieves placements that are 56% more robust to forceful perturbations while reducing runtime by 47% compared to state-of-the-art geometric methods across four benchmark scenes where stability can be accurately computed.

Conclusion: The proposed physics-guided diffusion model successfully integrates stability directly into the sampling process, requiring no additional re-training or fine-tuning, and can be directly applied to off-the-shelf models for improved robotic manipulation performance.

Abstract: Stably placing an object in a multi-object scene is a fundamental challenge
in robotic manipulation, as placements must be penetration-free, establish
precise surface contact, and result in a force equilibrium. To assess
stability, existing methods rely on running a simulation engine or resort to
heuristic, appearance-based assessments. In contrast, our approach integrates
stability directly into the sampling process of a diffusion model. To this end,
we query an offline sampling-based planner to gather multi-modal placement
labels and train a diffusion model to generate stable placements. The diffusion
model is conditioned on scene and object point clouds, and serves as a
geometry-aware prior. We leverage the compositional nature of score-based
generative models to combine this learned prior with a stability-aware loss,
thereby increasing the likelihood of sampling from regions of high stability.
Importantly, this strategy requires no additional re-training or fine-tuning,
and can be directly applied to off-the-shelf models. We evaluate our method on
four benchmark scenes where stability can be accurately computed. Our
physics-guided models achieve placements that are 56% more robust to forceful
perturbations while reducing runtime by 47% compared to a state-of-the-art
geometric method.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning framework for humanoid table tennis that maps ball positions directly to whole-body joint commands, using predictive signals and physics-guided rewards to achieve coordinated striking and locomotion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid table tennis requires rapid perception, proactive motion, and agile footwork under strict timing constraints, which are difficult for unified controllers to achieve.

Method: Uses RL with ball-position observations mapped to joint commands, augmented by a lightweight learned predictor for future ball states and physics-based predictor for dense rewards during training.

Result: Achieves hit rate ≥96% and success rate ≥92% in simulations, with zero-shot deployment on physical humanoid showing coordinated footwork and accurate returns.

Conclusion: The predictive reward design and learned predictor are critical for end-to-end learning, providing a practical path toward versatile competitive humanoid table tennis.

Abstract: Humanoid table tennis (TT) demands rapid perception, proactive whole-body
motion, and agile footwork under strict timing -- capabilities that remain
difficult for unified controllers. We propose a reinforcement learning
framework that maps ball-position observations directly to whole-body joint
commands for both arm striking and leg locomotion, strengthened by predictive
signals and dense, physics-guided rewards. A lightweight learned predictor, fed
with recent ball positions, estimates future ball states and augments the
policy's observations for proactive decision-making. During training, a
physics-based predictor supplies precise future states to construct dense,
informative rewards that lead to effective exploration. The resulting policy
attains strong performance across varied serve ranges (hit rate $\geq$ 96% and
success rate $\geq$ 92%) in simulations. Ablation studies confirm that both the
learned predictor and the predictive reward design are critical for end-to-end
learning. Deployed zero-shot on a physical Booster T1 humanoid with 23 revolute
joints, the policy produces coordinated lateral and forward-backward footwork
with accurate, fast returns, suggesting a practical path toward versatile,
competitive humanoid TT.

*Huayi Zhou,Kui Jia*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VLBiMan is a framework that learns reusable bimanual manipulation skills from just one human demonstration by decomposing tasks into invariant primitives and dynamically adapting components using vision-language grounding, enabling robust generalization across diverse scenarios without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing approaches that either require extensive demonstrations for imitation learning or lack flexibility in modular methods, particularly for bimanual manipulation in dynamic, unstructured environments with varying embodiments.

Method: Task-aware decomposition of demonstrations into reusable skills, preserving invariant primitives while dynamically adapting adjustable components through vision-language grounding, semantic parsing, and geometric feasibility constraints. Inherits human-like hybrid control for mixed synchronous/asynchronous arm use.

Result: Significant reduction in demonstration requirements, compositional generalization for long-horizon tasks, robustness to novel objects and disturbances, and strong cross-embodiment transfer without retraining across tool-use and multi-object tasks.

Conclusion: VLBiMan bridges human priors with vision-language anchored adaptation to enable practical and versatile dual-arm manipulation in unstructured settings, representing a step toward generalizable bimanual manipulation systems.

Abstract: Achieving generalizable bimanual manipulation requires systems that can learn
efficiently from minimal human input while adapting to real-world uncertainties
and diverse embodiments. Existing approaches face a dilemma: imitation policy
learning demands extensive demonstrations to cover task variations, while
modular methods often lack flexibility in dynamic scenes. We introduce VLBiMan,
a framework that derives reusable skills from a single human example through
task-aware decomposition, preserving invariant primitives as anchors while
dynamically adapting adjustable components via vision-language grounding. This
adaptation mechanism resolves scene ambiguities caused by background changes,
object repositioning, or visual clutter without policy retraining, leveraging
semantic parsing and geometric feasibility constraints. Moreover, the system
inherits human-like hybrid control capabilities, enabling mixed synchronous and
asynchronous use of both arms. Extensive experiments validate VLBiMan across
tool-use and multi-object tasks, demonstrating: (1) a drastic reduction in
demonstration requirements compared to imitation baselines, (2) compositional
generalization through atomic skill splicing for long-horizon tasks, (3)
robustness to novel but semantically similar objects and external disturbances,
and (4) strong cross-embodiment transfer, showing that skills learned from
human demonstrations can be instantiated on different robotic platforms without
retraining. By bridging human priors with vision-language anchored adaptation,
our work takes a step toward practical and versatile dual-arm manipulation in
unstructured settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Playful deception is common in human social interactions but underexplored in HRI. The study aims to investigate how culturally familiar forms of deception affect user trust, enjoyment, and engagement during robotic handovers.

Method: Designed a robotic manipulator with custom end-effector implementing five Turkish Ice Cream-inspired trick policies that deceptively delay handovers. Conducted mixed-design user study with 91 participants to evaluate effects on user experience.

Result: TIC-inspired deception significantly enhances enjoyment and engagement but reduces perceived safety and trust, revealing a structured trade-off across multi-dimensional aspects of user experience.

Conclusion: Playful deception can be a valuable design strategy for interactive robots in entertainment and engagement-focused contexts, but requires deliberate consideration of its complex trade-offs between positive and negative user experience dimensions.

Abstract: Playful deception, a common feature in human social interactions, remains
underexplored in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Inspired by the Turkish Ice
Cream (TIC) vendor routine, we investigate how bounded, culturally familiar
forms of deception influence user trust, enjoyment, and engagement during
robotic handovers. We design a robotic manipulator equipped with a custom
end-effector and implement five TIC-inspired trick policies that deceptively
delay the handover of an ice cream-shaped object. Through a mixed-design user
study with 91 participants, we evaluate the effects of playful deception and
interaction duration on user experience. Results reveal that TIC-inspired
deception significantly enhances enjoyment and engagement, though reduces
perceived safety and trust, suggesting a structured trade-off across the
multi-dimensional aspects. Our findings demonstrate that playful deception can
be a valuable design strategy for interactive robots in entertainment and
engagement-focused contexts, while underscoring the importance of deliberate
consideration of its complex trade-offs. You can find more information,

TL;DR: A framework called Conditional Adversarial Motion Priors (CAMP) enables quadruped robots to learn multiple locomotion skills from demonstrations through skill-conditioned rewards and discriminators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to acquire multiple locomotion skills through a single policy and lack smooth skill transitions, limiting legged robots' ability to navigate complex environments.

Method: Uses Conditional Adversarial Motion Priors (CAMP) with a novel skill discriminator and skill-conditioned reward design to reconstruct precise skills from expert demonstrations.

Result: Enables quadruped robots to efficiently acquire diverse locomotion skills and supports active control and reuse of multiple skills.

Conclusion: Provides a practical solution for learning generalizable policies in complex environments through multi-skill learning.

Abstract: Despite growing interest in developing legged robots that emulate biological
locomotion for agile navigation of complex environments, acquiring a diverse
repertoire of skills remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. Existing
methods can learn motion behaviors from expert data, but they often fail to
acquire multiple locomotion skills through a single policy and lack smooth
skill transitions. We propose a multi-skill learning framework based on
Conditional Adversarial Motion Priors (CAMP), with the aim of enabling
quadruped robots to efficiently acquire a diverse set of locomotion skills from
expert demonstrations. Precise skill reconstruction is achieved through a novel
skill discriminator and skill-conditioned reward design. The overall framework
supports the active control and reuse of multiple skills, providing a practical
solution for learning generalizable policies in complex environments.

*Nishant Doshi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Level-k game theory to improve lane change prediction accuracy by modeling vehicle interactions, combining game-theoretic reasoning with traditional classification models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional maneuver prediction models lack accuracy in lane change prediction because they don't incorporate full scene context and vehicle interactions.

Method: Uses Level-k game theory to model hierarchical reasoning and vehicle interactions, creating a prior that can be combined with traditional motion-based classification models through online optimization.

Result: Enables more accurate maneuver predictions by leveraging rational decision-making in multi-agent scenarios, which improves systems like Adaptive Cruise Control.

Conclusion: Game-theoretic approaches provide better lane change prediction accuracy by modeling vehicle interactions, leading to improved fuel savings in automotive systems.

Abstract: Conventional maneuver prediction methods use some sort of classification
model on temporal trajectory data to predict behavior of agents over a set time
horizon. Despite of having the best precision and recall, these models cannot
predict a lane change accurately unless they incorporate information about the
entire scene. Level-k game theory can leverage the human-like hierarchical
reasoning to come up with the most rational decisions each agent can make in a
group. This can be leveraged to model interactions between different vehicles
in presence of each other and hence compute the most rational decisions each
agent would make. The result of game theoretic evaluation can be used as a
"prior" or combined with a traditional motion-based classification model to
achieve more accurate predictions. The proposed approach assumes that the
states of the vehicles around the target lead vehicle are known. The module
will output the most rational maneuver prediction of the target vehicle based
on an online optimization solution. These predictions are instrumental in
decision making systems like Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) or Traxen's
iQ-Cruise further improving the resulting fuel savings.

TL;DR: WAVE is a variable stiffness actuator using a worm gear to decouple motors from external forces, enabling precise force transmission while absorbing impacts through elastic energy storage and continuous stiffness modulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop robotic manipulators with enhanced safety and versatility through better compliance and stiffness regulation, particularly for contact-intensive tasks in challenging environments.

Method: Integrates a non-backdrivable worm gear to decouple the driving motor from external forces, uses spring-based elastic energy storage to absorb impacts, and modulates joint stiffness by changing spring precompression length.

Result: Experimental validation shows motor loads approach zero at rest even under external loading, successful decoupling of external forces, and extended operation in contact-intensive tasks.

Conclusion: WAVE actuator successfully demonstrates protective capabilities for robust robotic applications through force decoupling and variable stiffness control.

Abstract: Robotic manipulators capable of regulating both compliance and stiffness
offer enhanced operational safety and versatility. Here, we introduce Worm
Gear-based Adaptive Variable Elasticity (WAVE), a variable stiffness actuator
(VSA) that integrates a non-backdrivable worm gear. By decoupling the driving
motor from external forces using this gear, WAVE enables precise force
transmission to the joint, while absorbing positional discrepancies through
compliance. WAVE is protected from excessive loads by converting impact forces
into elastic energy stored in a spring. In addition, the actuator achieves
continuous joint stiffness modulation by changing the spring's precompression
length. We demonstrate these capabilities, experimentally validate the proposed
stiffness model, show that motor loads approach zero at rest--even under
external loading--and present applications using a manipulator with WAVE. This
outcome showcases the successful decoupling of external forces. The protective
attributes of this actuator allow for extended operation in contact-intensive
tasks, and for robust robotic applications in challenging environments.

TL;DR: SAGE is a framework that uses semantic scene graphs to bridge task-level planning and pixel-level control for long-horizon manipulation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon manipulation tasks present a gap between high-level symbolic planning and low-level continuous control, with existing methods having limited generalization and adaptation to unseen tasks.

Method: SAGE uses semantic scene graphs as structural scene representations, combining a scene graph-based task planner (using VLMs and LLMs) with a decoupled structural image editing pipeline for sub-goal image synthesis.

Result: Extensive experiments show SAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance on distinct long-horizon manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: Semantic scene graphs effectively bridge task-level reasoning and visuo-motor control, enabling robust long-horizon manipulation through the SAGE framework.

Abstract: Successfully solving long-horizon manipulation tasks remains a fundamental
challenge. These tasks involve extended action sequences and complex object
interactions, presenting a critical gap between high-level symbolic planning
and low-level continuous control. To bridge this gap, two essential
capabilities are required: robust long-horizon task planning and effective
goal-conditioned manipulation. Existing task planning methods, including
traditional and LLM-based approaches, often exhibit limited generalization or
sparse semantic reasoning. Meanwhile, image-conditioned control methods
struggle to adapt to unseen tasks. To tackle these problems, we propose SAGE, a
novel framework for Scene Graph-Aware Guidance and Execution in Long-Horizon
Manipulation Tasks. SAGE utilizes semantic scene graphs as a structural
representation for scene states. A structural scene graph enables bridging
task-level semantic reasoning and pixel-level visuo-motor control. This also
facilitates the controllable synthesis of accurate, novel sub-goal images. SAGE
consists of two key components: (1) a scene graph-based task planner that uses
VLMs and LLMs to parse the environment and reason about physically-grounded
scene state transition sequences, and (2) a decoupled structural image editing
pipeline that controllably converts each target sub-goal graph into a
corresponding image through image inpainting and composition. Extensive
experiments have demonstrated that SAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance
on distinct long-horizon tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Learnable Conformal Prediction (LCP) replaces fixed nonconformity scores with a lightweight neural function to produce context-aware uncertainty sets, maintaining theoretical guarantees while significantly improving performance across robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in robotics output poorly calibrated confidences with no mechanism to quantify predictive reliability under novel, noisy, or out-of-distribution inputs. Standard conformal prediction uses fixed scores that ignore context and can yield overly conservative or unsafe intervals.

Method: LCP replaces fixed nonconformity scores with a lightweight neural function that leverages geometric, semantic, and task-specific features to produce context-aware uncertainty sets while maintaining conformal prediction's theoretical guarantees.

Result: LCP reduces prediction set sizes by 18% in classification, tightens detection intervals by 52%, and improves path planning safety from 72% to 91% success. It achieves 4.7-9.9% smaller set sizes on CIFAR-100/ImageNet, 46-54% tighter bounding boxes on COCO/BDD100K/Cityscapes, and 91.5% path planning success with only 4.5% path inflation.

Conclusion: LCP consistently outperforms Standard CP and ensemble baselines across three robotic tasks on seven benchmarks, with minimal overhead (4.8% runtime, 42KB memory) and supports online adaptation, making it suitable for resource-constrained autonomous systems.

Abstract: Deep learning models in robotics often output point estimates with poorly
calibrated confidences, offering no native mechanism to quantify predictive
reliability under novel, noisy, or out-of-distribution inputs. Conformal
prediction (CP) addresses this gap by providing distribution-free coverage
guarantees, yet its reliance on fixed nonconformity scores ignores context and
can yield intervals that are overly conservative or unsafe. We address this
with Learnable Conformal Prediction (LCP), which replaces fixed scores with a
lightweight neural function that leverages geometric, semantic, and
task-specific features to produce context-aware uncertainty sets.
  LCP maintains CP's theoretical guarantees while reducing prediction set sizes
by 18% in classification, tightening detection intervals by 52%, and improving
path planning safety from 72% to 91% success with minimal overhead. Across
three robotic tasks on seven benchmarks, LCP consistently outperforms Standard
CP and ensemble baselines. In classification on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, it
achieves smaller set sizes (4.7-9.9% reduction) at target coverage. For object
detection on COCO, BDD100K, and Cityscapes, it produces 46-54% tighter bounding
boxes. In path planning through cluttered environments, it improves success to
91.5% with only 4.5% path inflation, compared to 12.2% for Standard CP.
  The method is lightweight (approximately 4.8% runtime overhead, 42 KB memory)
and supports online adaptation, making it well suited to resource-constrained
autonomous systems. Hardware evaluation shows LCP adds less than 1% memory and
15.9% inference overhead, yet sustains 39 FPS on detection tasks while being
7.4 times more energy-efficient than ensembles.

TL;DR: FlowDrive is a flow-matching trajectory planner that addresses data imbalance in driving datasets by using trajectory pattern reweighting and moderated guidance to increase diversity while maintaining scene consistency, achieving state-of-the-art performance on nuPlan and interPlan benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based planners are sensitive to the long-tailed distribution of driving data, where common maneuvers dominate datasets while dangerous or rare scenarios are sparse, leading to biased models that perform poorly on critical scenarios.

Method: FlowDrive uses flow-matching to learn a conditional rectified flow that maps noise directly to trajectory distributions with few flow-matching steps. It introduces moderated, in-the-loop guidance that injects small perturbations between flow steps to systematically increase trajectory diversity while remaining scene-consistent.

Result: On nuPlan and interPlan benchmarks, FlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art results among learning-based planners and approaches methods with rule-based refinements. With moderated guidance and light post-processing (FlowDrive*), it achieves overall state-of-the-art performance across nearly all benchmark splits.

Conclusion: FlowDrive demonstrates that addressing data imbalance through trajectory pattern reweighting and incorporating moderated guidance for diversity enhancement can significantly improve learning-based trajectory planning performance, achieving top results on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Learning-based planners are sensitive to the long-tailed distribution of
driving data. Common maneuvers dominate datasets, while dangerous or rare
scenarios are sparse. This imbalance can bias models toward the frequent cases
and degrade performance on critical scenarios. To tackle this problem, we
compare balancing strategies for sampling training data and find reweighting by
trajectory pattern an effective approach. We then present FlowDrive, a
flow-matching trajectory planner that learns a conditional rectified flow to
map noise directly to trajectory distributions with few flow-matching steps. We
further introduce moderated, in-the-loop guidance that injects small
perturbation between flow steps to systematically increase trajectory diversity
while remaining scene-consistent. On nuPlan and the interaction-focused
interPlan benchmarks, FlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art results among
learning-based planners and approaches methods with rule-based refinements.
After adding moderated guidance and light post-processing (FlowDrive*), it
achieves overall state-of-the-art performance across nearly all benchmark
splits.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Hybrid diffusion model combining continuous trajectory generation with symbolic planning outperforms baselines on long-horizon robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models struggle with long-horizon tasks involving complex decision-making and tend to confuse different behavior modes, leading to failure.

Method: Augment continuous trajectory generation by simultaneously generating high-level symbolic plans using a novel mix of discrete variable diffusion and continuous diffusion.

Result: The hybrid diffusion process dramatically outperforms baselines and enables flexible trajectory synthesis conditioned on partial and complete symbolic conditions.

Conclusion: Combining continuous trajectory generation with symbolic planning through hybrid diffusion effectively addresses limitations of pure diffusion models for long-horizon robotic tasks.

Abstract: Constructing robots to accomplish long-horizon tasks is a long-standing
challenge within artificial intelligence. Approaches using generative methods,
particularly Diffusion Models, have gained attention due to their ability to
model continuous robotic trajectories for planning and control. However, we
show that these models struggle with long-horizon tasks that involve complex
decision-making and, in general, are prone to confusing different modes of
behavior, leading to failure. To remedy this, we propose to augment continuous
trajectory generation by simultaneously generating a high-level symbolic plan.
We show that this requires a novel mix of discrete variable diffusion and
continuous diffusion, which dramatically outperforms the baselines. In
addition, we illustrate how this hybrid diffusion process enables flexible
trajectory synthesis, allowing us to condition synthesized actions on partial
and complete symbolic conditions.

### [230] [Developing Vision-Language-Action Model from Egocentric Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21986)
*Tomoya Yoshida,Shuhei Kurita,Taichi Nishimura,Shinsuke Mori*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Egocentric videos provide scalable training data for Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) without needing costly manual teleoperation. Using EgoScaler to extract 6DoF object manipulation trajectories from raw videos, the authors create a large-scale dataset that improves VLA performance by 20+% and competes with real-robot data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA training relies on expensive expert teleoperation, while egocentric videos offer a scalable alternative but typically require auxiliary annotations. The goal is to determine if VLAs can be trained directly from raw egocentric videos without such annotations.

Method: Leverage EgoScaler framework to extract 6DoF object manipulation trajectories from four large-scale egocentric video datasets, automatically refining noisy trajectories to create a new VLA pre-training dataset.

Result: Pre-training on the egocentric dataset improves task success rates by over 20% compared to training from scratch, performs competitively with real-robot datasets, and combining both yields further improvements in both simulated and real-robot environments.

Conclusion: Egocentric videos constitute a promising and scalable resource for advancing VLA research, offering performance comparable to real-robot data while being more cost-effective and scalable.

Abstract: Egocentric videos capture how humans manipulate objects and tools, providing
diverse motion cues for learning object manipulation. Unlike the costly,
expert-driven manual teleoperation commonly used in training
Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs), egocentric videos offer a scalable
alternative. However, prior studies that leverage such videos for training
robot policies typically rely on auxiliary annotations, such as detailed
hand-pose recordings. Consequently, it remains unclear whether VLAs can be
trained directly from raw egocentric videos. In this work, we address this
challenge by leveraging EgoScaler, a framework that extracts 6DoF object
manipulation trajectories from egocentric videos without requiring auxiliary
recordings. We apply EgoScaler to four large-scale egocentric video datasets
and automatically refine noisy or incomplete trajectories, thereby constructing
a new large-scale dataset for VLA pre-training. Our experiments with a
state-of-the-art $\pi_0$ architecture in both simulated and real-robot
environments yield three key findings: (i) pre-training on our dataset improves
task success rates by over 20\% compared to training from scratch, (ii) the
performance is competitive with that achieved using real-robot datasets, and
(iii) combining our dataset with real-robot data yields further improvements.
These results demonstrate that egocentric videos constitute a promising and
scalable resource for advancing VLA research.

*Yuping Gu,Bangchao Huang,Haoran Sun,Ronghan Xu,Jiayi Yin,Wei Zhang,Fang Wan,Jia Pan,Chaoyang Song*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a computational method for designing 1-DoF overconstrained robotic limbs that achieve energy-efficient, self-collision-free motion for spatial trajectories, validated through hexapod robots and personalized automata.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design simple, robust, and cost-effective 1-DoF robotic limbs that overcome motion constraints and self-collision issues while maintaining motion diversity through overconstrained linkage mechanisms.

Method: A computational approach involving geometric optimization for self-collision-free linkage design, spatial trajectory generation with similarity and dynamic metrics optimization, and geometric shape optimization for smooth motion driven by a single actuator.

Result: The method successfully created overconstrained robotic limbs that demonstrated outstanding energy efficiency during forward walking in hexapod robots, with validation through various experiments including personalized automata.

Conclusion: The proposed computational approach enables the design of efficient 1-DoF overconstrained robotic limbs that achieve complex spatial trajectories while maintaining simplicity, robustness, and energy efficiency.

Abstract: While it is expected to build robotic limbs with multiple degrees of freedom
(DoF) inspired by nature, a single DoF design remains fundamental, providing
benefits that include, but are not limited to, simplicity, robustness,
cost-effectiveness, and efficiency. Mechanisms, especially those with multiple
links and revolute joints connected in closed loops, play an enabling factor in
introducing motion diversity for 1-DoF systems, which are usually constrained
by self-collision during a full-cycle range of motion. This study presents a
novel computational approach to designing one-degree-of-freedom (1-DoF)
overconstrained robotic limbs for a desired spatial trajectory, while achieving
energy-efficient, self-collision-free motion in full-cycle rotations. Firstly,
we present the geometric optimization problem of linkage-based robotic limbs in
a generalized formulation for self-collision-free design. Next, we formulate
the spatial trajectory generation problem with the overconstrained linkages by
optimizing the similarity and dynamic-related metrics. We further optimize the
geometric shape of the overconstrained linkage to ensure smooth and
collision-free motion driven by a single actuator. We validated our proposed
method through various experiments, including personalized automata and
bio-inspired hexapod robots. The resulting hexapod robot, featuring
overconstrained robotic limbs, demonstrated outstanding energy efficiency
during forward walking.

### [232] [An Adaptive ICP LiDAR Odometry Based on Reliable Initial Pose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22058)
*Qifeng Wang,Weigang Li,Lei Nie,Xin Xu,Wenping Liu,Zhe Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes an adaptive ICP-based LiDAR odometry method with reliable initial pose selection and dynamic threshold adjustment to improve registration accuracy in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ICP-based LiDAR odometry methods have issues with unreliable initial poses causing local optima convergence, and lack adaptive mechanisms for handling dynamic environments, leading to degraded registration accuracy.

Method: 1) Distributed coarse registration with density filtering for initial pose estimation, 2) Reliable initial pose selection by comparing with motion prediction pose, 3) Dynamic adaptive threshold adjustment using current and historical errors, 4) Point-to-plane adaptive ICP registration from current frame to local map.

Result: Extensive experiments on KITTI dataset show the proposed method outperforms existing approaches and significantly enhances LiDAR odometry accuracy.

Conclusion: The adaptive ICP-based method with reliable initial pose selection and dynamic threshold adjustment effectively addresses local optimum convergence and dynamic environment challenges, achieving superior LiDAR odometry performance.

Abstract: As a key technology for autonomous navigation and positioning in mobile
robots, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) odometry is widely used in
autonomous driving applications. The Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based
methods have become the core technique in LiDAR odometry due to their efficient
and accurate point cloud registration capability. However, some existing
ICP-based methods do not consider the reliability of the initial pose, which
may cause the method to converge to a local optimum. Furthermore, the absence
of an adaptive mechanism hinders the effective handling of complex dynamic
environments, resulting in a significant degradation of registration accuracy.
To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive ICP-based LiDAR
odometry method that relies on a reliable initial pose. First, distributed
coarse registration based on density filtering is employed to obtain the
initial pose estimation. The reliable initial pose is then selected by
comparing it with the motion prediction pose, reducing the initial error
between the source and target point clouds. Subsequently, by combining the
current and historical errors, the adaptive threshold is dynamically adjusted
to accommodate the real-time changes in the dynamic environment. Finally, based
on the reliable initial pose and the adaptive threshold, point-to-plane
adaptive ICP registration is performed from the current frame to the local map,
achieving high-precision alignment of the source and target point clouds.
Extensive experiments on the public KITTI dataset demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches and significantly enhances the accuracy
of LiDAR odometry.

### [233] [Effect of Gait Design on Proprioceptive Sensing of Terrain Properties in a Quadrupedal Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22065)
*Ethan Fulcher,J. Diego Caporale,Yifeng Zhang,John Ruck,Feifei Qian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper investigates how different gaits affect proprioceptive terrain sensing accuracy in legged robots, comparing a sensing-oriented crawl gait with a locomotion-oriented trot gait for measuring terrain properties during movement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance robotic exploration operations by understanding how legged robots can measure terrain properties during locomotion, enabling faster sampling and access to risky terrains.

Method: The study compares two gaits - Crawl N' Sense (sensing-oriented) and Trot-Walk (locomotion-oriented) - as a robot locomotes over different substrates including rigid surfaces, loose sand, and sand with synthetic crusts.

Result: Both gaits can measure consistent differences in substrate strength, but the trot gait shows larger magnitude and variance in measurements. The crawl gait detects brittle crust ruptures with significantly higher accuracy than the trot gait.

Conclusion: The findings inform gait design for legged robots to enable effective terrain sensing during locomotion, advancing scientific exploration of planetary geology.

Abstract: In-situ robotic exploration is an important tool for advancing knowledge of
geological processes that describe the Earth and other Planetary bodies. To
inform and enhance operations for these roving laboratories, it is imperative
to understand the terramechanical properties of their environments, especially
for traversing on loose, deformable substrates. Recent research suggested that
legged robots with direct-drive and low-gear ratio actuators can sensitively
detect external forces, and therefore possess the potential to measure terrain
properties with their legs during locomotion, providing unprecedented sampling
speed and density while accessing terrains previously too risky to sample. This
paper explores these ideas by investigating the impact of gait on
proprioceptive terrain sensing accuracy, particularly comparing a
sensing-oriented gait, Crawl N' Sense, with a locomotion-oriented gait,
Trot-Walk. Each gait's ability to measure the strength and texture of
deformable substrate is quantified as the robot locomotes over a laboratory
transect consisting of a rigid surface, loose sand, and loose sand with
synthetic surface crusts. Our results suggest that with both the
sensing-oriented crawling gait and locomotion-oriented trot gait, the robot can
measure a consistent difference in the strength (in terms of penetration
resistance) between the low- and high-resistance substrates; however, the
locomotion-oriented trot gait contains larger magnitude and variance in
measurements. Furthermore, the slower crawl gait can detect brittle ruptures of
the surface crusts with significantly higher accuracy than the faster trot
gait. Our results offer new insights that inform legged robot "sensing during
locomotion" gait design and planning for scouting the terrain and producing
scientific measurements on other worlds to advance our understanding of their
geology and formation.

*Xiaohuan Pei,Yuxing Chen,Siyu Xu,Yunke Wang,Yuheng Shi,Chang Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ADP is a multi-modal pruning framework that dynamically adjusts visual token retention based on action trajectories, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining performance in robotic manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for optimizing Vision-Language-Action models overlook the varying visual redundancy across different robotic manipulation stages, where coarse manipulation phases have higher redundancy than fine-grained operations.

Method: Proposes Action-aware Dynamic Pruning (ADP) with text-driven token selection and action-aware trajectory gating that conditions pruning signals on recent action trajectories to adaptively adjust token retention ratios.

Result: Achieves 1.35× speed up on OpenVLA-OFT while maintaining competitive success rates, with 25.8% improvements on OpenVLA compared to baselines, significantly reducing FLOPs and action inference latency.

Conclusion: ADP provides a simple plug-in path to efficient robot policies that advances both efficiency and performance in robotic manipulation, demonstrated across LIBERO suites and real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation with Vision-Language-Action models requires efficient
inference over long-horizon multi-modal context, where attention to dense
visual tokens dominates computational cost. Existing methods optimize inference
speed by reducing visual redundancy within VLA models, but they overlook the
varying redundancy across robotic manipulation stages. We observe that the
visual token redundancy is higher in coarse manipulation phase than in
fine-grained operations, and is strongly correlated with the action dynamic.
Motivated by this observation, we propose \textbf{A}ction-aware
\textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{P}runing (\textbf{ADP}), a multi-modal pruning
framework that integrates text-driven token selection with action-aware
trajectory gating. Our method introduces a gating mechanism that conditions the
pruning signal on recent action trajectories, using past motion windows to
adaptively adjust token retention ratios in accordance with dynamics, thereby
balancing computational efficiency and perceptual precision across different
manipulation stages. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO suites and diverse
real-world scenarios demonstrate that our method significantly reduces FLOPs
and action inference latency (\textit{e.g.} $1.35 \times$ speed up on
OpenVLA-OFT) while maintaining competitive success rates (\textit{e.g.} 25.8\%
improvements with OpenVLA) compared to baselines, thereby providing a simple
plug-in path to efficient robot policies that advances the efficiency and
performance frontier of robotic manipulation. Our project website is:

*Alireza Aliyari,Gholamreza Vossoughi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes Robust Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (multi-stage NMPC) for exoskeleton robots to handle uncertainties and minimize human-robot interaction forces, showing significant improvements over non-robust methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of linearization-based robust MPC methods that degrade performance due to nonlinearities in exoskeleton dynamics, and improve robustness against uncertainties in human-robot systems.

Method: Multi-stage NMPC approach that solves nonlinear optimization problems using multiple scenarios to represent system uncertainties, focusing on minimizing interaction forces during swing phase with unknown loads.

Result: Significantly improves robustness with lower tracking errors and interaction forces. With 2kg unknown payload and disturbances, reduces thigh and shank interaction forces by 77% and 94% respectively compared to non-robust NMPC.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-stage NMPC method effectively handles uncertainties in exoskeleton control, providing superior robustness and performance over traditional approaches, making it suitable for real-world applications with varying conditions.

Abstract: The use of exoskeleton robots is increasing due to the rising number of
musculoskeletal injuries. However, their effectiveness depends heavily on the
design of control systems. Designing robust controllers is challenging because
of uncertainties in human-robot systems. Among various control strategies,
Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful approach due to its ability to
handle constraints and optimize performance. Previous studies have used
linearization-based methods to implement robust MPC on exoskeletons, but these
can degrade performance due to nonlinearities in the robot's dynamics. To
address this gap, this paper proposes a Robust Nonlinear Model Predictive
Control (RNMPC) method, called multi-stage NMPC, to control a
two-degree-of-freedom exoskeleton by solving a nonlinear optimization problem.
This method uses multiple scenarios to represent system uncertainties. The
study focuses on minimizing human-robot interaction forces during the swing
phase, particularly when the robot carries unknown loads. Simulations and
experimental tests show that the proposed method significantly improves
robustness, outperforming non-robust NMPC. It achieves lower tracking errors
and interaction forces under various uncertainties. For instance, when a 2 kg
unknown payload is combined with external disturbances, the RMS values of thigh
and shank interaction forces for multi-stage NMPC are reduced by 77 and 94
percent, respectively, compared to non-robust NMPC.

*Haoqi Yuan,Ziye Huang,Ye Wang,Chuan Mao,Chaoyi Xu,Zongqing Lu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DemoGrasp is a novel method for learning universal dexterous grasping that starts from a single demonstration trajectory and adapts to novel objects by editing robot actions through a single-step MDP formulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Universal grasping with multi-fingered dexterous hands is challenging due to high-dimensional, long-horizon exploration in RL approaches that require complex reward and curriculum design, often leading to suboptimal solutions across diverse objects.

Method: DemoGrasp uses a single successful demonstration trajectory and adapts to novel objects by editing robot actions: changing wrist pose determines where to grasp, and changing hand joint angles determines how to grasp. This is formulated as a single-step MDP and optimized with RL across hundreds of objects in parallel.

Result: Achieves 95% success rate on DexGraspNet objects using Shadow Hand in simulation, outperforming previous methods. Shows strong transferability with 84.6% average success rate across diverse dexterous hands on six unseen object datasets. Successfully grasps 110 unseen real-world objects through vision-based imitation learning.

Conclusion: DemoGrasp provides an effective approach for universal dexterous grasping that generalizes well to spatial, background, and lighting changes, supports both RGB and depth inputs, and extends to language-guided grasping in cluttered scenes.

Abstract: Universal grasping with multi-fingered dexterous hands is a fundamental
challenge in robotic manipulation. While recent approaches successfully learn
closed-loop grasping policies using reinforcement learning (RL), the inherent
difficulty of high-dimensional, long-horizon exploration necessitates complex
reward and curriculum design, often resulting in suboptimal solutions across
diverse objects. We propose DemoGrasp, a simple yet effective method for
learning universal dexterous grasping. We start from a single successful
demonstration trajectory of grasping a specific object and adapt to novel
objects and poses by editing the robot actions in this trajectory: changing the
wrist pose determines where to grasp, and changing the hand joint angles
determines how to grasp. We formulate this trajectory editing as a single-step
Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use RL to optimize a universal policy across
hundreds of objects in parallel in simulation, with a simple reward consisting
of a binary success term and a robot-table collision penalty. In simulation,
DemoGrasp achieves a 95% success rate on DexGraspNet objects using the Shadow
Hand, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. It also shows strong
transferability, achieving an average success rate of 84.6% across diverse
dexterous hand embodiments on six unseen object datasets, while being trained
on only 175 objects. Through vision-based imitation learning, our policy
successfully grasps 110 unseen real-world objects, including small, thin items.
It generalizes to spatial, background, and lighting changes, supports both RGB
and depth inputs, and extends to language-guided grasping in cluttered scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing grasp datasets focus on single-hand interactions with limited semantic part annotations, making dual-hand grasp generation with object semantics largely underexplored due to dataset scarcity.

Method: SymOpt constructs dual-hand grasp dataset from single-hand datasets using object/hand symmetries. DHAGrasp uses novel dual-hand affordance representation and two-stage design to learn from small segmented training data while scaling to larger unsegmented data.

Result: Method produces diverse and semantically consistent grasps, outperforming strong baselines in both grasp quality and generalization to unseen objects.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses dual-hand grasp generation with semantic awareness through dataset construction and text-guided generation, demonstrating improved performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Learning to generate dual-hand grasps that respect object semantics is
essential for robust hand-object interaction but remains largely underexplored
due to dataset scarcity. Existing grasp datasets predominantly focus on
single-hand interactions and contain only limited semantic part annotations. To
address these challenges, we introduce a pipeline, SymOpt, that constructs a
large-scale dual-hand grasp dataset by leveraging existing single-hand datasets
and exploiting object and hand symmetries. Building on this, we propose a
text-guided dual-hand grasp generator, DHAGrasp, that synthesizes Dual-Hand
Affordance-aware Grasps for unseen objects. Our approach incorporates a novel
dual-hand affordance representation and follows a two-stage design, which
enables effective learning from a small set of segmented training objects while
scaling to a much larger pool of unsegmented data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method produces diverse and semantically consistent
grasps, outperforming strong baselines in both grasp quality and generalization

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VLM2VLA is a training paradigm that converts low-level robot actions into natural language representations to align with VLMs' pretraining data, enabling VLA training via LoRA without catastrophic forgetting of foundational reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the fundamental tradeoff where fine-tuning VLMs on robot data causes catastrophic forgetting of reasoning and multimodal understanding, hindering generalization to novel scenarios and instruction following.

Method: Represent low-level robot actions with natural language to resolve distribution mismatch, then train VLAs solely using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to minimally modify the VLM backbone.

Result: Preserves VLM's core capabilities while enabling zero-shot generalization to novel tasks requiring open-world semantic reasoning and multilingual instruction following, validated through 800+ real-world experiments.

Conclusion: VLM2VLA successfully addresses catastrophic forgetting in VLA training by data-level alignment and LoRA-based fine-tuning, creating generalist policies that maintain foundational reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) on robot teleoperation data to
create vision-language-action (VLA) models is a promising paradigm for training
generalist policies, but it suffers from a fundamental tradeoff: learning to
produce actions often diminishes the VLM's foundational reasoning and
multimodal understanding, hindering generalization to novel scenarios,
instruction following, and semantic understanding. We argue that this
catastrophic forgetting is due to a distribution mismatch between the VLM's
internet-scale pretraining corpus and the robotics fine-tuning data. Inspired
by this observation, we introduce VLM2VLA: a VLA training paradigm that first
resolves this mismatch at the data level by representing low-level actions with
natural language. This alignment makes it possible to train VLAs solely with
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), thereby minimally modifying the VLM backbone and
averting catastrophic forgetting. As a result, the VLM can be fine-tuned on
robot teleoperation data without fundamentally altering the underlying
architecture and without expensive co-training on internet-scale VLM datasets.
Through extensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) studies and over 800
real-world robotics experiments, we demonstrate that VLM2VLA preserves the
VLM's core capabilities, enabling zero-shot generalization to novel tasks that
require open-world semantic reasoning and multilingual instruction following.

TL;DR: MimicDreamer is a framework that converts human demonstration videos into robot-usable supervision by aligning vision, viewpoint, and actions to enable efficient VLA model training without expensive robot data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting embodied robot interaction data is prohibitively expensive, while human demonstration videos are more scalable and cost-efficient, but there's a significant domain gap between human videos and robot-executed videos.

Method: Three components: H2R Aligner (video diffusion model for visual alignment), EgoStabilizer (viewpoint stabilization via homography and inpainting), and action alignment through trajectory mapping and constrained inverse kinematics solver.

Result: VLA models trained on synthesized human-to-robot videos achieve few-shot execution on real robots, with 14.7% average success rate improvement across six manipulation tasks compared to models trained only on real robot data.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the domain gap between human and robot videos, enabling scalable training of VLA models using cost-effective human demonstrations while significantly boosting robot manipulation performance.

Abstract: Vision Language Action (VLA) models derive their generalization capability
from diverse training data, yet collecting embodied robot interaction data
remains prohibitively expensive. In contrast, human demonstration videos are
far more scalable and cost-efficient to collect, and recent studies confirm
their effectiveness in training VLA models. However, a significant domain gap
persists between human videos and robot-executed videos, including unstable
camera viewpoints, visual discrepancies between human hands and robotic arms,
and differences in motion dynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose
MimicDreamer, a framework that turns fast, low-cost human demonstrations into
robot-usable supervision by jointly aligning vision, viewpoint, and actions to
directly support policy training. For visual alignment, we propose H2R Aligner,
a video diffusion model that generates high-fidelity robot demonstration videos
by transferring motion from human manipulation footage. For viewpoint
stabilization, EgoStabilizer is proposed, which canonicalizes egocentric videos
via homography and inpaints occlusions and distortions caused by warping. For
action alignment, we map human hand trajectories to the robot frame and apply a
constrained inverse kinematics solver to produce feasible, low-jitter joint
commands with accurate pose tracking. Empirically, VLA models trained purely on
our synthesized human-to-robot videos achieve few-shot execution on real
robots. Moreover, scaling training with human data significantly boosts
performance compared to models trained solely on real robot data; our approach
improves the average success rate by 14.7\% across six representative
manipulation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal foundation approaches fail to decompose high-level commands into executable action sequences from static visual input alone for long-horizon manipulation tasks in zero-shot settings.

Method: A two-module hierarchical framework: Human Intent Translator (HIT) parses input videos using multimodal reasoning to produce language-grounded subtasks, then Future Dynamics Predictor (FDP) uses a generative model to synthesize physically plausible video rollouts for each step with explicit modeling of object interactions and contact points.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot methods by over 20% on long-horizon manipulation tasks through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Coupling video-driven intent parsing with prospective dynamics modeling is a highly effective strategy for developing general-purpose robotic systems.

Abstract: Generalizing to long-horizon manipulation tasks in a zero-shot setting
remains a central challenge in robotics. Current multimodal foundation based
approaches, despite their capabilities, typically fail to decompose high-level
commands into executable action sequences from static visual input alone. To
address this challenge, we introduce Super-Mimic, a hierarchical framework that
enables zero-shot robotic imitation by directly inferring procedural intent
from unscripted human demonstration videos. Our framework is composed of two
sequential modules. First, a Human Intent Translator (HIT) parses the input
video using multimodal reasoning to produce a sequence of language-grounded
subtasks. These subtasks then condition a Future Dynamics Predictor (FDP),
which employs a generative model that synthesizes a physically plausible video
rollout for each step. The resulting visual trajectories are dynamics-aware,
explicitly modeling crucial object interactions and contact points to guide the
low-level controller. We validate this approach through extensive experiments
on a suite of long-horizon manipulation tasks, where Super-Mimic significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot methods by over 20\%. These results
establish that coupling video-driven intent parsing with prospective dynamics
modeling is a highly effective strategy for developing general-purpose robotic
systems.

TL;DR: The TalBot project uses a Furhat conversational robot with LLM capabilities to play language games with preschool children who have language vulnerabilities, aiming to improve their expressive language skills through implicit learning of morphological structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preschool children with language vulnerabilities (developmental language disorders or immigration-related challenges) need support for expressive language skills. Current approaches require educators and SLTs to embed target morphological structures in interactions, which is demanding and requires precise linguistic knowledge.

Method: Developed an application where a Furhat conversational robot plays the word retrieval game "Alias" with children. Uses LLM to manage gameplay, dialogue, affective responses, and turn-taking. Plans to leverage LLMs further to generate and deliver specific morphological targets during gameplay.

Result: The approach is currently in development. The hypothesis is that a robot could outperform humans at delivering morphological targets while keeping children engaged in game-based activities.

Conclusion: Long-term goal is to create a robust LLM-based Robot-Assisted Language Learning intervention capable of teaching various morphological structures across different languages, serving as a model and tutor for both children and professionals.

Abstract: Preschool children with language vulnerabilities -- such as developmental
language disorders or immigration related language challenges -- often require
support to strengthen their expressive language skills. Based on the principle
of implicit learning, speech-language therapists (SLTs) typically embed target
morphological structures (e.g., third person -s) into everyday interactions or
game-based learning activities. Educators are recommended by SLTs to do the
same. This approach demands precise linguistic knowledge and real-time
production of various morphological forms (e.g., "Daddy wears these when he
drives to work"). The task becomes even more demanding when educators or parent
also must keep children engaged and manage turn-taking in a game-based
activity. In the TalBot project our multiprofessional team have developed an
application in which the Furhat conversational robot plays the word retrieval
game "Alias" with children to improve language skills. Our application
currently employs a large language model (LLM) to manage gameplay, dialogue,
affective responses, and turn-taking. Our next step is to further leverage the
capacity of LLMs so the robot can generate and deliver specific morphological
targets during the game. We hypothesize that a robot could outperform humans at
this task. Novel aspects of this approach are that the robot could ultimately
serve as a model and tutor for both children and professionals and that using
LLM capabilities in this context would support basic communication needs for
children with language vulnerabilities. Our long-term goal is to create a
robust LLM-based Robot-Assisted Language Learning intervention capable of
teaching a variety of morphological structures across different languages.

### [242] [IMU-Preintegrated Radar Factors for Asynchronous Radar-LiDAR-Inertial SLAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22288)
*Johan Hatleskog,Morten Nissov,Kostas Alexis*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes IMU-preintegrated radar factors to reduce computational costs in radar-LiDAR-inertial SLAM by maintaining state creation at LiDAR frequency instead of doubling it, achieving 56% optimization time reduction while preserving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional fixed-lag smoothers create states for each radar and LiDAR measurement, doubling the state creation rate and causing high optimization costs that inhibit real-time performance on resource-constrained hardware.

Method: Introduces IMU-preintegrated radar factors that use high-rate inertial data to propagate the most recent LiDAR state to radar measurement timestamps, maintaining node creation at LiDAR frequency instead of doubling it.

Result: Reduces the number of nodes by 50% and lowers aggregated factor graph optimization time by up to 56% while preserving absolute pose error comparable to conventional baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully reduces computational costs significantly (up to 56% optimization time reduction) while maintaining localization accuracy, enabling real-time performance on resource-constrained hardware.

Abstract: Fixed-lag Radar-LiDAR-Inertial smoothers conventionally create one factor
graph node per measurement to compensate for the lack of time synchronization
between radar and LiDAR. For a radar-LiDAR sensor pair with equal rates, this
strategy results in a state creation rate of twice the individual sensor
frequencies. This doubling of the number of states per second yields high
optimization costs, inhibiting real-time performance on resource-constrained
hardware. We introduce IMU-preintegrated radar factors that use high-rate
inertial data to propagate the most recent LiDAR state to the radar measurement
timestamp. This strategy maintains the node creation rate at the LiDAR
measurement frequency. Assuming equal sensor rates, this lowers the number of
nodes by 50 % and consequently the computational costs. Experiments on a single
board computer (which has 4 cores each of 2.2 GHz A73 and 2 GHz A53 with 8 GB
RAM) show that our method preserves the absolute pose error of a conventional
baseline while simultaneously lowering the aggregated factor graph optimization
time by up to 56 %.

*Joseph Hunt,Koyo Fujii,Aly Magassouba,Praminda Caleb-Solly*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel IoRT-based system that uses thermal sensing for proactive bed-exit prediction and coordinates multiple robots to provide personalized patient assistance before falls occur.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of conventional fall prevention systems that rely on post-fall detection and suffer from high false positives, while also attending to patients' underlying needs that lead to bed-exit attempts.

Method: Integrated system combining privacy-preserving thermal sensing for real-time bed-exit prediction with two coordinated robotic agents that respond dynamically based on predicted intent and patient input.

Result: Demonstrated accurate preemptive bed-exit detection using low-resolution thermal sensing and developed a modular IoRT framework enabling distributed sensing, prediction, and multi-robot coordination.

Conclusion: Interactive and connected robotic systems can move beyond passive monitoring to deliver timely, meaningful assistance, enabling safer and more responsive hospital care environments.

Abstract: Hospital patient falls remain a critical and costly challenge worldwide.
While conventional fall prevention systems typically rely on post-fall
detection or reactive alerts, they also often suffer from high false positive
rates and fail to address the underlying patient needs that lead to bed-exit
attempts. This paper presents a novel system architecture that leverages the
Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) to orchestrate human-robot-robot interaction
for proactive and personalized patient assistance. The system integrates a
privacy-preserving thermal sensing model capable of real-time bed-exit
prediction, with two coordinated robotic agents that respond dynamically based
on predicted intent and patient input. This orchestrated response could not
only reduce fall risk but also attend to the patient's underlying motivations
for movement, such as thirst, discomfort, or the need for assistance, before a
hazardous situation arises. Our contributions with this pilot study are
three-fold: (1) a modular IoRT-based framework enabling distributed sensing,
prediction, and multi-robot coordination; (2) a demonstration of low-resolution
thermal sensing for accurate, privacy-preserving preemptive bed-exit detection;
and (3) results from a user study and systematic error analysis that inform the
design of situationally aware, multi-agent interactions in hospital settings.
The findings highlight how interactive and connected robotic systems can move
beyond passive monitoring to deliver timely, meaningful assistance, empowering
safer, more responsive care environments.

### [244] [RoboView-Bias: Benchmarking Visual Bias in Embodied Agents for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22356)
*Enguang Liu,Siyuan Liang,Liming Lu,Xiyu Zeng,Xiaochun Cao,Aishan Liu,Shuchao Pang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboView-Bias is the first benchmark to systematically quantify visual bias in robotic manipulation, revealing significant biases in embodied agents and demonstrating that a semantic grounding layer can reduce bias by 54.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on generalization and robustness but lack systematic quantification of visual bias, limiting understanding of how perception affects decision-making stability in embodied agents.

Method: Created RoboView-Bias benchmark with 2,127 task instances using structured variant-generation framework and perceptual-fairness validation protocol to measure biases from individual visual factors and their interactions.

Result: Three key findings: (i) all agents show significant visual biases with camera viewpoint as most critical factor; (ii) agents perform best on highly saturated colors, indicating inherited VLM preferences; (iii) visual biases show strong asymmetric coupling with viewpoint amplifying color-related bias.

Conclusion: Systematic analysis of visual bias is essential for developing safe and reliable general-purpose embodied agents, and mitigation strategies like semantic grounding can substantially reduce bias.

Abstract: The safety and reliability of embodied agents rely on accurate and unbiased
visual perception. However, existing benchmarks mainly emphasize generalization
and robustness under perturbations, while systematic quantification of visual
bias remains scarce. This gap limits a deeper understanding of how perception
influences decision-making stability. To address this issue, we propose
RoboView-Bias, the first benchmark specifically designed to systematically
quantify visual bias in robotic manipulation, following a principle of factor
isolation. Leveraging a structured variant-generation framework and a
perceptual-fairness validation protocol, we create 2,127 task instances that
enable robust measurement of biases induced by individual visual factors and
their interactions. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate three
representative embodied agents across two prevailing paradigms and report three
key findings: (i) all agents exhibit significant visual biases, with camera
viewpoint being the most critical factor; (ii) agents achieve their highest
success rates on highly saturated colors, indicating inherited visual
preferences from underlying VLMs; and (iii) visual biases show strong,
asymmetric coupling, with viewpoint strongly amplifying color-related bias.
Finally, we demonstrate that a mitigation strategy based on a semantic
grounding layer substantially reduces visual bias by approximately 54.5\% on
MOKA. Our results highlight that systematic analysis of visual bias is a
prerequisite for developing safe and reliable general-purpose embodied agents.

### [245] [Learning-Based Collaborative Control for Bi-Manual Tactile-Reactive Grasping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22421)
*Leonel Giacobbe,Jingdao Chen,Chuangchuang Sun*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A learning-based, tactile-reactive multi-agent MPC system for collaborative grasping of diverse objects with different softness and shapes, using real-time tactile feedback from Gelsight Mini sensors to adapt control policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current grasping systems are limited to rigid items and single-agent approaches, performing poorly with fragile/deformable materials and large/heavy objects that require real-time feedback and multi-agent collaboration.

Method: Uses two Gelsight Mini tactile sensors for real-time texture/stiffness information, estimates contact dynamics and object compliance, implements multi-agent MPC trained on real contact interactions with tactile-data driven grasping state inference and collaborative coordination strategy.

Result: Outperforms independent PD and MPC baselines in success rates for achieving and maintaining stable grasps across objects of varying sizes and stiffness, validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Combining tactile sensing with learning-based multi-agent MPC provides a robust, intelligent solution for collaborative grasping in complex environments, significantly advancing multi-agent system capabilities.

Abstract: Grasping is a core task in robotics with various applications. However, most
current implementations are primarily designed for rigid items, and their
performance drops considerably when handling fragile or deformable materials
that require real-time feedback. Meanwhile, tactile-reactive grasping focuses
on a single agent, which limits their ability to grasp and manipulate large,
heavy objects. To overcome this, we propose a learning-based, tactile-reactive
multi-agent Model Predictive Controller (MPC) for grasping a wide range of
objects with different softness and shapes, beyond the capabilities of
preexisting single-agent implementations. Our system uses two Gelsight Mini
tactile sensors [1] to extract real-time information on object texture and
stiffness. This rich tactile feedback is used to estimate contact dynamics and
object compliance in real time, enabling the system to adapt its control policy
to diverse object geometries and stiffness profiles. The learned controller
operates in a closed loop, leveraging tactile encoding to predict grasp
stability and adjust force and position accordingly. Our key technical
contributions include a multi-agent MPC formulation trained on real contact
interactions, a tactile-data driven method for inferring grasping states, and a
coordination strategy that enables collaborative control. By combining tactile
sensing and a learning-based multi-agent MPC, our method offers a robust,
intelligent solution for collaborative grasping in complex environments,
significantly advancing the capabilities of multi-agent systems. Our approach
is validated through extensive experiments against independent PD and MPC
baselines. Our pipeline outperforms the baselines regarding success rates in
achieving and maintaining stable grasps across objects of varying sizes and
stiffness.

### [246] [An Ontology for Unified Modeling of Tasks, Actions, Environments, and Capabilities in Personal Service Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22434)
*Margherita Martorana,Francesca Urgese,Ilaria Tiddi,Stefan Schlobach*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes OntoBOT, an ontology that unifies task, action, environment, and capability representations for service robots, enabling formal reasoning and knowledge sharing across different robotic platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current service robot solutions are often platform-specific and hard-coded, limiting interoperability and reusability. Existing ontologies don't fully capture the connection between environment, actions, robot capabilities, and system integration.

Method: Extends existing ontologies (SOMA, DOLCE) to create OntoBOT - a unified ontology for robots and actions. Evaluated through competency questions across four embodied agents (TIAGo, HSR, UR3, Stretch).

Result: OntoBOT enables context-aware reasoning, task-oriented execution, and knowledge sharing across different robotic platforms, demonstrating generalizability across multiple robot types.

Conclusion: OntoBOT provides a cohesive framework that supports formal reasoning about task execution and facilitates interoperability and knowledge sharing in service robotics.

Abstract: Personal service robots are increasingly used in domestic settings to assist
older adults and people requiring support. Effective operation involves not
only physical interaction but also the ability to interpret dynamic
environments, understand tasks, and choose appropriate actions based on
context. This requires integrating both hardware components (e.g. sensors,
actuators) and software systems capable of reasoning about tasks, environments,
and robot capabilities. Frameworks such as the Robot Operating System (ROS)
provide open-source tools that help connect low-level hardware with
higher-level functionalities. However, real-world deployments remain tightly
coupled to specific platforms. As a result, solutions are often isolated and
hard-coded, limiting interoperability, reusability, and knowledge sharing.
Ontologies and knowledge graphs offer a structured way to represent tasks,
environments, and robot capabilities. Existing ontologies, such as the
Socio-physical Model of Activities (SOMA) and the Descriptive Ontology for
Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering (DOLCE), provide models for activities,
spatial relationships, and reasoning structures. However, they often focus on
specific domains and do not fully capture the connection between environment,
action, robot capabilities, and system-level integration. In this work, we
propose the Ontology for roBOts and acTions (OntoBOT), which extends existing
ontologies to provide a unified representation of tasks, actions, environments,
and capabilities. Our contributions are twofold: (1) we unify these aspects
into a cohesive ontology to support formal reasoning about task execution, and
(2) we demonstrate its generalizability by evaluating competency questions
across four embodied agents - TIAGo, HSR, UR3, and Stretch - showing how
OntoBOT enables context-aware reasoning, task-oriented execution, and knowledge
sharing in service robotics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater operations face significant challenges including hydrodynamic disturbances, limited communication bandwidth, and degraded sensing in turbid waters, making autonomous navigation difficult and unreliable.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) Dual-brain architecture decouples high-level mission reasoning from low-level reactive control; 2) First application of Vision-Language-Action models to underwater robotics with chain-of-thought reasoning; 3) Hydrodynamics-informed Model Predictive Control that compensates for fluid effects in real time without task-specific training.

Result: Field tests demonstrate UnderwaterVLA reduces navigation errors in degraded visual conditions while maintaining 19% to 27% higher task completion rates compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: UnderwaterVLA provides a scalable and cost-effective path toward next-generation intelligent AUVs by minimizing reliance on underwater-specific training data and improving adaptability across environments.

Abstract: This paper presents UnderwaterVLA, a novel framework for autonomous
underwater navigation that integrates multimodal foundation models with
embodied intelligence systems. Underwater operations remain difficult due to
hydrodynamic disturbances, limited communication bandwidth, and degraded
sensing in turbid waters. To address these challenges, we introduce three
innovations. First, a dual-brain architecture decouples high-level mission
reasoning from low-level reactive control, enabling robust operation under
communication and computational constraints. Second, we apply
Vision-Language-Action(VLA) models to underwater robotics for the first time,
incorporating structured chain-of-thought reasoning for interpretable
decision-making. Third, a hydrodynamics-informed Model Predictive Control(MPC)
scheme compensates for fluid effects in real time without costly task-specific
training. Experimental results in field tests show that UnderwaterVLA reduces
navigation errors in degraded visual conditions while maintaining higher task
completion by 19% to 27% over baseline. By minimizing reliance on
underwater-specific training data and improving adaptability across
environments, UnderwaterVLA provides a scalable and cost-effective path toward
the next generation of intelligent AUVs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address task allocation in environments with uncertain task requirements for heterogeneous robot teams, enabling proactive mitigation of task failures without resource waste.

Method: Uses a market-based approach with probability distributions over capabilities, optimizing joint team objectives while capturing coupled rewards between robots in decentralized settings.

Result: Comparative experiments show the approach's effectiveness and highlight challenges of incorporating coupled rewards in decentralized formulations.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm provides an effective polynomial-time solution for decentralized task allocation with uncertain requirements and coupled rewards.

Abstract: This paper proposes a task allocation algorithm for teams of heterogeneous
robots in environments with uncertain task requirements. We model these
requirements as probability distributions over capabilities and use this model
to allocate tasks such that robots with complementary skills naturally position
near uncertain tasks, proactively mitigating task failures without wasting
resources. We introduce a market-based approach that optimizes the joint team
objective while explicitly capturing coupled rewards between robots, offering a
polynomial-time solution in decentralized settings with strict communication
assumptions. Comparative experiments against benchmark algorithms demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the challenges of incorporating
coupled rewards in a decentralized formulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents an ontological model and algorithm for robots to explain differences between competing plans, enabling contrastive explanations that outperform baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure trustworthy human-robot interaction by enabling robots to make reasonable decisions and effectively communicate the reasoning behind choosing one plan over another.

Method: Proposes a novel ontological model to formalize and reason about differences between competing plans, and develops an algorithm leveraging divergent knowledge to construct contrastive narratives.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows the proposed explanations significantly outperform the baseline method in effectiveness.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enables robots to provide meaningful contrastive explanations for plan selection, enhancing transparency and trust in human-robot interaction.

Abstract: Mutual understanding of artificial agents' decisions is key to ensuring a
trustworthy and successful human-robot interaction. Hence, robots are expected
to make reasonable decisions and communicate them to humans when needed. In
this article, the focus is on an approach to modeling and reasoning about the
comparison of two competing plans, so that robots can later explain the
divergent result. First, a novel ontological model is proposed to formalize and
reason about the differences between competing plans, enabling the
classification of the most appropriate one (e.g., the shortest, the safest, the
closest to human preferences, etc.). This work also investigates the
limitations of a baseline algorithm for ontology-based explanatory narration.
To address these limitations, a novel algorithm is presented, leveraging
divergent knowledge between plans and facilitating the construction of
contrastive narratives. Through empirical evaluation, it is observed that the
explanations excel beyond the baseline method.

TL;DR: HELIOS is a hierarchical scene representation method for language-specified mobile manipulation that achieves state-of-the-art results on the OVMM benchmark and transfers to real-world robots without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in mobile manipulation tasks including partial scene observation, grounding semantic information from language to partially observed scenes, and actively updating scene knowledge with new observations.

Method: Constructs 2D maps with semantic and occupancy information for navigation while actively building 3D Gaussian representations of task-relevant objects. Fuses observations across multi-layered representation with explicit multi-view consistency modeling. Uses objective function balancing exploration of uncertain regions with exploitation of semantic information.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on OVMM benchmark in Habitat simulator. Successfully transfers to real-world office environment on Spot robot without requiring additional data (zero-shot capability).

Conclusion: HELIOS provides an effective hierarchical scene representation approach for language-specified mobile manipulation that handles partial observation challenges and enables real-world deployment.

Abstract: Language-specified mobile manipulation tasks in novel environments
simultaneously face challenges interacting with a scene which is only partially
observed, grounding semantic information from language instructions to the
partially observed scene, and actively updating knowledge of the scene with new
observations. To address these challenges, we propose HELIOS, a hierarchical
scene representation and associated search objective to perform language
specified pick and place mobile manipulation tasks. We construct 2D maps
containing the relevant semantic and occupancy information for navigation while
simultaneously actively constructing 3D Gaussian representations of
task-relevant objects. We fuse observations across this multi-layered
representation while explicitly modeling the multi-view consistency of the
detections of each object. In order to efficiently search for the target
object, we formulate an objective function balancing exploration of unobserved
or uncertain regions with exploitation of scene semantic information. We
evaluate HELIOS on the OVMM benchmark in the Habitat simulator, a pick and
place benchmark in which perception is challenging due to large and complex
scenes with comparatively small target objects. HELIOS achieves
state-of-the-art results on OVMM. As our approach is zero-shot, HELIOS can also
transfer to the real world without requiring additional data, as we illustrate
by demonstrating it in a real world office environment on a Spot robot.

TL;DR: An intention-driven lane change framework for autonomous vehicles that integrates driving-style recognition, cooperation-aware decision-making, and coordinated motion planning to handle heterogeneous human behaviors in mixed-traffic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In mixed-traffic environments where AVs interact with human-driven vehicles, unpredictable intentions and heterogeneous behaviors make safe and efficient lane change maneuvers highly challenging. Existing methods often oversimplify these interactions by assuming uniform patterns.

Method: Deep learning classifier trained on NGSIM dataset identifies human driving styles in real time. Cooperation score with intrinsic and interactive components estimates drivers' intentions and willingness to cooperate. Decision-making combines behavior cloning with inverse reinforcement learning. Trajectory generation uses model predictive control integrated with IRL-based intention inference.

Result: The model achieves 94.2% accuracy and 94.3% F1-score, outperforming rule-based and learning-based baselines by 4-15% in lane change recognition.

Conclusion: The results highlight the benefit of modeling inter-driver heterogeneity and demonstrate the potential of the framework to advance context-aware and human-like autonomous driving in complex traffic environments.

Abstract: In mixed-traffic environments, where autonomous vehicles (AVs) interact with
diverse human-driven vehicles (HVs), unpredictable intentions and heterogeneous
behaviors make safe and efficient lane change maneuvers highly challenging.
Existing methods often oversimplify these interactions by assuming uniform
patterns. We propose an intention-driven lane change framework that integrates
driving-style recognition, cooperation-aware decision-making, and coordinated
motion planning. A deep learning classifier trained on the NGSIM dataset
identifies human driving styles in real time. A cooperation score with
intrinsic and interactive components estimates surrounding drivers' intentions
and quantifies their willingness to cooperate with the ego vehicle.
Decision-making combines behavior cloning with inverse reinforcement learning
to determine whether a lane change should be initiated. For trajectory
generation, model predictive control is integrated with IRL-based intention
inference to produce collision-free and socially compliant maneuvers.
Experiments show that the proposed model achieves 94.2\% accuracy and 94.3\%
F1-score, outperforming rule-based and learning-based baselines by 4-15\% in
lane change recognition. These results highlight the benefit of modeling
inter-driver heterogeneity and demonstrate the potential of the framework to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient detection of human intent is crucial for effective human-robot interaction, but existing approaches rely on multimodal inputs (RGB-D) and face challenges with class imbalance in real-world datasets.

Method: Uses RGB-only pipeline with MINT-RVAE synthetic sequence generation method, new loss functions, and training strategies to handle class imbalance and improve generalization on out-of-sample data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with AUROC of 0.95, outperforming prior works (AUROC: 0.90-0.912), while requiring only RGB input and supporting precise frame onset prediction.

Conclusion: The RGB-only approach enables faster robot responses and improved service quality, and the authors release a new dataset with frame-level labeling to support future research.

Abstract: Efficiently detecting human intent to interact with ubiquitous robots is
crucial for effective human-robot interaction (HRI) and collaboration. Over the
past decade, deep learning has gained traction in this field, with most
existing approaches relying on multimodal inputs, such as RGB combined with
depth (RGB-D), to classify time-sequence windows of sensory data as interactive
or non-interactive. In contrast, we propose a novel RGB-only pipeline for
predicting human interaction intent with frame-level precision, enabling faster
robot responses and improved service quality. A key challenge in intent
prediction is the class imbalance inherent in real-world HRI datasets, which
can hinder the model's training and generalization. To address this, we
introduce MINT-RVAE, a synthetic sequence generation method, along with new
loss functions and training strategies that enhance generalization on
out-of-sample data. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance (AUROC:
0.95) outperforming prior works (AUROC: 0.90-0.912), while requiring only RGB
input and supporting precise frame onset prediction. Finally, to support future
research, we openly release our new dataset with frame-level labeling of human
interaction intent.

Motivation: Imitation learning policies degrade under egocentric viewpoint shifts when trained from a single viewpoint, limiting their practical deployment in robotic manipulation.

Method: EgoDemoGen framework generates paired novel egocentric demonstrations by retargeting actions and synthesizing corresponding videos using EgoViewTransfer, a generative video repair model finetuned from pretrained video generation with self-supervised double reprojection.

Result: Policy success rate improved absolutely by +17.0% for standard viewpoint and +17.7% for novel viewpoints in simulation, and +18.3% and +25.8% respectively in real-world robots. Performance improves with more generated demonstrations.

Conclusion: EgoDemoGen provides a practical route to egocentric viewpoint-robust robotic manipulation, with diminishing returns as generated demonstration proportion increases.

Abstract: Imitation learning based policies perform well in robotic manipulation, but
they often degrade under *egocentric viewpoint shifts* when trained from a
single egocentric viewpoint. To address this issue, we present **EgoDemoGen**,
a framework that generates *paired* novel egocentric demonstrations by
retargeting actions in the novel egocentric frame and synthesizing the
corresponding egocentric observation videos with proposed generative video
repair model **EgoViewTransfer**, which is conditioned by a novel-viewpoint
reprojected scene video and a robot-only video rendered from the retargeted
joint actions. EgoViewTransfer is finetuned from a pretrained video generation
model using self-supervised double reprojection strategy. We evaluate
EgoDemoGen on both simulation (RoboTwin2.0) and real-world robot. After
training with a mixture of EgoDemoGen-generated novel egocentric demonstrations
and original standard egocentric demonstrations, policy success rate improves
**absolutely** by **+17.0%** for standard egocentric viewpoint and by
**+17.7%** for novel egocentric viewpoints in simulation. On real-world robot,
the **absolute** improvements are **+18.3%** and **+25.8%**. Moreover,
performance continues to improve as the proportion of EgoDemoGen-generated
demonstrations increases, with diminishing returns. These results demonstrate
that EgoDemoGen provides a practical route to egocentric viewpoint-robust
robotic manipulation.

Motivation: Current video models like Sora rely on passive observation and struggle with physical causality, while humans learn physics through active interaction. The hypothesis is that authentic physical intuition requires extensive, causally rich real-world interactions.

Method: Train 14B-parameter WoW model on 2M robot interaction trajectories. Use SOPHIA (vision-language agents) to evaluate and refine DiT-generated outputs through iterative language instruction evolution. Co-train Inverse Dynamics Model to translate refined plans into executable robotic actions.

Result: WoW achieves state-of-the-art performance on WoWBench in both human and autonomous evaluation, demonstrating strong ability in physical causality, collision dynamics, and object permanence. The model shows physical understanding as probabilistic distributions but can be constrained toward realism.

Conclusion: Large-scale, real-world interaction is essential for developing physical intuition in AI. The work provides systematic evidence that active interaction, rather than passive observation, is key to building physically grounded world models.

Abstract: Humans develop an understanding of intuitive physics through active
interaction with the world. This approach is in stark contrast to current video
models, such as Sora, which rely on passive observation and therefore struggle
with grasping physical causality. This observation leads to our central
hypothesis: authentic physical intuition of the world model must be grounded in
extensive, causally rich interactions with the real world. To test this
hypothesis, we present WoW, a 14-billion-parameter generative world model
trained on 2 million robot interaction trajectories. Our findings reveal that
the model's understanding of physics is a probabilistic distribution of
plausible outcomes, leading to stochastic instabilities and physical
hallucinations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this emergent capability can
be actively constrained toward physical realism by SOPHIA, where
vision-language model agents evaluate the DiT-generated output and guide its
refinement by iteratively evolving the language instructions. In addition, a
co-trained Inverse Dynamics Model translates these refined plans into
executable robotic actions, thus closing the imagination-to-action loop. We
establish WoWBench, a new benchmark focused on physical consistency and causal
reasoning in video, where WoW achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
human and autonomous evaluation, demonstrating strong ability in physical
causality, collision dynamics, and object permanence. Our work provides
systematic evidence that large-scale, real-world interaction is a cornerstone
for developing physical intuition in AI. Models, data, and benchmarks will be
open-sourced.

Method: Proposes VLA-Reasoner that samples action trajectories using a world model to generate future states, employs MCTS for efficient search in large action spaces, uses KDE-based confidence sampling for exploration, and offline reward shaping to evaluate intermediate states.

Result: Extensive experiments in simulators and real-world settings demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art VLAs, showing enhanced performance in long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: VLA-Reasoner provides a scalable test-time computation approach for robotic manipulation, enabling VLAs to overcome their short-sighted limitations and effectively handle complex long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) achieve strong performance in general
robotic manipulation tasks by scaling imitation learning. However, existing
VLAs are limited to predicting short-sighted next-action, which struggle with
long-horizon trajectory tasks due to incremental deviations. To address this
problem, we propose a plug-in framework named VLA-Reasoner that effectively
empowers off-the-shelf VLAs with the capability of foreseeing future states via
test-time scaling. Specifically, VLA-Reasoner samples and rolls out possible
action trajectories where involved actions are rationales to generate future
states via a world model, which enables VLA-Reasoner to foresee and reason
potential outcomes and search for the optimal actions. We further leverage
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to improve search efficiency in large action
spaces, where stepwise VLA predictions seed the root. Meanwhile, we introduce a
confidence sampling mechanism based on Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), to
enable efficient exploration in MCTS without redundant VLA queries. We evaluate
intermediate states in MCTS via an offline reward shaping strategy, to score
predicted futures and correct deviations with long-term feedback. We conducted
extensive experiments in both simulators and the real world, demonstrating that
our proposed VLA-Reasoner achieves significant improvements over the
state-of-the-art VLAs. Our method highlights a potential pathway toward
scalable test-time computation of robotic manipulation.

Abstract: We present DAWN (Diffusion is All We Need for robot control), a unified
diffusion-based framework for language-conditioned robotic manipulation that
bridges high-level motion intent and low-level robot action via structured
pixel motion representation. In DAWN, both the high-level and low-level

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPF is a training-free aerial navigation framework that uses vision-language models to convert free-form instructions into 2D waypoints, which are then transformed into 3D actions for UAVs, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM-based approaches treat action prediction as text generation, but the authors argue it should be treated as a 2D spatial grounding task for more effective aerial navigation.

Method: SPF decomposes language instructions into iterative 2D waypoint annotations on input images, transforms them into 3D displacement vectors with adaptive traveling distance, and operates in closed-loop control for dynamic environments.

Result: SPF achieves 63% absolute improvement over previous best method in DRL simulation benchmark and outperforms strong baselines by large margins in real-world evaluations.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates remarkable generalization across different VLMs and effectively handles dynamic targets in dynamic environments through its spatial grounding approach.

Abstract: We present See, Point, Fly (SPF), a training-free aerial vision-and-language
navigation (AVLN) framework built atop vision-language models (VLMs). SPF is
capable of navigating to any goal based on any type of free-form instructions
in any kind of environment. In contrast to existing VLM-based approaches that
treat action prediction as a text generation task, our key insight is to
consider action prediction for AVLN as a 2D spatial grounding task. SPF
harnesses VLMs to decompose vague language instructions into iterative
annotation of 2D waypoints on the input image. Along with the predicted
traveling distance, SPF transforms predicted 2D waypoints into 3D displacement
vectors as action commands for UAVs. Moreover, SPF also adaptively adjusts the
traveling distance to facilitate more efficient navigation. Notably, SPF
performs navigation in a closed-loop control manner, enabling UAVs to follow
dynamic targets in dynamic environments. SPF sets a new state of the art in DRL
simulation benchmark, outperforming the previous best method by an absolute
margin of 63%. In extensive real-world evaluations, SPF outperforms strong
baselines by a large margin. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies to
highlight the effectiveness of our design choice. Lastly, SPF shows remarkable
generalization to different VLMs. Project page: https://spf-web.pages.dev
