*Abdul Joseph Fofanah,Lian Wen,Alpha Alimamy Kamara,Zhongyi Zhang,David Chen,Albert Patrick Sankoh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRAFNet: A biologically inspired neural network for polyp segmentation in colonoscopy that mimics human visual system hierarchy to address challenges of morphological variability, visual similarity to normal structures, and multi-scale detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate polyp segmentation is crucial for cancer prevention but faces challenges: high morphological variability (flat to protruding lesions), strong visual similarity to normal structures (folds/vessels), and need for robust multi-scale detection. Existing deep learning methods suffer from unidirectional processing, weak multi-scale fusion, lack of anatomical constraints, leading to false positives and false negatives.

Method: GRAFNet emulates human visual system hierarchy with three key modules: (1) Guided Asymmetric Attention Module (GAAM) mimics orientation-tuned cortical neurons to emphasize polyp boundaries; (2) MultiScale Retinal Module (MSRM) replicates retinal ganglion cell pathways for parallel multi-feature analysis; (3) Guided Cortical Attention Feedback Module (GCAFM) applies predictive coding for iterative refinement. These are unified in a Polyp Encoder-Decoder Module (PEDM) that enforces spatial-semantic consistency via resolution-adaptive feedback.

Result: Extensive experiments on five public benchmarks (Kvasir-SEG, CVC-300, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-Clinic, PolypGen) demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance with 3-8% Dice improvements and 10-20% higher generalization over leading methods, while offering interpretable decision pathways.

Conclusion: GRAFNet establishes a paradigm where neural computation principles bridge the gap between AI accuracy and clinically trustworthy reasoning, providing both high performance and interpretability for polyp segmentation in colonoscopy.

Abstract: Accurate polyp segmentation in colonoscopy is essential for cancer prevention but remains challenging due to: (1) high morphological variability (from flat to protruding lesions), (2) strong visual similarity to normal structures such as folds and vessels, and (3) the need for robust multi-scale detection. Existing deep learning approaches suffer from unidirectional processing, weak multi-scale fusion, and the absence of anatomical constraints, often leading to false positives (over-segmentation of normal structures) and false negatives (missed subtle flat lesions). We propose GRAFNet, a biologically inspired architecture that emulates the hierarchical organisation of the human visual system. GRAFNet integrates three key modules: (1) a Guided Asymmetric Attention Module (GAAM) that mimics orientation-tuned cortical neurones to emphasise polyp boundaries, (2) a MultiScale Retinal Module (MSRM) that replicates retinal ganglion cell pathways for parallel multi-feature analysis, and (3) a Guided Cortical Attention Feedback Module (GCAFM) that applies predictive coding for iterative refinement. These are unified in a Polyp Encoder-Decoder Module (PEDM) that enforces spatial-semantic consistency via resolution-adaptive feedback. Extensive experiments on five public benchmarks (Kvasir-SEG, CVC-300, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-Clinic, and PolypGen) demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance, with 3-8% Dice improvements and 10-20% higher generalisation over leading methods, while offering interpretable decision pathways. This work establishes a paradigm in which neural computation principles bridge the gap between AI accuracy and clinically trustworthy reasoning.

### [2] [Zero-shot HOI Detection with MLLM-based Detector-agnostic Interaction Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15124)
*Shiyu Xuan,Dongkai Wang,Zechao Li,Jinhui Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A decoupled framework for zero-shot human-object interaction detection that separates object detection from interaction recognition using MLLMs, achieving superior performance without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HOI detection methods tightly couple interaction recognition with specific detectors and rely on coarse-grained VLM features, limiting generalization to unseen interactions. There's a need for a more flexible, decoupled approach that can work with any object detector.

Method: Proposes a decoupled framework separating object detection from interaction recognition. Uses MLLMs for zero-shot IR via deterministic generation formulated as visual QA. Includes spatial-aware pooling module for appearance and spatial cues, and one-pass deterministic matching for efficiency.

Result: Achieves superior zero-shot performance on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets, demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization, and shows flexibility to integrate with any object detectors without retraining.

Conclusion: The decoupled framework with MLLMs enables effective zero-shot HOI detection with better generalization, flexibility, and performance compared to existing methods, offering a promising direction for open-vocabulary interaction recognition.

Abstract: Zero-shot Human-object interaction (HOI) detection aims to locate humans and objects in images and recognize their interactions. While advances in open-vocabulary object detection provide promising solutions for object localization, interaction recognition (IR) remains challenging due to the combinatorial diversity of interactions. Existing methods, including two-stage methods, tightly couple IR with a specific detector and rely on coarse-grained vision-language model (VLM) features, which limit generalization to unseen interactions. In this work, we propose a decoupled framework that separates object detection from IR and leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for zero-shot IR. We introduce a deterministic generation method that formulates IR as a visual question answering task and enforces deterministic outputs, enabling training-free zero-shot IR. To further enhance performance and efficiency by fine-tuning the model, we design a spatial-aware pooling module that integrates appearance and pairwise spatial cues, and a one-pass deterministic matching method that predicts all candidate interactions in a single forward pass. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO demonstrate that our method achieves superior zero-shot performance, strong cross-dataset generalization, and the flexibility to integrate with any object detectors without retraining.

### [3] [MB-DSMIL-CL-PL: Scalable Weakly Supervised Ovarian Cancer Subtype Classification and Localisation Using Contrastive and Prototype Learning with Frozen Patch Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15138)
*Marcus Jenkins,Jasenka Mazibrada,Bogdan Leahu,Michal Mackiewicz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes contrastive and prototype learning with frozen features for ovarian cancer subtype classification and localization, achieving significant F1 and AUC improvements over DSMIL while maintaining scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Histopathological subtype analysis is crucial for personalized ovarian cancer treatment, but increasing diagnostic workloads challenge UK pathology departments. Traditional AI approaches using pre-computed frozen features lack accuracy, while end-to-end methods improve accuracy but sacrifice scalability and require time-consuming experimentation.

Method: Uses contrastive and prototype learning with pre-computed, frozen features via feature-space augmentations for subtype classification and localization in ovarian cancer histopathology images.

Result: Achieves 70.4% and 15.3% F1 score improvements for instance- and slide-level classification respectively over DSMIL, with 16.9% AUC gain for instance localization and 2.3% AUC gain for slide classification, while maintaining frozen patch features.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides accurate ovarian cancer subtype classification and localization while maintaining the scalability benefits of frozen features, addressing the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency in histopathology AI.

Abstract: The study of histopathological subtypes is valuable for the personalisation of effective treatment strategies for ovarian cancer. However, increasing diagnostic workloads present a challenge for UK pathology departments, leading to the rise in AI approaches. While traditional approaches in this field have relied on pre-computed, frozen image features, recent advances have shifted towards end-to-end feature extraction, providing an improvement in accuracy but at the expense of significantly reduced scalability during training and time-consuming experimentation. In this paper, we propose a new approach for subtype classification and localisation in ovarian cancer histopathology images using contrastive and prototype learning with pre-computed, frozen features via feature-space augmentations. Compared to DSMIL, our method achieves an improvement of 70.4\% and 15.3\% in F1 score for instance- and slide-level classification, respectively, along with AUC gains of 16.9\% for instance localisation and 2.3\% for slide classification, while maintaining the use of frozen patch features.

### [4] [Loss Knows Best: Detecting Annotation Errors in Videos via Loss Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15154)
*Praditha Alwis,Soumyadeep Chandra,Deepak Ravikumar,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A model-agnostic method using Cumulative Sample Loss (CSL) to detect annotation errors (mislabeling and disordering) in video datasets without requiring ground truth error labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world video datasets often contain annotation errors like mislabeling and temporal disordering, which are particularly harmful for phase-annotated tasks where temporal consistency is critical. These errors undermine model training reliability.

Method: Proposes Cumulative Sample Loss (CSL) - the average loss a frame incurs across model checkpoints saved during training. Frames with persistently high or irregular CSL patterns are flagged as likely annotation errors, as mislabeled/disordered frames remain difficult to learn throughout training.

Result: Experiments on EgoPER and Cholec80 datasets demonstrate strong detection performance for identifying subtle inconsistencies like mislabeling and frame disordering, providing effective dataset auditing.

Conclusion: The CSL-based approach offers a powerful, model-agnostic tool for dataset auditing that improves training reliability in video-based machine learning without requiring ground truth error annotations.

Abstract: High-quality video datasets are foundational for training robust models in tasks like action recognition, phase detection, and event segmentation. However, many real-world video datasets suffer from annotation errors such as *mislabeling*, where segments are assigned incorrect class labels, and *disordering*, where the temporal sequence does not follow the correct progression. These errors are particularly harmful in phase-annotated tasks, where temporal consistency is critical. We propose a novel, model-agnostic method for detecting annotation errors by analyzing the Cumulative Sample Loss (CSL)--defined as the average loss a frame incurs when passing through model checkpoints saved across training epochs. This per-frame loss trajectory acts as a dynamic fingerprint of frame-level learnability. Mislabeled or disordered frames tend to show consistently high or irregular loss patterns, as they remain difficult for the model to learn throughout training, while correctly labeled frames typically converge to low loss early. To compute CSL, we train a video segmentation model and store its weights at each epoch. These checkpoints are then used to evaluate the loss of each frame in a test video. Frames with persistently high CSL are flagged as likely candidates for annotation errors, including mislabeling or temporal misalignment. Our method does not require ground truth on annotation errors and is generalizable across datasets. Experiments on EgoPER and Cholec80 demonstrate strong detection performance, effectively identifying subtle inconsistencies such as mislabeling and frame disordering. The proposed approach provides a powerful tool for dataset auditing and improving training reliability in video-based machine learning.

### [5] [Distributional Deep Learning for Super-Resolution of 4D Flow MRI under Domain Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15167)
*Xiaoyi Wen,Fei Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Distributional deep learning framework for super-resolution in medical imaging that addresses domain shift between synthetic training data (CFD simulations) and real clinical data (4D Flow MRI).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world clinical low-resolution data often comes from different acquisition mechanisms than simple downsampling used in training, causing domain shift and poor generalization of conventional super-resolution models.

Method: Distributional deep learning framework trained on high-resolution CFD simulations and downsampled counterparts, then fine-tuned on small harmonized dataset of paired 4D Flow MRI and CFD samples.

Result: Framework significantly outperforms traditional deep learning approaches in real data applications, demonstrating effectiveness in addressing domain shift and improving super-resolution performance.

Conclusion: Distributional learning effectively addresses domain shift in medical imaging super-resolution, improving robustness and generalization for clinically realistic scenarios like 4D Flow MRI enhancement.

Abstract: Super-resolution is widely used in medical imaging to enhance low-quality data, reducing scan time and improving abnormality detection. Conventional super-resolution approaches typically rely on paired datasets of downsampled and original high resolution images, training models to reconstruct high resolution images from their artificially degraded counterparts. However, in real-world clinical settings, low resolution data often arise from acquisition mechanisms that differ significantly from simple downsampling. As a result, these inputs may lie outside the domain of the training data, leading to poor model generalization due to domain shift. To address this limitation, we propose a distributional deep learning framework that improves model robustness and domain generalization. We develop this approch for enhancing the resolution of 4D Flow MRI (4DF). This is a novel imaging modality that captures hemodynamic flow velocity and clinically relevant metrics such as vessel wall stress. These metrics are critical for assessing aneurysm rupture risk. Our model is initially trained on high resolution computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and their downsampled counterparts. It is then fine-tuned on a small, harmonized dataset of paired 4D Flow MRI and CFD samples. We derive the theoretical properties of our distributional estimators and demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms traditional deep learning approaches through real data applications. This highlights the effectiveness of distributional learning in addressing domain shift and improving super-resolution performance in clinically realistic scenarios.

### [6] [Time-Archival Camera Virtualization for Sports and Visual Performances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15181)
*Yunxiao Zhang,William Stone,Suryansh Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A neural volume rendering approach for camera virtualization that enables photorealistic novel view synthesis of dynamic scenes with efficient time-archival capabilities for sports and live events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting methods struggle with fast-paced dynamic scenes, non-rigid motions, and multiple independent subjects, while lacking time-archival capabilities needed for sports broadcasting and live event analysis.

Method: Models dynamic scenes as rigid transformations across synchronized camera views, using neural representation learning to enable high-quality rendering and time-archival functionality for revisiting past temporal instances.

Result: Provides enhanced visual rendering quality with support for time-archival, allowing users to revisit any past moment and perform novel view synthesis for replay, analysis, and archival of live events.

Conclusion: Neural volume rendering offers a promising alternative to Gaussian splatting for camera virtualization, addressing limitations in handling complex dynamic scenes while adding valuable time-archival capabilities for practical applications.

Abstract: Camera virtualization -- an emerging solution to novel view synthesis -- holds transformative potential for visual entertainment, live performances, and sports broadcasting by enabling the generation of photorealistic images from novel viewpoints using images from a limited set of calibrated multiple static physical cameras. Despite recent advances, achieving spatially and temporally coherent and photorealistic rendering of dynamic scenes with efficient time-archival capabilities, particularly in fast-paced sports and stage performances, remains challenging for existing approaches. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for dynamic scenes could offer real-time view-synthesis results. Yet, they are hindered by their dependence on accurate 3D point clouds from the structure-from-motion method and their inability to handle large, non-rigid, rapid motions of different subjects (e.g., flips, jumps, articulations, sudden player-to-player transitions). Moreover, independent motions of multiple subjects can break the Gaussian-tracking assumptions commonly used in 4DGS, ST-GS, and other dynamic splatting variants. This paper advocates reconsidering a neural volume rendering formulation for camera virtualization and efficient time-archival capabilities, making it useful for sports broadcasting and related applications. By modeling a dynamic scene as rigid transformations across multiple synchronized camera views at a given time, our method performs neural representation learning, providing enhanced visual rendering quality at test time. A key contribution of our approach is its support for time-archival, i.e., users can revisit any past temporal instance of a dynamic scene and can perform novel view synthesis, enabling retrospective rendering for replay, analysis, and archival of live events, a functionality absent in existing neural rendering approaches and novel view synthesis...

### [7] [How to Train Your Long-Context Visual Document Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15257)
*Austin Veselka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First large-scale study training vision-language models up to 344K context for long-document visual QA, achieving SOTA on MMLongBenchDoc with systematic training recipes and novel findings about context length matching, page indices, and bidirectional context transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-weight long-context vision-language models (Qwen3 VL, GLM 4.5/6V) lack reproducible training recipes and data pipelines, creating a gap in understanding how to effectively train models for long-document visual question answering.

Method: Systematic study of continued pretraining, supervised finetuning, and preference optimization for 24B and 32B parameter models, with extensive long-context evaluations and ablations. Includes synthetic data pipelines for self-improvement and introduces page indices for training/evaluation.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on MMLongBenchDoc for both 24B and 32B parameter scales. Key findings: context length matching outperforms longer training contexts, page indices boost performance, synthetic data enables self-improvement, and visual long-context training transfers to text tasks.

Conclusion: Provides reproducible training recipes for long-context vision-language models, introduces MMLBD-C (corrected benchmark), and demonstrates bidirectional context transfer between visual and text domains, advancing long-document visual QA capabilities.

Abstract: We present the first comprehensive, large-scale study of training long-context vision language models up to 344K context, targeting long-document visual question answering with measured transfer to long-context text. While several such strong are open-weight, namely Qwen3 VL and GLM 4.5/6V, their training recipes and data pipelines are not reproducible. We systematically study continued pretraining, supervised finetuning, and preference optimization for 24B and 32B parameter models, backed by extensive LC evaluations and ablations to bridge this gap, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on MMLongBenchDoc for both parameter scales. In addition to this, our key findings include: (i) training on context lengths that match evaluation context lengths outperforms training on longer contexts, (ii) training and evaluating with page indices provides a simple, high-impact boost to long-document performance, (iii) our synthetic data pipelines enable self-improvement via continued pretraining and supervised finetuning, and (iv) we extend the known text-to-visual long context transfer to the reverse, showing that visual long context training transfers to long-context text performance. We also release MMLBD-C, a manually corrected version of MMLongBenchDoc to reduce erroneous and low quality examples in the benchmark.

### [8] [Accelerating Large-Scale Dataset Distillation via Exploration-Exploitation Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15277)
*Muhammad J. Alahmadi,Peng Gao,Feiyi Wang,Dongkuan,Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E²D is a dataset distillation method that bridges the accuracy-efficiency gap through a two-phase optimization strategy with exploration and exploitation phases, achieving state-of-the-art results on ImageNet benchmarks while being significantly faster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current decoupling-based dataset distillation methods face a trade-off: optimization-based methods are accurate but computationally intensive, while optimization-free methods are efficient but less accurate. There's a need to bridge this accuracy-efficiency gap for practical large-scale deployment.

Method: E²D uses full-image initialization to preserve semantic integrity, followed by a two-phase optimization strategy: 1) Exploration phase with uniform updates to identify high-loss regions, and 2) Exploitation phase that focuses updates on these high-loss regions to accelerate convergence and minimize redundant computation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-1K while being 18x faster, and substantially improves accuracy on ImageNet-21K while remaining 4.3x faster than existing methods.

Conclusion: Targeted, redundancy-reducing updates (rather than brute-force optimization) effectively bridge the accuracy-efficiency gap in large-scale dataset distillation, making the method both practical and high-performing.

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses the original data into compact synthetic datasets, reducing training time and storage while retaining model performance, enabling deployment under limited resources. Although recent decoupling-based distillation methods enable dataset distillation at large-scale, they continue to face an efficiency gap: optimization-based decoupling methods achieve higher accuracy but demand intensive computation, whereas optimization-free decoupling methods are efficient but sacrifice accuracy. To overcome this trade-off, we propose Exploration-Exploitation Distillation (E^2D), a simple, practical method that minimizes redundant computation through an efficient pipeline that begins with full-image initialization to preserve semantic integrity and feature diversity. It then uses a two-phase optimization strategy: an exploration phase that performs uniform updates and identifies high-loss regions, and an exploitation phase that focuses updates on these regions to accelerate convergence. We evaluate E^2D on large-scale benchmarks, surpassing the state-of-the-art on ImageNet-1K while being 18x faster, and on ImageNet-21K, our method substantially improves accuracy while remaining 4.3x faster. These results demonstrate that targeted, redundancy-reducing updates, rather than brute-force optimization, bridge the gap between accuracy and efficiency in large-scale dataset distillation.

### [9] [Visual Persuasion: What Influences Decisions of Vision-Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15278)
*Manuel Cherep,Pranav M R,Pattie Maes,Nikhil Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Researchers develop a framework to study visual preferences of vision-language models by systematically editing images and observing choice behaviors, revealing visual vulnerabilities that could be exploited.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As VLMs increasingly make visual decisions at scale (clicking, recommending, buying), we lack understanding of their visual preferences and potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited in the wild.

Method: Place VLMs in controlled image-based choice tasks, systematically perturb inputs via visual prompt optimization (adapting text optimization methods to propose visually plausible modifications using image generation models), then evaluate which edits increase selection probability.

Result: Optimized edits significantly shift choice probabilities in head-to-head comparisons; automatic interpretability pipeline identifies consistent visual themes driving selection, revealing visual vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: This approach offers practical way to surface visual vulnerabilities proactively, supporting more effective auditing and governance of image-based AI agents before issues emerge in real-world deployment.

Abstract: The web is littered with images, once created for human consumption and now increasingly interpreted by agents using vision-language models (VLMs). These agents make visual decisions at scale, deciding what to click, recommend, or buy. Yet, we know little about the structure of their visual preferences. We introduce a framework for studying this by placing VLMs in controlled image-based choice tasks and systematically perturbing their inputs. Our key idea is to treat the agent's decision function as a latent visual utility that can be inferred through revealed preference: choices between systematically edited images. Starting from common images, such as product photos, we propose methods for visual prompt optimization, adapting text optimization methods to iteratively propose and apply visually plausible modifications using an image generation model (such as in composition, lighting, or background). We then evaluate which edits increase selection probability. Through large-scale experiments on frontier VLMs, we demonstrate that optimized edits significantly shift choice probabilities in head-to-head comparisons. We develop an automatic interpretability pipeline to explain these preferences, identifying consistent visual themes that drive selection. We argue that this approach offers a practical and efficient way to surface visual vulnerabilities, safety concerns that might otherwise be discovered implicitly in the wild, supporting more proactive auditing and governance of image-based AI agents.

### [10] [Consistency-Preserving Diverse Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15287)
*Xinshuang Liu,Runfa Blark Li,Truong Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a joint-sampling framework for text-to-video generation that improves batch diversity while preserving temporal consistency using lightweight latent-space models to avoid costly video decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-video generation is expensive, typically producing few samples per prompt, requiring high cross-video diversity. Existing diversity methods for videos often degrade temporal consistency and require costly backpropagation through video decoders.

Method: Joint-sampling framework for flow-matching video generators that applies diversity-driven updates, then removes components that would decrease temporal consistency. Uses lightweight latent-space models to compute both objectives without video decoding or decoder backpropagation.

Result: Achieves diversity comparable to strong joint-sampling baselines while substantially improving temporal consistency and color naturalness on a state-of-the-art text-to-video flow-matching model.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively balances diversity and temporal consistency in text-to-video generation while avoiding computational costs of traditional methods, with code to be released.

Abstract: Text-to-video generation is expensive, so only a few samples are typically produced per prompt. In this low-sample regime, maximizing the value of each batch requires high cross-video diversity. Recent methods improve diversity for image generation, but for videos they often degrade within-video temporal consistency and require costly backpropagation through a video decoder. We propose a joint-sampling framework for flow-matching video generators that improves batch diversity while preserving temporal consistency. Our approach applies diversity-driven updates and then removes only the components that would decrease a temporal-consistency objective. To avoid image-space gradients, we compute both objectives with lightweight latent-space models, avoiding video decoding and decoder backpropagation. Experiments on a state-of-the-art text-to-video flow-matching model show diversity comparable to strong joint-sampling baselines while substantially improving temporal consistency and color naturalness. Code will be released.

*Tai Le-Gia,Jaehyun Ahn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free 3D zero-shot anomaly detection for brain MRI using 2D foundation models to create volumetric tokens without supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot anomaly detection methods are limited to 2D medical images and fail to capture volumetric structure in 3D medical imaging like brain MRI, requiring new approaches that can handle 3D data without task-specific supervision.

Method: Constructs localized volumetric tokens by aggregating multi-axis slices processed by 2D foundation models, creating 3D patch tokens that restore cubic spatial context and integrate with distance-based, batch-level anomaly detection pipelines.

Result: The framework provides compact 3D representations that are practical to compute on standard GPUs and effectively extends training-free, batch-based zero-shot anomaly detection from 2D encoders to full 3D MRI volumes.

Conclusion: Training-free zero-shot anomaly detection can be effectively extended to 3D medical imaging, offering a simple and robust approach for volumetric anomaly detection without fine-tuning, prompts, or supervision.

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) has gained increasing attention in medical imaging as a way to identify abnormalities without task-specific supervision, but most advances remain limited to 2D datasets. Extending ZSAD to 3D medical images has proven challenging, with existing methods relying on slice-wise features and vision-language models, which fail to capture volumetric structure. In this paper, we introduce a fully training-free framework for ZSAD in 3D brain MRI that constructs localized volumetric tokens by aggregating multi-axis slices processed by 2D foundation models. These 3D patch tokens restore cubic spatial context and integrate directly with distance-based, batch-level anomaly detection pipelines. The framework provides compact 3D representations that are practical to compute on standard GPUs and require no fine-tuning, prompts, or supervision. Our results show that training-free, batch-based ZSAD can be effectively extended from 2D encoders to full 3D MRI volumes, offering a simple and robust approach for volumetric anomaly detection.

### [12] [Sparrow: Text-Anchored Window Attention with Visual-Semantic Glimpsing for Speculative Decoding in Video LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15318)
*Libo Zhang,Zhaoning Zhang,Wangyang Hong,Peng Qiao,Dongsheng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sparrow framework accelerates Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) inference by addressing attention dilution and negative visual gain through hidden state reuse and intermediate-layer training, achieving 2.82x speedup with 25k visual tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speculative decoding faces severe performance collapse when applied to Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) due to attention dilution and negative visual gain caused by key-value cache explosion and context window mismatches. Visual semantic internalization phenomenon shows critical visual semantics are encoded into text hidden states, making raw visual inputs redundant during deep inference.

Method: Sparrow framework uses visually-aware text-anchored window attention via hidden state reuse to offload visual computation to the target model, leverages intermediate-layer visual state bridging to train draft model with semantic-rich intermediate states (filtering low-level visual noise), and introduces multi-token prediction strategy to bridge training-inference distribution shift.

Result: Sparrow achieves average speedup of 2.82x even with 25k visual tokens, effectively resolving performance degradation in long sequences and offering practical solution for real-time long video tasks.

Conclusion: Sparrow provides an effective framework for accelerating Vid-LLMs inference by addressing the unique challenges of video processing, enabling practical real-time long video applications through hidden state reuse and intermediate-layer training strategies.

Abstract: Although speculative decoding is widely used to accelerate Vision-Language Models (VLMs) inference, it faces severe performance collapse when applied to Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs). The draft model typically falls into the trap of attention dilution and negative visual gain due to key-value cache explosion and context window mismatches. We observe a visual semantic internalization phenomenon in Vid-LLMs, indicating that critical visual semantics are implicitly encoded into text hidden states during deep-layer interactions, which renders raw visual inputs structurally redundant during deep inference. To address this, we propose the Sparrow framework, which first utilizes visually-aware text-anchored window attention via hidden state reuse to fully offload visual computation to the target model, and leverages intermediate-layer visual state bridging to train the draft model with semantic-rich intermediate states, thereby filtering out low-level visual noise. Additionally, a multi-token prediction strategy is introduced to bridge the training-inference distribution shift. Experiments show that Sparrow achieves an average speedup of 2.82x even with 25k visual tokens, effectively resolving the performance degradation in long sequences and offering a practical solution for real-time long video tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EventMemAgent: Active online video agent with hierarchical memory (short-term event detection + long-term event archiving) and agentic RL for continuous video understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address conflict between unbounded streaming video input and limited MLLM context windows; overcome trade-off between long-range context and fine-grained detail capture in current passive methods.

Method: Hierarchical memory framework with short-term memory for event boundary detection using reservoir sampling, long-term memory for structured event archiving, multi-granular perception toolkit, and Agentic RL for end-to-end reasoning/tool-use internalization.

Result: Achieves competitive results on online video benchmarks.

Conclusion: Proposes active agent framework for continuous video understanding that balances context maintenance with detail capture through hierarchical memory and learned reasoning strategies.

Abstract: Online video understanding requires models to perform continuous perception and long-range reasoning within potentially infinite visual streams. Its fundamental challenge lies in the conflict between the unbounded nature of streaming media input and the limited context window of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Current methods primarily rely on passive processing, which often face a trade-off between maintaining long-range context and capturing the fine-grained details necessary for complex tasks. To address this, we introduce EventMemAgent, an active online video agent framework based on a hierarchical memory module. Our framework employs a dual-layer strategy for online videos: short-term memory detects event boundaries and utilizes event-granular reservoir sampling to process streaming video frames within a fixed-length buffer dynamically; long-term memory structuredly archives past observations on an event-by-event basis. Furthermore, we integrate a multi-granular perception toolkit for active, iterative evidence capture and employ Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) to end-to-end internalize reasoning and tool-use strategies into the agent's intrinsic capabilities. Experiments show that EventMemAgent achieves competitive results on online video benchmarks. The code will be released here: https://github.com/lingcco/EventMemAgent.

Abstract: Multimodal Fusion Learning (MFL), leveraging disparate data from various imaging modalities (e.g., MRI, CT, SPECT), has shown great potential for addressing medical problems such as skin cancer and brain tumor prediction. However, existing MFL methods face three key limitations: a) they often specialize in specific modalities, and overlook effective shared complementary information across diverse modalities, hence limiting their generalizability for multi-disease analysis; b) they rely on computationally expensive models, restricting their applicability in resource-limited settings; and c) they lack robustness against adversarial attacks, compromising reliability in medical AI applications. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Multi-Attention Integration Learning (MAIL) network, incorporating two key components: a) an efficient residual learning attention block for capturing refined modality-specific multi-scale patterns and b) an efficient multimodal cross-attention module for learning enriched complementary shared representations across diverse modalities. Furthermore, to ensure adversarial robustness, we extend MAIL network to design Robust-MAIL by incorporating random projection filters and modulated attention noise. Extensive evaluations on 20 public datasets show that both MAIL and Robust-MAIL outperform existing methods, achieving performance gains of up to 9.34% while reducing computational costs by up to 78.3%. These results highlight the superiority of our approaches, ensuring more reliable predictions than top competitors. Code: https://github.com/misti1203/MAIL-Robust-MAIL.

*Jinho Baek,Houwei Cao,Kate Blackwell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CREMD dataset study shows context improves dog emotion annotation agreement, audio increases confidence, and surprising findings about annotator demographics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dog emotion recognition is important for human-animal interaction and veterinary care, but challenging due to subjective assessments and lack of standardized ground truth methods.

Method: Created CREMD dataset with 923 video clips presented in three modes (no context/audio, context only, context+audio), analyzed annotations from diverse participants including dog owners, professionals, and various demographics.

Result: (1) Visual context significantly improved annotation agreement, but audio findings inconclusive due to design limitations; (2) Non-owners and male annotators showed higher agreement than owners/females, while professionals had higher agreement as expected; (3) Audio substantially increased annotators' confidence in identifying anger and fear.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into factors influencing reliable dog emotion recognition, highlighting the importance of context, audio cues, and annotator characteristics in emotion labeling.

Abstract: Dog emotion recognition plays a crucial role in enhancing human-animal interactions, veterinary care, and the development of automated systems for monitoring canine well-being. However, accurately interpreting dog emotions is challenging due to the subjective nature of emotional assessments and the absence of standardized ground truth methods. We present the CREMD (Crowd-sourced Emotional Multimodal Dogs Dataset), a comprehensive dataset exploring how different presentation modes (e.g., context, audio, video) and annotator characteristics (e.g., dog ownership, gender, professional experience) influence the perception and labeling of dog emotions. The dataset consists of 923 video clips presented in three distinct modes: without context or audio, with context but no audio, and with both context and audio. We analyze annotations from diverse participants, including dog owners, professionals, and individuals with varying demographic backgrounds and experience levels, to identify factors that influence reliable dog emotion recognition. Our findings reveal several key insights: (1) while adding visual context significantly improved annotation agreement, our findings regarding audio cues are inconclusive due to design limitations (specifically, the absence of a no-context-with-audio condition and limited clean audio availability); (2) contrary to expectations, non-owners and male annotators showed higher agreement levels than dog owners and female annotators, respectively, while professionals showed higher agreement levels, aligned with our initial hypothesis; and (3) the presence of audio substantially increased annotators' confidence in identifying specific emotions, particularly anger and fear.

TL;DR: DAV-GSWT uses diffusion models and active view sampling to create Gaussian Splatting Wang Tiles from minimal input, reducing data needs while maintaining quality for large-scale environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian Splatting with Wang Tiles requires dense exemplar reconstructions, which is data-intensive. The paper aims to reduce data requirements while maintaining high-fidelity rendering for large-scale virtual environments.

Method: Combines diffusion priors with active view sampling, using hierarchical uncertainty quantification to identify informative viewpoints and generative diffusion models to hallucinate missing structural details for seamless tile transitions.

Result: Significantly reduces required data volume while maintaining visual integrity and interactive performance for large-scale virtual environments.

Conclusion: DAV-GSWT provides a data-efficient framework for synthesizing high-fidelity Gaussian Splatting Wang Tiles, enabling expansive landscape generation with minimal input observations.

Abstract: The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting has fundamentally redefined the capabilities of photorealistic neural rendering by enabling high-throughput synthesis of complex environments. While procedural methods like Wang Tiles have recently been integrated to facilitate the generation of expansive landscapes, these systems typically remain constrained by a reliance on densely sampled exemplar reconstructions. We present DAV-GSWT, a data-efficient framework that leverages diffusion priors and active view sampling to synthesize high-fidelity Gaussian Splatting Wang Tiles from minimal input observations. By integrating a hierarchical uncertainty quantification mechanism with generative diffusion models, our approach autonomously identifies the most informative viewpoints while hallucinating missing structural details to ensure seamless tile transitions. Experimental results indicate that our system significantly reduces the required data volume while maintaining the visual integrity and interactive performance necessary for large-scale virtual environments.

*Shentong Mo,Sukmin Yun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMAIL is a framework that treats generated images as a separate modality from real images and uses multi-modal learning to align them in latent space, enabling effective use of synthetic data for vision-language tasks without causing mode collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While generative models can produce realistic synthetic images for training, indiscriminate use of generated images as real images can cause mode collapse due to modality discrepancies between real and synthetic domains.

Method: Proposes GMAIL framework that treats generated images as separate modality, fine-tunes model on generated images using cross-modality alignment loss, then uses aligned model to train vision-language models with generated images through multi-modal learning approach.

Result: Significantly improves performance on image captioning, zero-shot image retrieval, zero-shot image classification, and long caption retrieval tasks; shows positive generated data scaling trends and notable enhancements in LLaVA's captioning performance.

Conclusion: By explicitly treating generated images as separate modality and aligning them with real images in latent space, GMAIL effectively leverages generative model advances to boost vision-language task performance while avoiding mode collapse issues.

Abstract: Generative models have made it possible to synthesize highly realistic images, potentially providing an abundant data source for training machine learning models. Despite the advantages of these synthesizable data sources, the indiscriminate use of generated images as real images for training can even cause mode collapse due to modality discrepancies between real and synthetic domains. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for discriminative use of generated images, coined GMAIL, that explicitly treats generated images as a separate modality from real images. Instead of indiscriminately replacing real images with generated ones in the pixel space, our approach bridges the two distinct modalities in the same latent space through a multi-modal learning approach. To be specific, we first fine-tune a model exclusively on generated images using a cross-modality alignment loss and then employ this aligned model to further train various vision-language models with generated images. By aligning the two modalities, our approach effectively leverages the benefits of recent advances in generative models, thereby boosting the effectiveness of generated image learning across a range of vision-language tasks. Our framework can be easily incorporated with various vision-language models, and we demonstrate its efficacy throughout extensive experiments. For example, our framework significantly improves performance on image captioning, zero-shot image retrieval, zero-shot image classification, and long caption retrieval tasks. It also shows positive generated data scaling trends and notable enhancements in the captioning performance of the large multimodal model, LLaVA.

TL;DR: A novel framework for day-to-night unpaired image translation that detects and suppresses semantic hallucinations using a dual-head discriminator and class-specific prototypes, improving downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Day-to-night image translation is challenging due to large appearance shifts and lack of pixel-level supervision, causing semantic hallucinations where objects like traffic signs and vehicles are incorrectly synthesized, degrading downstream performance.

Method: Uses a dual-head discriminator for semantic segmentation to detect hallucinations in background regions, and class-specific prototypes constructed from target-domain object features as semantic anchors. Built on Schrodinger Bridge-based translation with iterative refinement where hallucinated features are pushed away from class prototypes.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches qualitatively and quantitatively. On BDD100K dataset, improves mAP by 15.5% for day-to-night domain adaptation, with 31.7% gain for hallucination-prone classes like traffic lights.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively detects and suppresses semantic hallucinations in unpaired day-to-night image translation, significantly improving downstream task performance by preserving object semantics through class-specific prototypes and iterative refinement.

Abstract: Day-to-night unpaired image translation is important to downstream tasks but remains challenging due to large appearance shifts and the lack of direct pixel-level supervision. Existing methods often introduce semantic hallucinations, where objects from target classes such as traffic signs and vehicles, as well as man-made light effects, are incorrectly synthesized. These hallucinations significantly degrade downstream performance. We propose a novel framework that detects and suppresses hallucinations of target-class features during unpaired translation. To detect hallucination, we design a dual-head discriminator that additionally performs semantic segmentation to identify hallucinated content in background regions. To suppress these hallucinations, we introduce class-specific prototypes, constructed by aggregating features of annotated target-domain objects, which act as semantic anchors for each class. Built upon a Schrodinger Bridge-based translation model, our framework performs iterative refinement, where detected hallucination features are explicitly pushed away from class prototypes in feature space, thus preserving object semantics across the translation trajectory.Experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively. On the BDD100K dataset, it improves mAP by 15.5% for day-to-night domain adaptation, with a notable 31.7% gain for classes such as traffic lights that are prone to hallucinations.

*Jeongwoo Shin,Jinhwan Sul,Joonseok Lee,Jaewong Choi,Jaemoo Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASBM is a two-stage Schrödinger Bridge framework that learns optimal trajectories for diffusion models, producing straighter sampling paths and better image generation with fewer steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard diffusion models have highly curved trajectories and noisy score targets due to uninformative, memoryless forward processes with independent data-noise coupling, leading to inefficient sampling.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Learn SB forward dynamic as coupling construction via data-to-energy sampling that transports data to energy-defined prior; 2) Learn backward generative dynamic with simple matching loss supervised by induced optimal coupling.

Result: ASBM produces significantly straighter and more efficient sampling paths, scales to high-dimensional data with improved stability/efficiency, improves image generation fidelity with fewer steps, and enables effective distillation to one-step generator.

Conclusion: ASBM's non-memoryless regime and optimal trajectory recovery via Schrödinger Bridge matching offers superior generative modeling with efficient sampling and high-quality results.

Abstract: Diffusion models often yield highly curved trajectories and noisy score targets due to an uninformative, memoryless forward process that induces independent data-noise coupling. We propose Adjoint Schrödinger Bridge Matching (ASBM), a generative modeling framework that recovers optimal trajectories in high dimensions via two stages. First, we view the Schrödinger Bridge (SB) forward dynamic as a coupling construction problem and learn it through a data-to-energy sampling perspective that transports data to an energy-defined prior. Then, we learn the backward generative dynamic with a simple matching loss supervised by the induced optimal coupling. By operating in a non-memoryless regime, ASBM produces significantly straighter and more efficient sampling paths. Compared to prior works, ASBM scales to high-dimensional data with notably improved stability and efficiency. Extensive experiments on image generation show that ASBM improves fidelity with fewer sampling steps. We further showcase the effectiveness of our optimal trajectory via distillation to a one-step generator.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most current MAD systems require task-specific training and generalize poorly to unseen attack types, while the potential of open-source MLLMs in biometric forensics remains underexplored despite their strong visual-linguistic reasoning capabilities.

Method: First systematic zero-shot evaluation of open-source MLLMs for single-image MAD using publicly available weights and standardized, reproducible protocols across diverse morphing techniques without any fine-tuning or domain adaptation.

Result: Many MLLMs show non-trivial discriminative ability, with LLaVA1.6-Mistral-7B achieving state-of-the-art performance, surpassing competitive task-specific MAD baselines by at least 23% in equal error rate (EER).

Conclusion: Multimodal pretraining implicitly encodes fine-grained facial inconsistencies indicative of morphing artifacts, enabling zero-shot forensic sensitivity. Open-source MLLMs serve as reproducible, interpretable, and competitive foundations for biometric security and forensic image analysis.

Abstract: Face morphing attacks threaten biometric verification, yet most morphing attack detection (MAD) systems require task-specific training and generalize poorly to unseen attack types. Meanwhile, open-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong visual-linguistic reasoning, but their potential in biometric forensics remains underexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic zero-shot evaluation of open-source MLLMs for single-image MAD, using publicly available weights and a standardized, reproducible protocol. Across diverse morphing techniques, many MLLMs show non-trivial discriminative ability without any fine-tuning or domain adaptation, and LLaVA1.6-Mistral-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing highly competitive task-specific MAD baselines by at least 23% in terms of equal error rate (EER). The results indicate that multimodal pretraining can implicitly encode fine-grained facial inconsistencies indicative of morphing artifacts, enabling zero-shot forensic sensitivity. Our findings position open-source MLLMs as reproducible, interpretable, and competitive foundations for biometric security and forensic image analysis. This emergent capability also highlights new opportunities to develop state-of-the-art MAD systems through targeted fine-tuning or lightweight adaptation, further improving accuracy and efficiency while preserving interpretability. To support future research, all code and evaluation protocols will be released upon publication.

### [21] [RPT-SR: Regional Prior attention Transformer for infrared image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15490)
*Youngwan Jin,Incheol Park,Yagiz Nalcakan,Hyeongjin Ju,Sanghyeop Yeo,Shiho Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RPT-SR is a regional prior attention transformer for infrared super-resolution that encodes scene layout priors into attention, outperforming general-purpose models on fixed-viewpoint infrared imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose super-resolution models fail to exploit persistent spatial priors in fixed-viewpoint infrared scenarios like surveillance and autonomous driving, leading to redundant learning and suboptimal performance.

Method: Proposes RPT-SR with dual-token framework: learnable regional prior tokens for scene's global structure and local tokens for frame-specific content, fused through attention to dynamically modulate local reconstruction.

Result: Establishes new state-of-the-art performance across diverse datasets covering both Long-Wave (LWIR) and Short-Wave (SWIR) infrared spectra.

Conclusion: RPT-SR effectively leverages scene-specific priors for infrared super-resolution, demonstrating broad applicability across different infrared bands and outperforming general-purpose approaches.

Abstract: General-purpose super-resolution models, particularly Vision Transformers, have achieved remarkable success but exhibit fundamental inefficiencies in common infrared imaging scenarios like surveillance and autonomous driving, which operate from fixed or nearly-static viewpoints. These models fail to exploit the strong, persistent spatial priors inherent in such scenes, leading to redundant learning and suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose the Regional Prior attention Transformer for infrared image Super-Resolution (RPT-SR), a novel architecture that explicitly encodes scene layout information into the attention mechanism. Our core contribution is a dual-token framework that fuses (1) learnable, regional prior tokens, which act as a persistent memory for the scene's global structure, with (2) local tokens that capture the frame-specific content of the current input. By utilizing these tokens into an attention, our model allows the priors to dynamically modulate the local reconstruction process. Extensive experiments validate our approach. While most prior works focus on a single infrared band, we demonstrate the broad applicability and versatility of RPT-SR by establishing new state-of-the-art performance across diverse datasets covering both Long-Wave (LWIR) and Short-Wave (SWIR) spectra

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LEADER is a lightweight end-to-end neural network that extracts fingerprint minutiae directly from raw images without separate preprocessing/postprocessing, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with only 0.9M parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning approaches for fingerprint minutiae extraction still rely on separate preprocessing and postprocessing steps, lacking truly end-to-end solutions that could improve efficiency and performance.

Method: Proposes LEADER with a dual-autoencoder structure connected via attention-gating, novel "Castle-Moat-Rampart" ground-truth encoding, and integrated non-maximum suppression and angular decoding for complete end-to-end inference.

Result: Achieves 34% higher F1-score on NIST SD27 dataset compared to specialized latent extractors, ranks first in 47% of samples (more than double second-best), and shows robust cross-domain generalization from plain to latent fingerprints.

Conclusion: LEADER demonstrates that lightweight end-to-end architectures can achieve superior minutiae extraction performance while learning meaningful fingerprint representations, with efficient inference (15ms GPU/322ms CPU) outperforming commercial software.

Abstract: Minutiae extraction, a fundamental stage in fingerprint recognition, is increasingly shifting toward deep learning. However, truly end-to-end methods that eliminate separate preprocessing and postprocessing steps remain scarce. This paper introduces LEADER (Lightweight End-to-end Attention-gated Dual autoencodER), a neural network that maps raw fingerprint images to minutiae descriptors, including location, direction, and type. The proposed architecture integrates non-maximum suppression and angular decoding to enable complete end-to-end inference using only 0.9M parameters. It employs a novel "Castle-Moat-Rampart" ground-truth encoding and a dual-autoencoder structure, interconnected through an attention-gating mechanism. Experimental evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy on plain fingerprints and robust cross-domain generalization to latent impressions. Specifically, LEADER attains a 34% higher F1-score on the NIST SD27 dataset compared to specialized latent minutiae extractors. Sample-level analysis on this challenging benchmark reveals an average rank of 2.07 among all compared methods, with LEADER securing the first-place position in 47% of the samples-more than doubling the frequency of the second-best extractor. The internal representations learned by the model align with established fingerprint domain features, such as segmentation masks, orientation fields, frequency maps, and skeletons. Inference requires 15ms on GPU and 322ms on CPU, outperforming leading commercial software in computational efficiency. The source code and pre-trained weights are publicly released to facilitate reproducibility.

TL;DR: Semantic filtering framework using vision-language models removes transient objects in 3D Gaussian Splatting without motion heuristics or high memory cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transient objects in multi-view captures cause ghosting artifacts in 3DGS reconstruction. Existing solutions either use scene decomposition with high memory cost or motion-based heuristics vulnerable to parallax ambiguity.

Method: Category-aware transient removal using CLIP vision-language models. Accumulate CLIP similarity scores between rendered views and distractor text prompts per-Gaussian across training. Gaussians exceeding calibrated threshold undergo opacity regularization and periodic pruning.

Result: Consistent improvement in reconstruction quality over vanilla 3DGS across four sequences in RobustNeRF benchmark. Maintains minimal memory overhead and real-time rendering performance. Threshold calibration and baseline comparisons validate semantic guidance as practical strategy.

Conclusion: Semantic classification resolves parallax ambiguity by identifying object categories independently of motion patterns. Semantic filtering is effective for transient removal in scenarios with predictable distractor categories.

Abstract: Transient objects in casual multi-view captures cause ghosting artifacts in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) reconstruction. Existing solutions relied on scene decomposition at significant memory cost or on motion-based heuristics that were vulnerable to parallax ambiguity. A semantic filtering framework was proposed for category-aware transient removal using vision-language models. CLIP similarity scores between rendered views and distractor text prompts were accumulated per-Gaussian across training iterations. Gaussians exceeding a calibrated threshold underwent opacity regularization and periodic pruning. Unlike motion-based approaches, semantic classification resolved parallax ambiguity by identifying object categories independently of motion patterns. Experiments on the RobustNeRF benchmark demonstrated consistent improvement in reconstruction quality over vanilla 3DGS across four sequences, while maintaining minimal memory overhead and real-time rendering performance. Threshold calibration and comparisons with baselines validated semantic guidance as a practical strategy for transient removal in scenarios with predictable distractor categories.

*Aman Verma,Seshan Srirangarajan,Sumantra Dutta Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a comprehensive evaluation measure called "advanced acceptance score" for assessing biometric gesture recognition systems, addressing limitations of existing error-rate based metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing biometric capacity estimation relies on error rates which don't indicate the quality or goodness of fitness scores derived from gesture and identity aware feature spaces.

Method: Formulates an advanced acceptance score by integrating: (1) ranking order and relevance of output scores, (2) rank deviation, (3) rewards for higher scores of high-ranked gestures and lower scores of low-ranked gestures, (4) compensation for correspondence between output and ground truth score trends, and (5) discounting based on identity feature disentanglement.

Result: Experiments on three datasets with five SOTA models show that optimal scores selected using the proposed measure are more appropriate than existing measures, and the measure correlates with existing metrics, validating its reliability.

Conclusion: The proposed advanced acceptance score provides a holistic evaluation measure for biometric gesture recognition systems that better assesses score quality than traditional error-rate based approaches.

Abstract: Quantifying biometric characteristics within hand gestures involve derivation of fitness scores from a gesture and identity aware feature space. However, evaluating the quality of these scores remains an open question. Existing biometric capacity estimation literature relies upon error rates. But these rates do not indicate goodness of scores. Thus, in this manuscript we present an exhaustive set of evaluation measures. We firstly identify ranking order and relevance of output scores as the primary basis for evaluation. In particular, we consider both rank deviation as well as rewards for: (i) higher scores of high ranked gestures and (ii) lower scores of low ranked gestures. We also compensate for correspondence between trends of output and ground truth scores. Finally, we account for disentanglement between identity features of gestures as a discounting factor. Integrating these elements with adequate weighting, we formulate advanced acceptance score as a holistic evaluation measure. To assess effectivity of the proposed we perform in-depth experimentation over three datasets with five state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Results show that the optimal score selected with our measure is more appropriate than existing other measures. Also, our proposed measure depicts correlation with existing measures. This further validates its reliability. We have made our \href{https://github.com/AmanVerma2307/MeasureSuite}{code} public.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dynamic training-free LoRA fusion framework that adaptively combines subject and style LoRAs during generation using KL divergence for feature selection and gradient-based corrections for semantic/stylistic guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA fusion methods use static statistical heuristics that deviate from LoRA's original purpose of learning adaptive feature adjustments and ignore input randomness, limiting coherent subject-style synthesis.

Method: Two-stage dynamic framework: 1) Forward pass: compute KL divergence between base model features and LoRA-produced features at each layer, adaptively selecting fusion weights; 2) Reverse denoising: apply gradient-based corrections using CLIP/DINO scores for continuous semantic/stylistic guidance.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LoRA fusion methods both qualitatively and quantitatively across diverse subject-style combinations.

Conclusion: The proposed dynamic training-free fusion framework achieves coherent subject-style synthesis without retraining by integrating feature-level selection and metric-guided latent adjustment throughout the diffusion timeline.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored the combination of multiple LoRAs to simultaneously generate user-specified subjects and styles. However, most existing approaches fuse LoRA weights using static statistical heuristics that deviate from LoRA's original purpose of learning adaptive feature adjustments and ignore the randomness of sampled inputs. To address this, we propose a dynamic training-free fusion framework that operates throughout the generation process. During the forward pass, at each LoRA-applied layer, we dynamically compute the KL divergence between the base model's original features and those produced by subject and style LoRAs, respectively, and adaptively select the most appropriate weights for fusion. In the reverse denoising stage, we further refine the generation trajectory by dynamically applying gradient-based corrections derived from objective metrics such as CLIP and DINO scores, providing continuous semantic and stylistic guidance. By integrating these two complementary mechanisms-feature-level selection and metric-guided latent adjustment-across the entire diffusion timeline, our method dynamically achieves coherent subject-style synthesis without any retraining. Extensive experiments across diverse subject-style combinations demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LoRA fusion methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

TL;DR: PADE is a training-free attention intervention method that reduces hallucinations in LVLMs by enhancing positive attention dynamics to identify semantically core visual regions while maintaining instruction attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs suffer from hallucinations and existing training-free methods have issues: contrastive decoding/expert models increase computational overhead and may cause interference, while static internal signal enhancement is vulnerable to attention sink distortions.

Method: PADE constructs a Positive Attention Dynamics (PAD) map to identify semantically core visual regions, applies per-head Median Absolute Deviation Scaling for adaptive intervention strength control, and uses System-Token Compensation to maintain attention to complex instructions and ensure long-term output consistency.

Result: Experiments on multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that PADE improves visual grounding and reduces hallucinations, validating the effectiveness of leveraging internal attention dynamics for reliable multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: The proposed PADE method successfully addresses hallucination issues in LVLMs by enhancing internal positive attention dynamics, offering a training-free solution that improves visual grounding without the computational overhead or interference problems of existing approaches.

Abstract: LVLMs have achieved strong multimodal reasoning capabilities but remain prone to hallucinations, producing outputs inconsistent with visual inputs or user instructions. Existing training-free methods, including contrastive decoding and auxiliary expert models, which incur several times more computational overhead and may introduce potential interference, as well as static internal signal enhancement, are often vulnerable to the attention sink phenomenon. We find that internal Positive Attention Dynamics (PAD) in LVLMs naturally reveal semantically core visual regions under the distortions of attention sinks. Based on this, we propose Positive Attention Dynamics Enhancement (PADE), a training-free attention intervention that constructs a PAD map to identify semantically core visual regions, applies per-head Median Absolute Deviation Scaling to adaptively control the intervention strength, and leverages System-Token Compensation to maintain attention to complex user instructions and support long-term output consistency. Experiments on multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that PADE improves visual grounding and reduces hallucinations, validating the effectiveness of leveraging internal attention dynamics for reliable multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: IRIS-v2 addresses the data scarcity problem in industrial digital twin research and demonstrates a practical alignment approach that could reduce manual effort for schematic-to-reality alignment.

Abstract: Aligning functional schematics with 2D and 3D scene acquisitions is crucial for building digital twins, especially for old industrial facilities that lack native digital models. Current manual alignment using images and LiDAR data does not scale due to tediousness and complexity of industrial sites. Inconsistencies between schematics and reality, and the scarcity of public industrial datasets, make the problem both challenging and underexplored. This paper introduces IRIS-v2, a comprehensive dataset to support further research. It includes images, point clouds, 2D annotated boxes and segmentation masks, a CAD model, 3D pipe routing information, and the P&ID (Piping and Instrumentation Diagram). The alignment is experimented on a practical case study, aiming at reducing the time required for this task by combining segmentation and graph matching.

### [29] [Concept-Enhanced Multimodal RAG: Towards Interpretable and Accurate Radiology Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15650)
*Marco Salmè,Federico Siciliano,Fabrizio Silvestri,Paolo Soda,Rosa Sicilia,Valerio Guarrasi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CEMRAG is a unified framework that combines clinical concept decomposition with multimodal retrieval-augmented generation to improve both interpretability and accuracy in radiology report generation, challenging the assumed trade-off between transparency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical adoption of Vision-Language Models for radiology report generation is limited by lack of interpretability and hallucination of findings not supported by imaging evidence. Existing approaches treat interpretability and accuracy as separate objectives rather than addressing them together.

Method: Concept-Enhanced Multimodal RAG (CEMRAG) decomposes visual representations into interpretable clinical concepts and integrates them with multimodal retrieval-augmented generation. This creates enriched contextual prompts that combine visual transparency with factual grounding from external retrieval.

Result: Experiments on MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray datasets across multiple VLM architectures, training regimes, and retrieval configurations show consistent improvements over conventional RAG and concept-only baselines on both clinical accuracy metrics and standard NLP measures.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that transparent visual concepts can enhance rather than compromise diagnostic accuracy, challenging the assumed trade-off between interpretability and performance. The modular design provides a pathway toward clinically trustworthy AI-assisted radiology by decomposing interpretability into visual transparency and structured language model conditioning.

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) through Vision-Language Models (VLMs) promises to reduce documentation burden, improve reporting consistency, and accelerate clinical workflows. However, their clinical adoption remains limited by the lack of interpretability and the tendency to hallucinate findings misaligned with imaging evidence. Existing research typically treats interpretability and accuracy as separate objectives, with concept-based explainability techniques focusing primarily on transparency, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods targeting factual grounding through external retrieval. We present Concept-Enhanced Multimodal RAG (CEMRAG), a unified framework that decomposes visual representations into interpretable clinical concepts and integrates them with multimodal RAG. This approach exploits enriched contextual prompts for RRG, improving both interpretability and factual accuracy. Experiments on MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray across multiple VLM architectures, training regimes, and retrieval configurations demonstrate consistent improvements over both conventional RAG and concept-only baselines on clinical accuracy metrics and standard NLP measures. These results challenge the assumed trade-off between interpretability and performance, showing that transparent visual concepts can enhance rather than compromise diagnostic accuracy in medical VLMs. Our modular design decomposes interpretability into visual transparency and structured language model conditioning, providing a principled pathway toward clinically trustworthy AI-assisted radiology.

### [30] [A Novel Public Dataset for Strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa) Ripeness Detection and Comparative Evaluation of YOLO-Based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15656)
*Mustafa Yurdakul,Zeynep Sena Bastug,Ali Emre Gok,Sakir Taşdemir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Researchers created a public strawberry ripeness dataset with 566 images and 1,201 labeled objects from Turkish greenhouses, then tested YOLO models with YOLOv8s achieving best overall performance (86.09% mAP@50).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional visual assessment of strawberry ripeness is subjective and error-prone, but computer-assisted systems are hindered by lack of comprehensive public datasets for comparison.

Method: Created a new public strawberry ripeness dataset under variable conditions in Turkish greenhouses, then conducted comparative tests using YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLO11 models.

Result: YOLOv9c achieved highest precision (90.94%), YOLO11s highest recall (83.74%), and YOLOv8s best overall performance with 86.09% mAP@50, showing small/medium models work most balanced.

Conclusion: Small-medium YOLO models work efficiently on strawberry ripeness detection, establishing a reference point for smart agriculture applications with the new public dataset.

Abstract: The strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa), known worldwide for its economic value and nutritional richness, is a widely cultivated fruit. Determining the correct ripeness level during the harvest period is crucial for both preventing losses for producers and ensuring consumers receive a quality product. However, traditional methods, i.e., visual assessments alone, can be subjective and have a high margin of error. Therefore, computer-assisted systems are needed. However, the scarcity of comprehensive datasets accessible to everyone in the literature makes it difficult to compare studies in this field. In this study, a new and publicly available strawberry ripeness dataset, consisting of 566 images and 1,201 labeled objects, prepared under variable light and environmental conditions in two different greenhouses in Turkey, is presented to the literature. Comparative tests conducted on the data set using YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLO11-based models showed that the highest precision value was 90.94% in the YOLOv9c model, while the highest recall value was 83.74% in the YOLO11s model. In terms of the general performance criterion mAP@50, YOLOv8s was the best performing model with a success rate of 86.09%. The results show that small and medium-sized models work more balanced and efficiently on this type of dataset, while also establishing a fundamental reference point for smart agriculture applications.

TL;DR: 3D data Analysis Optimization Pipeline uses Bayesian Optimization to automate model selection and parameter tuning for 3D biomedical image segmentation and classification, reducing manual effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual analysis of 3D biomedical images is impractical, and selecting suitable models and tuning parameters remains a major bottleneck despite many existing methods.

Method: Two-stage Bayesian Optimization pipeline: first stage selects segmentation models and optimizes postprocessing parameters using domain-adapted syntactic benchmark data and a segmentation quality metric; second stage optimizes classifier design choices including encoder/classifier architectures, prior knowledge incorporation, and pretraining strategies with assisted class-annotation workflow.

Result: The pipeline efficiently identifies effective model and parameter configurations for individual datasets across four case studies.

Conclusion: The 3D data Analysis Optimization Pipeline provides an automated solution to the model selection and parameter tuning bottleneck in 3D biomedical image analysis, reducing manual annotation effort while improving efficiency.

Abstract: Deep learning-based segmentation and classification are crucial to large-scale biomedical imaging, particularly for 3D data, where manual analysis is impractical. Although many methods exist, selecting suitable models and tuning parameters remains a major bottleneck in practice. Hence, we introduce the 3D data Analysis Optimization Pipeline, a method designed to facilitate the design and parameterization of segmentation and classification using two Bayesian Optimization stages. First, the pipeline selects a segmentation model and optimizes postprocessing parameters using a domain-adapted syntactic benchmark dataset. To ensure a concise evaluation of segmentation performance, we introduce a segmentation quality metric that serves as the objective function. Second, the pipeline optimizes design choices of a classifier, such as encoder and classifier head architectures, incorporation of prior knowledge, and pretraining strategies. To reduce manual annotation effort, this stage includes an assisted class-annotation workflow that extracts predicted instances from the segmentation results and sequentially presents them to the operator, eliminating the need for manual tracking. In four case studies, the 3D data Analysis Optimization Pipeline efficiently identifies effective model and parameter configurations for individual datasets.

### [33] [Criteria-first, semantics-later: reproducible structure discovery in image-based sciences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15712)
*Jan Bumberger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes shifting from semantics-first to criteria-first structure discovery in image-based science, separating structure extraction from semantic mapping to address domain drift and enable reproducible cross-domain analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current semantics-first approaches fail in open-ended discovery, cross-sensor comparability, and long-term monitoring where domain ontologies drift. Need for stable, reproducible analysis across image-based sciences.

Method: Introduces unified framework separating criterion-defined, semantics-free structure extraction from downstream semantic mapping to domain ontologies/vocabularies.

Result: Provides domain-general scaffold for reproducible analysis, enabling plural interpretations and explicit crosswalks without rewriting upstream extraction.

Conclusion: Criteria-first approach grounded in cybernetics and information theory addresses scaling limitations of labeling, with implications for validation beyond accuracy and creating FAIR, AI-ready digital objects.

Abstract: Across the natural and life sciences, images have become a primary measurement modality, yet the dominant analytic paradigm remains semantics-first. Structure is recovered by predicting or enforcing domain-specific labels. This paradigm fails systematically under the conditions that make image-based science most valuable, including open-ended scientific discovery, cross-sensor and cross-site comparability, and long-term monitoring in which domain ontologies and associated label sets drift culturally, institutionally, and ecologically. A deductive inversion is proposed in the form of criteria-first and semantics-later. A unified framework for criteria-first structure discovery is introduced. It separates criterion-defined, semantics-free structure extraction from downstream semantic mapping into domain ontologies or vocabularies and provides a domain-general scaffold for reproducible analysis across image-based sciences. Reproducible science requires that the first analytic layer perform criterion-driven, semantics-free structure discovery, yielding stable partitions, structural fields, or hierarchies defined by explicit optimality criteria rather than local domain ontologies. Semantics is not discarded; it is relocated downstream as an explicit mapping from the discovered structural product to a domain ontology or vocabulary, enabling plural interpretations and explicit crosswalks without rewriting upstream extraction. Grounded in cybernetics, observation-as-distinction, and information theory's separation of information from meaning, the argument is supported by cross-domain evidence showing that criteria-first components recur whenever labels do not scale. Finally, consequences are outlined for validation beyond class accuracy and for treating structural products as FAIR, AI-ready digital objects for long-term monitoring and digital twins.

*Hyunchan Moon,Cheonjun Park,Steven L. Waslander*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToaSt is a decoupled framework for efficient Vision Transformers that applies head-wise structured pruning to attention modules and token channel selection to feed-forward networks, achieving better accuracy-efficiency trade-offs than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers have high computational costs that hinder deployment. Existing solutions like structured weight pruning have long retraining times, while token compression suffers from global propagation issues that create optimization challenges.

Method: ToaSt uses a decoupled approach: 1) Coupled head-wise structured pruning for Multi-Head Self-Attention modules, leveraging attention operation characteristics for robustness; 2) Token Channel Selection (TCS) for Feed-Forward Networks (which account for over 60% of FLOPs), which enhances compression ratios while avoiding global propagation issues.

Result: Extensive evaluations across nine diverse models (DeiT, ViT-MAE, Swin Transformer) show superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. On ViT-MAE-Huge: 88.52% accuracy (+1.64%) with 39.4% FLOPs reduction. Effective transfer to downstream tasks: 52.2 vs 51.9 mAP on COCO object detection.

Conclusion: ToaSt provides an effective decoupled framework for Vision Transformer compression that addresses limitations of existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various models and tasks while maintaining or improving accuracy with significant computational savings.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success across various vision tasks, yet their deployment is often hindered by prohibitive computational costs. While structured weight pruning and token compression have emerged as promising solutions, they suffer from prolonged retraining times and global propagation that creates optimization challenges, respectively. We propose ToaSt, a decoupled framework applying specialized strategies to distinct ViT components. We apply coupled head-wise structured pruning to Multi-Head Self-Attention modules, leveraging attention operation characteristics to enhance robustness. For Feed-Forward Networks (over 60\% of FLOPs), we introduce Token Channel Selection (TCS) that enhances compression ratios while avoiding global propagation issues. Our analysis reveals TCS effectively filters redundant noise during selection. Extensive evaluations across nine diverse models, including DeiT, ViT-MAE, and Swin Transformer, demonstrate that ToaSt achieves superior trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, consistently outperforming existing baselines. On ViT-MAE-Huge, ToaSt achieves 88.52\% accuracy (+1.64 \%) with 39.4\% FLOPs reduction. ToaSt transfers effectively to downstream tasks, cccccachieving 52.2 versus 51.9 mAP on COCO object detection. Code and models will be released upon acceptance.

### [35] [Learning to Retrieve Navigable Candidates for Efficient Vision-and-Language Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15724)
*Shutian Gu,Chengkai Huang,Ruoyu Wang,Lina Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Retrieval-augmented framework improves LLM-based Vision-and-Language Navigation efficiency without model fine-tuning, using instruction-level trajectory retrieval and step-level candidate pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt-based LLM navigation suffers from inefficient decision-making due to repeated instruction interpretation and reasoning over noisy navigable candidates at each step.

Method: Two-level retrieval: 1) Instruction-level embedding retriever selects similar successful trajectories as exemplars, 2) Imitation-learned candidate retriever prunes irrelevant navigable directions before LLM inference. Both modules are lightweight and trained independently.

Result: Consistent improvements in Success Rate, Oracle Success Rate, and SPL on R2R benchmark for both seen and unseen environments. Ablation shows complementary benefits of both retrieval components.

Conclusion: Retrieval-augmented decision support is effective and scalable for enhancing LLM-based vision-and-language navigation without modifying the underlying language model.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to follow natural-language instructions and navigate through previously unseen environments. Recent approaches increasingly employ large language models (LLMs) as high-level navigators due to their flexibility and reasoning capability. However, prompt-based LLM navigation often suffers from inefficient decision-making, as the model must repeatedly interpret instructions from scratch and reason over noisy and verbose navigable candidates at each step. In this paper, we propose a retrieval-augmented framework to improve the efficiency and stability of LLM-based VLN without modifying or fine-tuning the underlying language model. Our approach introduces retrieval at two complementary levels. At the episode level, an instruction-level embedding retriever selects semantically similar successful navigation trajectories as in-context exemplars, providing task-specific priors for instruction grounding. At the step level, an imitation-learned candidate retriever prunes irrelevant navigable directions before LLM inference, reducing action ambiguity and prompt complexity. Both retrieval modules are lightweight, modular, and trained independently of the LLM. We evaluate our method on the Room-to-Room (R2R) benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in Success Rate, Oracle Success Rate, and SPL on both seen and unseen environments. Ablation studies further show that instruction-level exemplar retrieval and candidate pruning contribute complementary benefits to global guidance and step-wise decision efficiency. These results indicate that retrieval-augmented decision support is an effective and scalable strategy for enhancing LLM-based vision-and-language navigation.

*Hila Manor,Rinon Gal,Haggai Maron,Tomer Michaeli,Gal Chechik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoRWeB enables visual analogy learning by dynamically composing learned LoRA transformation primitives at inference time, improving generalization over fixed LoRA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual analogy methods use single fixed LoRA modules that struggle to capture diverse visual transformations, limiting generalization capabilities.

Method: Proposes LoRWeB with: (1) learnable basis of LoRA modules spanning transformation space, and (2) lightweight encoder that dynamically selects/weighs basis LoRAs based on input analogy pair.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly improves generalization to unseen visual transformations.

Conclusion: LoRA basis decompositions are a promising direction for flexible visual manipulation, enabling dynamic composition of transformation primitives for better generalization.

Abstract: Visual analogy learning enables image manipulation through demonstration rather than textual description, allowing users to specify complex transformations difficult to articulate in words. Given a triplet $\{\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{a}'$, $\mathbf{b}\}$, the goal is to generate $\mathbf{b}'$ such that $\mathbf{a} : \mathbf{a}' :: \mathbf{b} : \mathbf{b}'$. Recent methods adapt text-to-image models to this task using a single Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module, but they face a fundamental limitation: attempting to capture the diverse space of visual transformations within a fixed adaptation module constrains generalization capabilities. Inspired by recent work showing that LoRAs in constrained domains span meaningful, interpolatable semantic spaces, we propose LoRWeB, a novel approach that specializes the model for each analogy task at inference time through dynamic composition of learned transformation primitives, informally, choosing a point in a "space of LoRAs". We introduce two key components: (1) a learnable basis of LoRA modules, to span the space of different visual transformations, and (2) a lightweight encoder that dynamically selects and weighs these basis LoRAs based on the input analogy pair. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly improves generalization to unseen visual transformations. Our findings suggest that LoRA basis decompositions are a promising direction for flexible visual manipulation. Code and data are in https://research.nvidia.com/labs/par/lorweb

*Guile Wu,David Huang,Bingbing Liu,Dongfeng Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unified 3D scene understanding framework using sparse voxels with appearance, density, feature, and confidence fields, enhanced by language and geometric distillation for holistic modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D open-vocabulary methods focus on distilling language features from 2D models but overlook synergy among appearance, semantics, and geometry, causing scene understanding to deviate from geometric structure and decouple from reconstruction.

Method: Uses 3D sparse voxels as primitives with four fields: appearance, density, feature, and confidence. Includes feature modulation module for synergy, distills language features from 2D foundation model, and integrates geometric distillation from geometry foundation model via depth correlation and pattern consistency regularization.

Result: Achieves superior overall performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in holistic scene understanding and reconstruction through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Proposed approach successfully models appearance, semantics, and geometry synergistically within a unified framework, demonstrating improved 3D scene understanding and reconstruction capabilities.

Abstract: Existing 3D open-vocabulary scene understanding methods mostly emphasize distilling language features from 2D foundation models into 3D feature fields, but largely overlook the synergy among scene appearance, semantics, and geometry. As a result, scene understanding often deviates from the underlying geometric structure of scenes and becomes decoupled from the reconstruction process. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages language and geometry grounded sparse voxel representations to comprehensively model appearance, semantics, and geometry within a unified framework. Specifically, we use 3D sparse voxels as primitives and employ an appearance field, a density field, a feature field, and a confidence field to holistically represent a 3D scene. To promote synergy among the appearance, density, and feature fields, we construct a feature modulation module and distill language features from a 2D foundation model into our 3D scene model. In addition, we integrate geometric distillation into feature field distillation to transfer geometric knowledge from a geometry foundation model to our 3D scene representations via depth correlation regularization and pattern consistency regularization. These components work together to synergistically model the appearance, semantics, and geometry of the 3D scene within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior overall performance compared with state-of-the-art methods in holistic scene understanding and reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models face a key challenge where improving generative capabilities often reduces understanding ability, and vice versa, creating a competitive dynamic that limits model performance.

Method: Proposes the Reason-Reflect-Refine (R3) framework that transforms single-step generation into a multi-step process: generate initial output, understand it, then regenerate improved output using that understanding.

Result: Successfully mitigates the optimization dilemma, achieving stronger generation results and improved understanding ability related to the generation process.

Conclusion: The R3 framework offers valuable insights for designing next-generation unified multimodal models by explicitly leveraging understanding during generation to overcome the trade-off between generation and understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Current research in multimodal models faces a key challenge where enhancing generative capabilities often comes at the expense of understanding, and vice versa. We analyzed this trade-off and identify the primary cause might be the potential conflict between generation and understanding, which creates a competitive dynamic within the model. To address this, we propose the Reason-Reflect-Refine (R3) framework. This innovative algorithm re-frames the single-step generation task into a multi-step process of "generate-understand-regenerate". By explicitly leveraging the model's understanding capability during generation, we successfully mitigate the optimization dilemma, achieved stronger generation results and improved understanding ability which are related to the generation process. This offers valuable insights for designing next-generation unified multimodal models. Code is available at https://github.com/sen-ye/R3.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Endoscopic 3D reconstruction is crucial for medical imaging but faces challenges due to tissue deformation, monocular cameras, illumination changes, occlusions, and unknown camera trajectories. Current methods lack robustness for dynamic endoscopic scenes.

Method: Introduces NeRFscopy with deformable model combining canonical radiance field and time-dependent deformation field parameterized by SE(3) transformations. Uses self-supervised learning with sophisticated loss terms to learn 3D implicit model without templates or pre-trained models.

Result: Achieves accurate novel view synthesis results, outperforming competing methods across various challenging endoscopy scenes.

Conclusion: NeRFscopy provides an effective self-supervised solution for 3D reconstruction of deformable endoscopic tissues, enhancing visualization and potentially improving diagnostic accuracy and surgical guidance.

Abstract: Endoscopy is essential in medical imaging, used for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Developing a robust dynamic 3D reconstruction pipeline for endoscopic videos could enhance visualization, improve diagnostic accuracy, aid in treatment planning, and guide surgery procedures. However, challenges arise due to the deformable nature of the tissues, the use of monocular cameras, illumination changes, occlusions and unknown camera trajectories. Inspired by neural rendering, we introduce NeRFscopy, a self-supervised pipeline for novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction of deformable endoscopic tissues from a monocular video. NeRFscopy includes a deformable model with a canonical radiance field and a time-dependent deformation field parameterized by SE(3) transformations. In addition, the color images are efficiently exploited by introducing sophisticated terms to learn a 3D implicit model without assuming any template or pre-trained model, solely from data. NeRFscopy achieves accurate results in terms of novel view synthesis, outperforming competing methods across various challenging endoscopy scenes.

TL;DR: Hybrid multimodal approach combining sky images, PV energy history, and meteorological data improves solar forecasting accuracy for ramp events and cloudy conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address photovoltaic forecasting challenges due to renewable energy variability, especially solar energy, to support efficient power grid operation and better management of solar variability.

Method: Multimodal approach combining sky images, photovoltaic energy history, and meteorological data using deep neural models for both nowcasting and forecasting, incorporating individual/multiple meteorological variables and analytical solar position.

Result: Inclusion of meteorological data (surface long-wave, radiation downwards, wind-solar position combination) significantly improves predictions in both nowcasting and forecasting, especially on cloudy days.

Conclusion: Integrating diverse data sources improves reliability and interpretability of solar energy prediction models for better grid management and solar variability handling.

Abstract: Due to the rise in the use of renewable energies as an alternative to traditional ones, and especially solar energy, there is increasing interest in studying how to address photovoltaic forecasting in the face of the challenge of variability in photovoltaic energy production, using different methodologies. This work develops a hybrid approach for short and long-term forecasting based on two studies with the same purpose. A multimodal approach that combines images of the sky and photovoltaic energy history with meteorological data is proposed. The main goal is to improve the accuracy of ramp event prediction, increase the robustness of forecasts in cloudy conditions, and extend capabilities beyond nowcasting, to support more efficient operation of the power grid and better management of solar variability. Deep neural models are used for both nowcasting and forecasting solutions, incorporating individual and multiple meteorological variables, as well as an analytical solar position. The results demonstrate that the inclusion of meteorological data, particularly the surface long-wave, radiation downwards, and the combination of wind and solar position, significantly improves current predictions in both nowcasting and forecasting tasks, especially on cloudy days. This study highlights the importance of integrating diverse data sources to improve the reliability and interpretability of solar energy prediction models.

*Lucas Sancéré,Noémie Moreau,Katarzyna Bozek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Graph Transformers on whole-slide cell graphs outperform image-based methods for classifying healthy vs tumor epithelial cells in skin cancer, achieving ~85% balanced accuracy by leveraging tissue-level cellular context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for whole-slide image analysis rely on patch-based representations that lose vital tissue-level context, making it difficult to differentiate similar cell types like healthy vs tumor epithelial cells in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.

Method: Proposed using scalable Graph Transformers (SGFormer and DIFFormer) on full-WSI cell graphs for classification. Evaluated morphological/texture features and cellular context, and extended to multi-patient analysis by extracting patches and converting to graphs.

Result: Graph Transformers achieved balanced accuracies of 85.2±1.5 (SGFormer) and 85.1±2.5 (DIFFormer) vs 81.2±3.0 for best image-based method. In multi-patient setting, DIFFormer reached 83.6±1.9 vs 78.1±0.5 for state-of-the-art CellViT256.

Conclusion: Graph-based approaches using Graph Transformers on cell graphs outperform image-based methods for WSI classification, demonstrating the importance of capturing tissue-level cellular context for differentiating morphologically similar cell types in cancer.

Abstract: Whole-slide images (WSIs) from cancer patients contain rich information that can be used for medical diagnosis or to follow treatment progress. To automate their analysis, numerous deep learning methods based on convolutional neural networks and Vision Transformers have been developed and have achieved strong performance in segmentation and classification tasks. However, due to the large size and complex cellular organization of WSIs, these models rely on patch-based representations, losing vital tissue-level context. We propose using scalable Graph Transformers on a full-WSI cell graph for classification. We evaluate this methodology on a challenging task: the classification of healthy versus tumor epithelial cells in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), where both cell types exhibit very similar morphologies and are therefore difficult to differentiate for image-based approaches. We first compared image-based and graph-based methods on a single WSI. Graph Transformer models SGFormer and DIFFormer achieved balanced accuracies of $85.2 \pm 1.5$ ($\pm$ standard error) and $85.1 \pm 2.5$ in 3-fold cross-validation, respectively, whereas the best image-based method reached $81.2 \pm 3.0$. By evaluating several node feature configurations, we found that the most informative representation combined morphological and texture features as well as the cell classes of non-epithelial cells, highlighting the importance of the surrounding cellular context. We then extended our work to train on several WSIs from several patients. To address the computational constraints of image-based models, we extracted four $2560 \times 2560$ pixel patches from each image and converted them into graphs. In this setting, DIFFormer achieved a balanced accuracy of $83.6 \pm 1.9$ (3-fold cross-validation), while the state-of-the-art image-based model CellViT256 reached $78.1 \pm 0.5$.

Uses latent task selector on task-adapted features with compact prototypes and feature-level experience replay for stable task identification without raw-image storage.

Result: Outperforms joint training under task-unknown deployment: higher routing accuracy (75.0% vs. 62.5%), maintains competitive diagnostic performance (AUROC 0.74 oracle, 0.75 task-unknown). Uses significantly fewer trainable parameters than full retraining.

Conclusion: CARL-XRay provides practical alternative to joint training and repeated full retraining for continual clinical deployment, enabling robust performance retention and reliable task-aware inference across sequential dataset updates.

Abstract: Clinical deployment of chest radiograph classifiers requires models that can be updated as new datasets become available without retraining on previously ob- served data or degrading validated performance. We study, for the first time, a task-incremental continual learning setting for chest radiograph classification, in which heterogeneous chest X-ray datasets arrive sequentially and task identifiers are unavailable at inference. We propose a continual adapter-based routing learning strategy for Chest X-rays (CARL-XRay) that maintains a fixed high-capacity backbone and incrementally allocates lightweight task-specific adapters and classifier heads. A latent task selector operates on task-adapted features and leverages both current and historical context preserved through compact prototypes and feature-level experience replay. This design supports stable task identification and adaptation across sequential updates while avoiding raw-image storage. Experiments on large-scale public chest radiograph datasets demonstrate robust performance retention and reliable task-aware inference under continual dataset ingestion. CARL-XRay outperforms joint training under task-unknown deployment, achieving higher routing accuracy (75.0\% vs.\ 62.5\%), while maintaining competitive diagnostic performance with AUROC of 0.74 in the oracle setting with ground-truth task identity and 0.75 under task-unknown inference, using significantly fewer trainable parameters. Finally, the proposed framework provides a practical alternative to joint training and repeated full retraining in continual clinical deployment.

*Hui Ren,Yuval Alaluf,Omer Bar Tal,Alexander Schwing,Antonio Torralba,Yael Vinker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adapts pretrained text-to-video diffusion models for sequential sketch generation by leveraging LLMs for semantic planning and video models for rendering, using minimal human sketch data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most generative models treat sketches as static images, ignoring the temporal structure and sequential nature of creative drawing processes.

Method: Two-stage fine-tuning: 1) Learn stroke ordering using synthetic shape compositions with controlled temporal structure, 2) Learn visual appearance from just 7 manually authored sketching processes. Represents sketches as short videos with progressive stroke drawing guided by text ordering instructions.

Result: Generates high-quality sequential sketches that closely follow text-specified orderings with rich visual detail, despite using extremely limited human-drawn sketch data. Extensions include brush style conditioning and autoregressive sketch generation.

Conclusion: Combining LLMs for semantic planning with video diffusion models for rendering enables data-efficient sequential sketch generation that captures both stroke ordering and visual appearance, with applications in controllable and interactive drawing.

Abstract: Sketching is inherently a sequential process, in which strokes are drawn in a meaningful order to explore and refine ideas. However, most generative models treat sketches as static images, overlooking the temporal structure that underlies creative drawing. We present a data-efficient approach for sequential sketch generation that adapts pretrained text-to-video diffusion models to generate sketching processes. Our key insight is that large language models and video diffusion models offer complementary strengths for this task: LLMs provide semantic planning and stroke ordering, while video diffusion models serve as strong renderers that produce high-quality, temporally coherent visuals. We leverage this by representing sketches as short videos in which strokes are progressively drawn on a blank canvas, guided by text-specified ordering instructions. We introduce a two-stage fine-tuning strategy that decouples the learning of stroke ordering from the learning of sketch appearance. Stroke ordering is learned using synthetic shape compositions with controlled temporal structure, while visual appearance is distilled from as few as seven manually authored sketching processes that capture both global drawing order and the continuous formation of individual strokes. Despite the extremely limited amount of human-drawn sketch data, our method generates high-quality sequential sketches that closely follow text-specified orderings while exhibiting rich visual detail. We further demonstrate the flexibility of our approach through extensions such as brush style conditioning and autoregressive sketch generation, enabling additional controllability and interactive, collaborative drawing.

*Rut Pate,Snehal Rajput,Mehul S. Raval,Rupal A. Kapdi,Mohendra Roy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Attention-Gated Recurrent Residual U-Net (R2U-Net) based Triplanar (2.5D) model for brain tumor segmentation achieves 0.900 Dice score on BraTS2021 and 45.71% accuracy for survival prediction.

Abstract: Gliomas, among the most common primary brain tumors, vary widely in aggressiveness, prognosis, and histology, making treatment challenging due to complex and time-intensive surgical interventions. This study presents an Attention-Gated Recurrent Residual U-Net (R2U-Net) based Triplanar (2.5D) model for improved brain tumor segmentation. The proposed model enhances feature representation and segmentation accuracy by integrating residual, recurrent, and triplanar architectures while maintaining computational efficiency, potentially aiding in better treatment planning. The proposed method achieves a Dice Similarity Score (DSC) of 0.900 for Whole Tumor (WT) segmentation on the BraTS2021 validation set, demonstrating performance comparable to leading models. Additionally, the triplanar network extracts 64 features per planar model for survival days prediction, which are reduced to 28 using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). This approach achieves an accuracy of 45.71%, a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 108,318.128, and a Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient (SRC) of 0.338 on the test dataset.

*Aniketh Garikaparthi,Manasi Patwardhan,Arman Cohan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ResearchGym is a benchmark for evaluating AI agents on end-to-end research tasks using containerized environments from real papers, revealing a significant capability-reliability gap where frontier agents can occasionally achieve state-of-the-art results but fail consistently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a systematic evaluation framework for autonomous AI agents on real-world research tasks, moving beyond simple benchmarks to assess end-to-end research capabilities including hypothesis generation, experimentation, and surpassing human baselines.

Method: Repurposed 5 oral/spotlight papers from ICML, ICLR, and ACL by preserving datasets, evaluation harnesses, and baselines but withholding proposed methods, creating 5 containerized environments with 39 sub-tasks total. Agents must propose hypotheses, run experiments, and surpass human baselines.

Result: GPT-5 agent improved over provided baselines in only 1 of 15 evaluations (6.7%) by 11.5%, completed only 26.5% of sub-tasks on average, but in one run surpassed an ICML 2025 Spotlight task solution. Similar gaps observed with Claude Code and Codex agents.

Conclusion: Frontier AI agents show a sharp capability-reliability gap - they can occasionally reach state-of-the-art performance but fail consistently due to long-horizon failure modes like impatience, poor resource management, overconfidence, and context length limits. ResearchGym enables systematic evaluation of autonomous research agents.

Abstract: We introduce ResearchGym, a benchmark and execution environment for evaluating AI agents on end-to-end research. To instantiate this, we repurpose five oral and spotlight papers from ICML, ICLR, and ACL. From each paper's repository, we preserve the datasets, evaluation harness, and baseline implementations but withhold the paper's proposed method. This results in five containerized task environments comprising 39 sub-tasks in total. Within each environment, agents must propose novel hypotheses, run experiments, and attempt to surpass strong human baselines on the paper's metrics. In a controlled evaluation of an agent powered by GPT-5, we observe a sharp capability--reliability gap. The agent improves over the provided baselines from the repository in just 1 of 15 evaluations (6.7%) by 11.5%, and completes only 26.5% of sub-tasks on average. We identify recurring long-horizon failure modes, including impatience, poor time and resource management, overconfidence in weak hypotheses, difficulty coordinating parallel experiments, and hard limits from context length. Yet in a single run, the agent surpasses the solution of an ICML 2025 Spotlight task, indicating that frontier agents can occasionally reach state-of-the-art performance, but do so unreliably. We additionally evaluate proprietary agent scaffolds including Claude Code (Opus-4.5) and Codex (GPT-5.2) which display a similar gap. ResearchGym provides infrastructure for systematic evaluation and analysis of autonomous agents on closed-loop research.

### [46] [Protecting Language Models Against Unauthorized Distillation through Trace Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15143)
*Xinhang Ma,William Yeoh,Ning Zhang,Yevgeniy Vorobeychik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods to modify teacher LLM reasoning traces to prevent unauthorized knowledge distillation while preserving answer quality, achieving both anti-distillation and watermarking objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unauthorized knowledge distillation unfairly exploits the significant investment in developing frontier LLMs, so there's a need for techniques to deter such unauthorized use while maintaining model utility.

Method: Introduces dynamic rewriting approaches for teacher reasoning outputs using both LLM-based rewriting (instruction-based) and gradient-based techniques to modify reasoning traces while preserving correctness and coherence.

Result: Simple instruction-based rewriting achieves strong anti-distillation effects while maintaining or improving teacher performance, and enables highly reliable watermark detection with essentially no false alarms.

Conclusion: Effective methods exist to protect LLMs from unauthorized distillation through reasoning trace modification, balancing protection with utility preservation.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a widely adopted technique for transferring capabilities from LLMs to smaller, more efficient student models. However, unauthorized use of knowledge distillation takes unfair advantage of the considerable effort and cost put into developing frontier models. We investigate methods for modifying teacher-generated reasoning traces to achieve two objectives that deter unauthorized distillation: (1) \emph{anti-distillation}, or degrading the training usefulness of query responses, and (2) \emph{API watermarking}, which embeds verifiable signatures in student models. We introduce several approaches for dynamically rewriting a teacher's reasoning outputs while preserving answer correctness and semantic coherence. Two of these leverage the rewriting capabilities of LLMs, while others use gradient-based techniques. Our experiments show that a simple instruction-based rewriting approach achieves a strong anti-distillation effect while maintaining or even improving teacher performance. Furthermore, we show that our rewriting approach also enables highly reliable watermark detection with essentially no false alarms.

### [47] [Panini: Continual Learning in Token Space via Structured Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15156)
*Shreyas Rajesh,Pavan Holur,Mehmet Yigit Turali,Chenda Duan,Vwani Roychowdhury*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Panini introduces a non-parametric continual learning framework using Generative Semantic Workspaces (GSW) - entity/event-aware QA networks that enable efficient reasoning over experiences without repeatedly processing verbatim documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG approaches inefficiently use compute by repeatedly reasoning over the same documents, and chunk retrieval can inject irrelevant context leading to unsupported generation. Need more efficient and reliable continual learning for language models.

Method: Panini represents documents as Generative Semantic Workspaces - networks of question-answer pairs that capture entities and events. The base model remains fixed while experiences integrate into external semantic memory. For queries, Panini traverses the continually-updated GSW to retrieve inference chains rather than verbatim documents.

Result: Achieves 5%-7% higher average performance across six QA benchmarks than competitive baselines, uses 2-30x fewer answer-context tokens, supports open-source pipelines, and reduces unsupported answers on unanswerable queries.

Conclusion: Efficient structuring of experiences at write time (via GSW framework) yields both efficiency and reliability gains at read time, demonstrating a human-like continual learning approach that avoids repeated document processing.

Abstract: Language models are increasingly used to reason over content they were not trained on, such as new documents, evolving knowledge, and user-specific data. A common approach is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which stores verbatim documents externally (as chunks) and retrieves only a relevant subset at inference time for an LLM to reason over. However, this results in inefficient usage of test-time compute (LLM repeatedly reasons over the same documents); moreover, chunk retrieval can inject irrelevant context that increases unsupported generation. We propose a human-like non-parametric continual learning framework, where the base model remains fixed, and learning occurs by integrating each new experience into an external semantic memory state that accumulates and consolidates itself continually. We present Panini, which realizes this by representing documents as Generative Semantic Workspaces (GSW) -- an entity- and event-aware network of question-answer (QA) pairs, sufficient for an LLM to reconstruct the experienced situations and mine latent knowledge via reasoning-grounded inference chains on the network. Given a query, Panini only traverses the continually-updated GSW (not the verbatim documents or chunks), and retrieves the most likely inference chains. Across six QA benchmarks, Panini achieves the highest average performance, 5%-7% higher than other competitive baselines, while using 2-30x fewer answer-context tokens, supports fully open-source pipelines, and reduces unsupported answers on curated unanswerable queries. The results show that efficient and accurate structuring of experiences at write time -- as achieved by the GSW framework -- yields both efficiency and reliability gains at read time.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel da Costian-Tarskian approach to ontological heterogeneity using extended consequence systems and development graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address ontological heterogeneity by building on Carnapian-Goguenism and developing a systematic framework for relating ontologies through formal consequence systems.

Method: Proposes da Costian-Tarskianism based on da Costa's Principle of Tolerance and Tarski's consequence operators. Uses extended consequence systems (consequence systems with ontological axioms) and extended development graphs with morphisms, fibring, and splitting operations.

Result: Develops a formal framework for ontological heterogeneity using extended consequence systems and development graphs that enable systematic relationships between ontologies through various operations.

Conclusion: The approach provides a foundation for addressing ontological heterogeneity in applied ontology, with implications for the field and directions for future research.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for ontological heterogeneity that draws heavily from Carnapian-Goguenism, as presented by Kutz, Mossakowski and Lücke (2010). The approach is provisionally designated da Costian-Tarskianism, named after da Costa's Principle of Tolerance in Mathematics and after Alfred Tarski's work on the concept of a consequence operator. The approach is based on the machinery of consequence systems, as developed by Carnielli et al. (2008) and Citkin and Muravitsky (2022), and it introduces the idea of an extended consequence system, which is a consequence system extended with ontological axioms. The paper also defines the concept of an extended development graph, which is a graph structure that allows ontologies to be related via morphisms of extended consequence systems, and additionally via other operations such as fibring and splitting. Finally, we discuss the implications of this approach for the field of applied ontology and suggest directions for future research.

*Luise Ge,Yongyan Zhang,Yevgeniy Vorobeychik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs cluster into reasoning models (rational, stable) vs conversational models (less rational, human-like, sensitive to framing/ordering) based on mathematical reasoning training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited understanding of LLM decision-making under uncertainty despite their rapid adoption in decision support systems and agentic workflows.

Method: Comparative study of 20 frontier/open LLMs on risky choices across two dimensions: prospect representation (explicit vs. experience-based) and decision rationale (explanation), complemented by matched human experiments and rational agent models.

Result: LLMs form two clusters: reasoning models (RMs) behave rationally, insensitive to ordering/framing/explanations; conversational models (CMs) are less rational, more human-like, sensitive to these factors, with large description-history gap. Mathematical reasoning training appears key.

Conclusion: LLM decision-making under uncertainty reveals distinct behavioral patterns based on training, with mathematical reasoning training driving rational behavior, highlighting important implications for deploying LLMs in decision-making contexts.

Abstract: The use of large language models either as decision support systems, or in agentic workflows, is rapidly transforming the digital ecosystem. However, the understanding of LLM decision-making under uncertainty remains limited. We initiate a comparative study of LLM risky choices along two dimensions: (1) prospect representation (explicit vs. experience based) and (2) decision rationale (explanation). Our study, which involves 20 frontier and open LLMs, is complemented by a matched human subjects experiment, which provides one reference point, while an expected payoff maximizing rational agent model provides another. We find that LLMs cluster into two categories: reasoning models (RMs) and conversational models (CMs). RMs tend towards rational behavior, are insensitive to the order of prospects, gain/loss framing, and explanations, and behave similarly whether prospects are explicit or presented via experience history. CMs are significantly less rational, slightly more human-like, sensitive to prospect ordering, framing, and explanation, and exhibit a large description-history gap. Paired comparisons of open LLMs suggest that a key factor differentiating RMs and CMs is training for mathematical reasoning.

*Yuanyan Song,Kezhi Wang,Xinmian Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Secure wireless agentic AI network with supervisor and multiple AI agents optimizes energy consumption while ensuring QoS, privacy, and reasoning accuracy through dynamic agent selection and resource allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to provision QoS for users' reasoning tasks while ensuring confidentiality of private knowledge and reasoning outcomes in wireless AI networks, with additional challenge of extending service duration of energy-constrained AI agents.

Method: Two resource allocation schemes: ASC (uses ADMM-based algorithm, SDR, and SCA for iterative optimization) and LAW (uses LLM optimizer within agentic workflow). Both decompose joint optimization problem into three sub-problems: AI agent selection, BS beamforming, and AI agent transmission power.

Result: Proposed solutions reduce network energy consumption by up to 59.1% compared to benchmark schemes. Practical validation using Qwen-based agentic AI system shows satisfactory reasoning accuracy across various public benchmarks.

Conclusion: The secure wireless agentic AI network with proposed resource allocation schemes effectively balances energy efficiency, QoS provisioning, privacy protection, and reasoning accuracy, demonstrating practical viability through real-world implementation.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a secure wireless agentic AI network comprising one supervisor AI agent and multiple other AI agents to provision quality of service (QoS) for users' reasoning tasks while ensuring confidentiality of private knowledge and reasoning outcomes. Specifically, the supervisor AI agent can dynamically assign other AI agents to participate in cooperative reasoning, while the unselected AI agents act as friendly jammers to degrade the eavesdropper's interception performance. To extend the service duration of AI agents, an energy minimization problem is formulated that jointly optimizes AI agent selection, base station (BS) beamforming, and AI agent transmission power, subject to latency and reasoning accuracy constraints. To address the formulated problem, we propose two resource allocation schemes, ASC and LAW, which first decompose it into three sub-problems. Specifically, ASC optimizes each sub-problem iteratively using the proposed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm, semi-definite relaxation (SDR), and successive convex approximation (SCA), while LAW tackles each sub-problem using the proposed large language model (LLM) optimizer within an agentic workflow. The experimental results show that the proposed solutions can reduce network energy consumption by up to 59.1% compared to other benchmark schemes. Furthermore, the proposed schemes are validated using a practical agentic AI system based on Qwen, demonstrating satisfactory reasoning accuracy across various public benchmarks.

*Pavel Koptev,Vishnu Kumar,Konstantin Malkov,George Shapiro,Yury Vikhanov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI/ML framework supplements deterministic algorithms to predict invoice dilution in supply chain finance using real-time data across nine transaction fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Invoice/payment dilution (gap between approved amount and actual collection) causes significant non-credit risk and margin loss in supply chain finance. Traditional IPU-based solutions hinder adoption, especially among sub-investment grade buyers.

Method: Introduces AI/ML framework that supplements deterministic algorithms to predict invoice dilution. Uses real-time dynamic credit limits and analyzes extensive production dataset across nine key transaction fields.

Result: Not explicitly stated in abstract, but implies the framework enables better prediction of invoice dilution compared to traditional IPU-based approaches.

Conclusion: Data-driven, real-time AI/ML methods can effectively predict invoice dilution and supplement traditional deterministic approaches, potentially improving supply chain finance adoption and risk management.

Abstract: Invoice or payment dilution is the gap between the approved invoice amount and the actual collection is a significant source of non credit risk and margin loss in supply chain finance. Traditionally, this risk is managed through the buyer's irrevocable payment undertaking (IPU), which commits to full payment without deductions. However, IPUs can hinder supply chain finance adoption, particularly among sub-invested grade buyers. A newer, data-driven methods use real-time dynamic credit limits, projecting dilution for each buyer-supplier pair in real-time. This paper introduces an AI, machine learning framework and evaluates how that can supplement a deterministic algorithm to predict invoice dilution using extensive production dataset across nine key transaction fields.

*Farbod Abbasi,Zachary Patterson,Bilal Farooq*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a WGAN-based joint learning method for multi-source synthetic population generation that improves diversity and feasibility through inverse gradient penalty regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for synthetic population generation rely on single datasets or sequential processes, failing to capture feature interplay and struggling with sampling/structural zeros, reducing diversity and feasibility.

Method: Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty using joint learning to integrate multi-source datasets simultaneously, with inverse gradient penalty regularization term in generator loss function.

Result: Joint approach outperforms sequential baseline: recall increased by 7%, precision by 15%. Regularization further improved recall by 10% and precision by 1%. Similarity score of 88.1 vs 84.6 for sequential method.

Conclusion: The multi-source generative approach using joint learning with WGAN and regularization significantly enhances synthetic population quality, potentially improving accuracy and reliability of agent-based models.

Abstract: Generating realistic synthetic populations is essential for agent-based models (ABM) in transportation and urban planning. Current methods face two major limitations. First, many rely on a single dataset or follow a sequential data fusion and generation process, which means they fail to capture the complex interplay between features. Second, these approaches struggle with sampling zeros (valid but unobserved attribute combinations) and structural zeros (infeasible combinations due to logical constraints), which reduce the diversity and feasibility of the generated data. This study proposes a novel method to simultaneously integrate and synthesize multi-source datasets using a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with gradient penalty. This joint learning method improves both the diversity and feasibility of synthetic data by defining a regularization term (inverse gradient penalty) for the generator loss function. For the evaluation, we implement a unified evaluation metric for similarity, and place special emphasis on measuring diversity and feasibility through recall, precision, and the F1 score. Results show that the proposed joint approach outperforms the sequential baseline, with recall increasing by 7\% and precision by 15\%. Additionally, the regularization term further improves diversity and feasibility, reflected in a 10\% increase in recall and 1\% in precision. We assess similarity distributions using a five-metric score. The joint approach performs better overall, and reaches a score of 88.1 compared to 84.6 for the sequential method. Since synthetic populations serve as a key input for ABM, this multi-source generative approach has the potential to significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of ABM.

*Omid Madani,J. Brian Burns,Reza Eghbali,Thomas L. Dean*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agents using non-stationary probability learning and episodic memories to build imperfect maps for planning outperform simpler agents in challenging navigation tasks with changing environments, as long as uncertainty isn't too high.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different memory types and uses can help spatial navigation in changing, uncertain environments where agents face non-stationary barriers/food locations, limited sensing, and need fast learning.

Method: Study a foraging task where agents navigate from home to food through changing barriers. Compare strategies from simple to sophisticated using various memory and learning approaches, including non-stationary probability learning to update episodic memories and build imperfect maps for on-the-fly planning.

Result: Agents using episodic memory updates and map-based planning become increasingly more efficient than minimal-memory agents as task difficulty increases (e.g., longer distances), provided localization and environmental change uncertainty remain moderate.

Conclusion: Effective navigation in changing uncertain environments requires architectures that combine multiple strategies for different subtasks (exploration vs. planning), with non-stationary probability learning for memory updates and imperfect map-based planning offering substantial efficiency gains over simpler approaches.

Abstract: We explore how different types and uses of memory can aid spatial navigation in changing uncertain environments. In the simple foraging task we study, every day, our agent has to find its way from its home, through barriers, to food. Moreover, the world is non-stationary: from day to day, the location of the barriers and food may change, and the agent's sensing such as its location information is uncertain and very limited. Any model construction, such as a map, and use, such as planning, needs to be robust against these challenges, and if any learning is to be useful, it needs to be adequately fast. We look at a range of strategies, from simple to sophisticated, with various uses of memory and learning. We find that an architecture that can incorporate multiple strategies is required to handle (sub)tasks of a different nature, in particular for exploration and search, when food location is not known, and for planning a good path to a remembered (likely) food location. An agent that utilizes non-stationary probability learning techniques to keep updating its (episodic) memories and that uses those memories to build maps and plan on the fly (imperfect maps, i.e. noisy and limited to the agent's experience) can be increasingly and substantially more efficient than the simpler (minimal-memory) agents, as the task difficulties such as distance to goal are raised, as long as the uncertainty, from localization and change, is not too large.

Conclusion: Vision-capable agents can significantly enhance beamline efficiency, reduce operational burden, and make advanced microscopy more accessible to users with varying expertise levels.

Abstract: We present Experiment Automation Agents (EAA), a vision-language-model-driven agentic system designed to automate complex experimental microscopy workflows. EAA integrates multimodal reasoning, tool-augmented action, and optional long-term memory to support both autonomous procedures and interactive user-guided measurements. Built on a flexible task-manager architecture, the system enables workflows ranging from fully agent-driven automation to logic-defined routines that embed localized LLM queries. EAA further provides a modern tool ecosystem with two-way compatibility for Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing instrument-control tools to be consumed or served across applications. We demonstrate EAA at an imaging beamline at the Advanced Photon Source, including automated zone plate focusing, natural language-described feature search, and interactive data acquisition. These results illustrate how vision-capable agents can enhance beamline efficiency, reduce operational burden, and lower the expertise barrier for users.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: X-MAP is an explainable framework that analyzes misclassifications in spam/phishing detection by revealing topic-level semantic patterns behind model failures, achieving high detection performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misclassifications in spam and phishing detection are harmful: false negatives expose users to attacks while false positives degrade trust. Existing uncertainty-based detectors have limitations - they can be deceived and offer limited interpretability.

Method: X-MAP combines SHAP-based feature attributions with non-negative matrix factorization to build interpretable topic profiles for reliably classified spam/phishing and legitimate messages. It measures each message's deviation from these profiles using Jensen-Shannon divergence.

Result: Misclassified messages exhibit at least two times larger divergence than correctly classified ones. As a detector, X-MAP achieves up to 0.98 AUROC and lowers false-rejection rate at 95% TRR to 0.089. When used as a repair layer, it recovers up to 97% of falsely rejected correct predictions with moderate leakage.

Conclusion: X-MAP demonstrates effectiveness and interpretability for improving spam and phishing detection by revealing semantic patterns behind model failures and enabling better error analysis and correction.

Abstract: Misclassifications in spam and phishing detection are very harmful, as false negatives expose users to attacks while false positives degrade trust. Existing uncertainty-based detectors can flag potential errors, but possibly be deceived and offer limited interpretability. This paper presents X-MAP, an eXplainable Misclassification Analysis and Profilling framework that reveals topic-level semantic patterns behind model failures. X-MAP combines SHAP-based feature attributions with non-negative matrix factorization to build interpretable topic profiles for reliably classified spam/phishing and legitimate messages, and measures each message's deviation from these profiles using Jensen-Shannon divergence. Experiments on SMS and phishing datasets show that misclassified messages exhibit at least two times larger divergence than correctly classified ones. As a detector, X-MAP achieves up to 0.98 AUROC and lowers the false-rejection rate at 95% TRR to 0.089 on positive predictions. When used as a repair layer on base detectors, it recovers up to 97% of falsely rejected correct predictions with moderate leakage.

TL;DR: Bridging AI models for agriculture: An agentic framework combines LLMs' language reasoning with specialized agricultural data tools through iterative code execution and reflection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models for agriculture lack language reasoning and interactivity, while LLMs can't handle high-dimensional agricultural data. There's a gap between data-driven agricultural models and language-based reasoning needed for real-world agronomic workflows.

Method: Created AgriWorld (Python execution environment with geospatial queries, remote-sensing analytics, crop simulation, and task predictors) + Agro-Reflective (multi-turn LLM agent that writes code, observes results, and refines analysis via execute-observe-refine loop). Evaluated on AgroBench with diverse agricultural QA tasks.

Result: Outperforms text-only and direct tool-use baselines, demonstrating execution-driven reflection enables reliable agricultural reasoning across lookup, forecasting, anomaly detection, and counterfactual analysis tasks.

Conclusion: Agentic framework successfully bridges agricultural data models and LLMs, enabling language-based reasoning over complex agricultural datasets through iterative code execution and reflection loops.

Abstract: Foundation models for agriculture are increasingly trained on massive spatiotemporal data (e.g., multi-spectral remote sensing, soil grids, and field-level management logs) and achieve strong performance on forecasting and monitoring. However, these models lack language-based reasoning and interactive capabilities, limiting their usefulness in real-world agronomic workflows. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting and generating text, but cannot directly reason over high-dimensional, heterogeneous agricultural datasets. We bridge this gap with an agentic framework for agricultural science. It provides a Python execution environment, AgriWorld, exposing unified tools for geospatial queries over field parcels, remote-sensing time-series analytics, crop growth simulation, and task-specific predictors (e.g., yield, stress, and disease risk). On top of this environment, we design a multi-turn LLM agent, Agro-Reflective, that iteratively writes code, observes execution results, and refines its analysis via an execute-observe-refine loop. We introduce AgroBench, with scalable data generation for diverse agricultural QA spanning lookups, forecasting, anomaly detection, and counterfactual "what-if" analysis. Experiments outperform text-only and direct tool-use baselines, validating execution-driven reflection for reliable agricultural reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WAC is a web agent that uses multi-model collaboration with consequence simulation and feedback-driven refinement to improve web task execution by enhancing reasoning and risk awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current web agents struggle with reasoning about environment changes and lack comprehensive risk awareness, often performing risky actions prematurely that lead to task failure.

Method: WAC integrates model collaboration with a multi-agent process where an action model consults a world model for strategic guidance, then uses a two-stage deduction chain: the world model simulates action outcomes, and a judge model scrutinizes them to trigger corrective feedback when needed.

Result: WAC achieves absolute gains of 1.8% on VisualWebArena and 1.3% on Online-Mind2Web benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach of model collaboration with consequence simulation and feedback-driven refinement effectively addresses reasoning limitations and risk awareness in web agents, leading to improved performance on web automation tasks.

Abstract: Web agents based on large language models have demonstrated promising capability in automating web tasks. However, current web agents struggle to reason out sensible actions due to the limitations of predicting environment changes, and might not possess comprehensive awareness of execution risks, prematurely performing risky actions that cause losses and lead to task failure. To address these challenges, we propose WAC, a web agent that integrates model collaboration, consequence simulation, and feedback-driven action refinement. To overcome the cognitive isolation of individual models, we introduce a multi-agent collaboration process that enables an action model to consult a world model as a web-environment expert for strategic guidance; the action model then grounds these suggestions into executable actions, leveraging prior knowledge of environmental state transition dynamics to enhance candidate action proposal. To achieve risk-aware resilient task execution, we introduce a two-stage deduction chain. A world model, specialized in environmental state transitions, simulates action outcomes, which a judge model then scrutinizes to trigger action corrective feedback when necessary. Experiments show that WAC achieves absolute gains of 1.8% on VisualWebArena and 1.3% on Online-Mind2Web.

*Ankit Sharma,Nachiket Tapas,Jyotiprakash Patra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An adaptive abstention system for LLMs that dynamically adjusts safety thresholds using contextual signals, combining five parallel detectors in a hierarchical cascade to balance safety and utility while reducing latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM safety systems face a fundamental trade-off: strict filtering blocks benign queries while relaxed controls risk unsafe content. Conventional guardrails are context-insensitive, computationally expensive, and cause high latency, degrading user experience.

Method: Introduces an adaptive abstention system with dynamic safety thresholds based on real-time contextual signals (domain, user history). Uses a multi-dimensional detection architecture with five parallel detectors combined through a hierarchical cascade mechanism to optimize speed and precision.

Result: Significant reductions in false positives, especially in sensitive domains like medical advice and creative writing. Substantial latency improvements compared to non-cascaded models and external guardrail systems. Maintains high safety precision and near-perfect recall under strict modes.

Conclusion: The context-aware abstention framework effectively balances safety and utility while preserving performance, offering a scalable solution for reliable LLM deployment in production environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in production environments face a fundamental safety-utility trade-off either a strict filtering mechanisms prevent harmful outputs but often block benign queries or a relaxed controls risk unsafe content generation. Conventional guardrails based on static rules or fixed confidence thresholds are typically context-insensitive and computationally expensive, resulting in high latency and degraded user experience. To address these limitations, we introduce an adaptive abstention system that dynamically adjusts safety thresholds based on real-time contextual signals such as domain and user history. The proposed framework integrates a multi-dimensional detection architecture composed of five parallel detectors, combined through a hierarchical cascade mechanism to optimize both speed and precision. The cascade design reduces unnecessary computation by progressively filtering queries, achieving substantial latency improvements compared to non-cascaded models and external guardrail systems. Extensive evaluation on mixed and domain-specific workloads demonstrates significant reductions in false positives, particularly in sensitive domains such as medical advice and creative writing. The system maintains high safety precision and near-perfect recall under strict operating modes. Overall, our context-aware abstention framework effectively balances safety and utility while preserving performance, offering a scalable solution for reliable LLM deployment.

### [59] [Common Belief Revisited](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15403)
*Thomas Ågotnes*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper provides a complete axiomatization of common belief when individual belief is KD45, showing it requires KD4 plus shift-reflexivity and one additional agent-dependent axiom.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the open problem of characterizing the logic of common belief when individual belief follows KD45, as common belief loses the 5 property but gains shift-reflexivity, and determine if KD4 plus shift-reflexivity is complete.

Method: Logical analysis and axiomatic characterization of common belief operators, investigating properties that hold when individual belief is KD45, and proving completeness results.

Result: KD4 plus shift-reflexivity is incomplete; one additional axiom is required that depends on the number of agents, providing a complete characterization of common belief in the KD45 case.

Conclusion: The paper settles the open problem by showing common belief in the KD45 case is characterized by KD4 plus shift-reflexivity and an additional agent-dependent axiom, providing a complete logic of common belief.

Abstract: Contrary to common belief, common belief is not KD4.
  If individual belief is KD45, common belief does indeed lose the 5 property and keep the D and 4 properties -- and it has none of the other commonly considered properties of knowledge and belief. But it has another property: $C(Cφ\rightarrow φ)$ -- corresponding to so-called shift-reflexivity (reflexivity one step ahead). This observation begs the question:
  is KD4 extended with this axiom a complete characterisation of common belief in the KD45 case? If not, what \emph{is} the logic of common belief? In this paper we show that the answer to the first question is ``no'': there is one additional axiom, and, furthermore, it relies on the number of agents. We show that the result is a complete characterisation of common belief, settling the open problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support the evaluation and training of automatic pedagogical evaluators and AI tutors for instructional explanations, addressing the need for standardized assessment of AI-generated educational content.

Method: Created dataset with 854 explanations for 139 ScienceQA questions, including human-teacher and LLM-simulated teacher role explanations. Developed pedagogical risk rubric with 5 dimensions, annotated explanations via semi-automatic process with expert review, and conducted validation experiments benchmarking education-oriented models.

Result: Dataset successfully created with comprehensive annotations. Preliminary validation shows EduEVAL-DB is suitable for evaluating pedagogical risk detection, with experiments comparing Gemini 2.5 Pro against lightweight Llama 3.1 8B model.

Conclusion: EduEVAL-DB provides a valuable resource for evaluating AI tutors' pedagogical explanations and supports development of deployable models for pedagogical risk detection on consumer hardware.

Abstract: This work introduces EduEVAL-DB, a dataset based on teacher roles designed to support the evaluation and training of automatic pedagogical evaluators and AI tutors for instructional explanations. The dataset comprises 854 explanations corresponding to 139 questions from a curated subset of the ScienceQA benchmark, spanning science, language, and social science across K-12 grade levels. For each question, one human-teacher explanation is provided and six are generated by LLM-simulated teacher roles. These roles are inspired by instructional styles and shortcomings observed in real educational practice and are instantiated via prompt engineering. We further propose a pedagogical risk rubric aligned with established educational standards, operationalizing five complementary risk dimensions: factual correctness, explanatory depth and completeness, focus and relevance, student-level appropriateness, and ideological bias. All explanations are annotated with binary risk labels through a semi-automatic process with expert teacher review. Finally, we present preliminary validation experiments to assess the suitability of EduEVAL-DB for evaluation. We benchmark a state-of-the-art education-oriented model (Gemini 2.5 Pro) against a lightweight local Llama 3.1 8B model and examine whether supervised fine-tuning on EduEVAL-DB supports pedagogical risk detection using models deployable on consumer hardware.

### [61] [Quantifying construct validity in large language model evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15532)
*Ryan Othniel Kearns*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper critiques current LLM evaluation methods and introduces a new model called "structured capabilities" that combines insights from latent factor models and scaling laws to better measure true model capabilities beyond just benchmark scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM benchmarks have problems like test set contamination and annotator error, making them unreliable indicators of true model capabilities. Existing approaches (latent factor models and scaling laws) are inadequate for establishing construct validity - latent factor models ignore scaling laws and proxy model size, while scaling laws ignore measurement error.

Method: The paper proposes the "structured capabilities model" which combines insights from both latent factor models and scaling laws. It separates model scale from capabilities appropriately: model scale informs capabilities (like scaling laws), and these capabilities inform observed results up to measurement error (like latent factor models). The model is fitted on results from the OpenLLM Leaderboard.

Result: Structured capabilities outperform latent factor models on parsimonious fit indices and show better out-of-distribution benchmark prediction than scaling laws. The model demonstrates better explanatory and predictive power for quantifying construct validity in LLM evaluations.

Conclusion: The structured capabilities model successfully addresses the limitations of existing approaches by properly separating model scale from capabilities, resulting in interpretable and generalizable capability measurements that better reflect true LLM performance beyond benchmark artifacts.

Abstract: The LLM community often reports benchmark results as if they are synonymous with general model capabilities. However, benchmarks can have problems that distort performance, like test set contamination and annotator error. How can we know that a benchmark is a reliable indicator of some capability that we want to measure? This question concerns the construct validity of LLM benchmarks, and it requires separating benchmark results from capabilities when we model and predict LLM performance.
  Both social scientists and computer scientists propose formal models - latent factor models and scaling laws - for identifying the capabilities underlying benchmark scores. However, neither technique is satisfactory for construct validity. Latent factor models ignore scaling laws, and as a result, the capabilities they extract often proxy model size. Scaling laws ignore measurement error, and as a result, the capabilities they extract are both uninterpretable and overfit to the observed benchmarks.
  This thesis presents the structured capabilities model, the first model to extract interpretable and generalisable capabilities from a large collection of LLM benchmark results. I fit this model and its two alternatives on a large sample of results from the OpenLLM Leaderboard. Structured capabilities outperform latent factor models on parsimonious fit indices, and exhibit better out-of-distribution benchmark prediction than scaling laws. These improvements are possible because neither existing approach separates model scale from capabilities in the appropriate way. Model scale should inform capabilities, as in scaling laws, and these capabilities should inform observed results up to measurement error, as in latent factor models. In combining these two insights, structured capabilities demonstrate better explanatory and predictive power for quantifying construct validity in LLM evaluations.

TL;DR: Ruva is a "Glass Box" personal AI architecture using knowledge graphs instead of black-box vector databases, enabling users to inspect and precisely edit AI memory for privacy and accountability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current personal AI systems use black-box retrieval-augmented generation with vector databases that lack accountability. Users can't inspect why AI hallucinates or retrieves sensitive data, and "deleting" concepts from vector spaces leaves probabilistic "ghosts" that violate privacy rights.

Method: Ruva grounds personal AI in a Personal Knowledge Graph instead of vector databases, shifting from vector matching to graph reasoning. This enables human-in-the-loop memory curation where users can inspect what the AI knows and perform precise redaction of specific facts.

Result: Ruva provides the first "Glass Box" architecture for personal AI that ensures the "Right to be Forgotten" by allowing users to be editors of their own AI memories through precise fact redaction in knowledge graphs.

Conclusion: By replacing black-box vector matching with transparent graph reasoning, Ruva empowers users with control over their personal AI, addressing privacy concerns and enabling accountable AI systems where users can truly "delete" information.

Abstract: The Personal AI landscape is currently dominated by "Black Box" Retrieval-Augmented Generation. While standard vector databases offer statistical matching, they suffer from a fundamental lack of accountability: when an AI hallucinates or retrieves sensitive data, the user cannot inspect the cause nor correct the error. Worse, "deleting" a concept from a vector space is mathematically imprecise, leaving behind probabilistic "ghosts" that violate true privacy. We propose Ruva, the first "Glass Box" architecture designed for Human-in-the-Loop Memory Curation. Ruva grounds Personal AI in a Personal Knowledge Graph, enabling users to inspect what the AI knows and to perform precise redaction of specific facts. By shifting the paradigm from Vector Matching to Graph Reasoning, Ruva ensures the "Right to be Forgotten." Users are the editors of their own lives; Ruva hands them the pen.

*Hongxuan Wu,Yukun Zhang,Xueqing Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces PID Flow, a framework using Partial Information Decomposition to analyze how multimodal Transformers process visual questions, revealing that visual information peaks early, language dominates late layers (~82% of prediction), and cross-modal synergy remains low (<2%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether multimodal Transformer predictions are driven by visual evidence, linguistic reasoning, or genuine cross-modal fusion, and how this information structure evolves across layers in visual question answering models.

Method: Developed PID Flow pipeline combining dimensionality reduction, normalizing-flow Gaussianization, and closed-form Gaussian PID estimation to make Partial Information Decomposition tractable for high-dimensional neural representations. Applied to LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.6-7B across six GQA reasoning tasks, with targeted attention knockouts for causal analysis.

Result: Consistent "modal transduction" pattern: visual-unique information peaks early and decays, language-unique information surges in late layers (82% of final prediction), cross-modal synergy remains below 2%. Pattern is stable across model variants (layer-wise correlations >0.96) but task-dependent. Attention knockouts show predictable increases in trapped visual information and compensatory synergy.

Conclusion: Provides information-theoretic, causal account of how vision becomes language in multimodal Transformers, revealing architectural bottlenecks where modality-specific information is lost, with quantitative guidance for model improvement.

Abstract: When a multimodal Transformer answers a visual question, is the prediction driven by visual evidence, linguistic reasoning, or genuinely fused cross-modal computation -- and how does this structure evolve across layers? We address this question with a layer-wise framework based on Partial Information Decomposition (PID) that decomposes the predictive information at each Transformer layer into redundant, vision-unique, language-unique, and synergistic components. To make PID tractable for high-dimensional neural representations, we introduce \emph{PID Flow}, a pipeline combining dimensionality reduction, normalizing-flow Gaussianization, and closed-form Gaussian PID estimation. Applying this framework to LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.6-7B across six GQA reasoning tasks, we uncover a consistent \emph{modal transduction} pattern: visual-unique information peaks early and decays with depth, language-unique information surges in late layers to account for roughly 82\% of the final prediction, and cross-modal synergy remains below 2\%. This trajectory is highly stable across model variants (layer-wise correlations $>$0.96) yet strongly task-dependent, with semantic redundancy governing the detailed information fingerprint. To establish causality, we perform targeted Image$\rightarrow$Question attention knockouts and show that disrupting the primary transduction pathway induces predictable increases in trapped visual-unique information, compensatory synergy, and total information cost -- effects that are strongest in vision-dependent tasks and weakest in high-redundancy tasks. Together, these results provide an information-theoretic, causal account of how vision becomes language in multimodal Transformers, and offer quantitative guidance for identifying architectural bottlenecks where modality-specific information is lost.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A preprocessing method that infers additional cumulative constraints to capture multi-resource interactions in scheduling, improving search performance and tightening bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cumulative constraint propagation in scheduling misses multi-resource interactions, causing slowdowns on some benchmarks. There's a need to capture these interactions without search-time probing.

Method: Interprets cumulative constraints as linear inequalities over occupancy vectors, discovers covers (sets of tasks that cannot run in parallel), strengthens cover inequalities with lifting, and injects resulting constraints back into the problem.

Result: Improves search performance and tightens objective bounds on favorable instances with little degradation on unfavorable ones. Discovers 25 new lower bounds and five new best solutions, with eight lower bounds obtained directly from inferred constraints.

Conclusion: The preprocessing method for inferring additional cumulative constraints effectively captures multi-resource interactions, leading to improved scheduling performance and better solution bounds.

Abstract: Cumulative constraints are central in scheduling with constraint programming, yet propagation is typically performed per constraint, missing multi-resource interactions and causing severe slowdowns on some benchmarks. I present a preprocessing method for inferring additional cumulative constraints that capture such interactions without search-time probing. This approach interprets cumulative constraints as linear inequalities over occupancy vectors and generates valid inequalities by (i) discovering covers, the sets of tasks that cannot run in parallel, (ii) strengthening the cover inequalities for the discovered sets with lifting, and (iii) injecting the resulting constraints back into the scheduling problem instance. Experiments on standard RCPSP and RCPSP/max test suites show that these inferred constraints improve search performance and tighten objective bounds on favorable instances, while incurring little degradation on unfavorable ones. Additionally, these experiments discover 25 new lower bounds and five new best solutions; eight of the lower bounds are obtained directly from the inferred constraints.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CARE Drive is a framework for evaluating whether vision language models in automated driving make decisions based on human reasons rather than just post-hoc rationalizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for foundation models in automated driving only assess outcomes (safety, trajectory accuracy) without determining if decisions reflect genuine human reasoning, creating false confidence in safety-critical domains.

Method: CARE Drive uses a model-agnostic framework with two stages: prompt calibration for stable outputs, then systematic contextual perturbation to measure decision sensitivity to human reasons (safety margins, social pressure, efficiency constraints).

Result: Explicit human reasons significantly influence model decisions and improve alignment with expert recommendations, but responsiveness varies across contextual factors, showing uneven sensitivity to different reason types.

Conclusion: Reason responsiveness in foundation models can be systematically evaluated without modifying parameters, providing empirical evidence for assessing whether model decisions genuinely reflect human reasoning rather than just post-hoc rationalizations.

Abstract: Foundation models, including vision language models, are increasingly used in automated driving to interpret scenes, recommend actions, and generate natural language explanations. However, existing evaluation methods primarily assess outcome based performance, such as safety and trajectory accuracy, without determining whether model decisions reflect human relevant considerations. As a result, it remains unclear whether explanations produced by such models correspond to genuine reason responsive decision making or merely post hoc rationalizations. This limitation is especially significant in safety critical domains because it can create false confidence. To address this gap, we propose CARE Drive, Context Aware Reasons Evaluation for Driving, a model agnostic framework for evaluating reason responsiveness in vision language models applied to automated driving. CARE Drive compares baseline and reason augmented model decisions under controlled contextual variation to assess whether human reasons causally influence decision behavior. The framework employs a two stage evaluation process. Prompt calibration ensures stable outputs. Systematic contextual perturbation then measures decision sensitivity to human reasons such as safety margins, social pressure, and efficiency constraints. We demonstrate CARE Drive in a cyclist overtaking scenario involving competing normative considerations. Results show that explicit human reasons significantly influence model decisions, improving alignment with expert recommended behavior. However, responsiveness varies across contextual factors, indicating uneven sensitivity to different types of reasons. These findings provide empirical evidence that reason responsiveness in foundation models can be systematically evaluated without modifying model parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for personality control in LLMs rely on static prompting or expensive fine-tuning, failing to capture the dynamic and compositional nature of human traits.

Method: Three-stage framework: Persona-Base extracts orthogonal trait vectors via contrastive activation analysis; Persona-Algebra enables control through vector arithmetic (scalar multiplication, addition, subtraction); Persona-Flow achieves context-aware adaptation by dynamically composing vectors during inference.

Result: On PersonalityBench, achieves mean score of 9.60 (nearly matching supervised fine-tuning upper bound of 9.61). On Persona-Evolve benchmark for dynamic adaptation, achieves up to 91% win rates across diverse model families.

Conclusion: Personality traits in LLMs are mathematically tractable as extractable, approximately orthogonal directions in representation space, opening new directions for interpretable and efficient behavioral control.

Abstract: Current methods for personality control in Large Language Models rely on static prompting or expensive fine-tuning, failing to capture the dynamic and compositional nature of human traits. We introduce PERSONA, a training-free framework that achieves fine-tuning level performance through direct manipulation of personality vectors in activation space. Our key insight is that personality traits appear as extractable, approximately orthogonal directions in the model's representation space that support algebraic operations. The framework operates through three stages: Persona-Base extracts orthogonal trait vectors via contrastive activation analysis; Persona-Algebra enables precise control through vector arithmetic (scalar multiplication for intensity, addition for composition, subtraction for suppression); and Persona-Flow achieves context-aware adaptation by dynamically composing these vectors during inference. On PersonalityBench, our approach achieves a mean score of 9.60, nearly matching the supervised fine-tuning upper bound of 9.61 without any gradient updates. On our proposed Persona-Evolve benchmark for dynamic personality adaptation, we achieve up to 91% win rates across diverse model families. These results provide evidence that aspects of LLM personality are mathematically tractable, opening new directions for interpretable and efficient behavioral control.

TL;DR: RCE enables LLMs to dynamically modify their internal representation geometry during inference by generating new concept subspaces, improving compositional reasoning performance by 8-18 points across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with compositional reasoning tasks despite strong performance on other complex reasoning. Existing methods only expand token-level search without modifying the model's latent representation space, causing performance collapse when required abstractions aren't already encoded.

Method: Recursive Concept Evolution (RCE) framework that enables pretrained LLMs to modify internal representation geometry during inference. It dynamically generates low-rank concept subspaces when representational inadequacy is detected, selects them via minimum description length criterion, merges synergistic subspaces, and consolidates via constrained optimization for stability.

Result: RCE integrated with Mistral-7B yields 12-18 point gains on ARC-AGI-2, 8-14 point improvements on GPQA and BBH, and consistent reductions in depth-induced error on MATH and HLE benchmarks.

Conclusion: RCE enables LLMs to construct new abstractions rather than just recombining existing ones, significantly improving compositional reasoning by allowing dynamic modification of internal representation geometry during inference.

Abstract: Large language models achieve strong performance on many complex reasoning tasks, yet their accuracy degrades sharply on benchmarks that require compositional reasoning, including ARC-AGI-2, GPQA, MATH, BBH, and HLE. Existing methods improve reasoning by expanding token-level search through chain-of-thought prompting, self-consistency, or reinforcement learning, but they leave the model's latent representation space fixed. When the required abstraction is not already encoded in this space, performance collapses. We propose Recursive Concept Evolution (RCE), a framework that enables pretrained language models to modify their internal representation geometry during inference. RCE introduces dynamically generated low-rank concept subspaces that are spawned when representational inadequacy is detected, selected through a minimum description length criterion, merged when synergistic, and consolidated via constrained optimization to preserve stability. This process allows the model to construct new abstractions rather than recombining existing ones. We integrate RCE with Mistral-7B and evaluate it across compositional reasoning benchmarks. RCE yields 12-18 point gains on ARC-AGI-2, 8-14 point improvements on GPQA and BBH, and consistent reductions in depth-induced error on MATH and HLE.

TL;DR: GlobeDiff is a multi-modal diffusion algorithm that accurately infers global states from local observations in partially observable multi-agent systems, overcoming limitations of existing belief-based and communication methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Partial observability is a critical barrier to effective coordination in multi-agent systems. Existing approaches like belief state estimation and inter-agent communication have limitations: belief-based methods focus too much on past experiences without leveraging global information, while communication methods lack robust models to effectively use auxiliary information.

Method: GlobeDiff formulates state inference as a multi-modal diffusion process to infer global states from local observations. The algorithm overcomes ambiguities in state estimation while maintaining high fidelity in global state inference.

Result: Theoretical analysis proves that GlobeDiff's estimation error under both unimodal and multi-modal distributions can be bounded. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance and accurate global state inference capabilities.

Conclusion: GlobeDiff effectively addresses the partial observability challenge in multi-agent systems by providing a robust diffusion-based approach to global state inference that outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: In the realm of multi-agent systems, the challenge of \emph{partial observability} is a critical barrier to effective coordination and decision-making. Existing approaches, such as belief state estimation and inter-agent communication, often fall short. Belief-based methods are limited by their focus on past experiences without fully leveraging global information, while communication methods often lack a robust model to effectively utilize the auxiliary information they provide. To solve this issue, we propose Global State Diffusion Algorithm~(GlobeDiff) to infer the global state based on the local observations. By formulating the state inference process as a multi-modal diffusion process, GlobeDiff overcomes ambiguities in state estimation while simultaneously inferring the global state with high fidelity. We prove that the estimation error of GlobeDiff under both unimodal and multi-modal distributions can be bounded. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GlobeDiff achieves superior performance and is capable of accurately inferring the global state.

TL;DR: LLMs as synthetic participants can support valid inference about human behavior through heuristic approaches for exploratory research or statistical calibration for confirmatory research, but validity depends on how well LLMs approximate relevant populations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is growing use of LLMs as synthetic participants in social science experiments, but limited guidance on when such simulations support valid inference about human behavior, creating a need to clarify appropriate strategies and assumptions.

Method: Contrast two strategies: heuristic approaches (prompt engineering, model fine-tuning) for exploratory research, and statistical calibration (combining auxiliary human data with statistical adjustments) for confirmatory research.

Result: Heuristic approaches lack formal statistical guarantees but are useful for exploratory tasks, while statistical calibration preserves validity and provides more precise estimates of causal effects at lower cost than human-only experiments.

Conclusion: Both approaches depend on how well LLMs approximate relevant populations, and researchers should consider what opportunities are overlooked when focusing narrowly on substituting LLMs for human participants.

Abstract: A growing literature uses large language models (LLMs) as synthetic participants to generate cost-effective and nearly instantaneous responses in social science experiments. However, there is limited guidance on when such simulations support valid inference about human behavior. We contrast two strategies for obtaining valid estimates of causal effects and clarify the assumptions under which each is suitable for exploratory versus confirmatory research. Heuristic approaches seek to establish that simulated and observed human behavior are interchangeable through prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, and other repair strategies designed to reduce LLM-induced inaccuracies. While useful for many exploratory tasks, heuristic approaches lack the formal statistical guarantees typically required for confirmatory research. In contrast, statistical calibration combines auxiliary human data with statistical adjustments to account for discrepancies between observed and simulated responses. Under explicit assumptions, statistical calibration preserves validity and provides more precise estimates of causal effects at lower cost than experiments that rely solely on human participants. Yet the potential of both approaches depends on how well LLMs approximate the relevant populations.

*Suhyung Jang,Ghang Lee,Jaekun Lee,Hyunjun Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM embeddings outperform one-hot encoding for building object subtype classification in BIM models, enhancing AI's semantic understanding in AECO industry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional encoding methods like one-hot fail to capture nuanced relationships among closely related building object subtypes, limiting AI's semantic comprehension in the AECO industry.

Method: Proposed using LLM embeddings (OpenAI GPT and Meta LLaMA) as encodings to preserve finer semantic distinctions. Trained GraphSAGE models to classify 42 building object subtypes across five high-rise residential BIMs, testing various embedding dimensions including original high-dimensional embeddings and compacted embeddings via Matryoshka representation model.

Result: LLM encodings outperformed conventional one-hot baseline, with llama-3 (compacted) embedding achieving weighted average F1-score of 0.8766 compared to 0.8475 for one-hot encoding.

Conclusion: LLM-based encodings show promise for enhancing AI's ability to interpret complex, domain-specific building semantics, with potential for broad application in semantic elaboration tasks throughout the AECO industry as LLM capabilities evolve.

Abstract: Accurate representation of building semantics, encompassing both generic object types and specific subtypes, is essential for effective AI model training in the architecture, engineering, construction, and operation (AECO) industry. Conventional encoding methods (e.g., one-hot) often fail to convey the nuanced relationships among closely related subtypes, limiting AI's semantic comprehension. To address this limitation, this study proposes a novel training approach that employs large language model (LLM) embeddings (e.g., OpenAI GPT and Meta LLaMA) as encodings to preserve finer distinctions in building semantics. We evaluated the proposed method by training GraphSAGE models to classify 42 building object subtypes across five high-rise residential building information models (BIMs). Various embedding dimensions were tested, including original high-dimensional LLM embeddings (1,536, 3,072, or 4,096) and 1,024-dimensional compacted embeddings generated via the Matryoshka representation model. Experimental results demonstrated that LLM encodings outperformed the conventional one-hot baseline, with the llama-3 (compacted) embedding achieving a weighted average F1-score of 0.8766, compared to 0.8475 for one-hot encoding. The results underscore the promise of leveraging LLM-based encodings to enhance AI's ability to interpret complex, domain-specific building semantics. As the capabilities of LLMs and dimensionality reduction techniques continue to evolve, this approach holds considerable potential for broad application in semantic elaboration tasks throughout the AECO industry.

*Tengjie Zhu,Guanyu Cai,Yang Zhaohui,Guanzhu Ren,Haohui Xie,ZiRui Wang,Junsong Wu,Jingbo Wang,Xiaokang Yang,Yao Mu,Yichao Yan,Yichao Yan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CLOT is a real-time whole-body humanoid teleoperation system that achieves closed-loop global motion tracking via high-frequency localization feedback, enabling drift-free human-to-humanoid mimicry over long time horizons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon whole-body humanoid teleoperation suffers from accumulated global pose drift, especially on full-sized humanoids. Existing learning-based tracking methods operate in local frames without global pose feedback, causing drift and instability during extended execution.

Method: CLOT synchronizes operator and robot poses in closed loop with high-frequency localization feedback. Uses data-driven randomization to decouple observation trajectories from reward evaluation for smooth global corrections. Regularizes policy with adversarial motion prior to suppress unnatural behaviors. Trains transformer-based policy on 20 hours of curated human motion data for over 1300 GPU hours.

Result: System deployed on full-sized humanoid with 31 DoF. Both simulation and real-world experiments verify high-dynamic motion, high-precision tracking, and strong robustness in sim-to-real humanoid teleoperation.

Conclusion: CLOT enables drift-free, stable whole-body humanoid teleoperation over long time horizons through closed-loop global motion tracking, addressing a key limitation in current humanoid teleoperation systems.

Abstract: Long-horizon whole-body humanoid teleoperation remains challenging due to accumulated global pose drift, particularly on full-sized humanoids. Although recent learning-based tracking methods enable agile and coordinated motions, they typically operate in the robot's local frame and neglect global pose feedback, leading to drift and instability during extended execution. In this work, we present CLOT, a real-time whole-body humanoid teleoperation system that achieves closed-loop global motion tracking via high-frequency localization feedback. CLOT synchronizes operator and robot poses in a closed loop, enabling drift-free human-to-humanoid mimicry over long timehorizons. However, directly imposing global tracking rewards in reinforcement learning, often results in aggressive and brittle corrections. To address this, we propose a data-driven randomization strategy that decouples observation trajectories from reward evaluation, enabling smooth and stable global corrections. We further regularize the policy with an adversarial motion prior to suppress unnatural behaviors. To support CLOT, we collect 20 hours of carefully curated human motion data for training the humanoid teleoperation policy. We design a transformer-based policy and train it for over 1300 GPU hours. The policy is deployed on a full-sized humanoid with 31 DoF (excluding hands). Both simulation and real-world experiments verify high-dynamic motion, high-precision tracking, and strong robustness in sim-to-real humanoid teleoperation. Motion data, demos and code can be found in our website.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Safe-SDL framework addresses safety gaps in Self-Driving Labs through formal boundaries, real-time monitoring, and transactional protocols to ensure AI-driven autonomous experiments operate safely.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-Driving Laboratories (SDLs) accelerate research but introduce unique safety challenges not present in traditional labs or purely digital AI systems, particularly the "Syntax-to-Safety Gap" where AI-generated commands may be syntactically correct but physically unsafe.

Method: Three-component framework: (1) Operational Design Domains (ODDs) with mathematically verified boundaries, (2) Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for real-time safety monitoring, and (3) Transactional Safety Protocol (CRUTD) ensuring atomic consistency between digital planning and physical execution.

Result: Evaluation shows current foundation models have significant safety failures, demonstrating that architectural safety mechanisms are essential. The framework provides both theoretical foundations and practical guidance for safe SDL deployment.

Conclusion: Safe-SDL establishes groundwork for responsible acceleration of AI-driven scientific discovery by addressing critical safety gaps in autonomous laboratories through formal verification, real-time monitoring, and transactional protocols.

Abstract: The emergence of Self-Driving Laboratories (SDLs) transforms scientific discovery methodology by integrating AI with robotic automation to create closed-loop experimental systems capable of autonomous hypothesis generation, experimentation, and analysis. While promising to compress research timelines from years to weeks, their deployment introduces unprecedented safety challenges differing from traditional laboratories or purely digital AI. This paper presents Safe-SDL, a comprehensive framework for establishing robust safety boundaries and control mechanisms in AI-driven autonomous laboratories. We identify and analyze the critical ``Syntax-to-Safety Gap'' -- the disconnect between AI-generated syntactically correct commands and their physical safety implications -- as the central challenge in SDL deployment. Our framework addresses this gap through three synergistic components: (1) formally defined Operational Design Domains (ODDs) that constrain system behavior within mathematically verified boundaries, (2) Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) that provide real-time safety guarantees through continuous state-space monitoring, and (3) a novel Transactional Safety Protocol (CRUTD) that ensures atomic consistency between digital planning and physical execution. We ground our theoretical contributions through analysis of existing implementations including UniLabOS and the Osprey architecture, demonstrating how these systems instantiate key safety principles. Evaluation against the LabSafety Bench reveals that current foundation models exhibit significant safety failures, demonstrating that architectural safety mechanisms are essential rather than optional. Our framework provides both theoretical foundations and practical implementation guidance for safe deployment of autonomous scientific systems, establishing the groundwork for responsible acceleration of AI-driven discovery.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Systematic review of 86 papers shows LLMs are transforming human-robot interaction fundamentals but current research remains exploratory with fragmented approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs show technical potential in HRI, there's a lack of systematic examination of their human-centered impact and emerging challenges, making it difficult to consolidate research in LLM-driven HRI systems.

Method: Conducted systematic literature search following PRISMA guidelines, identifying 86 articles meeting inclusion criteria for comprehensive analysis.

Result: LLMs transform HRI fundamentals by reshaping robot context sensing, socially grounded interactions, and continuous human needs alignment. Current research is largely exploratory with fragmented approaches across different facets, leading to wide-ranging experimental setups, methods, and evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: Identified key design considerations and challenges, offering coherent overview and guidelines for future research at the intersection of LLMs and HRI.

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) are profoundly reshaping the field of human-robot interaction (HRI). While prior work has highlighted the technical potential of LLMs, few studies have systematically examined their human-centered impact (e.g., human-oriented understanding, user modeling, and levels of autonomy), making it difficult to consolidate emerging challenges in LLM-driven HRI systems. Therefore, we conducted a systematic literature search following the PRISMA guideline, identifying 86 articles that met our inclusion criteria. Our findings reveal that: (1) LLMs are transforming the fundamentals of HRI by reshaping how robots sense context, generate socially grounded interactions, and maintain continuous alignment with human needs in embodied settings; and (2) current research is largely exploratory, with different studies focusing on different facets of LLM-driven HRI, resulting in wide-ranging choices of experimental setups, study methods, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we identify key design considerations and challenges, offering a coherent overview and guidelines for future research at the intersection of LLMs and HRI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supernumerary robotic limbs have usability limitations due to safety and control challenges, particularly maintaining balance in human-SL systems as a prerequisite for safe augmentation tasks.

Method: Three-layer hierarchical architecture: (1) prediction layer estimates human trunk and center of mass dynamics, (2) planning layer generates optimal CoM trajectories to counteract trunk movements and computes SL control inputs, (3) control layer executes inputs on SL hardware.

Result: Evaluation with ten participants performing forward and lateral bending tasks showed clear reduction in stance instability, demonstrating framework effectiveness in enhancing balance.

Conclusion: The work provides a general framework for preserving balance with SLs designed for generic use, paving the way toward safe and versatile human-SL interactions.

Abstract: Supernumerary robotic limbs (SLs) have the potential to transform a wide range of human activities, yet their usability remains limited by key technical challenges, particularly in ensuring safety and achieving versatile control. Here, we address the critical problem of maintaining balance in the human-SLs system, a prerequisite for safe and comfortable augmentation tasks. Unlike previous approaches that developed SLs specifically for stability support, we propose a general framework for preserving balance with SLs designed for generic use. Our hierarchical three-layer architecture consists of: (i) a prediction layer that estimates human trunk and center of mass (CoM) dynamics, (ii) a planning layer that generates optimal CoM trajectories to counteract trunk movements and computes the corresponding SL control inputs, and (iii) a control layer that executes these inputs on the SL hardware. We evaluated the framework with ten participants performing forward and lateral bending tasks. The results show a clear reduction in stance instability, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in enhancing balance. This work paves the path towards safe and versatile human-SLs interactions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A benchmarking framework for evaluating mobile robot controllers in greenhouse environments with standardized metrics and realistic disturbance scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile robots in agroindustrial environments face challenging conditions (uneven terrain, variable friction, payload changes, slopes) that affect control performance. Lack of standardized, reproducible benchmarks impedes fair comparisons and systematic evaluation of control strategies under realistic operating conditions.

Method: Comprehensive framework integrating: 1) accurate 3D environment model, 2) physics-based simulator, 3) hierarchical control architecture (low, mid, high level), 4) three benchmark categories for modular assessment, 5) three disturbance scenarios (payload variation, terrain type, slope), 6) standardized performance metrics (SAE, SCI, composite indices), 7) statistical analysis with repeated trials, 8) plugin-based architecture for user-defined controllers.

Result: The framework provides a robust and extensible tool for quantitative comparison of classical, predictive, and planning-based control strategies in realistic conditions, enabling objective and reproducible evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark bridges the gap between simulation-based analysis and real-world agroindustrial applications, facilitating systematic evaluation and fair comparison of mobile robot control strategies in challenging greenhouse environments.

Abstract: Mobile robots operating in agroindustrial environments, such as Mediterranean greenhouses, are subject to challenging conditions, including uneven terrain, variable friction, payload changes, and terrain slopes, all of which significantly affect control performance and stability. Despite the increasing adoption of robotic platforms in agriculture, the lack of standardized, reproducible benchmarks impedes fair comparisons and systematic evaluations of control strategies under realistic operating conditions. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmarking framework for evaluating mobile robot controllers in greenhouse environments. The proposed framework integrates an accurate three dimensional model of the environment, a physics based simulator, and a hierarchical control architecture comprising low, mid, and high level control layers. Three benchmark categories are defined to enable modular assessment, ranging from actuator level control to full autonomous navigation. Additionally, three disturbance scenarios payload variation, terrain type, and slope are explicitly modeled to replicate real world agricultural conditions. To ensure objective and reproducible evaluation, standardized performance metrics are introduced, including the Squared Absolute Error (SAE), the Squared Control Input (SCI), and composite performance indices. Statistical analysis based on repeated trials is employed to mitigate the influence of sensor noise and environmental variability. The framework is further enhanced by a plugin based architecture that facilitates seamless integration of user defined controllers and planners. The proposed benchmark provides a robust and extensible tool for the quantitative comparison of classical, predictive, and planning based control strategies in realistic conditions, bridging the gap between simulation based analysis and real world agroindustrial applications.

### [77] [DexEvolve: Evolutionary Optimization for Robust and Diverse Dexterous Grasp Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15201)
*René Zurbrügg,Andrei Cramariuc,Marco Hutter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Scalable generate-and-refine pipeline for synthesizing diverse, physically feasible grasps using evolutionary optimization in high-fidelity simulators, then distilling into diffusion models for real-world deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-driven grasp prediction requires costly datasets limited to specific grippers, while analytical methods produce infeasible grasps that need filtering, reducing diversity and scalability.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Generate seed grasps analytically, 2) Refine in high-fidelity simulator (Isaac Sim) using asynchronous evolutionary algorithm, then distill refined distribution into diffusion model.

Result: Achieves 120+ distinct stable grasps per object (1.7-6x improvement over unrefined methods) and outperforms diffusion-based alternatives by 46-60% in unique grasp coverage.

Conclusion: Evolutionary refinement in simulators enables scalable synthesis of diverse, physically feasible grasps that can be distilled for robust real-world deployment, highlighting the importance of diversity.

Abstract: Dexterous grasping is fundamental to robotics, yet data-driven grasp prediction heavily relies on large, diverse datasets that are costly to generate and typically limited to a narrow set of gripper morphologies. Analytical grasp synthesis can be used to scale data collection, but necessary simplifying assumptions often yield physically infeasible grasps that need to be filtered in high-fidelity simulators, significantly reducing the total number of grasps and their diversity.
  We propose a scalable generate-and-refine pipeline for synthesizing large-scale, diverse, and physically feasible grasps. Instead of using high-fidelity simulators solely for verification and filtering, we leverage them as an optimization stage that continuously improves grasp quality without discarding precomputed candidates. More specifically, we initialize an evolutionary search with a seed set of analytically generated, potentially suboptimal grasps. We then refine these proposals directly in a high-fidelity simulator (Isaac Sim) using an asynchronous, gradient-free evolutionary algorithm, improving stability while maintaining diversity. In addition, this refinement stage can be guided toward human preferences and/or domain-specific quality metrics without requiring a differentiable objective. We further distill the refined grasp distribution into a diffusion model for robust real-world deployment, and highlight the role of diversity for both effective training and during deployment. Experiments on a newly introduced Handles dataset and a DexGraspNet subset demonstrate that our approach achieves over 120 distinct stable grasps per object (a 1.7-6x improvement over unrefined analytical methods) while outperforming diffusion-based alternatives by 46-60\% in unique grasp coverage.

TL;DR: Computer vision semantic communication reduces data needs by 50% for remote vehicle operation, enabling <200ms latency on constrained 4G/5G networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote operation of automated vehicles requires reliable high-throughput networks, but real-world deployments on public infrastructure often face data rate limitations and connectivity issues.

Method: Uses computer vision assisted semantic communication that encodes road user segmentations as color-coded highlights within low-resolution greyscale imagery, reducing required data rates compared to conventional compression.

Result: Achieves 50% data rate reduction while maintaining visual clarity, enables median glass-to-glass latency below 200ms even with network data rates below 500kbit/s, and clearly outlines salient road users for remote operator situational awareness.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates that large-scale deployment of remotely operated automated vehicles is feasible on constrained public 4G/5G mobile networks, potentially expediting nationwide automated vehicle rollout.

Abstract: Remote Operation is touted as being key to the rapid deployment of automated vehicles. Streaming imagery to control connected vehicles remotely currently requires a reliable, high throughput network connection, which can be limited in real-world remote operation deployments relying on public network infrastructure. This paper investigates how the application of computer vision assisted semantic communication can be used to circumvent data loss and corruption associated with traditional image compression techniques. By encoding the segmentations of detected road users into colour coded highlights within low resolution greyscale imagery, the required data rate can be reduced by 50 \% compared with conventional techniques, while maintaining visual clarity. This enables a median glass-to-glass latency of below 200ms even when the network data rate is below 500kbit/s, while clearly outlining salient road users to enhance situational awareness of the remote operator. The approach is demonstrated in an area of variable 4G mobile connectivity using an automated last-mile delivery vehicle. With this technique, the results indicate that large-scale deployment of remotely operated automated vehicles could be possible even on the often constrained public 4G/5G mobile network, providing the potential to expedite the nationwide roll-out of automated vehicles.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OSCAR is an ovipositor-inspired self-propelling capsule robot for colonoscopy that uses phase-shifted slider motion to create controlled friction anisotropy for net forward thrust, achieving 0.85N traction force and 3.08mm/s speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-propelling robotic capsules can eliminate shaft looping and reduce patient discomfort in colonoscopy, but reliably moving within the slippery, viscoelastic colon environment remains challenging. Current propulsion methods struggle with this difficult environment.

Method: OSCAR translates parasitic wasp ovipositor transport strategy into propulsion using a spring-loaded cam system that drives twelve circumferential sliders in coordinated, phase-shifted sequence. By tuning motion profile to maximize retract phase relative to advance phase, it creates controlled friction anisotropy. An analytical model using Kelvin-Voigt formulation captures viscoelastic stick-slip interactions.

Result: Force characterization in ex-vivo porcine colon showed mean steady-state traction force of 0.85N, matching the model. Thrust generation is speed-independent and scales linearly with phase asymmetry. OSCAR achieved average speed of 3.08 mm/s, sufficient to match conventional colonoscopy cecal intubation times.

Conclusion: By coupling phase-encoded friction anisotropy with a predictive model, OSCAR delivers controllable thrust generation at low normal loads, enabling safer and more robust self-propelling locomotion for robotic capsule colonoscopy.

Abstract: Self-propelling robotic capsules eliminate shaft looping of conventional colonoscopy, reducing patient discomfort. However, reliably moving within the slippery, viscoelastic environment of the colon remains a significant challenge. We present OSCAR, an ovipositor-inspired self-propelling capsule robot that translates the transport strategy of parasitic wasps into a propulsion mechanism for colonoscopy. OSCAR mechanically encodes the ovipositor-inspired motion pattern through a spring-loaded cam system that drives twelve circumferential sliders in a coordinated, phase-shifted sequence. By tuning the motion profile to maximize the retract phase relative to the advance phase, the capsule creates a controlled friction anisotropy at the interface that generates net forward thrust. We developed an analytical model incorporating a Kelvin-Voigt formulation to capture the viscoelastic stick--slip interactions between the sliders and the tissue, linking the asymmetry between advance and retract phase durations to mean thrust, and slider-reversal synchronization to thrust stability. Comprehensive force characterization experiments in ex-vivo porcine colon revealed a mean steady-state traction force of 0.85 N, closely matching the model. Furthermore, experiments confirmed that thrust generation is speed-independent and scales linearly with the phase asymmetry, in agreement with theoretical predictions, underscoring the capsule's predictable performance and scalability. In locomotion validation experiments, OSCAR demonstrated robust performance, achieving an average speed of 3.08 mm/s, a velocity sufficient to match the cecal intubation times of conventional colonoscopy. By coupling phase-encoded friction anisotropy with a predictive model, OSCAR delivers controllable thrust generation at low normal loads, enabling safer and more robust self-propelling locomotion for robotic capsule colonoscopy.

*Kei Takahashi,Hikaru Sasaki,Takamitsu Matsubara*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FABCO improves imitation learning by integrating feasibility estimation with behavior cloning from observation, using robot dynamics to assess motion reproducibility and providing multimodal feedback to demonstrators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation learning from human demonstrations faces limitations due to physical differences between humans and robots: demonstration data lacks robot actions, and human motions may be infeasible for robots to execute.

Method: FABCO combines behavior cloning from observation (which uses robot dynamics models to complement missing robot actions) with feasibility estimation. It learns robot dynamics from execution data, evaluates demonstration feasibility, provides multimodal visual/haptic feedback to demonstrators, and uses feasibility-aware policy learning to reduce influence of infeasible motions.

Result: Experiments with 15 participants on two tasks showed FABCO improves imitation learning performance by more than 3.2 times compared to cases without feasibility feedback.

Conclusion: FABCO successfully addresses the limitations of imitation learning from human demonstrations by integrating feasibility estimation and feedback, enabling learning of robust policies that robots can execute stably.

Abstract: Imitation learning frameworks that learn robot control policies from demonstrators' motions via hand-mounted demonstration interfaces have attracted increasing attention. However, due to differences in physical characteristics between demonstrators and robots, this approach faces two limitations: i) the demonstration data do not include robot actions, and ii) the demonstrated motions may be infeasible for robots. These limitations make policy learning difficult. To address them, we propose Feasibility-Aware Behavior Cloning from Observation (FABCO). FABCO integrates behavior cloning from observation, which complements robot actions using robot dynamics models, with feasibility estimation. In feasibility estimation, the demonstrated motions are evaluated using a robot-dynamics model, learned from the robot's execution data, to assess reproducibility under the robot's dynamics. The estimated feasibility is used for multimodal feedback and feasibility-aware policy learning to improve the demonstrator's motions and learn robust policies. Multimodal feedback provides feasibility through the demonstrator's visual and haptic senses to promote feasible demonstrated motions. Feasibility-aware policy learning reduces the influence of demonstrated motions that are infeasible for robots, enabling the learning of policies that robots can execute stably. We conducted experiments with 15 participants on two tasks and confirmed that FABCO improves imitation learning performance by more than 3.2 times compared to the case without feasibility feedback.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Magnetic actuation offers advantages for surgical robots but faces clinical deployment challenges due to poor fluoroscopic imaging feedback (low frame rate, noisy pose data).

Method: Combines nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) with analytically differentiable magnetic field model using Zernike polynomials and Kalman filter for state estimation.

Result: Method maintains high accuracy with feedback downsampled to 3 Hz and added Gaussian noise (σ=2mm); achieves 1.18 mm RMS error in spine phantom drug delivery while maintaining safe clearance.

Conclusion: The proposed control framework enables accurate and stable magnetic robot operation under clinical fluoroscopic imaging conditions, facilitating clinical deployment of magnetic surgical robots.

Abstract: Magnetic actuation enables surgical robots to navigate complex anatomical pathways while reducing tissue trauma and improving surgical precision. However, clinical deployment is limited by the challenges of controlling such systems under fluoroscopic imaging, which provides low frame rate and noisy pose feedback. This paper presents a control framework that remains accurate and stable under such conditions by combining a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework that directly outputs coil currents, an analytically differentiable magnetic field model based on Zernike polynomials, and a Kalman filter to estimate the robot state. Experimental validation is conducted with two magnetic robots in a 3D-printed fluid workspace and a spine phantom replicating drug delivery in the epidural space. Results show the proposed control method remains highly accurate when feedback is downsampled to 3 Hz with added Gaussian noise (sigma = 2 mm), mimicking clinical fluoroscopy. In the spine phantom experiments, the proposed method successfully executed a drug delivery trajectory with a root mean square (RMS) position error of 1.18 mm while maintaining safe clearance from critical anatomical boundaries.

TL;DR: ActionCodec: A new action tokenizer design for Vision-Language-Action models based on information-theoretic principles that improves training efficiency and performance without robotics pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current action tokenization in VLA models focuses only on reconstruction fidelity, ignoring its direct impact on VLA optimization. The fundamental question of what makes good action tokenizers remains unanswered, creating a gap in understanding how tokenization affects model performance.

Method: Establishes design principles from VLA optimization perspective using information-theoretic insights: maximized temporal token overlap, minimized vocabulary redundancy, enhanced multimodal mutual information, and token independence. Introduces ActionCodec, a high-performance action tokenizer implementing these principles.

Result: ActionCodec significantly enhances training efficiency and VLA performance across simulation and real-world benchmarks. On LIBERO, SmolVLM2-2.2B fine-tuned with ActionCodec achieves 95.5% success rate without robotics pre-training, reaching 97.4% with architectural enhancements - new SOTA for VLA models without robotics pre-training.

Conclusion: The paper establishes clear design principles for action tokenizers from VLA optimization perspective and provides ActionCodec as a practical implementation. These principles offer a roadmap for developing more effective action tokenizers in the VLA community.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leveraging the native autoregressive paradigm of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated superior instruction-following and training efficiency. Central to this paradigm is action tokenization, yet its design has primarily focused on reconstruction fidelity, failing to address its direct impact on VLA optimization. Consequently, the fundamental question of \textit{what makes for good action tokenizers} remains unanswered. In this paper, we bridge this gap by establishing design principles specifically from the perspective of VLA optimization. We identify a set of best practices based on information-theoretic insights, including maximized temporal token overlap, minimized vocabulary redundancy, enhanced multimodal mutual information, and token independence. Guided by these principles, we introduce \textbf{ActionCodec}, a high-performance action tokenizer that significantly enhances both training efficiency and VLA performance across diverse simulation and real-world benchmarks. Notably, on LIBERO, a SmolVLM2-2.2B fine-tuned with ActionCodec achieves a 95.5\% success rate without any robotics pre-training. With advanced architectural enhancements, this reaches 97.4\%, representing a new SOTA for VLA models without robotics pre-training. We believe our established design principles, alongside the released model, will provide a clear roadmap for the community to develop more effective action tokenizers.

Motivation: Current MLLM-based navigation agents suffer from tightly coupled designs that limit performance, and rely on oversimplified textual maps that lack rich spatial information needed for effective navigation.

Method: Proposes decoupled design separating low-level spatial state estimation from high-level semantic planning. Introduces interactive metric world representation that maintains rich, consistent spatial information for MLLM reasoning. Uses counterfactual reasoning to elicit MLLM capabilities while ensuring physical validity through metric representation.

Conclusion: The decoupled framework with interactive metric world representation serves as a robust, domain-invariant interface for embodied Vision-and-Language navigation, enabling effective zero-shot performance and real-world deployment across different robot platforms.

Abstract: A navigable agent needs to understand both high-level semantic instructions and precise spatial perceptions. Building navigation agents centered on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrates a promising solution due to their powerful generalization ability. However, the current tightly coupled design dramatically limits system performance. In this work, we propose a decoupled design that separates low-level spatial state estimation from high-level semantic planning. Unlike previous methods that rely on predefined, oversimplified textual maps, we introduce an interactive metric world representation that maintains rich and consistent information, allowing MLLMs to interact with and reason on it for decision-making. Furthermore, counterfactual reasoning is introduced to further elicit MLLMs' capacity, while the metric world representation ensures the physical validity of the produced actions. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments. Our method establishes a new zero-shot state-of-the-art, achieving 48.8\% Success Rate (SR) in R2R-CE and 42.2\% in RxR-CE benchmarks. Furthermore, to validate the versatility of our metric representation, we demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer across diverse embodiments, including a wheeled TurtleBot 4 and a custom-built aerial drone. These real-world deployments verify that our decoupled framework serves as a robust, domain-invariant interface for embodied Vision-and-Language navigation.

TL;DR: A memory framework for embodied AI that separates episodic and semantic memory, using retrieval-first reasoning to improve exploration and question answering without rigid geometric alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current memory methods for multimodal LLMs in embodied agents rely on textual summaries that lose visual/spatial details and struggle in non-stationary environments, especially with long observations and limited context.

Method: Non-parametric memory framework with explicit episodic/semantic memory separation. Uses retrieval-first reasoning: recall episodic experiences via semantic similarity, verify through visual reasoning. Includes program-style rule extraction to convert experiences into structured semantic memory.

Result: State-of-the-art performance: 7.3% gain in LLM-Match and 11.4% gain in LLM MatchXSPL on A-EQA; +7.7% success rate and +6.8% SPL on GOAT-Bench. Episodic memory improves exploration efficiency, semantic memory enhances complex reasoning.

Conclusion: The disentangled episodic-semantic memory framework enables robust reuse of past observations without geometric alignment, improving both exploration and reasoning for embodied agents through complementary memory systems.

Abstract: Deploying Multimodal Large Language Models as the brain of embodied agents remains challenging, particularly under long-horizon observations and limited context budgets. Existing memory assisted methods often rely on textual summaries, which discard rich visual and spatial details and remain brittle in non-stationary environments. In this work, we propose a non-parametric memory framework that explicitly disentangles episodic and semantic memory for embodied exploration and question answering. Our retrieval-first, reasoning-assisted paradigm recalls episodic experiences via semantic similarity and verifies them through visual reasoning, enabling robust reuse of past observations without rigid geometric alignment. In parallel, we introduce a program-style rule extraction mechanism that converts experiences into structured, reusable semantic memory, facilitating cross-environment generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on embodied question answering and exploration benchmarks, yielding a 7.3% gain in LLM-Match and an 11.4% gain in LLM MatchXSPL on A-EQA, as well as +7.7% success rate and +6.8% SPL on GOAT-Bench. Analyses reveal that our episodic memory primarily improves exploration efficiency, while semantic memory strengthens complex reasoning of embodied agents.

Conclusion: The proposed initialization scheme enables effective cross-embodiment knowledge transfer in reinforcement learning for multirotor control, significantly reducing training time while maintaining high performance, paving the way for more efficient robot policy training.

Abstract: Efficiently training control policies for robots is a major challenge that can greatly benefit from utilizing knowledge gained from training similar systems through cross-embodiment knowledge transfer. In this work, we focus on accelerating policy training using a library-based initialization scheme that enables effective knowledge transfer across multirotor configurations. By leveraging a physics-aware neural control architecture that combines a reinforcement learning-based controller and a supervised control allocation network, we enable the reuse of previously trained policies. To this end, we utilize a policy evaluation-based similarity measure that identifies suitable policies for initialization from a library. We demonstrate that this measure correlates with the reduction in environment interactions needed to reach target performance and is therefore suited for initialization. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments confirm that our control architecture achieves state-of-the-art control performance, and that our initialization scheme saves on average up to $73.5\%$ of environment interactions (compared to training a policy from scratch) across diverse quadrotor and hexarotor designs, paving the way for efficient cross-embodiment transfer in reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: Dynamic information fusion is effective and practical for resource-constrained, real-time robot control environments, validating the approach's ability to balance computational efficiency with robust performance through adaptive visual input processing.

Abstract: In robotics, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models that integrate diverse multimodal signals from multi-view inputs have emerged as an effective approach. However, most prior work adopts static fusion that processes all visual inputs uniformly, which incurs unnecessary computational overhead and allows task-irrelevant background information to act as noise. Inspired by the principles of human active perception, we propose a dynamic information fusion framework designed to maximize the efficiency and robustness of VLA models. Our approach introduces a lightweight adaptive routing architecture that analyzes the current text prompt and observations from a wrist-mounted camera in real-time to predict the task-relevance of multiple camera views. By conditionally attenuating computations for views with low informational utility and selectively providing only essential visual features to the policy network, Our framework achieves computation efficiency proportional to task relevance. Furthermore, to efficiently secure large-scale annotation data for router training, we established an automated labeling pipeline utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to minimize data collection and annotation costs. Experimental results in real-world robotic manipulation scenarios demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant improvements in both inference efficiency and control performance compared to existing VLA models, validating the effectiveness and practicality of dynamic information fusion in resource-constrained, real-time robot control environments.

TL;DR: VLM-DEWM is a cognitive architecture that separates VLM reasoning from world-state management using a persistent Dynamic External World Model to address stateless operation and opaque reasoning in smart manufacturing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models show promise for high-level planning in smart manufacturing but face two critical challenges: (1) stateless operation that cannot persistently track out-of-view states, causing world-state drift, and (2) opaque reasoning where failures are difficult to diagnose, leading to costly blind retries.

Method: VLM-DEWM decouples VLM reasoning from world-state management through a persistent, queryable Dynamic External World Model (DEWM). Each VLM decision is structured into an Externalizable Reasoning Trace (ERT) comprising action proposal, world belief, and causal assumption, which is validated against DEWM before execution. When failures occur, discrepancy analysis between predicted and observed states enables targeted recovery instead of global replanning.

Result: Compared to baseline memory-augmented VLM systems, VLM-DEWM improves state-tracking accuracy from 56% to 93%, increases recovery success rate from below 5% to 95%, and significantly reduces computational overhead through structured memory. Evaluated on multi-station assembly, large-scale facility exploration, and real-robot recovery under induced failures.

Conclusion: VLM-DEWM establishes a verifiable and resilient solution for long-horizon robotic operations in dynamic manufacturing environments by addressing the fundamental limitations of stateless operation and opaque reasoning in current VLM systems.

TL;DR: CASF enhances streaming flow policies with real-time constraint adaptation using differentiable distance functions and local metrics to reshape velocity fields for safety while preserving multi-modal reactivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing streaming flow policies lack mechanisms for adapting trajectories post-training to enforce safety and task-specific constraints like joint limits, collision avoidance, and workspace boundaries.

Method: Augments streaming flow policies with constraint-dependent metrics that reshape learned velocity fields during execution. Models constraints as differentiable distance functions converted to local metrics and pulled back into control space, smoothly attenuating/redirecting motion near boundaries.

Result: Demonstrated in simulated and real-world manipulation tasks, producing constraint-satisfying trajectories that remain smooth, feasible, and dynamically consistent, outperforming standard post-hoc projection baselines.

Conclusion: CASF enables real-time adaptation of robot trajectories to enforce constraints while preserving the multi-modal and reactive properties of streaming flow policies, providing a flexible framework for safe robot control.

Abstract: Robot motion distributions often exhibit multi-modality and require flexible generative models for accurate representation. Streaming Flow Policies (SFPs) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for generating robot trajectories by integrating learned velocity fields directly in action space, enabling smooth and reactive control. However, existing formulations lack mechanisms for adapting trajectories post-training to enforce safety and task-specific constraints. We propose Constraint-Aware Streaming Flow (CASF), a framework that augments streaming flow policies with constraint-dependent metrics that reshape the learned velocity field during execution. CASF models each constraint, defined in either the robot's workspace or configuration space, as a differentiable distance function that is converted into a local metric and pulled back into the robot's control space. Far from restricted regions, the resulting metric reduces to the identity; near constraint boundaries, it smoothly attenuates or redirects motion, effectively deforming the underlying flow to maintain safety. This allows trajectories to be adapted in real time, ensuring that robot actions respect joint limits, avoid collisions, and remain within feasible workspaces, while preserving the multi-modal and reactive properties of streaming flow policies. We demonstrate CASF in simulated and real-world manipulation tasks, showing that it produces constraint-satisfying trajectories that remain smooth, feasible, and dynamically consistent, outperforming standard post-hoc projection baselines.

Motivation: Friction is essential for locomotion but typically treated as a passive, fixed property in robotics. The researchers wanted to develop an active friction control mechanism to improve robotic locomotion efficiency and reduce design complexity.

Method: Used ultrasonic lubrication by exciting resonant structures at ultrasonic frequencies to dynamically switch contact interfaces between "grip" and "slip" states. Developed two friction control modules (cylindrical for lumen-like environments and flat-plate for external surfaces) and integrated them into bio-inspired systems modeled after inchworm and wasp ovipositor locomotion.

Result: Both systems achieved bidirectional locomotion with nearly perfect efficiencies exceeding 90%. Friction characterization showed substantial friction reduction across rigid, soft, granular, and biological tissue interfaces under various conditions (dry/wet, different roughness levels).

Conclusion: Ultrasonic lubrication is a viable active friction control mechanism for robotic locomotion with broad applicability, potential to reduce design complexity, and improve efficiency of robotic locomotion systems.

Abstract: Friction is the essential mediator of terrestrial locomotion, yet in robotic systems it is almost always treated as a passive property fixed by surface materials and conditions. Here, we introduce ultrasonic lubrication as a method to actively control friction in robotic locomotion. By exciting resonant structures at ultrasonic frequencies, contact interfaces can dynamically switch between "grip" and "slip" states, enabling locomotion. We developed two friction control modules, a cylindrical design for lumen-like environments and a flat-plate design for external surfaces, and integrated them into bio-inspired systems modeled after inchworm and wasp ovipositor locomotion. Both systems achieved bidirectional locomotion with nearly perfect locomotion efficiencies that exceeded 90%. Friction characterization experiments further demonstrated substantial friction reduction across various surfaces, including rigid, soft, granular, and biological tissue interfaces, under dry and wet conditions, and on surfaces with different levels of roughness, confirming the broad applicability of ultrasonic lubrication to locomotion tasks. These findings establish ultrasonic lubrication as a viable active friction control mechanism for robotic locomotion, with the potential to reduce design complexity and improve efficiency of robotic locomotion systems.

Motivation: Autonomous UAV landing on marine platforms is challenging due to wave-induced oscillations, wind disturbances, and prediction phase lags. Existing methods lack explicit wave spectral modeling, leading to suboptimal performance in dynamic sea conditions.

Method: Spectral-temporal fusion predictive control framework integrating frequency-domain wave decomposition with time-domain recursive state estimation. Uses hierarchical control with sampling-based HPO-RRT* for trajectory planning and learning-augmented predictive controller with data-driven disturbance compensation.

Result: Achieves 3.2 cm prediction error, 4.46 cm landing deviation, 98.7%/87.5% success rates (simulation/real-world), 82 ms latency on embedded hardware, outperforming SOTA by 44%-48% in accuracy.

Conclusion: SpecFuse enables robust UAV landing on oscillating USVs under wave-wind coupling disturbances, supporting critical maritime missions. Framework will be open-sourced for reproducibility.

Abstract: Autonomous landing of Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) on oscillating marine platforms is severely constrained by wave-induced multi-frequency oscillations, wind disturbances, and prediction phase lags in motion prediction. Existing methods either treat platform motion as a general random process or lack explicit modeling of wave spectral characteristics, leading to suboptimal performance under dynamic sea conditions. To address these limitations, we propose SpecFuse: a novel spectral-temporal fusion predictive control framework that integrates frequency-domain wave decomposition with time-domain recursive state estimation for high-precision 6-DoF motion forecasting of Uncrewed Surface Vehicles (USVs). The framework explicitly models dominant wave harmonics to mitigate phase lags, refining predictions in real time via IMU data without relying on complex calibration. Additionally, we design a hierarchical control architecture featuring a sampling-based HPO-RRT* algorithm for dynamic trajectory planning under non-convex constraints and a learning-augmented predictive controller that fuses data-driven disturbance compensation with optimization-based execution. Extensive validations (2,000 simulations + 8 lake experiments) show our approach achieves a 3.2 cm prediction error, 4.46 cm landing deviation, 98.7% / 87.5% success rates (simulation / real-world), and 82 ms latency on embedded hardware, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 44%-48% in accuracy. Its robustness to wave-wind coupling disturbances supports critical maritime missions such as search and rescue and environmental monitoring. All code, experimental configurations, and datasets will be released as open-source to facilitate reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional raceline optimization treats tracking errors as disturbances rather than informative signals. The paper aims to exploit these errors to adapt trajectories to local track characteristics and varying friction conditions without explicit friction parameterization.

Method: Combines NURBS-based trajectory representation with CMA-ES global optimization and controller-guided spatial feedback using a Kalman-inspired spatial update. Creates adaptive acceleration-based constraint maps that iteratively refine trajectories based on spatial feedback.

Result: Simulation: 17.38% lap time reduction vs. controller with maximum static acceleration. Real hardware: 7.60% lap time improvement across different tire compounds (high to low friction) without explicit friction parameterization.

Conclusion: The closed-loop framework demonstrates effective raceline optimization by treating tracking errors as informative spatial feedback, enabling robust performance across varying friction conditions and achieving significant real-world lap time improvements.

Abstract: We present a closed-loop framework for autonomous raceline optimization that combines NURBS-based trajectory representation, CMA-ES global trajectory optimization, and controller-guided spatial feedback. Instead of treating tracking errors as transient disturbances, our method exploits them as informative signals of local track characteristics via a Kalman-inspired spatial update. This enables the construction of an adaptive, acceleration-based constraint map that iteratively refines trajectories toward near-optimal performance under spatially varying track and vehicle behavior. In simulation, our approach achieves a 17.38% lap time reduction compared to a controller parametrized with maximum static acceleration. On real hardware, tested with different tire compounds ranging from high to low friction, we obtain a 7.60% lap time improvement without explicitly parametrizing friction. This demonstrates robustness to changing grip conditions in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: Data-driven framework using sEMG and ML/DL models (CNN, Random Forest, XGBoost, Linear Regression) to estimate muscle fatigue as continuous regression during physical human-robot interaction, achieving ~21-27% RMSE and showing cross-task generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for accurate muscle fatigue assessment in physical human-robot interaction to optimize performance and safety, enabling timely intervention and adaptive robot control.

Method: Arm-mounted sEMG with subject-specific ML regression models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Linear Regression) using frequency/time-domain features, benchmarked against CNN processing spectrograms of filtered EMG. Tested with 10 participants performing repetitive lateral motions with collaborative robot under admittance control.

Result: CNN achieved lowest error (20.8±4.3% RMSE), followed by Random Forest (23.3±3.8%), XGBoost (24.8±4.5%), and Linear Regression (26.9±6.1%). Cross-task generalization tests showed models trained on lateral data retained accuracy for unseen vertical/circular motions, except Linear Regression deteriorated.

Conclusion: Both feature-based ML and spectrogram-based DL can effectively estimate remaining work capacity during pHRI, with CNN performing best. Transfer learning to new motion patterns suggests practical fatigue monitoring without task-specific retraining, enabling safer fatigue-adaptive pHRI control.

Abstract: Assessing human muscle fatigue is critical for optimizing performance and safety in physical human-robot interaction(pHRI). This work presents a data-driven framework to estimate fatigue in dynamic, cyclic pHRI using arm-mounted surface electromyography(sEMG). Subject-specific machine-learning regression models(Random Forest, XGBoost, and Linear Regression predict the fraction of cycles to fatigue(FCF) from three frequency-domain and one time-domain EMG features, and are benchmarked against a convolutional neural network(CNN) that ingests spectrograms of filtered EMG. Framing fatigue estimation as regression (rather than classification) captures continuous progression toward fatigue, supporting earlier detection, timely intervention, and adaptive robot control. In experiments with ten participants, a collaborative robot under admittance control guided repetitive lateral (left-right) end-effector motions until muscular fatigue. Average FCF RMSE across participants was 20.8+/-4.3% for the CNN, 23.3+/-3.8% for Random Forest, 24.8+/-4.5% for XGBoost, and 26.9+/-6.1% for Linear Regression. To probe cross-task generalization, one participant additionally performed unseen vertical (up-down) and circular repetitions; models trained only on lateral data were tested directly and largely retained accuracy, indicating robustness to changes in movement direction, arm kinematics, and muscle recruitment, while Linear Regression deteriorated. Overall, the study shows that both feature-based ML and spectrogram-based DL can estimate remaining work capacity during repetitive pHRI, with the CNN delivering the lowest error and the tree-based models close behind. The reported transfer to new motion patterns suggests potential for practical fatigue monitoring without retraining for every task, improving operator protection and enabling fatigue-aware shared autonomy, for safer fatigue-adaptive pHRI control.

TL;DR: LSMART is an open-source simulator for evaluating MAPF algorithms in lifelong AGV fleet management systems, addressing real-world complexities like kinodynamics, communication delays, and execution uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MAPF/LMAPF simulators assume simplified agent models and perfect execution, while SMART only handles MAPF, not lifelong systems. Real-world AGV fleet management requires handling parallel planning/execution, varying planner assumptions, and failure recovery.

Method: Developed LSMART as an open-source simulator that incorporates three key design choices: 1) when to plan (planning timing), 2) how to plan (planner selection), and 3) how to recover from planning failures. The system evaluates any MAPF algorithm in realistic AGV fleet scenarios.

Result: Created LSMART simulator available at https://smart-mapf.github.io/lifelong-smart, with experimental results using state-of-the-art methods for each design choice, providing guidance for designing effective lifelong AGV fleet management systems.

Conclusion: LSMART enables realistic evaluation of MAPF algorithms in lifelong AGV fleet management, addressing critical design challenges and providing practical guidance for system implementation.

Abstract: We present Lifelong Scalable Multi-Agent Realistic Testbed (LSMART), an open-source simulator to evaluate any Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithm in a Fleet Management System (FMS) with Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs). MAPF aims to move a group of agents from their corresponding starting locations to their goals. Lifelong MAPF (LMAPF) is a variant of MAPF that continuously assigns new goals for agents to reach. LMAPF applications, such as autonomous warehouses, often require a centralized, lifelong system to coordinate the movement of a fleet of robots, typically AGVs. However, existing works on MAPF and LMAPF often assume simplified kinodynamic models, such as pebble motion, as well as perfect execution and communication for AGVs. Prior work has presented SMART, a software capable of evaluating any MAPF algorithms while considering agent kinodynamics, communication delays, and execution uncertainties. However, SMART is designed for MAPF, not LMAPF. Generalizing SMART to an FMS requires many more design choices. First, an FMS parallelizes planning and execution, raising the question of when to plan. Second, given planners with varying optimality and differing agent-model assumptions, one must decide how to plan. Third, when the planner fails to return valid solutions, the system must determine how to recover. In this paper, we first present LSMART, an open-source simulator that incorporates all these considerations to evaluate any MAPF algorithms in an FMS. We then provide experiment results based on state-of-the-art methods for each design choice, offering guidance on how to effectively design centralized lifelong AGV Fleet Management Systems. LSMART is available at https://smart-mapf.github.io/lifelong-smart.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MeshMimic enables humanoid robots to learn motion-terrain interactions directly from video using 3D scene reconstruction, eliminating need for expensive motion capture data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current humanoid motion control relies on expensive motion capture data that lacks geometric context of physical environments, causing physical inconsistencies like contact slippage and mesh penetration during terrain-aware tasks.

Method: Leverages 3D vision models to segment/reconstruct human trajectories and terrain geometry from video, uses kinematic consistency optimization for motion extraction, and contact-invariant retargeting to transfer human-environment interactions to robots.

Result: Achieves robust, highly dynamic performance across diverse challenging terrains using only consumer-grade monocular sensors, demonstrating scalable training of complex physical interactions.

Conclusion: Provides low-cost pipeline for autonomous evolution of humanoid robots in unstructured environments by bridging 3D scene reconstruction and embodied intelligence to learn coupled motion-terrain interactions directly from video.

Abstract: Humanoid motion control has witnessed significant breakthroughs in recent years, with deep reinforcement learning (RL) emerging as a primary catalyst for achieving complex, human-like behaviors. However, the high dimensionality and intricate dynamics of humanoid robots make manual motion design impractical, leading to a heavy reliance on expensive motion capture (MoCap) data. These datasets are not only costly to acquire but also frequently lack the necessary geometric context of the surrounding physical environment. Consequently, existing motion synthesis frameworks often suffer from a decoupling of motion and scene, resulting in physical inconsistencies such as contact slippage or mesh penetration during terrain-aware tasks. In this work, we present MeshMimic, an innovative framework that bridges 3D scene reconstruction and embodied intelligence to enable humanoid robots to learn coupled "motion-terrain" interactions directly from video. By leveraging state-of-the-art 3D vision models, our framework precisely segments and reconstructs both human trajectories and the underlying 3D geometry of terrains and objects. We introduce an optimization algorithm based on kinematic consistency to extract high-quality motion data from noisy visual reconstructions, alongside a contact-invariant retargeting method that transfers human-environment interaction features to the humanoid agent. Experimental results demonstrate that MeshMimic achieves robust, highly dynamic performance across diverse and challenging terrains. Our approach proves that a low-cost pipeline utilizing only consumer-grade monocular sensors can facilitate the training of complex physical interactions, offering a scalable path toward the autonomous evolution of humanoid robots in unstructured environments.

*Atharva S Kashyap,Ugne Aleksandra Morkute,Patricia Alves-Oliveira*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Robot-assisted feeding systems need to be designed for in-the-wild social dining contexts like restaurants, requiring multimodal interaction, social awareness, expanded roles, and adaptation to group dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robot-assisted feeding systems have only been tested in controlled environments (lab or home), leaving real-world social dining contexts unexplored. There's a need to design robots that can handle dynamic, unsupervised dining environments like restaurants while maintaining user dignity and independence.

Method: Used speculative participatory design with people with disabilities, supported by semi-structured interviews and a custom AI-based visual storyboarding tool to uncover ideal scenarios for in-the-wild social dining.

Result: Identified four key principles for in-the-wild social dining robots: 1) multimodal inputs and unobtrusive outputs, 2) contextually sensitive social behavior prioritizing the user, 3) expanded roles beyond just feeding, and 4) adaptation to other relationships at the dining table.

Conclusion: Robot-assisted feeding systems for social dining contexts should embody "white glove service" principles, with implications for designing robots that work effectively in real-world group settings beyond controlled environments.

Abstract: Robot-assisted feeding enables people with disabilities who require assistance eating to enjoy a meal independently and with dignity. However, existing systems have only been tested in-lab or in-home, leaving in-the-wild social dining contexts (e.g., restaurants) largely unexplored. Designing a robot for such contexts presents unique challenges, such as dynamic and unsupervised dining environments that a robot needs to account for and respond to. Through speculative participatory design with people with disabilities, supported by semi-structured interviews and a custom AI-based visual storyboarding tool, we uncovered ideal scenarios for in-the-wild social dining. Our key insight suggests that such systems should: embody the principles of a white glove service where the robot (1) supports multimodal inputs and unobtrusive outputs; (2) has contextually sensitive social behavior and prioritizes the user; (3) has expanded roles beyond feeding; (4) adapts to other relationships at the dining table. Our work has implications for in-the-wild and group contexts of robot-assisted feeding.

*Haochen Zhang,Nirav Savaliya,Faizan Siddiqui,Enna Sachdeva*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FAST-EQA is a framework for Embodied Question Answering that uses question-conditioned target identification, region scoring for navigation, and Chain-of-Thought reasoning over bounded visual memory to achieve fast inference and state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EQA requires combining visual understanding, exploration, and reasoning under partial observability, with challenges in confining search to relevant subspaces, maintaining compact actionable memory, and achieving fast inference for real-world deployment.

Method: FAST-EQA uses: (1) question-conditioned visual target identification, (2) scoring of global regions of interest to guide navigation, (3) Chain-of-Thought reasoning over bounded visual memory, and (4) a global exploration policy that treats narrow openings/doors as high-value frontiers.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on HMEQA and EXPRESS-Bench, competitive performance on OpenEQA and MT-HM3D, while running substantially faster than prior approaches.

Conclusion: FAST-EQA effectively focuses agent attention, improves scene coverage and answer reliability through bounded memory management and efficient exploration, making it suitable for real-world EQA deployment with fast inference requirements.

Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) combines visual scene understanding, goal-directed exploration, spatial and temporal reasoning under partial observability. A central challenge is to confine physical search to question-relevant subspaces while maintaining a compact, actionable memory of observations. Furthermore, for real-world deployment, fast inference time during exploration is crucial. We introduce FAST-EQA, a question-conditioned framework that (i) identifies likely visual targets, (ii) scores global regions of interest to guide navigation, and (iii) employs Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning over visual memory to answer confidently. FAST-EQA maintains a bounded scene memory that stores a fixed-capacity set of region-target hypotheses and updates them online, enabling robust handling of both single and multi-target questions without unbounded growth. To expand coverage efficiently, a global exploration policy treats narrow openings and doors as high-value frontiers, complementing local target seeking with minimal computation. Together, these components focus the agent's attention, improve scene coverage, and improve answer reliability while running substantially faster than prior approaches. On HMEQA and EXPRESS-Bench, FAST-EQA achieves state-of-the-art performance, while performing competitively on OpenEQA and MT-HM3D.

TL;DR: PHP enables humanoid robots to perform vision-based parkour by composing human motion skills and training perception-driven policies for autonomous obstacle navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current humanoid locomotion lacks the agility and adaptivity of dynamic human motions, especially for parkour in complex environments requiring motion expressiveness, long-horizon skill composition, and perception-driven decision-making.

Method: 1) Use motion matching to compose human skills into long-horizon kinematic trajectories; 2) Train RL expert policies for composed motions; 3) Distill into single depth-based multi-skill student policy using DAgger+RL; 4) Enable autonomous decision-making using onboard depth sensing and velocity commands.

Result: Validated on Unitree G1 robot: dynamic parkour skills including climbing 1.25m obstacles (96% robot height) and long-horizon multi-obstacle traversal with closed-loop adaptation to real-time perturbations.

Conclusion: PHP framework successfully enables humanoid robots to perform autonomous, perception-driven parkour with human-like agility and adaptivity in complex environments.

Abstract: While recent advances in humanoid locomotion have achieved stable walking on varied terrains, capturing the agility and adaptivity of highly dynamic human motions remains an open challenge. In particular, agile parkour in complex environments demands not only low-level robustness, but also human-like motion expressiveness, long-horizon skill composition, and perception-driven decision-making. In this paper, we present Perceptive Humanoid Parkour (PHP), a modular framework that enables humanoid robots to autonomously perform long-horizon, vision-based parkour across challenging obstacle courses. Our approach first leverages motion matching, formulated as nearest-neighbor search in a feature space, to compose retargeted atomic human skills into long-horizon kinematic trajectories. This framework enables the flexible composition and smooth transition of complex skill chains while preserving the elegance and fluidity of dynamic human motions. Next, we train motion-tracking reinforcement learning (RL) expert policies for these composed motions, and distill them into a single depth-based, multi-skill student policy, using a combination of DAgger and RL. Crucially, the combination of perception and skill composition enables autonomous, context-aware decision-making: using only onboard depth sensing and a discrete 2D velocity command, the robot selects and executes whether to step over, climb onto, vault or roll off obstacles of varying geometries and heights. We validate our framework with extensive real-world experiments on a Unitree G1 humanoid robot, demonstrating highly dynamic parkour skills such as climbing tall obstacles up to 1.25m (96% robot height), as well as long-horizon multi-obstacle traversal with closed-loop adaptation to real-time obstacle perturbations.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Dex4D learns task-agnostic dexterous manipulation skills in simulation that can be zero-shot transferred to real-world tasks using point track conditioning, enabling flexible recomposition for diverse manipulation without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting large-scale real-world manipulation data is expensive and difficult to scale, while simulation-based approaches require designing multiple task-specific environments and rewards, which is similarly challenging.

Method: Learn a domain-agnostic 3D point track conditioned policy ("Anypose-to-Anypose") in simulation across thousands of objects with diverse pose configurations, then zero-shot transfer to real-world tasks by prompting with desired object-centric point tracks extracted from generated videos, using online point tracking for closed-loop control.

Result: Enables zero-shot deployment for diverse dexterous manipulation tasks with consistent improvements over prior baselines, and demonstrates strong generalization to novel objects, scene layouts, backgrounds, and trajectories.

Conclusion: Dex4D provides a robust and scalable framework for learning generalist dexterous manipulation policies that can be flexibly recomposed for diverse real-world tasks without finetuning.

Abstract: Learning generalist policies capable of accomplishing a plethora of everyday tasks remains an open challenge in dexterous manipulation. In particular, collecting large-scale manipulation data via real-world teleoperation is expensive and difficult to scale. While learning in simulation provides a feasible alternative, designing multiple task-specific environments and rewards for training is similarly challenging. We propose Dex4D, a framework that instead leverages simulation for learning task-agnostic dexterous skills that can be flexibly recomposed to perform diverse real-world manipulation tasks. Specifically, Dex4D learns a domain-agnostic 3D point track conditioned policy capable of manipulating any object to any desired pose. We train this 'Anypose-to-Anypose' policy in simulation across thousands of objects with diverse pose configurations, covering a broad space of robot-object interactions that can be composed at test time. At deployment, this policy can be zero-shot transferred to real-world tasks without finetuning, simply by prompting it with desired object-centric point tracks extracted from generated videos. During execution, Dex4D uses online point tracking for closed-loop perception and control. Extensive experiments in simulation and on real robots show that our method enables zero-shot deployment for diverse dexterous manipulation tasks and yields consistent improvements over prior baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong generalization to novel objects, scene layouts, backgrounds, and trajectories, highlighting the robustness and scalability of the proposed framework.
