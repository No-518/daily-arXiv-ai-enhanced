We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using five case studies in Sudan. We show that, compared to a baseline, the automated method captures the active fires and charred areas more accurately. Our results indicate that using 8-band imagery or time series of such imagery only result in marginal gains.

*Zekai Luo,Zongze Du,Zhouhang Zhu,Hao Zhong,Muzhi Zhu,Wen Wang,Yuling Xi,Chenchen Jing,Hao Chen,Chunhua Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LivingSwap is the first video reference-guided face swapping model that uses keyframes as conditioning signals to achieve high fidelity and temporal consistency in long video sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video face swapping in film production faces challenges in achieving high fidelity and temporal consistency over long, complex sequences. The paper explores leveraging rich visual attributes from source videos to enhance both fidelity and temporal coherence, inspired by recent advances in reference-guided image editing.

Method: LivingSwap employs keyframes as conditioning signals to inject target identity, enabling flexible and controllable editing. It combines keyframe conditioning with video reference guidance to perform temporal stitching for stable identity preservation and high-fidelity reconstruction. The method addresses data scarcity by constructing a paired face-swapping dataset (Face2Face) and reversing data pairs for reliable ground-truth supervision.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results, seamlessly integrating target identity with source video's expressions, lighting, and motion while significantly reducing manual effort in production workflows.

Conclusion: LivingSwap presents an effective video reference-guided face swapping approach that achieves high fidelity and temporal consistency for long video sequences, offering practical benefits for film and entertainment production workflows.

Abstract: Video face swapping is crucial in film and entertainment production, where achieving high fidelity and temporal consistency over long and complex video sequences remains a significant challenge. Inspired by recent advances in reference-guided image editing, we explore whether rich visual attributes from source videos can be similarly leveraged to enhance both fidelity and temporal coherence in video face swapping. Building on this insight, this work presents LivingSwap, the first video reference guided face swapping model. Our approach employs keyframes as conditioning signals to inject the target identity, enabling flexible and controllable editing. By combining keyframe conditioning with video reference guidance, the model performs temporal stitching to ensure stable identity preservation and high-fidelity reconstruction across long video sequences. To address the scarcity of data for reference-guided training, we construct a paired face-swapping dataset, Face2Face, and further reverse the data pairs to ensure reliable ground-truth supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results, seamlessly integrating the target identity with the source video's expressions, lighting, and motion, while significantly reducing manual effort in production workflows.

### [4] [Restrictive Hierarchical Semantic Segmentation for Stratified Tooth Layer Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07984)
*Ryan Banks,Camila Lindoni Azevedo,Hongying Tang,Yunpeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hierarchical semantic segmentation framework improves dental anatomy segmentation by explicitly embedding anatomical structure through recurrent prediction, feature conditioning, and consistency rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hierarchy-aware segmentation methods only use weak supervision through loss functions, lacking explicit anatomical structure encoding needed for reliable dental disease staging.

Method: Recurrent level-wise prediction with restrictive output heads, top-down feature conditioning using FiLM, probabilistic composition rules, and hierarchical loss combining Dice, cross-entropy, and consistency terms.

Result: Hierarchical variants consistently improve IoU, Dice, and recall (especially for fine-grained anatomies) and produce more anatomically coherent masks, though with increased false positives (recall over precision).

Conclusion: Explicit hierarchical structuring improves both performance and clinical plausibility in dental imaging, particularly in low-data regimes.

Abstract: Accurate understanding of anatomical structures is essential for reliably staging certain dental diseases. A way of introducing this within semantic segmentation models is by utilising hierarchy-aware methodologies. However, existing hierarchy-aware segmentation methods largely encode anatomical structure through the loss functions, providing weak and indirect supervision. We introduce a general framework that embeds an explicit anatomical hierarchy into semantic segmentation by coupling a recurrent, level-wise prediction scheme with restrictive output heads and top-down feature conditioning. At each depth of the class tree, the backbone is re-run on the original image concatenated with logits from the previous level. Child class features are conditioned using Feature-wise Linear Modulation of their parent class probabilities, to modulate child feature spaces for fine grained detection. A probabilistic composition rule enforces consistency between parent and descendant classes. Hierarchical loss combines per-level class weighted Dice and cross entropy loss and a consistency term loss, ensuring parent predictions are the sum of their children. We validate our approach on our proposed dataset, TL-pano, containing 194 panoramic radiographs with dense instance and semantic segmentation annotations, of tooth layers and alveolar bone. Utilising UNet and HRNet as donor models across a 5-fold cross validation scheme, the hierarchical variants consistently increase IoU, Dice, and recall, particularly for fine-grained anatomies, and produce more anatomically coherent masks. However, hierarchical variants also demonstrated increased recall over precision, implying increased false positives. The results demonstrate that explicit hierarchical structuring improves both performance and clinical plausibility, especially in low data dental imaging regimes.

### [5] [FRIEDA: Benchmarking Multi-Step Cartographic Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08016)
*Jiyoon Pyo,Yuankun Jiao,Dongwon Jung,Zekun Li,Leeje Jang,Sofia Kirsanova,Jina Kim,Yijun Lin,Qin Liu,Junyi Xie,Hadi Askari,Nan Xu,Muhao Chen,Yao-Yi Chiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FRIEDA is a new benchmark for evaluating complex cartographic reasoning in large vision-language models, focusing on multi-step spatial reasoning across real-world maps, where current state-of-the-art models perform poorly compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current map visual question-answering (VQA) benchmarks treat maps as simple charts, failing to capture the complex spatial reasoning required for real-world cartographic interpretation involving layered symbology, spatial relations, and cross-map reasoning essential for tasks like disaster response and urban planning.

Method: FRIEDA collects real map images from various domains and geographical areas, then creates questions targeting all three categories of spatial relations from GIS literature: topological (border, equal, intersect, within), metric (distance), and directional (orientation). Questions require multi-step inference and often cross-map grounding.

Result: Even top models (Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-5-Think) achieve only 38.20% and 37.20% accuracy respectively, far below human performance of 84.87%, revealing a persistent gap in multi-step cartographic reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: FRIEDA serves as a rigorous benchmark to drive progress in spatial intelligence for LVLMs, highlighting the significant gap between current model capabilities and human-level cartographic reasoning needed for practical applications.

Abstract: Cartographic reasoning is the skill of interpreting geographic relationships by aligning legends, map scales, compass directions, map texts, and geometries across one or more map images. Although essential as a concrete cognitive capability and for critical tasks such as disaster response and urban planning, it remains largely unevaluated. Building on progress in chart and infographic understanding, recent large vision language model studies on map visual question-answering often treat maps as a special case of charts. In contrast, map VQA demands comprehension of layered symbology (e.g., symbols, geometries, and text labels) as well as spatial relations tied to orientation and distance that often span multiple maps and are not captured by chart-style evaluations. To address this gap, we introduce FRIEDA, a benchmark for testing complex open-ended cartographic reasoning in LVLMs. FRIEDA sources real map images from documents and reports in various domains and geographical areas. Following classifications in Geographic Information System (GIS) literature, FRIEDA targets all three categories of spatial relations: topological (border, equal, intersect, within), metric (distance), and directional (orientation). All questions require multi-step inference, and many require cross-map grounding and reasoning. We evaluate eleven state-of-the-art LVLMs under two settings: (1) the direct setting, where we provide the maps relevant to the question, and (2) the contextual setting, where the model may have to identify the maps relevant to the question before reasoning. Even the strongest models, Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-5-Think, achieve only 38.20% and 37.20% accuracy, respectively, far below human performance of 84.87%. These results reveal a persistent gap in multi-step cartographic reasoning, positioning FRIEDA as a rigorous benchmark to drive progress on spatial intelligence in LVLMs.

### [6] [SSplain: Sparse and Smooth Explainer for Retinopathy of Prematurity Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08038)
*Elifnur Sunger,Tales Imbiriba,Peter Campbell,Deniz Erdogmus,Stratis Ioannidis,Jennifer Dy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSplain is a novel explainer method for ROP classification from fundus images that generates pixel-wise explanations while preserving image structures through smoothness and sparsity constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing explainer methods for medical diagnosis fail to generate explanations that preserve important input image structures like smoothness and sparsity, which are crucial for clinicians to understand and trust model outputs in critical applications like Retinopathy of Prematurity diagnosis.

Method: SSplain formulates an optimization problem with combinatorial constraints to generate pixel-wise explanations that enforce smoothness and sparsity, solved using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM).

Result: SSplain outperforms commonly used explainers in post-hoc accuracy and smoothness analyses, identifies clinically relevant features consistent with domain knowledge, and generalizes well to additional publicly available datasets.

Conclusion: SSplain provides realistic, structure-preserving explanations for medical image classification that enhance clinician understanding and trust in black-box models, with demonstrated effectiveness for ROP diagnosis and potential for broader medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Neural networks are frequently used in medical diagnosis. However, due to their black-box nature, model explainers are used to help clinicians understand better and trust model outputs. This paper introduces an explainer method for classifying Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) from fundus images. Previous methods fail to generate explanations that preserve input image structures such as smoothness and sparsity. We introduce Sparse and Smooth Explainer (SSplain), a method that generates pixel-wise explanations while preserving image structures by enforcing smoothness and sparsity. This results in realistic explanations to enhance the understanding of the given black-box model. To achieve this goal, we define an optimization problem with combinatorial constraints and solve it using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Experimental results show that SSplain outperforms commonly used explainers in terms of both post-hoc accuracy and smoothness analyses. Additionally, SSplain identifies features that are consistent with domain-understandable features that clinicians consider as discriminative factors for ROP. We also show SSplain's generalization by applying it to additional publicly available datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/neu-spiral/SSplain.

*Youngjoon Jang,Liliane Momeni,Zifan Jiang,Joon Son Chung,Gül Varol,Andrew Zisserman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unified model for sign language translation and alignment using visual keypoints, sliding perceiver network, and multi-task training, achieving SOTA on BSL and strong ASL performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop a unified model for sign language understanding that performs both sign language translation (SLT) and sign-subtitle alignment (SSA) to enable practical communication, large-scale corpus construction, and educational applications.

Method: Three-component approach: (1) lightweight visual backbone using human keypoints and lip-region images for privacy preservation, (2) Sliding Perceiver mapping network to aggregate visual features into word-level embeddings, (3) multi-task scalable training strategy jointly optimizing SLT and SSA with multilingual pretraining on BSL and ASL datasets.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on BOBSL (BSL) dataset for both SLT and SSA, demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization and fine-tuned performance on How2Sign (ASL), showing scalable translation across different sign languages.

Conclusion: The unified model successfully bridges vision-text gap for sign language understanding, with multilingual pretraining enabling cross-linguistic generalization and practical applications in communication, corpus construction, and education.

Abstract: Our aim is to develop a unified model for sign language understanding, that performs sign language translation (SLT) and sign-subtitle alignment (SSA). Together, these two tasks enable the conversion of continuous signing videos into spoken language text and also the temporal alignment of signing with subtitles -- both essential for practical communication, large-scale corpus construction, and educational applications. To achieve this, our approach is built upon three components: (i) a lightweight visual backbone that captures manual and non-manual cues from human keypoints and lip-region images while preserving signer privacy; (ii) a Sliding Perceiver mapping network that aggregates consecutive visual features into word-level embeddings to bridge the vision-text gap; and (iii) a multi-task scalable training strategy that jointly optimises SLT and SSA, reinforcing both linguistic and temporal alignment. To promote cross-linguistic generalisation, we pretrain our model on large-scale sign-text corpora covering British Sign Language (BSL) and American Sign Language (ASL) from the BOBSL and YouTube-SL-25 datasets. With this multilingual pretraining and strong model design, we achieve state-of-the-art results on the challenging BOBSL (BSL) dataset for both SLT and SSA. Our model also demonstrates robust zero-shot generalisation and finetuned SLT performance on How2Sign (ASL), highlighting the potential of scalable translation across different sign languages.

*Chandler Timm C. Doloriel,Habib Ullah,Kristian Hovde Liland,Fadi Al Machot,Ngai-Man Cheung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Frequency-domain masking improves universal deepfake detection by enhancing generalization to unseen generators while maintaining performance under model pruning for sustainable AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Universal deepfake detection needs robust generalization to new/unseen generative models while minimizing computational overhead for large-scale screening in the Green AI era.

Method: Introduces frequency-domain masking as a training strategy, using random masking and geometric transformations with focus on frequency masking for superior generalization properties.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art generalization on GAN- and diffusion-generated datasets, maintains performance under significant model pruning, and offers scalable resource-conscious solution.

Conclusion: Frequency-based masking is a practical step toward sustainable and generalizable deepfake detection, balancing performance with computational efficiency.

Abstract: Universal deepfake detection aims to identify AI-generated images across a broad range of generative models, including unseen ones. This requires robust generalization to new and unseen deepfakes, which emerge frequently, while minimizing computational overhead to enable large-scale deepfake screening, a critical objective in the era of Green AI. In this work, we explore frequency-domain masking as a training strategy for deepfake detectors. Unlike traditional methods that rely heavily on spatial features or large-scale pretrained models, our approach introduces random masking and geometric transformations, with a focus on frequency masking due to its superior generalization properties. We demonstrate that frequency masking not only enhances detection accuracy across diverse generators but also maintains performance under significant model pruning, offering a scalable and resource-conscious solution. Our method achieves state-of-the-art generalization on GAN- and diffusion-generated image datasets and exhibits consistent robustness under structured pruning. These results highlight the potential of frequency-based masking as a practical step toward sustainable and generalizable deepfake detection.

### [9] [Mask to Adapt: Simple Random Masking Enables Robust Continual Test-Time Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08048)
*Chandler Timm C. Doloriel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M2A uses simple random masking with consistency and entropy losses for continual test-time adaptation, achieving strong performance without complex uncertainty or attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CTTA methods rely on calibrated uncertainty or stable attention scores with complex masking designs, but the authors question whether simple random masking can work effectively under strong corruption.

Method: M2A generates random masked views (spatial or frequency) and adapts using two objectives: mask consistency loss aligning predictions across views, and entropy minimization loss encouraging confident outputs.

Result: On CIFAR10C/CIFAR100C/ImageNetC (severity 5), M2A (Spatial) achieves 8.3%/19.8%/39.2% mean error, outperforming or matching strong CTTA baselines, while frequency masking lags behind.

Conclusion: Simple random masking with consistency and entropy objectives is sufficient for effective test-time adaptation without relying on uncertainty or attention signals.

Abstract: Distribution shifts at test time degrade image classifiers. Recent continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods use masking to regulate learning, but often depend on calibrated uncertainty or stable attention scores and introduce added complexity. We ask: do we need custom-made masking designs, or can a simple random masking schedule suffice under strong corruption? We introduce Mask to Adapt (M2A), a simple CTTA approach that generates a short sequence of masked views (spatial or frequency) and adapts with two objectives: a mask consistency loss that aligns predictions across different views and an entropy minimization loss that encourages confident outputs. Motivated by masked image modeling, we study two common masking families -- spatial masking and frequency masking -- and further compare subtypes within each (spatial: patch vs.\ pixel; frequency: all vs.\ low vs.\ high). On CIFAR10C/CIFAR100C/ImageNetC (severity~5), M2A (Spatial) attains 8.3\%/19.8\%/39.2\% mean error, outperforming or matching strong CTTA baselines, while M2A (Frequency) lags behind. Ablations further show that simple random masking is effective and robust. These results indicate that a simple random masking schedule, coupled with consistency and entropy objectives, is sufficient to drive effective test-time adaptation without relying on uncertainty or attention signals.

### [10] [Identification of Deforestation Areas in the Amazon Rainforest Using Change Detection Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08075)
*Christian Massao Konishi,Helio Pedrini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Evaluation of change detection models for Amazon deforestation monitoring using PRODES data, incorporating modern architectures and preprocessing techniques to achieve improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deforestation detection models using PRODES data have limitations: unsatisfactory effectiveness, lack of modern architectures like self-attention mechanisms, and absence of methodological standardization for direct comparisons between studies.

Method: Evaluated various change detection models on unified dataset including fully convolutional models and Transformer-based self-attention networks. Investigated impact of pre- and post-processing techniques (filtering by connected component size, texture replacement, image enhancements) and tested different model combination strategies.

Result: Demonstrated that preprocessing and postprocessing techniques significantly improve individual model effectiveness. Achieved F1-score of 80.41% through model combination strategies, comparable to other recent works in the literature.

Conclusion: The work addresses gaps in Amazon deforestation monitoring by systematically evaluating modern change detection architectures with standardized preprocessing techniques, achieving competitive performance through model combination approaches.

Abstract: The preservation of the Amazon Rainforest is one of the global priorities in combating climate change, protecting biodiversity, and safeguarding indigenous cultures. The Satellite-based Monitoring Project of Deforestation in the Brazilian Legal Amazon (PRODES), a project of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), stands out as a fundamental initiative in this effort, annually monitoring deforested areas not only in the Amazon but also in other Brazilian biomes. Recently, machine learning models have been developed using PRODES data to support this effort through the comparative analysis of multitemporal satellite images, treating deforestation detection as a change detection problem. However, existing approaches present significant limitations: models evaluated in the literature still show unsatisfactory effectiveness, many do not incorporate modern architectures, such as those based on self-attention mechanisms, and there is a lack of methodological standardization that allows direct comparisons between different studies. In this work, we address these gaps by evaluating various change detection models in a unified dataset, including fully convolutional models and networks incorporating self-attention mechanisms based on Transformers. We investigate the impact of different pre- and post-processing techniques, such as filtering deforested areas predicted by the models based on the size of connected components, texture replacement, and image enhancements; we demonstrate that such approaches can significantly improve individual model effectiveness. Additionally, we test different strategies for combining the evaluated models to achieve results superior to those obtained individually, reaching an F1-score of 80.41%, a value comparable to other recent works in the literature.

### [11] [CVP: Central-Peripheral Vision-Inspired Multimodal Model for Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08135)
*Zeyuan Chen,Xiang Zhang,Haiyang Xu,Jianwen Xie,Zhuowen Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CVP is a multimodal model for spatial reasoning inspired by human central/peripheral vision, using target-affinity tokens and allocentric grids to achieve state-of-the-art 3D scene understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches rely on unstructured representations (point clouds, voxels, patch features) with implicit scene context via coordinate embeddings, resulting in limited spatial reasoning capabilities due to lack of explicit high-level structural understanding.

Method: Introduces central-peripheral vision-inspired framework with two components: 1) target-affinity token (central vision) guiding attention to query-relevant objects, and 2) allocentric grid (peripheral vision) capturing global scene context and spatial arrangements, integrated into Large Multimodal Model architecture.

Result: CVP achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of 3D scene understanding benchmarks, demonstrating superior spatial reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The biologically-inspired central-peripheral vision framework provides an effective approach for structured, context-aware understanding of complex 3D environments, addressing limitations of existing unstructured representations.

Abstract: We present a central-peripheral vision-inspired framework (CVP), a simple yet effective multimodal model for spatial reasoning that draws inspiration from the two types of human visual fields -- central vision and peripheral vision. Existing approaches primarily rely on unstructured representations, such as point clouds, voxels, or patch features, and inject scene context implicitly via coordinate embeddings. However, this often results in limited spatial reasoning capabilities due to the lack of explicit, high-level structural understanding. To address this limitation, we introduce two complementary components into a Large Multimodal Model-based architecture: target-affinity token, analogous to central vision, that guides the model's attention toward query-relevant objects; and allocentric grid, akin to peripheral vision, that captures global scene context and spatial arrangements. These components work in tandem to enable structured, context-aware understanding of complex 3D environments. Experiments show that CVP achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of 3D scene understanding benchmarks.

### [12] [Fourier-RWKV: A Multi-State Perception Network for Efficient Image Dehazing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08161)
*Lirong Zheng,Yanshan Li,Rui Yu,Kaihao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fourier-RWKV: A linear-complexity Transformer-based image dehazing framework using Multi-State Perception for real-world non-uniform haze removal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image dehazing is crucial for visual perception but challenging under real-world non-uniform haze conditions. Transformer-based methods capture global context well but have quadratic computational complexity that hinders real-time deployment.

Method: Proposes Fourier-RWKV framework based on Multi-State Perception paradigm with three components: 1) Spatial-form Perception using Deformable Quad-directional Token Shift (DQ-Shift) for local haze variations, 2) Frequency-domain Perception using Fourier Mix block extending RWKV's WKV attention to Fourier domain for long-range dependencies, 3) Semantic-relation Perception using Semantic Bridge Module with Dynamic Semantic Kernel Fusion for encoder-decoder alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance across diverse haze scenarios while significantly reducing computational overhead, establishing favorable trade-off between restoration quality and practical efficiency.

Conclusion: Fourier-RWKV delivers comprehensive haze degradation modeling with linear complexity, enabling real-time deployment while maintaining high restoration quality, making it suitable for practical applications.

Abstract: Image dehazing is crucial for reliable visual perception, yet it remains highly challenging under real-world non-uniform haze conditions. Although Transformer-based methods excel at capturing global context, their quadratic computational complexity hinders real-time deployment. To address this, we propose Fourier Receptance Weighted Key Value (Fourier-RWKV), a novel dehazing framework based on a Multi-State Perception paradigm. The model achieves comprehensive haze degradation modeling with linear complexity by synergistically integrating three distinct perceptual states: (1) Spatial-form Perception, realized through the Deformable Quad-directional Token Shift (DQ-Shift) operation, which dynamically adjusts receptive fields to accommodate local haze variations; (2) Frequency-domain Perception, implemented within the Fourier Mix block, which extends the core WKV attention mechanism of RWKV from the spatial domain to the Fourier domain, preserving the long-range dependencies essential for global haze estimation while mitigating spatial attenuation; (3) Semantic-relation Perception, facilitated by the Semantic Bridge Module (SBM), which utilizes Dynamic Semantic Kernel Fusion (DSK-Fusion) to precisely align encoder-decoder features and suppress artifacts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Fourier-RWKV delivers state-of-the-art performance across diverse haze scenarios while significantly reducing computational overhead, establishing a favorable trade-off between restoration quality and practical efficiency.

### [13] [Accuracy Does Not Guarantee Human-Likeness in Monocular Depth Estimators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08163)
*Yuki Kubota,Taiki Fukiage*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Monocular depth estimation models show trade-off between accuracy and human-like behavior, with improved accuracy not necessarily leading to more human-like performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether monocular depth estimation models align with human perception, and whether there's a trade-off between model accuracy and human-like behavior similar to what's observed in object recognition.

Method: Systematically analyzed 69 monocular depth estimators using KITTI dataset, applied affine fitting to decompose prediction errors into interpretable components, and examined error correlations between humans and DNNs.

Result: While humans and DNNs share certain estimation biases (positive error correlations), distinct trade-off relationships exist between model accuracy and human similarity, indicating improved accuracy doesn't necessarily lead to more human-like behavior.

Conclusion: Developing multifaceted, human-centric evaluation metrics is necessary beyond traditional accuracy measures for monocular depth estimation.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is a fundamental capability for real-world applications such as autonomous driving and robotics. Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved superhuman accuracy on physical-based benchmarks, a key challenge remains: aligning model representations with human perception, a promising strategy for enhancing model robustness and interpretability. Research in object recognition has revealed a complex trade-off between model accuracy and human-like behavior, raising a question whether a similar divergence exist in depth estimation, particularly for natural outdoor scenes where benchmarks rely on sensor-based ground truth rather than human perceptual estimates. In this study, we systematically investigated the relationship between model accuracy and human similarity across 69 monocular depth estimators using the KITTI dataset. To dissect the structure of error patterns on a factor-by-factor basis, we applied affine fitting to decompose prediction errors into interpretable components. Intriguingly, our results reveal while humans and DNNs share certain estimation biases (positive error correlations), we observed distinct trade-off relationships between model accuracy and human similarity. This finding indicates that improving accuracy does not necessarily lead to more human-like behavior, underscoring the necessity of developing multifaceted, human-centric evaluations beyond traditional accuracy.

*Xiaojing Wei,Ting Zhang,Wei He,Jingdong Wang,Hua Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoLoom is a text-to-geometric-diagram generation framework using formal language translation and Monte Carlo optimization for precise spatial accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality geometric diagram generation requires strict spatial accuracy but offers well-defined constraints that can guide generation. Current approaches lack the mathematical rigor needed for precise geometric diagrams.

Method: Two-component framework: 1) Autoformalization module translating natural language to formal language GeoLingua, 2) Coordinate solver using Monte Carlo optimization to map formal constraints to precise coordinates. Also introduces GeoNF dataset and constraint-based evaluation metric.

Result: GeoLoom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in structural fidelity, providing mathematically grounded supervision for iterative refinement.

Conclusion: GeoLoom offers a principled foundation for interpretable and scalable geometric diagram generation through formal language translation and optimization-based coordinate solving.

Abstract: High-quality geometric diagram generation presents both a challenge and an opportunity: it demands strict spatial accuracy while offering well-defined constraints to guide generation. Inspired by recent advances in geometry problem solving that employ formal languages and symbolic solvers for enhanced correctness and interpretability, we propose GeoLoom, a novel framework for text-to-diagram generation in geometric domains. GeoLoom comprises two core components: an autoformalization module that translates natural language into a specifically designed generation-oriented formal language GeoLingua, and a coordinate solver that maps formal constraints to precise coordinates using the efficient Monte Carlo optimization. To support this framework, we introduce GeoNF, a dataset aligning natural language geometric descriptions with formal GeoLingua descriptions. We further propose a constraint-based evaluation metric that quantifies structural deviation, offering mathematically grounded supervision for iterative refinement. Empirical results demonstrate that GeoLoom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in structural fidelity, providing a principled foundation for interpretable and scalable diagram generation.

*Yubo Chen,Di Zhao,Yun Sing Koh,Talia Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an on-device Animal Re-ID framework for MCU-class hardware that achieves competitive accuracy with 100x smaller models through optimized architecture scaling and data-efficient fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Animal Re-ID needs to run on low-power edge devices (collar tags, MCUs) in remote wildlife/livestock settings with limited connectivity, but existing models are too large for memory-constrained hardware with low-resolution inputs.

Method: 1) Characterize gap between SOTA models and MCU hardware, 2) Design optimized CNN architecture by scaling MobileNetV2 backbone for low-resolution inputs, 3) Develop data-efficient fine-tuning strategy requiring only 3 images per animal for new site adaptation.

Result: Compact model reduces size by 100x while maintaining competitive accuracy across 6 public datasets. On cattle dataset, on-device inference shows minimal accuracy drop with unchanged Top-1 accuracy compared to cluster version.

Conclusion: Practical, adaptable Animal Re-ID is achievable on MCU-class devices, enabling scalable deployment in real field environments for wildlife monitoring and precision livestock management.

Abstract: Camera-based animal re-identification (Animal Re-ID) can support wildlife monitoring and precision livestock management in large outdoor environments with limited wireless connectivity. In these settings, inference must run directly on collar tags or low-power edge nodes built around microcontrollers (MCUs), yet most Animal Re-ID models are designed for workstations or servers and are too large for devices with small memory and low-resolution inputs. We propose an on-device framework. First, we characterise the gap between state-of-the-art Animal Re-ID models and MCU-class hardware, showing that straightforward knowledge distillation from large teachers offers limited benefit once memory and input resolution are constrained. Second, guided by this analysis, we design a high-accuracy Animal Re-ID architecture by systematically scaling a CNN-based MobileNetV2 backbone for low-resolution inputs. Third, we evaluate the framework with a real-world dataset and introduce a data-efficient fine-tuning strategy to enable fast adaptation with just three images per animal identity at a new site. Across six public Animal Re-ID datasets, our compact model achieves competitive retrieval accuracy while reducing model size by over two orders of magnitude. On a self-collected cattle dataset, the deployed model performs fully on-device inference with only a small accuracy drop and unchanged Top-1 accuracy relative to its cluster version. We demonstrate that practical, adaptable Animal Re-ID is achievable on MCU-class devices, paving the way for scalable deployment in real field environments.

*Chia-Hern Lai,I-Hsuan Lo,Yen-Ku Yeh,Thanh-Nguyen Truong,Ching-Chun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Blur2Sharp generates sharp, geometrically consistent novel-view human avatars from single reference images using 3D-aware neural rendering and diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current human avatar generation methods produce either geometrically inconsistent multi-view images or blurry outputs under diverse viewing angles and complex motions, lacking both photorealism and geometric consistency.

Method: Dual-conditioning architecture: 1) Human NeRF generates geometrically coherent multi-view renderings for target poses with 3D structural guidance, 2) Diffusion model conditioned on these renderings refines images with hierarchical feature fusion incorporating texture, normal, and semantic priors from SMPL models.

Result: Extensive experiments show Blur2Sharp consistently surpasses state-of-the-art techniques in novel pose and view generation, particularly excelling under challenging scenarios with loose clothing and occlusions.

Conclusion: Blur2Sharp successfully addresses the fundamental challenge of creating lifelike human avatars with realistic pose variation and viewpoint flexibility by integrating 3D-aware neural rendering and diffusion models to achieve both geometric consistency and photorealism.

Abstract: The creation of lifelike human avatars capable of realistic pose variation and viewpoint flexibility remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Current approaches typically yield either geometrically inconsistent multi-view images or sacrifice photorealism, resulting in blurry outputs under diverse viewing angles and complex motions. To address these issues, we propose Blur2Sharp, a novel framework integrating 3D-aware neural rendering and diffusion models to generate sharp, geometrically consistent novel-view images from only a single reference view. Our method employs a dual-conditioning architecture: initially, a Human NeRF model generates geometrically coherent multi-view renderings for target poses, explicitly encoding 3D structural guidance. Subsequently, a diffusion model conditioned on these renderings refines the generated images, preserving fine-grained details and structural fidelity. We further enhance visual quality through hierarchical feature fusion, incorporating texture, normal, and semantic priors extracted from parametric SMPL models to simultaneously improve global coherence and local detail accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Blur2Sharp consistently surpasses state-of-the-art techniques in both novel pose and view generation tasks, particularly excelling under challenging scenarios involving loose clothing and occlusions.

### [17] [VisKnow: Constructing Visual Knowledge Base for Object Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08221)
*Ziwei Yao,Qiyang Wan,Ruiping Wang,Xilin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisKnow framework constructs Visual Knowledge Bases (VKBs) by structuring multi-modal object knowledge as graphs to advance comprehensive object understanding beyond basic recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current object understanding in computer vision is limited to basic recognition (category labels), lacking comprehensive perception of object categories including components, attributes, relationships, and contextual knowledge. Existing multi-modal data is task-oriented and not systematically organized for holistic object understanding.

Method: Propose VisKnow framework that extracts multi-modal, object-level knowledge and structures it as graphs. Combines expert design with large-scale model application to integrate aligned text/image knowledge with region annotations at object and part levels. Demonstrate with AnimalKB covering 406 animal categories with 22K textual triplets, 420K images, and region annotations.

Result: AnimalKB enhances object-level visual tasks: improves zero-shot recognition and fine-grained VQA, and serves as challenging benchmarks for knowledge graph completion and part segmentation. Shows potential of automatically constructed VKBs to advance visual understanding and practical applications.

Conclusion: Visual Knowledge Bases structured as graphs can significantly advance object understanding beyond basic recognition. The VisKnow framework demonstrates feasibility of automatically constructing comprehensive multi-modal knowledge bases that benefit various visual tasks and serve as valuable benchmarks.

Abstract: Understanding objects is fundamental to computer vision. Beyond object recognition that provides only a category label as typical output, in-depth object understanding represents a comprehensive perception of an object category, involving its components, appearance characteristics, inter-category relationships, contextual background knowledge, etc. Developing such capability requires sufficient multi-modal data, including visual annotations such as parts, attributes, and co-occurrences for specific tasks, as well as textual knowledge to support high-level tasks like reasoning and question answering. However, these data are generally task-oriented and not systematically organized enough to achieve the expected understanding of object categories. In response, we propose the Visual Knowledge Base that structures multi-modal object knowledge as graphs, and present a construction framework named VisKnow that extracts multi-modal, object-level knowledge for object understanding. This framework integrates enriched aligned text and image-source knowledge with region annotations at both object and part levels through a combination of expert design and large-scale model application. As a specific case study, we construct AnimalKB, a structured animal knowledge base covering 406 animal categories, which contains 22K textual knowledge triplets extracted from encyclopedic documents, 420K images, and corresponding region annotations. A series of experiments showcase how AnimalKB enhances object-level visual tasks such as zero-shot recognition and fine-grained VQA, and serves as challenging benchmarks for knowledge graph completion and part segmentation. Our findings highlight the potential of automatically constructing visual knowledge bases to advance visual understanding and its practical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes three lightweight VVC profiles (Fast, Faster, Fastest) for compressing neural network features in split inference systems, achieving significant encoding speed improvements with minimal compression efficiency loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video codecs are optimized for perceptual quality based on human visual system models, but these assumptions don't apply to intermediate neural network features in split inference systems, which are abstract, sparse, and task-specific.

Method: The authors investigate VVC for feature compression under MPEG-AI FCM standard, perform tool-level analysis to understand coding component impacts, and propose three lightweight VVC profiles based on these insights.

Result: Fast profile: 2.96% BD-Rate gain with 21.8% encoding time reduction; Faster: 1.85% BD-Rate gain with 51.5% speedup; Fastest: 95.6% encoding time reduction with only 1.71% BD-Rate loss.

Conclusion: Lightweight VVC profiles can effectively compress neural network features for split inference systems, achieving substantial encoding speed improvements while maintaining compression efficiency and downstream task accuracy.

Abstract: Modern video codecs have been extensively optimized to preserve perceptual quality, leveraging models of the human visual system. However, in split inference systems-where intermediate features from neural network are transmitted instead of pixel data-these assumptions no longer apply. Intermediate features are abstract, sparse, and task-specific, making perceptual fidelity irrelevant. In this paper, we investigate the use of Versatile Video Coding (VVC) for compressing such features under the MPEG-AI Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) standard. We perform a tool-level analysis to understand the impact of individual coding components on compression efficiency and downstream vision task accuracy. Based on these insights, we propose three lightweight essential VVC profiles-Fast, Faster, and Fastest. The Fast profile provides 2.96% BD-Rate gain while reducing encoding time by 21.8%. Faster achieves a 1.85% BD-Rate gain with a 51.5% speedup. Fastest reduces encoding time by 95.6% with only a 1.71% loss in BD-Rate.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MM-CoT is a new benchmark that tests whether multimodal models' Chain-of-Thought reasoning is genuinely grounded in visual evidence and logically coherent, rather than just fluent generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on generating reasoning chains but neglect verifying whether the reasoning is visually consistent and logically valid. There's a gap in assessing whether multimodal models' CoT reasoning is truly grounded in evidence and coherent.

Method: Created MM-CoT benchmark where models must select the single event chain satisfying both visual consistency (anchored in observable evidence) and logical coherence (causal and commonsense validity). Uses adversarial distractors engineered to violate one constraint to expose specific reasoning failures.

Result: Leading vision-language models struggle on MM-CoT, revealing a sharp discrepancy between generative fluency and true reasoning fidelity. The benchmark shows low correlation with existing benchmarks, confirming it measures a unique combination of visual grounding and logical reasoning.

Conclusion: MM-CoT provides a foundation for developing future multimodal models that reason not just plausibly, but faithfully and coherently within the visual world, addressing the critical gap in verifying reasoning quality beyond generation.

Abstract: The ability to perform Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning marks a major milestone for multimodal models (MMs), enabling them to solve complex visual reasoning problems. Yet a critical question remains: is such reasoning genuinely grounded in visual evidence and logically coherent? Existing benchmarks emphasize generation but neglect verification, i.e., the capacity to assess whether a reasoning chain is both visually consistent and logically valid. To fill this gap, we introduce MM-CoT, a diagnostic benchmark specifically designed to probe the visual grounding and logical coherence of CoT reasoning in MMs. Instead of generating free-form explanations, models must select the sole event chain that satisfies two orthogonal constraints: (i) visual consistency, ensuring all steps are anchored in observable evidence, and (ii) logical coherence, ensuring causal and commonsense validity. Adversarial distractors are engineered to violate one of these constraints, exposing distinct reasoning failures. We evaluate leading vision-language models on MM-CoT and find that even the most advanced systems struggle, revealing a sharp discrepancy between generative fluency and true reasoning fidelity. MM-CoT shows low correlation with existing benchmarks, confirming that it measures a unique combination of visual grounding and logical reasoning. This benchmark provides a foundation for developing future models that reason not just plausibly, but faithfully and coherently within the visual world.

### [21] [Geometry-Aware Sparse Depth Sampling for High-Fidelity RGB-D Depth Completion in Robotic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08229)
*Tony Salloom,Dandi Zhou,Xinhai Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes normal-guided sparse depth sampling for depth completion that mimics real sensor reliability patterns instead of uniform random sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current depth completion methods use unrealistic uniform random sampling of sparse depth points, ignoring that real sensors have geometry-dependent and spatially nonuniform reliability patterns.

Method: Uses PCA-based surface normal estimation on RGB-D point clouds to compute per-pixel depth reliability measures, then samples sparse depth points according to this reliability distribution.

Result: Improves accuracy, reduces artifacts near edges and discontinuities, and creates more realistic training conditions that better reflect real sensor behavior on NYU Depth v2 dataset.

Conclusion: Geometry-aware sparse depth sampling produces more realistic training data and better depth completion results by mimicking real sensor reliability patterns.

Abstract: Accurate three-dimensional perception is essential for modern industrial robotic systems that perform manipulation, inspection, and navigation tasks. RGB-D and stereo vision sensors are widely used for this purpose, but the depth maps they produce are often noisy, incomplete, or biased due to sensor limitations and environmental conditions. Depth completion methods aim to generate dense, reliable depth maps from RGB images and sparse depth input. However, a key limitation in current depth completion pipelines is the unrealistic generation of sparse depth: sparse pixels are typically selected uniformly at random from dense ground-truth depth, ignoring the fact that real sensors exhibit geometry-dependent and spatially nonuniform reliability. In this work, we propose a normal-guided sparse depth sampling strategy that leverages PCA-based surface normal estimation on the RGB-D point cloud to compute a per-pixel depth reliability measure. The sparse depth samples are then drawn according to this reliability distribution. We integrate this sampling method with the Marigold-DC diffusion-based depth completion model and evaluate it on NYU Depth v2 using the standard metrics. Experiments show that our geometry-aware sparse depth improves accuracy, reduces artifacts near edges and discontinuities, and produces more realistic training conditions that better reflect real sensor behavior.

*Yuanpeng Chen,Hui Song,Wei Tao,ShanHui Mo,Shuang Zhang,Xiao Hua,TianKun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastBEV++ is a camera-only BEV perception framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance (0.359 NDS) with exceptional real-time speed (134 FPS) by eliminating custom CUDA kernels and using only TensorRT-native operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current camera-only BEV perception faces a fundamental tension between state-of-the-art performance and deployment tractability, due to dependency on computationally expensive view transformations and platform-specific kernels that hinder real-world deployment.

Method: Introduces two principles: 1) "Deployable by Design" via novel view transformation that decomposes projection into standard Index-Gather-Reshape pipeline using deterministic pre-sorting, enabling TensorRT-native portability without custom CUDA kernels; 2) "Fast by Algorithm" via end-to-end depth-aware fusion with jointly learned depth modulation, temporal aggregation, and robust data augmentation.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art 0.359 NDS on nuScenes benchmark while maintaining exceptional real-time performance exceeding 134 FPS on automotive-grade hardware (Tesla T4), demonstrating both high accuracy and deployment efficiency.

Conclusion: FastBEV++ presents a mature and scalable design philosophy for production autonomous systems by offering a solution that is both highly accurate and free of custom plugins, reconciling the tension between performance and deployment tractability in BEV perception.

Abstract: The advancement of camera-only Bird's-Eye-View(BEV) perception is currently impeded by a fundamental tension between state-of-the-art performance and on-vehicle deployment tractability. This bottleneck stems from a deep-rooted dependency on computationally prohibitive view transformations and bespoke, platform-specific kernels. This paper introduces FastBEV++, a framework engineered to reconcile this tension, demonstrating that high performance and deployment efficiency can be achieved in unison via two guiding principles: Fast by Algorithm and Deployable by Design. We realize the "Deployable by Design" principle through a novel view transformation paradigm that decomposes the monolithic projection into a standard Index-Gather-Reshape pipeline. Enabled by a deterministic pre-sorting strategy, this transformation is executed entirely with elementary, operator native primitives (e.g Gather, Matrix Multiplication), which eliminates the need for specialized CUDA kernels and ensures fully TensorRT-native portability. Concurrently, our framework is "Fast by Algorithm", leveraging this decomposed structure to seamlessly integrate an end-to-end, depth-aware fusion mechanism. This jointly learned depth modulation, further bolstered by temporal aggregation and robust data augmentation, significantly enhances the geometric fidelity of the BEV representation.Empirical validation on the nuScenes benchmark corroborates the efficacy of our approach. FastBEV++ establishes a new state-of-the-art 0.359 NDS while maintaining exceptional real-time performance, exceeding 134 FPS on automotive-grade hardware (e.g Tesla T4). By offering a solution that is free of custom plugins yet highly accurate, FastBEV++ presents a mature and scalable design philosophy for production autonomous systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HTC-VLM is a hybrid vision-language model that uses dual channels (continuous for details, discrete for semantics) to compress 580 visual tokens into 1 token with 87.2% performance retention, solving the efficiency-fidelity trade-off in VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional vision-language models face quadratic computational costs from feeding hundreds of visual patch tokens into LLMs, creating memory and context window strain. Existing approaches trade off between continuous compression (which dilutes high-level semantics) and discrete quantization (which loses fine-grained details).

Method: HTC-VLM uses a hybrid framework with dual channels: a continuous pathway for fine-grained details via ViT patches, and a discrete pathway for symbolic anchors using MGVQ quantization projected to four tokens. These are fused into a 580-token hybrid sequence and compressed into a single voco token using disentanglement attention mask and bottleneck.

Result: Achieves 87.2% average performance retention across seven benchmarks (GQA, VQAv2, MMBench, MME, POPE, SEED-Bench, ScienceQA-Image), outperforming leading continuous baseline at 81.0% with 580-to-1 compression ratio. Attention analyses show compressed token prioritizes discrete anchor, validating semantic guidance.

Conclusion: A minimalist hybrid design can resolve the efficiency-fidelity dilemma in vision-language models, enabling scalable VLMs through disentangled semantics and appearance representation.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have transformed multimodal reasoning, but feeding hundreds of visual patch tokens into LLMs incurs quadratic computational costs, straining memory and context windows. Traditional approaches face a trade-off: continuous compression dilutes high-level semantics such as object identities, while discrete quantization loses fine-grained details such as textures. We introduce HTC-VLM, a hybrid framework that disentangles semantics and appearance through dual channels, i.e., a continuous pathway for fine-grained details via ViT patches and a discrete pathway for symbolic anchors using MGVQ quantization projected to four tokens. These are fused into a 580-token hybrid sequence and compressed into a single voco token via a disentanglement attention mask and bottleneck, ensuring efficient and grounded representations. HTC-VLM achieves an average performance retention of 87.2 percent across seven benchmarks (GQA, VQAv2, MMBench, MME, POPE, SEED-Bench, ScienceQA-Image), outperforming the leading continuous baseline at 81.0 percent with a 580-to-1 compression ratio. Attention analyses show that the compressed token prioritizes the discrete anchor, validating its semantic guidance. Our work demonstrates that a minimalist hybrid design can resolve the efficiency-fidelity dilemma and advance scalable VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed Residual-SwinCA-Net framework achieves state-of-the-art breast lesion segmentation performance (99.29% accuracy, 98.74% IoU) on BUSI dataset by combining residual CNNs, Swin Transformers, and novel attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in breast ultrasound lesion segmentation by developing a hybrid framework that can extract both locally correlated features and global dependencies while handling ultrasound noise and maintaining morphological integrity of malignant lesions.

Method: A deep hybrid framework combining: 1) Residual CNN modules for local feature extraction, 2) Customized Swin Transformer blocks with internal residual pathways for global dependencies, 3) Laplacian-of-Gaussian operator for tissue continuity and noise suppression, 4) Boundary-oriented operator for morphological integrity, 5) Progressive contraction strategy for scale invariance, 6) Multi-Scale Channel Attention and Squeezing (MSCAS) module for selective feature emphasis, and 7) Pixel-Attention module for adaptive weighting of lesion pixels.

Result: Outperformed existing CNN/ViT techniques on BUSI dataset with 99.29% mean accuracy, 98.74% IoU, and 0.9041 Dice score for breast lesion segmentation.

Conclusion: The Residual-SwinCA-Net framework significantly improves breast lesion diagnostic performance and supports timely clinical decision-making through superior segmentation accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: A novel deep hybrid Residual-SwinCA-Net segmentation framework is proposed in the study for addressing such challenges by extracting locally correlated and robust features, incorporating residual CNN modules. Furthermore, for learning global dependencies, Swin Transformer blocks are customized using internal residual pathways, which reinforce gradient stability, refine local patterns, and facilitate global feature fusion. Formerly, for enhancing tissue continuity, ultrasound noise suppressions, and accentuating fine structural transitions Laplacian-of-Gaussian regional operator is applied, and for maintaining the morphological integrity of malignant lesion contours, a boundary-oriented operator has been incorporated. Subsequently, a contraction strategy was applied stage-wise by progressively reducing features-map progressively for capturing scale invariance and enhancing the robustness of structural variability. In addition, each decoder level prior augmentation integrates a new Multi-Scale Channel Attention and Squeezing (MSCAS) module. The MSCAS selectively emphasizes encoder salient maps, retains discriminative global context, and complementary local structures with minimal computational cost while suppressing redundant activations. Finally, the Pixel-Attention module encodes class-relevant spatial cues by adaptively weighing malignant lesion pixels while suppressing background interference. The Residual-SwinCA-Net and existing CNNs/ViTs techniques have been implemented on the publicly available BUSI dataset. The proposed Residual-SwinCA-Net framework outperformed and achieved 99.29% mean accuracy, 98.74% IoU, and 0.9041 Dice for breast lesion segmentation. The proposed Residual-SwinCA-Net framework improves the BUSI lesion diagnostic performance and strengthens timely clinical decision-making.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FTKD: A sparse query-based knowledge distillation method that transfers future frame knowledge from offline to online 3D object detection models without strict frame alignment, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing knowledge distillation methods for camera-based temporal 3D object detection overlook future frames, focusing only on spatial features or temporal relations with strict frame alignment, making it difficult for online models to learn future knowledge from offline teachers.

Method: Proposes Future Temporal Knowledge Distillation (FTKD) with two key components: 1) future-aware feature reconstruction that allows students to capture future features without strict frame alignment, and 2) future-guided logit distillation that leverages teacher's stable foreground/background context.

Result: Achieves up to 1.3 mAP and 1.3 NDS gains on nuScenes dataset, plus the most accurate velocity estimation, without increasing inference cost when applied to two high-performing 3D object detection baselines.

Conclusion: FTKD effectively transfers future knowledge from offline to online 3D detection models through sparse query-based distillation, overcoming limitations of existing methods and improving performance without computational overhead.

Abstract: Camera-based temporal 3D object detection has shown impressive results in autonomous driving, with offline models improving accuracy by using future frames. Knowledge distillation (KD) can be an appealing framework for transferring rich information from offline models to online models. However, existing KD methods overlook future frames, as they mainly focus on spatial feature distillation under strict frame alignment or on temporal relational distillation, thereby making it challenging for online models to effectively learn future knowledge. To this end, we propose a sparse query-based approach, Future Temporal Knowledge Distillation (FTKD), which effectively transfers future frame knowledge from an offline teacher model to an online student model. Specifically, we present a future-aware feature reconstruction strategy to encourage the student model to capture future features without strict frame alignment. In addition, we further introduce future-guided logit distillation to leverage the teacher's stable foreground and background context. FTKD is applied to two high-performing 3D object detection baselines, achieving up to 1.3 mAP and 1.3 NDS gains on the nuScenes dataset, as well as the most accurate velocity estimation, without increasing inference cost.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QHP introduces query-aware hub prototypes with bipartite graph modeling and distribution optimization to address prototype bias in few-shot 3D point cloud segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metric-based prototype learning methods generate prototypes solely from support set without considering query relevance, causing prototype bias that overfits support characteristics and fails to generalize to query distribution, especially with distribution shifts.

Method: Proposes Query-aware Hub Prototype (QHP) learning with two modules: 1) Hub Prototype Generation (HPG) constructs bipartite graph connecting query and support points, identifies frequently linked support hubs to generate query-relevant prototypes; 2) Prototype Distribution Optimization (PDO) uses purity-reweighted contrastive loss to refine prototypes by pulling bad hubs and outliers toward class centers.

Result: Extensive experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet show QHP achieves substantial performance gains over state-of-the-art methods, effectively narrowing semantic gap between prototypes and query sets in FS-3DSeg.

Conclusion: QHP successfully addresses prototype bias by explicitly modeling semantic correlations between support and query sets, generating query-relevant prototypes that better capture cross-set semantics and improve few-shot 3D segmentation performance.

Abstract: Few-shot 3D point cloud semantic segmentation (FS-3DSeg) aims to segment novel classes with only a few labeled samples. However, existing metric-based prototype learning methods generate prototypes solely from the support set, without considering their relevance to query data. This often results in prototype bias, where prototypes overfit support-specific characteristics and fail to generalize to the query distribution, especially in the presence of distribution shifts, which leads to degraded segmentation performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Query-aware Hub Prototype (QHP) learning method that explicitly models semantic correlations between support and query sets. Specifically, we propose a Hub Prototype Generation (HPG) module that constructs a bipartite graph connecting query and support points, identifies frequently linked support hubs, and generates query-relevant prototypes that better capture cross-set semantics. To further mitigate the influence of bad hubs and ambiguous prototypes near class boundaries, we introduce a Prototype Distribution Optimization (PDO) module, which employs a purity-reweighted contrastive loss to refine prototype representations by pulling bad hubs and outlier prototypes closer to their corresponding class centers. Extensive experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet demonstrate that QHP achieves substantial performance gains over state-of-the-art methods, effectively narrowing the semantic gap between prototypes and query sets in FS-3DSeg.

TL;DR: SFP method uses spatial and frequency priors for scene recovery, combining transmission map estimation from degraded image inverse with adaptive frequency enhancement using DC component and low-frequency distribution priors, fused with input features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scene recovery methods rely on single priors (insufficient for multiple degradations) or complex networks trained on synthetic data (poor generalization to real-world scenarios). Need for effective real-world scene recovery that handles various degradation conditions.

Method: Spatial and Frequency Priors (SFP): 1) Spatial prior: uses inverse of degraded image's spectral projection to estimate transmission map for scattering degradation recovery; 2) Frequency prior: constructs adaptive frequency enhancement mask using two novel priors - DC component mean intensity similarity and low radial frequency magnitude distribution (1% of total spectrum); 3) Weighted fusion strategy integrates spatial restoration, frequency enhancement, and input image salient features.

Result: Extensive evaluations demonstrate effectiveness and superiority of SFP for scene recovery under various degradation conditions, showing better performance than existing methods.

Conclusion: SFP provides an effective approach for real-world scene recovery by leveraging complementary spatial and frequency priors, overcoming limitations of single-prior methods and synthetic-data-trained networks, with strong generalization to diverse degradation scenarios.

Abstract: Scene recovery serves as a critical task for various computer vision applications. Existing methods typically rely on a single prior, which is inherently insufficient to handle multiple degradations, or employ complex network architectures trained on synthetic data, which suffer from poor generalization for diverse real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose Spatial and Frequency Priors (SFP) for real-world scene recovery. In the spatial domain, we observe that the inverse of the degraded image exhibits a projection along its spectral direction that resembles the scene transmission. Leveraging this spatial prior, the transmission map is estimated to recover the scene from scattering degradation. In the frequency domain, a mask is constructed for adaptive frequency enhancement, with two parameters estimated using our proposed novel priors. Specifically, one prior assumes that the mean intensity of the degraded image's direct current (DC) components across three channels in the frequency domain closely approximates that of each channel in the clear image. The second prior is based on the observation that, for clear images, the magnitude of low radial frequencies below 0.001 constitutes approximately 1% of the total spectrum. Finally, we design a weighted fusion strategy to integrate spatial-domain restoration, frequency-domain enhancement, and salient features from the input image, yielding the final recovered result. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed SFP for scene recovery under various degradation conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable immersive understanding by translating exocentric (third-person) videos to egocentric (first-person) videos, which is challenging due to extreme camera pose variations and minimal view overlap

Method: Uses lightweight LoRA adaptation of pretrained video diffusion models, unified conditioning strategy combining exocentric and egocentric priors, and geometry-guided self-attention mechanism for spatial relevance

Result: Achieves coherent and realistic egocentric video generation with strong scalability and robustness across unseen and in-the-wild videos

Conclusion: EgoX framework successfully translates exocentric to egocentric videos while preserving content and ensuring geometric consistency

Abstract: Egocentric perception enables humans to experience and understand the world directly from their own point of view. Translating exocentric (third-person) videos into egocentric (first-person) videos opens up new possibilities for immersive understanding but remains highly challenging due to extreme camera pose variations and minimal view overlap. This task requires faithfully preserving visible content while synthesizing unseen regions in a geometrically consistent manner. To achieve this, we present EgoX, a novel framework for generating egocentric videos from a single exocentric input. EgoX leverages the pretrained spatio temporal knowledge of large-scale video diffusion models through lightweight LoRA adaptation and introduces a unified conditioning strategy that combines exocentric and egocentric priors via width and channel wise concatenation. Additionally, a geometry-guided self-attention mechanism selectively attends to spatially relevant regions, ensuring geometric coherence and high visual fidelity. Our approach achieves coherent and realistic egocentric video generation while demonstrating strong scalability and robustness across unseen and in-the-wild videos.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current V2A models are appearance-driven and lack consideration of physical factors that shape real-world sounds, limiting their ability to generate physically plausible audio.

Method: Uses Physics-Driven Audio Adapter (Phy-Adapter) with physical parameters estimated by Physical Parameter Estimator (PPE), which combines VLM for mass inference and 3D reconstruction for velocity computation, integrated into a latent diffusion framework.

Result: Outperforms existing V2A models in quantitative and qualitative evaluations, produces physically plausible and perceptually coherent audio, validated on the new VGG-Impact benchmark with Audio-Physics Correlation Coefficient metric.

Conclusion: Incorporating physical reasoning into V2A generation significantly improves audio realism and physical plausibility, advancing beyond appearance-driven approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation have achieved impressive perceptual quality and temporal synchronization, yet most models remain appearance-driven, capturing visual-acoustic correlations without considering the physical factors that shape real-world sounds. We present Physics-Aware Video-to-Audio Synthesis (PAVAS), a method that incorporates physical reasoning into a latent diffusion-based V2A generation through the Physics-Driven Audio Adapter (Phy-Adapter). The adapter receives object-level physical parameters estimated by the Physical Parameter Estimator (PPE), which uses a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to infer the moving-object mass and a segmentation-based dynamic 3D reconstruction module to recover its motion trajectory for velocity computation. These physical cues enable the model to synthesize sounds that reflect underlying physical factors. To assess physical realism, we curate VGG-Impact, a benchmark focusing on object-object interactions, and introduce Audio-Physics Correlation Coefficient (APCC), an evaluation metric that measures consistency between physical and auditory attributes. Comprehensive experiments show that PAVAS produces physically plausible and perceptually coherent audio, outperforming existing V2A models in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Abstract: Despite the promising progress in subject-driven image generation, current models often deviate from the reference identities and struggle in complex scenes with multiple subjects. To address this challenge, we introduce OpenSubject, a video-derived large-scale corpus with 2.5M samples and 4.35M images for subject-driven generation and manipulation. The dataset is built with a four-stage pipeline that exploits cross-frame identity priors. (i) Video Curation. We apply resolution and aesthetic filtering to obtain high-quality clips.

We introduce segmentation map-guided outpainting to synthesize the input images for subject-driven generation and box-guided inpainting to generate input images for subject-driven manipulation, together with geometry-aware augmentations and irregular boundary erosion. (iv) Verification and Captioning. We utilize a VLM to validate synthesized samples, re-synthesize failed samples based on stage (iii), and then construct short and long captions. In addition, we introduce a benchmark covering subject-driven generation and manipulation, and then evaluate identity fidelity, prompt adherence, manipulation consistency, and background consistency with a VLM judge. Extensive experiments show that training with OpenSubject improves generation and manipulation performance, particularly in complex scenes.

Motivation: Perlin noise has been the standard for procedural world generation for decades but is fundamentally limited in realism and large-scale coherence. The paper aims to create an AI-era successor that combines diffusion model fidelity with the practical properties needed for procedural generation.

Method: Introduces Terrain Diffusion with InfiniteDiffusion algorithm for infinite generation, hierarchical diffusion models for planetary context and local detail, Laplacian encoding for stability across Earth-scale ranges, open-source infinite-tensor framework for constant-memory manipulation, and few-step consistency distillation for efficiency.

Result: The system enables seamless, real-time synthesis of boundless landscapes, establishing diffusion models as a practical foundation for procedural world generation capable of synthesizing entire planets coherently and controllably.

Conclusion: Terrain Diffusion successfully bridges diffusion model fidelity with procedural noise properties, creating a next-generation tool for infinite, coherent planetary-scale world generation without the limitations of traditional noise functions.

Abstract: For decades, procedural worlds have been built on procedural noise functions such as Perlin noise, which are fast and infinite, yet fundamentally limited in realism and large-scale coherence. We introduce Terrain Diffusion, an AI-era successor to Perlin noise that bridges the fidelity of diffusion models with the properties that made procedural noise indispensable: seamless infinite extent, seed-consistency, and constant-time random access. At its core is InfiniteDiffusion, a novel algorithm for infinite generation, enabling seamless, real-time synthesis of boundless landscapes. A hierarchical stack of diffusion models couples planetary context with local detail, while a compact Laplacian encoding stabilizes outputs across Earth-scale dynamic ranges. An open-source infinite-tensor framework supports constant-memory manipulation of unbounded tensors, and few-step consistency distillation enables efficient generation. Together, these components establish diffusion models as a practical foundation for procedural world generation, capable of synthesizing entire planets coherently, controllably, and without limits.

TL;DR: GeoDM: A geometry-aware distribution-matching framework for dataset distillation that operates across Euclidean, hyperbolic, and spherical manifolds to capture diverse data structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dataset distillation methods are limited to Euclidean spaces, which only capture linear structures and overlook the intrinsic geometry of real data (like curvature). High-dimensional data often lie on low-dimensional manifolds, so distilled data should align with the original data manifold geometry.

Method: Proposes GeoDM framework operating in Cartesian product of Euclidean, hyperbolic, and spherical manifolds. Introduces learnable curvature and weight parameters for different geometries, and designs an optimal transport loss to enhance distribution fidelity.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows geometry-aware distribution matching yields smaller generalization error bound than Euclidean counterparts. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art data distillation methods.

Conclusion: GeoDM effectively captures diverse data geometries (flat, hierarchical, cyclical) through unified representation, outperforming existing methods and remaining effective across various distribution-matching strategies for single geometries.

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to synthesize a compact subset of the original data, enabling models trained on it to achieve performance comparable to those trained on the original large dataset. Existing distribution-matching methods are confined to Euclidean spaces, making them only capture linear structures and overlook the intrinsic geometry of real data, e.g., curvature. However, high-dimensional data often lie on low-dimensional manifolds, suggesting that dataset distillation should have the distilled data manifold aligned with the original data manifold. In this work, we propose a geometry-aware distribution-matching framework, called \textbf{GeoDM}, which operates in the Cartesian product of Euclidean, hyperbolic, and spherical manifolds, with flat, hierarchical, and cyclical structures all captured by a unified representation. To adapt to the underlying data geometry, we introduce learnable curvature and weight parameters for three kinds of geometries. At the same time, we design an optimal transport loss to enhance the distribution fidelity. Our theoretical analysis shows that the geometry-aware distribution matching in a product space yields a smaller generalization error bound than the Euclidean counterparts. Extensive experiments conducted on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art data distillation methods and remains effective across various distribution-matching strategies for the single geometries.

TL;DR: A depth-only 6D pose estimation method for cluttered bin-picking using multi-view depth fusion, staged heatmap attention, and sparse transformers to handle occlusions and textureless objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial bin-picking faces challenges with occlusions, reflections, and textureless parts, making accurate 6D pose recovery difficult in densely packed environments.

Method: Fuses multi-view depth maps into fine-grained 3D point clouds or sparse TSDFs; uses staged heatmap mechanism for scene-adaptive attention priors; employs density-aware sparse transformer blocks to handle occlusions and non-uniform 3D data distribution; operates fully sparse for high-resolution volumetric representations; predicts poses via per-voxel voting strategy.

Result: Validated on IPD and MV-YCB datasets, demonstrating competitive performance in heavily cluttered industrial and household bin picking scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework enables accurate 6D pose estimation in cluttered environments by leveraging sparse 3D representations and attention mechanisms, showing potential for close-range robotic applications.

Abstract: Accurately recovering 6D poses in densely packed industrial bin-picking environments remain a serious challenge, owing to occlusions, reflections, and textureless parts. We introduce a holistic depth-only 6D pose estimation approach that fuses multi-view depth maps into either a fine-grained 3D point cloud in its vanilla version, or a sparse Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF). At the core of our framework lies a staged heatmap mechanism that yields scene-adaptive attention priors across different resolutions, steering computation toward foreground regions, thus keeping memory requirements at high resolutions feasible. Along, we propose a density-aware sparse transformer block that dynamically attends to (self-) occlusions and the non-uniform distribution of 3D data. While sparse 3D approaches has proven effective for long-range perception, its potential in close-range robotic applications remains underexplored. Our framework operates fully sparse, enabling high-resolution volumetric representations to capture fine geometric details crucial for accurate pose estimation in clutter. Our method processes the entire scene integrally, predicting the 6D pose via a novel per-voxel voting strategy, allowing simultaneous pose predictions for an arbitrary number of target objects. We validate our method on the recently published IPD and MV-YCB multi-view datasets, demonstrating competitive performance in heavily cluttered industrial and household bin picking scenarios.

TL;DR: GeoDiffMM is a diffusion-based Lagrangian video motion magnification framework that uses optical flow as geometric conditioning to achieve structurally consistent motion amplification while suppressing noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Eulerian VMM approaches struggle to separate photon noise from true micro-motion when motion displacements are very small, even with decoupling representation learning techniques.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Noise-free Optical Flow Augmentation synthesizes diverse nonrigid motion fields without photon noise for supervision; 2) Diffusion Motion Magnifier conditions denoising on optical flow geometry prior and learnable magnification factor; 3) Flow-based Video Synthesis maps amplified motion back to image domain.

Result: Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets show GeoDiffMM outperforms state-of-the-art methods and significantly improves motion magnification quality.

Conclusion: GeoDiffMM successfully addresses noise amplification issues in VMM by leveraging diffusion models with geometric conditioning, enabling structurally consistent motion magnification while suppressing content-irrelevant perturbations.

Abstract: Video Motion Magnification (VMM) amplifies subtle macroscopic motions to a perceptible level. Recently, existing mainstream Eulerian approaches address amplification-induced noise via decoupling representation learning such as texture, shape and frequancey schemes, but they still struggle to separate photon noise from true micro-motion when motion displacements are very small. We propose GeoDiffMM, a novel diffusion-based Lagrangian VMM framework conditioned on optical flow as a geometric cue, enabling structurally consistent motion magnification. Specifically, we design a Noise-free Optical Flow Augmentation strategy that synthesizes diverse nonrigid motion fields without photon noise as supervision, helping the model learn more accurate geometry-aware optial flow and generalize better. Next, we develop a Diffusion Motion Magnifier that conditions the denoising process on (i) optical flow as a geometry prior and (ii) a learnable magnification factor controlling magnitude, thereby selectively amplifying motion components consistent with scene semantics and structure while suppressing content-irrelevant perturbations. Finally, we perform Flow-based Video Synthesis to map the amplified motion back to the image domain with high fidelity. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets show that GeoDiffMM outperforms state-of-the-art methods and significantly improves motion magnification.

TL;DR: Automated camera alignment system for surgical videos that selects least-occluded views and maintains fixed perspective despite lamp movement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical videos are valuable for education/research but suffer from surgeon occlusion and labor-intensive camera adjustments. Existing multi-camera setups require manual alignment when lamps are moved.

Method: Detects lighting system movement frames, automatically realigns cameras, selects least-occluded camera views, and synthesizes consistent fixed-perspective videos with multiple synthesis options.

Result: Surgeon user study showed superior ease of confirming surgical area and viewing comfort vs conventional methods. Improved video quality over existing techniques. Multiple synthesis options assessed for surgeon preferences.

Conclusion: Fully automated alignment system successfully generates high-quality surgical videos with consistent perspective, addressing occlusion and labor issues in surgical video capture.

Abstract: Video recordings of open surgeries are greatly required for education and research purposes. However, capturing unobstructed videos is challenging since surgeons frequently block the camera field of view. To avoid occlusion, the positions and angles of the camera must be frequently adjusted, which is highly labor-intensive. Prior work has addressed this issue by installing multiple cameras on a shadowless lamp and arranging them to fully surround the surgical area. This setup increases the chances of some cameras capturing an unobstructed view. However, manual image alignment is needed in post-processing since camera configurations change every time surgeons move the lamp for optimal lighting. This paper aims to fully automate this alignment task. The proposed method identifies frames in which the lighting system moves, realigns them, and selects the camera with the least occlusion to generate a video that consistently presents the surgical field from a fixed perspective. A user study involving surgeons demonstrated that videos generated by our method were superior to those produced by conventional methods in terms of the ease of confirming the surgical area and the comfort during video viewing. Additionally, our approach showed improvements in video quality over existing techniques. Furthermore, we implemented several synthesis options for the proposed view-synthesis method and conducted a user study to assess surgeons' preferences for each option.

TL;DR: LSQMM is a novel quaternion-based classification method for color images that treats RGB channels as pure quaternions and uses quaternion nuclear norm regularization for low-rank structure, achieving better accuracy and efficiency than SVM/SMM/STM methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional color image classification uses vector/matrix/tensor representations in real field, but quaternion modeling has shown success in image recovery/denoising. The authors want to preserve intrinsic coupling relationships among RGB channels via quaternion algebra for better classification.

Method: Low-rank Support Quaternion Matrix Machine (LSQMM) treats RGB channels as pure quaternions, adds quaternion nuclear norm regularization to hinge loss to promote low-rank structures from correlated color channels, and uses ADMM-based iterative algorithm to solve the quaternion optimization model.

Result: Experimental results on multiple color image classification datasets show LSQMM has advantages in classification accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods using support vector machines, support matrix machines, and support tensor machines.

Conclusion: LSQMM effectively preserves channel coupling relationships via quaternion algebra and low-rank regularization, demonstrating superior performance for color image classification tasks compared to conventional real-field approaches.

Abstract: Input features are conventionally represented as vectors, matrices, or third order tensors in the real field, for color image classification. Inspired by the success of quaternion data modeling for color images in image recovery and denoising tasks, we propose a novel classification method for color image classification, named as the Low-rank Support Quaternion Matrix Machine (LSQMM), in which the RGB channels are treated as pure quaternions to effectively preserve the intrinsic coupling relationships among channels via the quaternion algebra. For the purpose of promoting low-rank structures resulting from strongly correlated color channels, a quaternion nuclear norm regularization term, serving as a natural extension of the conventional matrix nuclear norm to the quaternion domain, is added to the hinge loss in our LSQMM model. An Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based iterative algorithm is designed to effectively resolve the proposed quaternion optimization model. Experimental results on multiple color image classification datasets demonstrate that our proposed classification approach exhibits advantages in classification accuracy, robustness and computational efficiency, compared to several state-of-the-art methods using support vector machines, support matrix machines, and support tensor machines.

TL;DR: GPU-optimized rotation-invariant convolution framework for UAV aerial imagery segmentation that eliminates im2col step, reduces memory/computation via structured filter sharing, achieving 20-55% faster training and 15-45% lower energy than CUDNN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rotation invariance is essential for precise object-level segmentation in UAV aerial imagery where targets have arbitrary orientations, but conventional CNNs lack rotation invariance, and existing rotation-invariant methods are computationally expensive.

Method: Introduces GPU-optimized rotation-invariant convolution framework that eliminates traditional im2col step and exploits structured data sharing among symmetrically rotated filters to reduce memory traffic and computational redundancy, generalizable to arbitrary rotation angles.

Result: Achieves 20-55% faster training and 15-45% lower energy consumption than CUDNN; up to 45% speedup and 41% energy savings on 256×256 inputs; 6% accuracy improvement over non-rotation-aware baseline in U-Net segmentation.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an effective and highly efficient alternative to existing rotation-invariant CNN frameworks, enabling rotation-invariant segmentation with significantly reduced computational cost and energy consumption.

Abstract: Rotation invariance is essential for precise, object-level segmentation in UAV aerial imagery, where targets can have arbitrary orientations and exhibit fine-scale details. Conventional segmentation architectures like U-Net rely on convolution operators that are not rotation-invariant, leading to degraded segmentation accuracy across varying viewpoints. Rotation invariance can be achieved by expanding the filter bank across multiple orientations; however, this will significantly increase computational cost and memory traffic. In this paper, we introduce a GPU-optimized rotation-invariant convolution framework that eliminates the traditional data-lowering (im2col) step required for matrix-multiplication-based convolution. By exploiting structured data sharing among symmetrically rotated filters, our method achieves multi-orientation convolution with greatly reduced memory traffic and computational redundancy. We further generalize the approach to accelerate convolution with arbitrary (non-symmetric) rotation angles.
  Across extensive benchmarks, the proposed convolution achieves 20--55% faster training and 15--45% lower energy consumption than CUDNN, while maintaining accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art rotation-invariant methods. In the eight-orientation setting, our approach achieves up to 45% speedup and 41% energy savings on 256\(\times\)256 inputs, and 32% speedup and 23% lower energy usage on 1024\(\times\)1024 inputs. Integrated into a U-Net segmentation model, the framework yields up to 6% improvement in accuracy over the non-rotation-aware baseline. These results demonstrate that the proposed method provides an effective and highly efficient alternative to existing rotation-invariant CNN frameworks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Systematic XAI analysis reveals image protection mechanisms (Glaze/Nightshade) use structured, low-entropy perturbations coupled to image content across representational, spatial, and spectral domains, operating through feature-level deformation rather than semantic dislocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While empirical effectiveness of image protection mechanisms like Glaze and Nightshade is known, their internal structure, detectability, and representational behavior remain poorly understood, requiring systematic explainable AI analysis.

Method: Unified framework integrating white-box feature-space inspection and black-box signal-level probing, including latent-space clustering, feature-channel activation analysis, occlusion-based spatial sensitivity mapping, and frequency-domain characterization.

Result: Protection mechanisms operate as structured, low-entropy perturbations tightly coupled to image content; protected images preserve content-driven feature organization with protection-specific substructure; detectability governed by perturbation entropy, spatial deployment, and frequency alignment; sequential protection amplifies detectable structure; frequency analysis shows energy redistribution along dominant image-aligned frequency axes.

Conclusion: Contemporary image protection operates through structured feature-level deformation rather than semantic dislocation, explaining why protection signals remain visually subtle yet consistently detectable; advances interpretability of adversarial image protection and informs future defense/detection strategies for generative AI systems.

Abstract: Recent image protection mechanisms such as Glaze and Nightshade introduce imperceptible, adversarially designed perturbations intended to disrupt downstream text-to-image generative models. While their empirical effectiveness is known, the internal structure, detectability, and representational behavior of these perturbations remain poorly understood. This study provides a systematic, explainable AI analysis using a unified framework that integrates white-box feature-space inspection and black-box signal-level probing. Through latent-space clustering, feature-channel activation analysis, occlusion-based spatial sensitivity mapping, and frequency-domain characterization, we show that protection mechanisms operate as structured, low-entropy perturbations tightly coupled to underlying image content across representational, spatial, and spectral domains. Protected images preserve content-driven feature organization with protection-specific substructure rather than inducing global representational drift. Detectability is governed by interacting effects of perturbation entropy, spatial deployment, and frequency alignment, with sequential protection amplifying detectable structure rather than suppressing it. Frequency-domain analysis shows that Glaze and Nightshade redistribute energy along dominant image-aligned frequency axes rather than introducing diffuse noise. These findings indicate that contemporary image protection operates through structured feature-level deformation rather than semantic dislocation, explaining why protection signals remain visually subtle yet consistently detectable. This work advances the interpretability of adversarial image protection and informs the design of future defenses and detection strategies for generative AI systems.

Conclusion: LiDAS enables zero-shot nighttime generalization of daytime-trained models through adaptive illumination control, offering cost-effective robust nighttime perception.

Abstract: Nighttime environments pose significant challenges for camera-based perception, as existing methods passively rely on the scene lighting. We introduce Lighting-driven Dynamic Active Sensing (LiDAS), a closed-loop active illumination system that combines off-the-shelf visual perception models with high-definition headlights. Rather than uniformly brightening the scene, LiDAS dynamically predicts an optimal illumination field that maximizes downstream perception performance, i.e., decreasing light on empty areas to reallocate it on object regions. LiDAS enables zero-shot nighttime generalization of daytime-trained models through adaptive illumination control. Trained on synthetic data and deployed zero-shot in real-world closed-loop driving scenarios, LiDAS enables +18.7% mAP50 and +5.0% mIoU over standard low-beam at equal power. It maintains performances while reducing energy use by 40%. LiDAS complements domain-generalization methods, further strengthening robustness without retraining. By turning readily available headlights into active vision actuators, LiDAS offers a cost-effective solution to robust nighttime perception.

TL;DR: MELLA dataset addresses low-resource language MLLM limitations by combining cultural and linguistic data sources to improve both cultural groundedness and linguistic capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multilingual MLLM enhancement methods focus only on text or machine translation, producing "thin descriptions" that lack multimodal informativeness and cultural groundedness needed for effective low-resource language support.

Method: Proposes a dual-source strategy: native web alt-text for cultural groundedness and MLLM-generated captions for linguistic capability. Implements this as MELLA, a multimodal multilingual dataset for fine-tuning MLLMs.

Result: Fine-tuning on MELLA improves performance across eight languages on various MLLM backbones, with models producing "thick descriptions" that combine cultural knowledge and linguistic capability.

Conclusion: The MELLA dataset successfully addresses both linguistic capability and cultural groundedness for low-resource languages, demonstrating that performance gains come from both cultural knowledge enhancement and linguistic capability improvement.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in high-resource languages. However, their effectiveness diminishes significantly in the contexts of low-resource languages. Current multilingual enhancement methods are often limited to text modality or rely solely on machine translation. While such approaches help models acquire basic linguistic capabilities and produce "thin descriptions", they neglect the importance of multimodal informativeness and cultural groundedness, both of which are crucial for serving low-resource language users effectively. To bridge this gap, in this study, we identify two significant objectives for a truly effective MLLM in low-resource language settings, namely 1) linguistic capability and 2) cultural groundedness, placing special emphasis on cultural awareness. To achieve these dual objectives, we propose a dual-source strategy that guides the collection of data tailored to each goal, sourcing native web alt-text for culture and MLLM-generated captions for linguistics. As a concrete implementation, we introduce MELLA, a multimodal, multilingual dataset. Experiment results show that after fine-tuning on MELLA, there is a general performance improvement for the eight languages on various MLLM backbones, with models producing "thick descriptions". We verify that the performance gains are from both cultural knowledge enhancement and linguistic capability enhancement. Our dataset can be found at https://opendatalab.com/applyMultilingualCorpus.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-supervised methods struggle with 3D data due to unordered and uneven density; contrastive models overfit while 3D Mask Autoencoders can't handle point cloud disorder.

Method: Proposes PointDico that integrates diffusion and contrastive learning via knowledge distillation, using hierarchical pyramid conditional generator for multi-scale features and dual-channel design for local-global context.

Result: Achieves 94.32% accuracy on ScanObjectNN and 86.5% instance mIoU on ShapeNetPart, setting new state-of-the-art for 3D representation learning.

Conclusion: PointDico successfully combines diffusion and contrastive learning advantages to overcome limitations of existing methods for 3D point cloud representation.

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning has shown significant improvement in Natural Language Processing and 2D Computer Vision. However, existing methods face difficulties in representing 3D data because of its unordered and uneven density. Through an in-depth analysis of mainstream contrastive and generative approaches, we find that contrastive models tend to suffer from overfitting, while 3D Mask Autoencoders struggle to handle unordered point clouds. This motivates us to learn 3D representations by sharing the merits of diffusion and contrast models, which is non-trivial due to the pattern difference between the two paradigms. In this paper, we propose \textit{PointDico}, a novel model that seamlessly integrates these methods. \textit{PointDico} learns from both denoising generative modeling and cross-modal contrastive learning through knowledge distillation, where the diffusion model serves as a guide for the contrastive model. We introduce a hierarchical pyramid conditional generator for multi-scale geometric feature extraction and employ a dual-channel design to effectively integrate local and global contextual information. \textit{PointDico} achieves a new state-of-the-art in 3D representation learning, \textit{e.g.}, \textbf{94.32\%} accuracy on ScanObjectNN, \textbf{86.5\%} Inst. mIoU on ShapeNetPart.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bi²MAC: A bimodal bi-adaptive mask-aware convolution method for pansharpening that uses soft/hard masks to route heterogeneous and redundant features to different processing branches for efficient high-resolution multispectral image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning pansharpening methods struggle with regional heterogeneity in feature representations. Adaptive convolution methods address this but suffer from high computational costs and limited ability to capture heterogeneous regions in remote sensing images.

Method: Proposes Bimodal Bi-Adaptive Mask-Aware Convolution (Bi²MAC) with a lightweight module generating both soft and hard masks. Soft masks modulate input features preliminarily, while hard masks guide different region types into separate branches: redundant features go to a compact branch for low-cost global processing, and heterogeneous features go to a focused branch with more computational resources for fine-grained modeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets while requiring substantially lower training time and parameter counts, with minimal computational cost among adaptive convolution models.

Conclusion: Bi²MAC effectively exploits information from different region types while intelligently allocating computational resources, overcoming limitations of conventional adaptive convolution methods for pansharpening tasks.

Abstract: Pansharpening aims to fuse a high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) image with a low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) image to generate a high-resolution multispectral image (HRMS). Conventional deep learning-based methods are inherently limited in their ability to adapt to regional heterogeneity within feature representations. Although various adaptive convolution methods have been proposed to address this limitation, they often suffer from excessive computational costs and a limited ability to capture heterogeneous regions in remote sensing images effectively. To overcome these challenges, we propose Bimodal Bi-Adaptive Mask-Aware Convolution (Bi^2MAC), which effectively exploits information from different types of regions while intelligently allocating computational resources. Specifically, we design a lightweight module to generate both soft and hard masks, which are used to modulate the input features preliminarily and to guide different types of regions into separate processing branches, respectively. Redundant features are directed to a compact branch for low-cost global processing. In contrast, heterogeneous features are routed to a focused branch that invests more computational resources for fine-grained modeling. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Bi^2MAC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while requiring substantially lower training time and parameter counts, and the minimal computational cost among adaptive convolution models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian splatting methods for rendering complex reflections face bottlenecks in rendering speed and memory storage, especially for photorealistic novel view synthesis of reflective scenes.

Method: Proposes HybridSplat with reflection-baked Gaussian tracing that bakes view-dependent reflections within each Gaussian primitive, integrates reflective and base primitives in unified framework, and adds pipeline acceleration with reflection-sensitive Gaussian pruning.

Result: Achieves 7x faster rendering speed across complex reflective scenes from Ref-NeRF and NeRF-Casting datasets with 4x fewer Gaussian primitives compared to ray-tracing based Gaussian splatting baselines.

Conclusion: HybridSplat establishes a new state-of-the-art method for complex reflective scenes, significantly improving rendering speed and memory efficiency while preserving reflection quality.

Abstract: Rendering complex reflection of real-world scenes using 3D Gaussian splatting has been a quite promising solution for photorealistic novel view synthesis, but still faces bottlenecks especially in rendering speed and memory storage. This paper proposes a new Hybrid Splatting(HybridSplat) mechanism for Gaussian primitives. Our key idea is a new reflection-baked Gaussian tracing, which bakes the view-dependent reflection within each Gaussian primitive while rendering the reflection using tile-based Gaussian splatting. Then we integrate the reflective Gaussian primitives with base Gaussian primitives using a unified hybrid splatting framework for high-fidelity scene reconstruction. Moreover, we further introduce a pipeline-level acceleration for the hybrid splatting, and reflection-sensitive Gaussian pruning to reduce the model size, thus achieving much faster rendering speed and lower memory storage while preserving the reflection rendering quality. By extensive evaluation, our HybridSplat accelerates about 7x rendering speed across complex reflective scenes from Ref-NeRF, NeRF-Casting with 4x fewer Gaussian primitives than similar ray-tracing based Gaussian splatting baselines, serving as a new state-of-the-art method especially for complex reflective scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recover missing BOLD fMRI information when corrupted/unavailable, enabling downstream tasks by generating BOLD from T1w structural MRI.

Method: DINOv3-guided multi-slice attention framework: frozen DINOv3 encoder extracts within-slice features, slice-attention module fuses cross-slice context, multi-scale decoder restores functional contrast with DINO-based perceptual loss.

Result: Outperforms conditional GAN baseline on 248-subject clinical dataset in PSNR and MS-SSIM metrics.

Conclusion: First framework for direct T1w-to-BOLD generation, demonstrating self-supervised transformer guidance potential for structural-to-functional mapping.

Abstract: Generating BOLD images from T1w images offers a promising solution for recovering missing BOLD information and enabling downstream tasks when BOLD images are corrupted or unavailable. Motivated by this, we propose DINO-BOLDNet, a DINOv3-guided multi-slice attention framework that integrates a frozen self-supervised DINOv3 encoder with a lightweight trainable decoder. The model uses DINOv3 to extract within-slice structural representations, and a separate slice-attention module to fuse contextual information across neighboring slices. A multi-scale generation decoder then restores fine-grained functional contrast, while a DINO-based perceptual loss encourages structural and textural consistency between predictions and ground-truth BOLD in the transformer feature space. Experiments on a clinical dataset of 248 subjects show that DINO-BOLDNet surpasses a conditional GAN baseline in both PSNR and MS-SSIM. To our knowledge, this is the first framework capable of generating mean BOLD images directly from T1w images, highlighting the potential of self-supervised transformer guidance for structural-to-functional mapping.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monocular 3D tracking methods fail to properly separate camera motion from foreground dynamic motion and cannot densely track newly emerging dynamic subjects in videos.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) Tracking upsampler lifts sparse 2D tracks to dense 2D tracks; 2) Generalization to newly emerging objects by applying upsampler to all frames and eliminating redundant tracks in overlapped regions; 3) Optimization-based framework back-projects dense 2D tracks into world-centric 3D trajectories by estimating camera poses and 3D coordinates.

Result: Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate accurate and dense 3D tracking in a world-centric coordinate frame.

Conclusion: TrackingWorld successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by providing a comprehensive solution for dense 3D tracking of almost all pixels within a world-centric coordinate system from monocular video.

Abstract: Monocular 3D tracking aims to capture the long-term motion of pixels in 3D space from a single monocular video and has witnessed rapid progress in recent years. However, we argue that the existing monocular 3D tracking methods still fall short in separating the camera motion from foreground dynamic motion and cannot densely track newly emerging dynamic subjects in the videos. To address these two limitations, we propose TrackingWorld, a novel pipeline for dense 3D tracking of almost all pixels within a world-centric 3D coordinate system. First, we introduce a tracking upsampler that efficiently lifts the arbitrary sparse 2D tracks into dense 2D tracks. Then, to generalize the current tracking methods to newly emerging objects, we apply the upsampler to all frames and reduce the redundancy of 2D tracks by eliminating the tracks in overlapped regions. Finally, we present an efficient optimization-based framework to back-project dense 2D tracks into world-centric 3D trajectories by estimating the camera poses and the 3D coordinates of these 2D tracks. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our system achieves accurate and dense 3D tracking in a world-centric coordinate frame.

### [49] [The Unseen Bias: How Norm Discrepancy in Pre-Norm MLLMs Leads to Visual Information Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08374)
*Bozhou Li,Xinda Xue,Sihan Yang,Yang Shi,Xinlong Chen,Yushuo Guan,Yuanxing Zhang,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs using Pre-Norm architecture suffer from norm disparity between visual and text tokens, causing asymmetric update dynamics where visual tokens update slower. Adding a single LayerNorm after the visual projector fixes this imbalance and improves performance on both multimodal and text-only benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with Pre-Norm architecture have a critical flaw: severe norm disparity between high-norm visual tokens and low-norm text tokens. This imbalance isn't static but creates asymmetric update dynamics where visual tokens transform much slower than text tokens, impairing effective cross-modal feature fusion.

Method: The paper presents formal theoretical analysis showing norm disparity causes "representational inertia" in visual tokens. Based on this insight, they propose a simple solution: inserting a single, carefully initialized LayerNorm layer after the visual projector to enforce norm alignment between visual and text tokens.

Result: Empirical validation across mainstream MLLMs confirms the prevalence of norm disparity and asymmetric update rates. Experiments on LLaVA-1.5 architecture show the LayerNorm intervention yields significant performance gains on multimodal benchmarks and surprisingly also on text-only evaluations like MMLU.

Conclusion: The norm disparity in Pre-Norm MLLMs is a fundamental architectural imbalance that impairs cross-modal fusion. A simple LayerNorm fix resolves this imbalance, leading to more holistically capable models that perform better on both multimodal and unimodal tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which couple pre-trained vision encoders and language models, have shown remarkable capabilities. However, their reliance on the ubiquitous Pre-Norm architecture introduces a subtle yet critical flaw: a severe norm disparity between the high-norm visual tokens and the low-norm text tokens. In this work, we present a formal theoretical analysis demonstrating that this imbalance is not a static issue. Instead, it induces an ``asymmetric update dynamic,'' where high-norm visual tokens exhibit a ``representational inertia,'' causing them to transform semantically much slower than their textual counterparts. This fundamentally impairs effective cross-modal feature fusion. Our empirical validation across a range of mainstream MLLMs confirms that this theoretical dynamic -- the persistence of norm disparity and the resulting asymmetric update rates -- is a prevalent phenomenon. Based on this insight, we propose a remarkably simple yet effective solution: inserting a single, carefully initialized LayerNorm layer after the visual projector to enforce norm alignment. Experiments conducted on the LLaVA-1.5 architecture show that this intervention yields significant performance gains not only on a wide suite of multimodal benchmarks but also, notably, on text-only evaluations such as MMLU, suggesting that resolving the architectural imbalance leads to a more holistically capable model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel framework for simultaneous image enhancement and noise suppression under complex illumination conditions using gradient-domain weighted guided filtering, Retinex decomposition, and multi-exposure fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image enhancement methods either amplify noise excessively or only work well under specific lighting conditions, limiting their effectiveness in challenging illumination scenarios.

Method: Three-stage approach: 1) GDWGIF for illumination estimation and initial enhancement, 2) Retinex decomposition into illumination/reflection layers with parallel processing, 3) Multi-exposure fusion and linear stretching for dynamic range optimization.

Result: Experimental evaluation on real-world datasets shows superior performance in both contrast enhancement and noise suppression compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by providing robust simultaneous enhancement and noise suppression under complex illumination conditions.

Abstract: Under challenging light conditions, captured images often suffer from various degradations, leading to a decline in the performance of vision-based applications. Although numerous methods have been proposed to enhance image quality, they either significantly amplify inherent noise or are only effective under specific illumination conditions. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework for simultaneous enhancement and noise suppression under complex illumination conditions. Firstly, a gradient-domain weighted guided filter (GDWGIF) is employed to accurately estimate illumination and improve image quality. Next, the Retinex model is applied to decompose the captured image into separate illumination and reflection layers. These layers undergo parallel processing, with the illumination layer being corrected to optimize lighting conditions and the reflection layer enhanced to improve image quality. Finally, the dynamic range of the image is optimized through multi-exposure fusion and a linear stretching strategy. The proposed method is evaluated on real-world datasets obtained from practical applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves better performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in both contrast enhancement and noise suppression.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facial retouching is widely used for beautification but poses a serious problem when retouched images are enrolled in biometric systems, as it challenges face recognition accuracy. Detection of facial retouching is increasingly necessary to maintain biometric system integrity.

Method: The study analyzes changes in beauty assessment algorithms on retouched images, assesses different AI-based feature extraction methods for retouching detection, and evaluates whether face beauty metrics can enhance detection rates.

Result: The approach achieved 1.1% D-EER (Detection Equal Error Rate) on single image detection in scenarios where the attacking retouching algorithm is unknown, demonstrating effective retouching detection.

Conclusion: Beauty assessment algorithms and AI-based feature extraction can effectively detect facial retouching in biometric systems, even when the specific retouching method is unknown, with promising detection performance.

Abstract: Facial retouching to beautify images is widely spread in social media, advertisements, and it is even applied in professional photo studios to let individuals appear younger, remove wrinkles and skin impurities. Generally speaking, this is done to enhance beauty. This is not a problem itself, but when retouched images are used as biometric samples and enrolled in a biometric system, it is one. Since previous work has proven facial retouching to be a challenge for face recognition systems,the detection of facial retouching becomes increasingly necessary. This work proposes to study and analyze changes in beauty assessment algorithms of retouched images, assesses different feature extraction methods based on artificial intelligence in order to improve retouching detection, and evaluates whether face beauty can be exploited to enhance the detection rate. In a scenario where the attacking retouching algorithm is unknown, this work achieved 1.1% D-EER on single image detection.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively addresses automated fish re-identification for EM systems, with Vision Transformers showing superior performance over CNNs, though distinguishing visually similar individuals of the same species remains the primary challenge.

Abstract: Accurate fisheries data are crucial for effective and sustainable marine resource management. With the recent adoption of Electronic Monitoring (EM) systems, more video data is now being collected than can be feasibly reviewed manually. This paper addresses this challenge by developing an optimized deep learning pipeline for automated fish re-identification (Re-ID) using the novel AutoFish dataset, which simulates EM systems with conveyor belts with six similarly looking fish species. We demonstrate that key Re-ID metrics (R1 and mAP@k) are substantially improved by using hard triplet mining in conjunction with a custom image transformation pipeline that includes dataset-specific normalization. By employing these strategies, we demonstrate that the Vision Transformer-based Swin-T architecture consistently outperforms the Convolutional Neural Network-based ResNet-50, achieving peak performance of 41.65% mAP@k and 90.43% Rank-1 accuracy. An in-depth analysis reveals that the primary challenge is distinguishing visually similar individuals of the same species (Intra-species errors), where viewpoint inconsistency proves significantly more detrimental than partial occlusion.

Conclusion: SAM-Body4D provides a training-free solution for temporally consistent and occlusion-robust human mesh recovery from videos, addressing limitations of per-frame inference methods while maintaining efficiency for multi-human scenarios.

Abstract: Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) aims to reconstruct 3D human pose and shape from 2D observations and is fundamental to human-centric understanding in real-world scenarios. While recent image-based HMR methods such as SAM 3D Body achieve strong robustness on in-the-wild images, they rely on per-frame inference when applied to videos, leading to temporal inconsistency and degraded performance under occlusions. We address these issues without extra training by leveraging the inherent human continuity in videos. We propose SAM-Body4D, a training-free framework for temporally consistent and occlusion-robust HMR from videos. We first generate identity-consistent masklets using a promptable video segmentation model, then refine them with an Occlusion-Aware module to recover missing regions. The refined masklets guide SAM 3D Body to produce consistent full-body mesh trajectories, while a padding-based parallel strategy enables efficient multi-human inference. Experimental results demonstrate that SAM-Body4D achieves improved temporal stability and robustness in challenging in-the-wild videos, without any retraining.

Conclusion: OneClip-RAG effectively addresses memory limitations of MLLMs for long-video processing through efficient retrieval augmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Due to excessive memory overhead, most Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can only process videos of limited frames. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient paradigm to remedy this shortcoming, termed One-shot video-Clip based Retrieval AuGmentation (OneClip-RAG). Compared with existing video RAG methods, OneClip-RAG makes full use of the merits of video clips for augmented video understanding in terms of both knowledge integrity and semantic coherence. Besides, it is also equipped with a novel query-guided video chunking algorithm that can unify clip chunking and cross-modal retrieval in one processing step, avoiding redundant computations. To improve instruction following, we further propose a new dataset called SynLongVideo and design a progressive training regime for OneClip-RAG. OneClip-RAG is plugged into five recent MLLMs and validated on a set of long-video benchmarks. Experimental results not only show the obvious performance gains by OneClip-RAG over MLLMs, e.g., boosting InternLV2 8B and Qwen2-VL 7B to the level of GPT-4o on MLVU, but also show its superior efficiency in handling long videos. e.g., enabling LLaVA-Video understand up to an hour of videos in less than 2.2 minutes on a single 4090 GPU.

Method: LapFM uses Hierarchical Concept Evolving Pre-training: 1) Creates Laparoscopic Concept Hierarchy (LCH) with hierarchical mask decoder and parent-child query embeddings to unify diverse entities (Anatomy, Tissue, Instrument) into scalable knowledge structure; 2) Implements Confidence-driven Evolving Labeling that iteratively generates and filters pseudo-labels based on hierarchical consistency, progressively incorporating reliable samples from unlabeled images.

Result: Creates LapBench-114K benchmark with 114K image-mask pairs. Extensive experiments show LapFM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing new standards for granularity-adaptive generalization in universal laparoscopic segmentation.

Conclusion: LapFM represents a true surgical foundation model that evolves robust segmentation capabilities from massive unlabeled surgical images, addressing limitations of existing approaches and demonstrating superior generalization across diverse laparoscopic procedures.

Abstract: Surgical segmentation is pivotal for scene understanding yet remains hindered by annotation scarcity and semantic inconsistency across diverse procedures. Existing approaches typically fine-tune natural foundation models (e.g., SAM) with limited supervision, functioning merely as domain adapters rather than surgical foundation models. Consequently, they struggle to generalize across the vast variability of surgical targets. To bridge this gap, we present LapFM, a foundation model designed to evolve robust segmentation capabilities from massive unlabeled surgical images. Distinct from medical foundation models relying on inefficient self-supervised proxy tasks, LapFM leverages a Hierarchical Concept Evolving Pre-training paradigm. First, we establish a Laparoscopic Concept Hierarchy (LCH) via a hierarchical mask decoder with parent-child query embeddings, unifying diverse entities (i.e., Anatomy, Tissue, and Instrument) into a scalable knowledge structure with cross-granularity semantic consistency. Second, we propose a Confidence-driven Evolving Labeling that iteratively generates and filters pseudo-labels based on hierarchical consistency, progressively incorporating reliable samples from unlabeled images into training. This process yields LapBench-114K, a large-scale benchmark comprising 114K image-mask pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LapFM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing new standards for granularity-adaptive generalization in universal laparoscopic segmentation.

*Luca Cogo,Marco Buzzelli,Simone Bianco,Javier Vazquez-Corral,Raimondo Schettini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unified learning-based framework for color correction using both high-res RGB and low-res multispectral sensors in an end-to-end pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat color correction in separate stages and discard multispectral data early, failing to fully leverage the richer spectral information from compact MS sensors now available in consumer devices.

Method: Proposes a unified learning-based framework that performs end-to-end color correction by jointly leveraging data from high-resolution RGB and auxiliary low-resolution MS sensors, integrating the full pipeline within a single model. The framework is flexible enough to refactor two different state-of-the-art image-to-image architectures.

Result: Extensive experiments show improved color accuracy and stability, reducing error by up to 50% compared to RGB-only and MS-driven baselines. A dedicated dataset was created by aggregating and repurposing publicly available spectral datasets with multiple RGB camera sensitivities.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework effectively leverages multispectral information for color correction, outperforming existing approaches while maintaining flexibility across different architectures. The method, dataset, and models will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advances in snapshot multispectral (MS) imaging have enabled compact, low-cost spectral sensors for consumer and mobile devices. By capturing richer spectral information than conventional RGB sensors, these systems can enhance key imaging tasks, including color correction. However, most existing methods treat the color correction pipeline in separate stages, often discarding MS data early in the process. We propose a unified, learning-based framework that (i) performs end-to-end color correction and (ii) jointly leverages data from a high-resolution RGB sensor and an auxiliary low-resolution MS sensor. Our approach integrates the full pipeline within a single model, producing coherent and color-accurate outputs. We demonstrate the flexibility and generality of our framework by refactoring two different state-of-the-art image-to-image architectures. To support training and evaluation, we construct a dedicated dataset by aggregating and repurposing publicly available spectral datasets, rendering under multiple RGB camera sensitivities. Extensive experiments show that our approach improves color accuracy and stability, reducing error by up to 50% compared to RGB-only and MS-driven baselines. Datasets, code, and models will be made available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: ContextDrag: A new drag-based image editing method that leverages contextual modeling from reference images to preserve fine-grained details without finetuning, using Context-preserving Token Injection and Position-Consistent Attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing drag-based image editing methods fail to fully exploit contextual information from reference images, including fine-grained texture details, leading to edits with limited coherence and fidelity.

Method: Introduces ContextDrag with two key components: 1) Context-preserving Token Injection (CTI) that injects noise-free reference features via Latent-space Reverse Mapping algorithm, and 2) Position-Consistent Attention (PCA) that re-encodes reference tokens with overlap-aware masking to eliminate irrelevant feature interference.

Result: Extensive experiments on DragBench-SR and DragBench-DR demonstrate that ContextDrag surpasses all existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ContextDrag provides a new paradigm for drag-based editing that leverages contextual modeling capabilities to achieve precise drag control while preserving semantic and texture consistency, without requiring finetuning or inversion.

Abstract: Drag-based image editing aims to modify visual content followed by user-specified drag operations. Despite existing methods having made notable progress, they still fail to fully exploit the contextual information in the reference image, including fine-grained texture details, leading to edits with limited coherence and fidelity. To address this challenge, we introduce ContextDrag, a new paradigm for drag-based editing that leverages the strong contextual modeling capability of editing models, such as FLUX-Kontext. By incorporating VAE-encoded features from the reference image, ContextDrag can leverage rich contextual cues and preserve fine-grained details, without the need for finetuning or inversion. Specifically, ContextDrag introduced a novel Context-preserving Token Injection (CTI) that injects noise-free reference features into their correct destination locations via a Latent-space Reverse Mapping (LRM) algorithm. This strategy enables precise drag control while preserving consistency in both semantics and texture details. Second, ContextDrag adopts a novel Position-Consistent Attention (PCA), which positional re-encodes the reference tokens and applies overlap-aware masking to eliminate interference from irrelevant reference features. Extensive experiments on DragBench-SR and DragBench-DR demonstrate that our approach surpasses all existing SOTA methods. Code will be publicly available.

*Madhav Gupta,Vishak Prasad C,Ganesh Ramakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Subset-based explanation methods degrade under OOD conditions; new framework combines submodular selection with gradient-based uncertainty estimation to improve robustness in both ID and OOD settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subset selection methods are popular for explaining deep vision models but their reliability under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions is poorly understood and they degrade significantly in OOD settings.

Method: Combines submodular subset selection with layer-wise, gradient-based uncertainty estimation using adaptive weight perturbations to guide submodular optimization for diverse and informative subset selection.

Result: Empirical evaluations show the framework mitigates weaknesses of existing methods under OOD scenarios and also yields improvements in in-distribution (ID) settings.

Conclusion: Highlights limitations of current subset-based approaches and demonstrates how uncertainty-driven optimization can enhance attribution and object-level interpretability for more transparent and trustworthy AI in vision applications.

Abstract: Subset selection-based methods are widely used to explain deep vision models: they attribute predictions by highlighting the most influential image regions and support object-level explanations. While these methods perform well in in-distribution (ID) settings, their behavior under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions remains poorly understood. Through extensive experiments across multiple ID-OOD sets, we find that reliability of the existing subset based methods degrades markedly, yielding redundant, unstable, and uncertainty-sensitive explanations. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a framework that combines submodular subset selection with layer-wise, gradient-based uncertainty estimation to improve robustness and fidelity without requiring additional training or auxiliary models. Our approach estimates uncertainty via adaptive weight perturbations and uses these estimates to guide submodular optimization, ensuring diverse and informative subset selection. Empirical evaluations show that, beyond mitigating the weaknesses of existing methods under OOD scenarios, our framework also yields improvements in ID settings. These findings highlight limitations of current subset-based approaches and demonstrate how uncertainty-driven optimization can enhance attribution and object-level interpretability, paving the way for more transparent and trustworthy AI in real-world vision applications.

Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting viewer solutions are fragmented, heavy, or constrained by legacy pipelines, resulting in high deployment friction and limited support for dynamic content and generative models.

Method: Built on efficient WebGPU renderer with per-frame ONNX inference, introduces standardized Gaussian Generator contract for plug-and-play algorithms, offers three.js library integration, and uses GPU-based primitive sorting.

Result: Achieves superior rendering efficiency compared to current Web viewers, supports multiple variants (MLP-based 3DGS, 4DGS, neural avatars, style transformation networks), and enables dynamic neural processing.

Conclusion: Visionary significantly lowers the barrier to reproduction, comparison, and deployment of 3DGS-family methods, serving as a unified World Model Carrier for both reconstructive and generative paradigms.

Abstract: Neural rendering, particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), has evolved rapidly and become a key component for building world models. However, existing viewer solutions remain fragmented, heavy, or constrained by legacy pipelines, resulting in high deployment friction and limited support for dynamic content and generative models. In this work, we present Visionary, an open, web-native platform for real-time various Gaussian Splatting and meshes rendering. Built on an efficient WebGPU renderer with per-frame ONNX inference, Visionary enables dynamic neural processing while maintaining a lightweight, "click-to-run" browser experience. It introduces a standardized Gaussian Generator contract, which not only supports standard 3DGS rendering but also allows plug-and-play algorithms to generate or update Gaussians each frame. Such inference also enables us to apply feedforward generative post-processing. The platform further offers a plug in three.js library with a concise TypeScript API for seamless integration into existing web applications. Experiments show that, under identical 3DGS assets, Visionary achieves superior rendering efficiency compared to current Web viewers due to GPU-based primitive sorting. It already supports multiple variants, including MLP-based 3DGS, 4DGS, neural avatars, and style transformation or enhancement networks. By unifying inference and rendering directly in the browser, Visionary significantly lowers the barrier to reproduction, comparison, and deployment of 3DGS-family methods, serving as a unified World Model Carrier for both reconstructive and generative paradigms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lightweight SAM-based football player tracking system combining SAM initialization with CSRT trackers and jersey color models achieves 7.6-7.7 FPS with stable memory, maintaining high success rates in most scenarios but struggling with long-term occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Football player tracking faces challenges from frequent occlusions, similar player appearances, and rapid motion in crowded scenes, requiring robust yet lightweight solutions.

Method: Team-aware tracking system using SAM for precise initialization, CSRT trackers for continuous tracking, and HSV histogram-based jersey color models for re-identification during occlusions.

Result: Achieves 7.6-7.7 FPS with ~1880 MB memory, 100% tracking success in light occlusions, 90% in crowded penalty-box scenarios, and 50% recovery in heavy occlusions, but only 8.66% re-acquisition success for long-term occlusions.

Conclusion: SAM + CSRT combination works well for continuous visibility but requires stronger re-identification mechanisms for extended absences, offering practical guidelines for resource-constrained football tracking deployments.

Abstract: Football player tracking is challenged by frequent occlusions, similar appearances, and rapid motion in crowded scenes. This paper presents a lightweight SAM-based tracking method combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with CSRT trackers and jersey color-based appearance models. We propose a team-aware tracking system that uses SAM for precise initialization and HSV histogram-based re-identification to improve occlusion recovery. Our evaluation measures three dimensions: processing speed (FPS and memory), tracking accuracy (success rate and box stability), and robustness (occlusion recovery and identity consistency). Experiments on football video sequences show that the approach achieves 7.6-7.7 FPS with stable memory usage (~1880 MB), maintaining 100 percent tracking success in light occlusions and 90 percent in crowded penalty-box scenarios with 5 or more players. Appearance-based re-identification recovers 50 percent of heavy occlusions, demonstrating the value of domain-specific cues. Analysis reveals key trade-offs: the SAM + CSRT combination provides consistent performance across crowd densities but struggles with long-term occlusions where players leave the frame, achieving only 8.66 percent re-acquisition success. These results offer practical guidelines for deploying football tracking systems under resource constraints, showing that classical tracker-based methods work well with continuous visibility but require stronger re-identification mechanisms for extended absences.

*Jiaming Zhang,Che Wang,Yang Cao,Longtao Huang,Wei Yang Bryan Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReasonBreak is an adversarial framework that disrupts MLRMs' hierarchical reasoning for geographic location inference using concept-aware perturbations, achieving significant privacy protection improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal large reasoning models (MLRMs) pose serious privacy risks by inferring precise geographic locations from personal images through sophisticated hierarchical reasoning. Existing privacy protection techniques designed for perception-based models are ineffective against MLRMs' multi-step reasoning processes.

Method: ReasonBreak uses concept-aware perturbations aligned with conceptual hierarchies to disrupt geographic reasoning. It strategically targets critical conceptual dependencies within reasoning chains, generating perturbations that invalidate specific inference steps and cascade through subsequent reasoning stages. The approach is supported by GeoPrivacy-6K, a dataset of 6,341 ultra-high-resolution images with hierarchical concept annotations.

Result: Extensive evaluation across seven state-of-the-art MLRMs (including GPT-o3, GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro) shows ReasonBreak's superior effectiveness: 14.4% improvement in tract-level protection (33.8% vs 19.4%) and nearly doubled block-level protection (33.5% vs 16.8%).

Conclusion: This work establishes a new paradigm for privacy protection against reasoning-based threats by demonstrating that effective disruption requires perturbations aligned with conceptual hierarchies rather than uniform noise, specifically targeting the hierarchical reasoning processes of MLRMs.

Abstract: Multi-modal large reasoning models (MLRMs) pose significant privacy risks by inferring precise geographic locations from personal images through hierarchical chain-of-thought reasoning. Existing privacy protection techniques, primarily designed for perception-based models, prove ineffective against MLRMs' sophisticated multi-step reasoning processes that analyze environmental cues. We introduce \textbf{ReasonBreak}, a novel adversarial framework specifically designed to disrupt hierarchical reasoning in MLRMs through concept-aware perturbations. Our approach is founded on the key insight that effective disruption of geographic reasoning requires perturbations aligned with conceptual hierarchies rather than uniform noise. ReasonBreak strategically targets critical conceptual dependencies within reasoning chains, generating perturbations that invalidate specific inference steps and cascade through subsequent reasoning stages. To facilitate this approach, we contribute \textbf{GeoPrivacy-6K}, a comprehensive dataset comprising 6,341 ultra-high-resolution images ($\geq$2K) with hierarchical concept annotations. Extensive evaluation across seven state-of-the-art MLRMs (including GPT-o3, GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro) demonstrates ReasonBreak's superior effectiveness, achieving a 14.4\% improvement in tract-level protection (33.8\% vs 19.4\%) and nearly doubling block-level protection (33.5\% vs 16.8\%).

TL;DR: Proposes quaternion Wasserstein distance and Wasserstein quaternion GAN for improved color image generation by modeling color channel correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing color image generation models ignore correlations among color channels, leading to chromatic aberration problems, and lack systematic theory for measuring color image datasets.

Method: Defines quaternion Wasserstein distance, develops its dual theory using quaternion convex set separation theorem and Farkas lemma, and proposes Wasserstein quaternion GAN.

Result: The proposed model surpasses both quaternion GANs and Wasserstein GANs in generation efficiency and image quality.

Conclusion: Quaternion Wasserstein distance provides theoretical foundation for color image generation, and the proposed GAN model effectively addresses color channel correlation issues.

Abstract: Color image generation has a wide range of applications, but the existing generation models ignore the correlation among color channels, which may lead to chromatic aberration problems. In addition, the data distribution problem of color images has not been systematically elaborated and explained, so that there is still the lack of the theory about measuring different color images datasets. In this paper, we define a new quaternion Wasserstein distance and develop its dual theory. To deal with the quaternion linear programming problem, we derive the strong duality form with helps of quaternion convex set separation theorem and quaternion Farkas lemma. With using quaternion Wasserstein distance, we propose a novel Wasserstein quaternion generative adversarial network. Experiments demonstrate that this novel model surpasses both the (quaternion) generative adversarial networks and the Wasserstein generative adversarial network in terms of generation efficiency and image quality.

TL;DR: PCI is a training-free framework that analyzes when concepts "lock in" during diffusion generation by measuring Concept Insertion Success across timesteps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion model evaluation focuses on final outputs, but understanding the dynamic generation process is crucial for analyzing controllability, reliability, and failure modes - specifically when noise transforms into specific concepts during denoising.

Method: Proposes PCI (Prompt-Conditioned Intervention), a training-free and model-agnostic framework that analyzes Concept Insertion Success (CIS) - the probability that a concept inserted at a given timestep is preserved in the final image, characterizing temporal concept formation dynamics.

Result: Reveals diverse temporal behaviors across diffusion models, showing certain trajectory phases are more favorable to specific concepts even within the same concept type. Provides actionable insights for text-driven image editing with quantitatively stronger edits balancing semantic accuracy and content preservation.

Conclusion: PCI enables analysis of concept dynamics in diffusion models without requiring model internals or training, offering practical applications for understanding generation processes and improving image editing interventions.

Abstract: Diffusion models are usually evaluated by their final outputs, gradually denoising random noise into meaningful images. Yet, generation unfolds along a trajectory, and analyzing this dynamic process is crucial for understanding how controllable, reliable, and predictable these models are in terms of their success/failure modes. In this work, we ask the question: when does noise turn into a specific concept (e.g., age) and lock in the denoising trajectory? We propose PCI (Prompt-Conditioned Intervention) to study this question. PCI is a training-free and model-agnostic framework for analyzing concept dynamics through diffusion time. The central idea is the analysis of Concept Insertion Success (CIS), defined as the probability that a concept inserted at a given timestep is preserved and reflected in the final image, offering a way to characterize the temporal dynamics of concept formation. Applied to several state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models and a broad taxonomy of concepts, PCI reveals diverse temporal behaviors across diffusion models, in which certain phases of the trajectory are more favorable to specific concepts even within the same concept type. These findings also provide actionable insights for text-driven image editing, highlighting when interventions are most effective without requiring access to model internals or training, and yielding quantitatively stronger edits that achieve a balance of semantic accuracy and content preservation than strong baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing on-the-fly 3DGS methods fail to achieve complete 3D coverage due to limited FOV from monocular cameras. Multi-camera rigs address this limitation but lack efficient reconstruction frameworks.

Method: Hierarchical camera initialization for coarse alignment without calibration, lightweight multi-camera bundle adjustment, redundancy-free Gaussian sampling, and frequency-aware optimization scheduler to maintain real-time performance.

Result: Reconstructs hundreds of meters of 3D scenes within just 2 minutes using raw multi-camera video streams, demonstrating unprecedented speed, robustness, and fidelity for on-the-fly reconstruction.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient, drift-free 3D reconstruction from multi-camera rigs with complete coverage, addressing FOV limitations of monocular approaches while maintaining real-time performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled efficient free-viewpoint rendering and photorealistic scene reconstruction. While on-the-fly extensions of 3DGS have shown promise for real-time reconstruction from monocular RGB streams, they often fail to achieve complete 3D coverage due to the limited field of view (FOV). Employing a multi-camera rig fundamentally addresses this limitation. In this paper, we present the first on-the-fly 3D reconstruction framework for multi-camera rigs. Our method incrementally fuses dense RGB streams from multiple overlapping cameras into a unified Gaussian representation, achieving drift-free trajectory estimation and efficient online reconstruction. We propose a hierarchical camera initialization scheme that enables coarse inter-camera alignment without calibration, followed by a lightweight multi-camera bundle adjustment that stabilizes trajectories while maintaining real-time performance. Furthermore, we introduce a redundancy-free Gaussian sampling strategy and a frequency-aware optimization scheduler to reduce the number of Gaussian primitives and the required optimization iterations, thereby maintaining both efficiency and reconstruction fidelity. Our method reconstructs hundreds of meters of 3D scenes within just 2 minutes using only raw multi-camera video streams, demonstrating unprecedented speed, robustness, and Fidelity for on-the-fly 3D scene reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoisyCLIP enables early detection of text-image misalignments during diffusion model generation by measuring semantic alignment in noisy latent space, reducing computational cost by 50% while maintaining 98% of CLIP performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current conditional diffusion models suffer from misalignment and hallucinations, requiring expensive post-generation alignment checks. The authors hypothesize that misalignments can be detected early in the denoising process to enable real-time assessment without waiting for complete generation.

Method: Proposes NoisyCLIP, a method that measures semantic alignment in the noisy latent space during the reverse diffusion process. It uses dual encoders to detect prompt-to-latent misalignment early in image generation, enabling real-time alignment assessment.

Result: NoisyCLIP reduces computational cost by 50% while achieving 98% of CLIP alignment performance in Best-of-N settings. It enables real-time alignment assessment during generation without sacrificing semantic fidelity.

Conclusion: Early detection of text-image misalignments during the denoising process is feasible and efficient. NoisyCLIP provides a cost-effective solution for real-time alignment assessment in diffusion models, addressing the limitations of post-generation alignment checks.

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models rely on language-to-image alignment methods to steer the generation towards semantically accurate outputs. Despite the success of this architecture, misalignment and hallucinations remain common issues and require automatic misalignment detection tools to improve quality, for example by applying them in a Best-of-N (BoN) post-generation setting. Unfortunately, measuring the alignment after the generation is an expensive step since we need to wait for the overall generation to finish to determine prompt adherence. In contrast, this work hypothesizes that text/image misalignments can be detected early in the denoising process, enabling real-time alignment assessment without waiting for the complete generation. In particular, we propose NoisyCLIP a method that measures semantic alignment in the noisy latent space. This work is the first to explore and benchmark prompt-to-latent misalignment detection during image generation using dual encoders in the reverse diffusion process. We evaluate NoisyCLIP qualitatively and quantitatively and find it reduces computational cost by 50% while achieving 98% of CLIP alignment performance in BoN settings. This approach enables real-time alignment assessment during generation, reducing costs without sacrificing semantic fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP's template-sample similarity (TSS) introduces bias that reduces classification accuracy and robustness. The paper proposes using empty prompts to decouple and correct this template bias during pre-training and fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP's few-shot learning performance is hindered by template-sample similarity (TSS) bias, where the model relies on template proximity rather than true sample-to-category alignment, reducing both accuracy and robustness.

Method: A two-stage framework using empty prompts: 1) During pre-training, empty prompts reveal and reduce template-induced bias within CLIP encoder; 2) During few-shot fine-tuning, a bias calibration loss enforces correct alignment between images and their categories.

Result: Experiments across multiple benchmarks show the template correction method significantly reduces performance fluctuations caused by TSS, yielding higher classification accuracy and stronger robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully decouples template bias in CLIP, improving few-shot classification performance by ensuring the model focuses on relevant visual cues rather than template proximity.

Abstract: The Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) model excels in few-shot learning by aligning visual and textual representations. Our study shows that template-sample similarity (TSS), defined as the resemblance between a text template and an image sample, introduces bias. This bias leads the model to rely on template proximity rather than true sample-to-category alignment, reducing both accuracy and robustness in classification. We present a framework that uses empty prompts, textual inputs that convey the idea of "emptiness" without category information. These prompts capture unbiased template features and offset TSS bias. The framework employs two stages. During pre-training, empty prompts reveal and reduce template-induced bias within the CLIP encoder. During few-shot fine-tuning, a bias calibration loss enforces correct alignment between images and their categories, ensuring the model focuses on relevant visual cues. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our template correction method significantly reduces performance fluctuations caused by TSS, yielding higher classification accuracy and stronger robustness.

Motivation: The main challenge is accurately reconstructing building surfaces from LiDAR point clouds that have varying point densities and noise interference, requiring flexible methods to capture high-quality 3D profiles at diverse resolutions.

Method: OCCDiff combines latent diffusion with function autoencoders to generate continuous occupancy functions. It uses a point encoder for condition features, occupancy constraints, and multi-modal feature insertion. Multi-task training ensures robust feature learning.

Result: The method generates physically consistent samples with high fidelity to target distributions and demonstrates robustness to noisy data in empirical evaluations.

Conclusion: OCCDiff effectively addresses building reconstruction challenges by leveraging latent diffusion in occupancy function space, providing flexible and robust surface reconstruction from LiDAR data with varying quality.

Abstract: A major challenge in reconstructing buildings from LiDAR point clouds lies in accurately capturing building surfaces under varying point densities and noise interference. To flexibly gather high-quality 3D profiles of the building in diverse resolution, we propose OCCDiff applying latent diffusion in the occupancy function space. Our OCCDiff combines a latent diffusion process with a function autoencoder architecture to generate continuous occupancy functions evaluable at arbitrary locations. Moreover, a point encoder is proposed to provide condition features to diffusion learning, constraint the final occupancy prediction for occupancy decoder, and insert multi-modal features for latent generation to latent encoder. To further enhance the model performance, a multi-task training strategy is employed, ensuring that the point encoder learns diverse and robust feature representations. Empirical results show that our method generates physically consistent samples with high fidelity to the target distribution and exhibits robustness to noisy data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing aerial VLN methods require panoramic images, depth inputs, or odometry, which increase system cost and complexity, hindering practical deployment on lightweight UAVs. There's a need for simpler, more practical solutions using only monocular RGB observations.

Method: Unified framework treating navigation as next-token prediction with joint optimization of spatial perception, trajectory reasoning, and action prediction via prompt-guided multi-task learning. Includes keyframe selection to reduce visual redundancy, and action merging with label reweighting to address long-tailed supervision imbalance.

Result: Achieves strong results on Aerial VLN benchmark under monocular RGB-only setting, outperforming existing RGB-only baselines and narrowing performance gap with state-of-the-art panoramic RGB-D methods across both seen and unseen environments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates that effective aerial VLN is possible with only monocular RGB observations, offering a more practical solution for lightweight UAV deployment while maintaining competitive performance through careful task design and architectural innovations.

Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to enable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex urban environments using onboard visual observation. This task holds promise for real-world applications such as low-altitude inspection, search-and-rescue, and autonomous aerial delivery. Existing methods often rely on panoramic images, depth inputs, or odometry to support spatial reasoning and action planning. These requirements increase system cost and integration complexity, thus hindering practical deployment for lightweight UAVs. We present a unified aerial VLN framework that operates solely on egocentric monocular RGB observations and natural language instructions. The model formulates navigation as a next-token prediction problem, jointly optimizing spatial perception, trajectory reasoning, and action prediction through prompt-guided multi-task learning. Moreover, we propose a keyframe selection strategy to reduce visual redundancy by retaining semantically informative frames, along with an action merging and label reweighting mechanism that mitigates long-tailed supervision imbalance and facilitates stable multi-task co-training. Extensive experiments on the Aerial VLN benchmark validate the effectiveness of our method. Under the challenging monocular RGB-only setting, our model achieves strong results across both seen and unseen environments. It significantly outperforms existing RGB-only baselines and narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art panoramic RGB-D counterparts. Comprehensive ablation studies further demonstrate the contribution of our task design and architectural choices.

*Wenxi Yang,Yuzhong Zhao,Fang Wan,Qixiang Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-Calling Chain-of-Thought (sCoT) reformulates multimodal reasoning as language-only CoT with self-calling to virtual replicas, improving performance while reducing training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing interleaved multimodal Chain-of-Thought (iMCoT) through reinforcement learning is challenging due to reliance on scarce high-quality reasoning data. Current thinking-with-images paradigms struggle with training effectiveness and efficiency.

Method: sCoT reformulates iMCoT as language-only CoT with self-calling: a main agent decomposes visual reasoning tasks into atomic subtasks and invokes parameter-sharing subagents (virtual replicas) to solve them in isolated context. Uses group-relative policy optimization to reinforce effective reasoning behavior.

Result: On HR-Bench 4K, sCoT improves overall reasoning performance by up to 1.9% while requiring ~75% fewer GPU hours compared to strong baseline approaches.

Conclusion: sCoT provides a more efficient and effective visual reasoning paradigm that avoids explicit interleaving between modalities, achieving better performance with significantly reduced computational costs.

Abstract: Thinking-with-images paradigms have showcased remarkable visual reasoning capability by integrating visual information as dynamic elements into the Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, optimizing interleaved multimodal CoT (iMCoT) through reinforcement learning remains challenging, as it relies on scarce high-quality reasoning data. In this study, we propose Self-Calling Chain-of-Thought (sCoT), a novel visual reasoning paradigm that reformulates iMCoT as a language-only CoT with self-calling. Specifically, a main agent decomposes the complex visual reasoning task to atomic subtasks and invokes its virtual replicas, i.e. parameter-sharing subagents, to solve them in isolated context. sCoT enjoys substantial training effectiveness and efficiency, as it requires no explicit interleaving between modalities. sCoT employs group-relative policy optimization to reinforce effective reasoning behavior to enhance optimization. Experiments on HR-Bench 4K show that sCoT improves the overall reasoning performance by up to $1.9\%$ with $\sim 75\%$ fewer GPU hours compared to strong baseline approaches.

*Kuniko Paxton,Zeinab Dehghani,Koorosh Aslansefat,Dhavalkumar Thakker,Yiannis Papadopoulos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a distribution-based framework for individual fairness in skin lesion classification, treating skin tone as continuous rather than categorical, using KDE modeling and statistical distance metrics with a reweighting loss to address minority tone underrepresentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fairness research in medical imaging uses coarse subgroup categories that overlook individual variations and risk obscuring biases faced by outliers within subgroups, particularly problematic for skin tone which is a continuous attribute.

Method: Treat skin tone as continuous attribute, use kernel density estimation (KDE) to model its distribution, compare 12 statistical distance metrics to quantify disparities, and propose distance-based reweighting (DRW) loss function to correct underrepresentation.

Result: Experiments show limitations of categorical reweighting for individual-level disparities, and superior performance of distribution-based reweighting, particularly with Fidelity Similarity (FS), Wasserstein Distance (WD), Hellinger Metric (HM), and Harmonic Mean Similarity (HS).

Conclusion: Establishes robust methodology for advancing individual-level fairness in dermatological AI systems, with broader implications for handling sensitive continuous attributes in medical image analysis.

Abstract: Skin color has historically been a focal point of discrimination, yet fairness research in machine learning for medical imaging often relies on coarse subgroup categories, overlooking individual-level variations. Such group-based approaches risk obscuring biases faced by outliers within subgroups. This study introduces a distribution-based framework for evaluating and mitigating individual fairness in skin lesion classification. We treat skin tone as a continuous attribute rather than a categorical label, and employ kernel density estimation (KDE) to model its distribution. We further compare twelve statistical distance metrics to quantify disparities between skin tone distributions and propose a distance-based reweighting (DRW) loss function to correct underrepresentation in minority tones. Experiments across CNN and Transformer models demonstrate: (i) the limitations of categorical reweighting in capturing individual-level disparities, and (ii) the superior performance of distribution-based reweighting, particularly with Fidelity Similarity (FS), Wasserstein Distance (WD), Hellinger Metric (HM), and Harmonic Mean Similarity (HS). These findings establish a robust methodology for advancing fairness at individual level in dermatological AI systems, and highlight broader implications for sensitive continuous attributes in medical image analysis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal language models require large parameter capacity to align visual features with linguistic representations, making them computationally heavy and difficult to deploy efficiently.

Method: Progressive reparameterization strategy that gradually replaces dense feed-forward network blocks with compact Parameterized Hypercomplex Multiplication (PHM) layers, using residual interpolation schedule with lightweight reconstruction and knowledge distillation losses.

Result: Substantial parameter and FLOP reductions while preserving strong multimodal alignment, enabling faster inference without degrading output quality. Maintains performance comparable to base models with significant reductions in model size and inference latency.

Conclusion: Progressive PHM substitution offers an architecture-compatible path toward more efficient multimodal reasoning and complements existing low-bit quantization techniques.

Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLLMs) require large parameter capacity to align high-dimensional visual features with linguistic representations, making them computationally heavy and difficult to deploy efficiently. We introduce a progressive reparameterization strategy that compresses these models by gradually replacing dense feed-forward network blocks with compact Parameterized Hypercomplex Multiplication (PHM) layers. A residual interpolation schedule, together with lightweight reconstruction and knowledge distillation losses, ensures that the PHM modules inherit the functional behavior of their dense counterparts during training. This transition yields substantial parameter and FLOP reductions while preserving strong multimodal alignment, enabling faster inference without degrading output quality. We evaluate the approach on multiple vision-language models (VLMs). Our method maintains performance comparable to the base models while delivering significant reductions in model size and inference latency. Progressive PHM substitution thus offers an architecture-compatible path toward more efficient multimodal reasoning and complements existing low-bit quantization techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVP is a training-free framework that improves GUI grounding stability by aggregating predictions from multiple cropped views to overcome coordinate prediction instability caused by minor visual perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI grounding models suffer from significant coordinate prediction instability where minor visual perturbations (like cropping a few pixels) can drastically alter predictions, flipping results between correct and incorrect. This instability severely undermines performance, especially for high-resolution screens with small UI elements.

Method: Multi-View Prediction (MVP) framework with two components: (1) Attention-Guided View Proposal - derives diverse views guided by instruction-to-image attention scores, and (2) Multi-Coordinates Clustering - ensembles predictions by selecting the centroid of the densest spatial cluster. The approach is training-free and enhances grounding through multi-view inference.

Result: MVP significantly boosts performance across various models and benchmarks. On ScreenSpot-Pro, it improves UI-TARS-1.5-7B to 56.1%, GTA1-7B to 61.7%, Qwen3VL-8B-Instruct to 65.3%, and Qwen3VL-32B-Instruct to 74.0%.

Conclusion: MVP effectively addresses GUI grounding instability by aggregating predictions from multiple views, demonstrating that while single-view predictions may be unstable, multi-view aggregation can reliably distinguish correct coordinates from outliers, leading to substantial performance improvements across different models.

Abstract: GUI grounding, which translates natural language instructions into precise pixel coordinates, is essential for developing practical GUI agents. However, we observe that existing grounding models exhibit significant coordinate prediction instability, minor visual perturbations (e.g. cropping a few pixels) can drastically alter predictions, flipping results between correct and incorrect. This instability severely undermines model performance, especially for samples with high-resolution and small UI elements. To address this issue, we propose Multi-View Prediction (MVP), a training-free framework that enhances grounding performance through multi-view inference. Our key insight is that while single-view predictions may be unstable, aggregating predictions from multiple carefully cropped views can effectively distinguish correct coordinates from outliers. MVP comprises two components: (1) Attention-Guided View Proposal, which derives diverse views guided by instruction-to-image attention scores, and (2) Multi-Coordinates Clustering, which ensembles predictions by selecting the centroid of the densest spatial cluster.

TL;DR: Unified multimodal framework for oil painting generation/editing using reference images, sketches, and text prompts with style consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oil painting is challenging for digital generation/editing due to complex brushstroke dynamics; existing methods are limited by training data and focus mainly on modifying real photos rather than creating stylized paintings.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) Enhanced training with spatial alignment (masks/sketches) and semantic enhancement (reference images/text), 2) Self-supervised style transfer pipeline using Stroke-Based Rendering to create large-scale paired dataset, 3) AdaIN operator integration during inference for style consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments show the system enables fine-grained editing while preserving artistic qualities, achieving unprecedented imagination realization in stylized oil painting generation/editing.

Conclusion: Proposed unified multimodal framework successfully addresses oil painting generation/editing challenges through interactive creation with precise semantic control, spatial alignment, and consistent painting style maintenance.

Abstract: Oil painting, as a high-level medium that blends human abstract thinking with artistic expression, poses substantial challenges for digital generation and editing due to its intricate brushstroke dynamics and stylized characteristics. Existing generation and editing techniques are often constrained by the distribution of training data and primarily focus on modifying real photographs. In this work, we introduce a unified multimodal framework for oil painting generation and editing. The proposed system allows users to incorporate reference images for precise semantic control, hand-drawn sketches for spatial structure alignment, and natural language prompts for high-level semantic guidance, while consistently maintaining a unified painting style across all outputs. Our method achieves interactive oil painting creation through three crucial technical advancements. First, we enhance the training stage with spatial alignment and semantic enhancement conditioning strategy, which map masks and sketches into spatial constraints, and encode contextual embedding from reference images and text into feature constraints, enabling object-level semantic alignment. Second, to overcome data scarcity, we propose a self-supervised style transfer pipeline based on Stroke-Based Rendering (SBR), which simulates the inpainting dynamics of oil painting restoration, converting real images into stylized oil paintings with preserved brushstroke textures to construct a large-scale paired training dataset. Finally, during inference, we integrate features using the AdaIN operator to ensure stylistic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our interactive system enables fine-grained editing while preserving the artistic qualities of oil paintings, achieving an unprecedented level of imagination realization in stylized oil paintings generation and editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Document shadow removal is essential for digitized document clarity, and preserving high-frequency details like text edges and lines is critical since shadows often obscure or distort these fine structures.

Method: Proposes MatteViT with two key strategies: 1) lightweight high-frequency amplification module (HFAM) that decomposes and adaptively amplifies high-frequency components, and 2) continuous luminance-based shadow matte generated using custom dataset and shadow matte generator for precise spatial guidance from early processing stages.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks (RDD and Kligler), provides robust practical solution for real-world document shadow removal, and better preserves text-level details in downstream tasks like OCR, improving recognition performance over prior methods.

Conclusion: MatteViT offers an effective framework for document shadow removal that successfully preserves fine-grained structural details while eliminating shadows, demonstrating practical value for real-world applications including optical character recognition.

Abstract: Document shadow removal is essential for enhancing the clarity of digitized documents. Preserving high-frequency details (e.g., text edges and lines) is critical in this process because shadows often obscure or distort fine structures. This paper proposes a matte vision transformer (MatteViT), a novel shadow removal framework that applies spatial and frequency-domain information to eliminate shadows while preserving fine-grained structural details. To effectively retain these details, we employ two preservation strategies. First, our method introduces a lightweight high-frequency amplification module (HFAM) that decomposes and adaptively amplifies high-frequency components. Second, we present a continuous luminance-based shadow matte, generated using a custom-built matte dataset and shadow matte generator, which provides precise spatial guidance from the earliest processing stage. These strategies enable the model to accurately identify fine-grained regions and restore them with high fidelity. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks (RDD and Kligler) demonstrate that MatteViT achieves state-of-the-art performance, providing a robust and practical solution for real-world document shadow removal. Furthermore, the proposed method better preserves text-level details in downstream tasks, such as optical character recognition, improving recognition performance over prior methods.

TL;DR: Photo3D is a framework for photorealistic 3D generation that uses GPT-4o-Image generated images to enhance realistic appearances while preserving 3D-native geometry structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D-native generators produce reliable geometry but lack realistic appearances due to scarcity of diverse, high-quality real-world 3D assets with rich textures. Capturing such data is difficult due to scene scale diversity, non-rigid object motions, and 3D scanner limitations.

Method: 1) Structure-aligned multi-view synthesis pipeline using GPT-4o-Image generated images; 2) Detail-enhanced multi-view dataset construction; 3) Realistic detail enhancement scheme with perceptual feature adaptation and semantic structure matching; 4) Dedicated training strategies for geometry-texture coupled and decoupled 3D-native generation paradigms.

Result: Photo3D generalizes well across diverse 3D-native generation paradigms and achieves state-of-the-art photorealistic 3D generation performance.

Conclusion: The framework successfully advances photorealistic 3D generation by leveraging image generation models to overcome data scarcity issues while maintaining structural consistency with 3D-native geometry.

Abstract: Although recent 3D-native generators have made great progress in synthesizing reliable geometry, they still fall short in achieving realistic appearances. A key obstacle lies in the lack of diverse and high-quality real-world 3D assets with rich texture details, since capturing such data is intrinsically difficult due to the diverse scales of scenes, non-rigid motions of objects, and the limited precision of 3D scanners. We introduce Photo3D, a framework for advancing photorealistic 3D generation, which is driven by the image data generated by the GPT-4o-Image model. Considering that the generated images can distort 3D structures due to their lack of multi-view consistency, we design a structure-aligned multi-view synthesis pipeline and construct a detail-enhanced multi-view dataset paired with 3D geometry. Building on it, we present a realistic detail enhancement scheme that leverages perceptual feature adaptation and semantic structure matching to enforce appearance consistency with realistic details while preserving the structural consistency with the 3D-native geometry. Our scheme is general to different 3D-native generators, and we present dedicated training strategies to facilitate the optimization of geometry-texture coupled and decoupled 3D-native generation paradigms. Experiments demonstrate that Photo3D generalizes well across diverse 3D-native generation paradigms and achieves state-of-the-art photorealistic 3D generation performance.

Method: Training-free Dual Hyperbolic Adapters (T-DHA) that characterize hierarchical vision-language relationships in hyperbolic space using Poincaré ball model, coupled with negative learning for improved representation.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot image recognition and domain generalization tasks across various datasets.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic space representation with T-DHA provides more accurate and robust classification with fewer feature dimensions, addressing domain adaptation challenges in VLMs without training overhead.

Abstract: Recent research in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly advanced our capabilities in cross-modal reasoning. However, existing methods suffer from performance degradation with domain changes or require substantial computational resources for fine-tuning in new domains. To address this issue, we develop a new adaptation method for large vision-language models, called \textit{Training-free Dual Hyperbolic Adapters} (T-DHA). We characterize the vision-language relationship between semantic concepts, which typically has a hierarchical tree structure, in the hyperbolic space instead of the traditional Euclidean space. Hyperbolic spaces exhibit exponential volume growth with radius, unlike the polynomial growth in Euclidean space. We find that this unique property is particularly effective for embedding hierarchical data structures using the Poincaré ball model, achieving significantly improved representation and discrimination power. Coupled with negative learning, it provides more accurate and robust classifications with fewer feature dimensions. Our extensive experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that the T-DHA method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in few-shot image recognition and domain generalization tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR-diffusion hybrid models combine structured modeling with photorealistic synthesis but suffer from high latency due to sequential AR generation and iterative denoising. The authors aim to tackle this bottleneck by jointly optimizing both components.

Method: 1) Entropy-informed speculative strategy aligns draft model's higher-entropy representations with target model's entropy characteristics to reduce mismatch and rejection rates. 2) Dynamic scheduler integrates diffusion decoding into end-to-end framework, prioritizing AR optimization to guide diffusion. 3) Joint distillation combines trajectory and distribution matching for stable training with few steps. 4) Inference uses shallow feature entropy to pre-filter low-entropy drafts.

Result: State-of-the-art acceleration: TransDiff achieves 4.3× lossless speedup on ImageNet 256×256, and NextStep-1 achieves 3× acceleration on text-conditioned generation.

Conclusion: Fast-ARDiff successfully addresses latency bottlenecks in AR-diffusion hybrids through unified optimization, achieving significant speedups while maintaining quality across diverse models.

Abstract: Autoregressive(AR)-diffusion hybrid paradigms combine AR's structured modeling with diffusion's photorealistic synthesis, yet suffer from high latency due to sequential AR generation and iterative denoising. In this work, we tackle this bottleneck and propose a unified AR-diffusion framework Fast-ARDiff that jointly optimizes both components, accelerating AR speculative decoding while simultaneously facilitating faster diffusion decoding. Specifically: (1) The entropy-informed speculative strategy encourages draft model to produce higher-entropy representations aligned with target model's entropy characteristics, mitigating entropy mismatch and high rejection rates caused by draft overconfidence. (2) For diffusion decoding, rather than treating it as an independent module, we integrate it into the same end-to-end framework using a dynamic scheduler that prioritizes AR optimization to guide the diffusion part in further steps. The diffusion part is optimized through a joint distillation framework combining trajectory and distribution matching, ensuring stable training and high-quality synthesis with extremely few steps. During inference, shallow feature entropy from AR module is used to pre-filter low-entropy drafts, avoiding redundant computation and improving latency. Fast-ARDiff achieves state-of-the-art acceleration across diverse models: on ImageNet 256$\times$256, TransDiff attains 4.3$\times$ lossless speedup, and NextStep-1 achieves 3$\times$ acceleration on text-conditioned generation.

Motivation: Window attention suffers performance degradation when sequence length exceeds window size, while linear attention underperforms on information-intensive tasks like OCR and document understanding. Need to overcome limitations of both approaches.

Method: Proposes InfiniteVL architecture that synergizes sliding window attention (SWA) with Gated DeltaNet for linear complexity. Uses three-stage training: distillation pretraining, instruction tuning, and long-sequence SFT.

Result: Outperforms previous linear-complexity VLMs and matches leading Transformer-based VLMs using <2% of training data. Achieves 3.6× inference speedup over FlashAttention-2 accelerated VLMs with constant latency/memory. Maintains 24 FPS real-time prefill in streaming video.

Conclusion: InfiniteVL successfully addresses limitations of both window and linear attention approaches, achieving competitive multimodal performance with linear complexity, efficient training, and practical deployment advantages for long-sequence tasks.

Abstract: Window attention and linear attention represent two principal strategies for mitigating the quadratic complexity and ever-growing KV cache in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, we observe that window-based VLMs suffer performance degradation when sequence length exceeds the window size, while linear attention underperforms on information-intensive tasks such as OCR and document understanding. To overcome these limitations, we propose InfiniteVL, a linear-complexity VLM architecture that synergizes sliding window attention (SWA) with Gated DeltaNet. For achieving competitive multimodal performance under constrained resources, we design a three-stage training strategy comprising distillation pretraining, instruction tuning, and long-sequence SFT. Remarkably, using less than 2\% of the training data required by leading VLMs, InfiniteVL not only substantially outperforms previous linear-complexity VLMs but also matches the performance of leading Transformer-based VLMs, while demonstrating effective long-term memory retention. Compared to similar-sized Transformer-based VLMs accelerated by FlashAttention-2, InfiniteVL achieves over 3.6\times inference speedup while maintaining constant latency and memory footprint. In streaming video understanding scenarios, it sustains a stable 24 FPS real-time prefill speed while preserving long-term memory cache.

Conclusion: SOLI provides an effective solution for lightweight, low-resolution image captioning that balances performance with computational efficiency, making it suitable for practical applications on constrained devices.

Abstract: Image captioning is essential in many fields including assisting visually impaired individuals, improving content management systems, and enhancing human-computer interaction. However, a recent challenge in this domain is dealing with low-resolution image (LRI). While performance can be improved by using larger models like transformers for encoding, these models are typically heavyweight, demanding significant computational resources and memory, leading to challenges in retraining. To address this, the proposed SOLI (Siamese-Driven Optimization for Low-Resolution Image Latent Embedding in Image Captioning) approach presents a solution specifically designed for lightweight, low-resolution images captioning. It employs a Siamese network architecture to optimize latent embeddings, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of the image-to-text translation process.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an iteration-free fixed-point estimator for diffusion inversion that avoids computational costs of iterative methods while maintaining reconstruction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fixed-point iteration methods for diffusion inversion suffer from high computational costs due to iterative nature and complex hyperparameter selection, creating need for more efficient approach.

Method: Derives explicit fixed-point expression from ideal inversion step, then introduces error approximation using calculable error from previous step to approximate unknown current error, creating calculable unbiased estimator.

Result: Achieves consistent superior reconstruction performance on NOCAPS and MS-COCO datasets compared to DDIM inversion and other fixed-point iteration methods, without additional iterations or training.

Conclusion: Proposed iteration-free fixed-point estimator provides efficient and accurate diffusion inversion solution that avoids computational overhead of iterative methods while maintaining reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Diffusion inversion aims to recover the initial noise corresponding to a given image such that this noise can reconstruct the original image through the denoising diffusion process. The key component of diffusion inversion is to minimize errors at each inversion step, thereby mitigating cumulative inaccuracies. Recently, fixed-point iteration has emerged as a widely adopted approach to minimize reconstruction errors at each inversion step. However, it suffers from high computational costs due to its iterative nature and the complexity of hyperparameter selection. To address these issues, we propose an iteration-free fixed-point estimator for diffusion inversion. First, we derive an explicit expression of the fixed point from an ideal inversion step. Unfortunately, it inherently contains an unknown data prediction error. Building upon this, we introduce the error approximation, which uses the calculable error from the previous inversion step to approximate the unknown error at the current inversion step. This yields a calculable, approximate expression for the fixed point, which is an unbiased estimator characterized by low variance, as shown by our theoretical analysis. We evaluate reconstruction performance on two text-image datasets, NOCAPS and MS-COCO. Compared to DDIM inversion and other inversion methods based on the fixed-point iteration, our method achieves consistent and superior performance in reconstruction tasks without additional iterations or training.

Conclusion: VALOR combines strengths of modern AI systems (advanced language-only reasoning models for decomposing spatial queries and strong vision specialist models improved via VLM critics) to achieve annotation-free visual reasoning with improved performance.

Abstract: Visual reasoning is challenging, requiring both precise object grounding and understanding complex spatial relationships. Existing methods fall into two camps: language-only chain-of-thought approaches, which demand large-scale (image, query, answer) supervision, and program-synthesis approaches which use pre-trained models and avoid training, but suffer from flawed logic and erroneous grounding. We propose an annotation-free training framework that improves both reasoning and grounding. Our framework uses AI-powered verifiers: an LLM verifier refines LLM reasoning via reinforcement learning, while a VLM verifier strengthens visual grounding through automated hard-negative mining, eliminating the need for ground truth labels. This design combines the strengths of modern AI systems: advanced language-only reasoning models for decomposing spatial queries into simpler subtasks, and strong vision specialist models improved via performant VLM critics. We evaluate our approach across diverse spatial reasoning tasks, and show that our method improves visual reasoning and surpasses open-source and proprietary models, while with our improved visual grounding model we further outperform recent text-only visual reasoning methods.

### [83] [SSCATeR: Sparse Scatter-Based Convolution Algorithm with Temporal Data Recycling for Real-Time 3D Object Detection in LiDAR Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08557)
*Alexander Dow,Manduhu Manduhu,Matheus Santos,Ben Bartlett,Gerard Dooly,James Riordan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSCATeR algorithm uses temporal data recycling and sparse scatter-based convolutions to process only changing parts of LiDAR point clouds, achieving 6.61x speedup while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LiDAR processing wastes computation on unchanged regions between frames. The paper aims to reduce redundant convolution operations by focusing only on areas where point data changes over time.

Method: Uses sliding time windows with short strides, stores convolution results between passes, extends scatter-based convolutions for data reuse, and processes LiDAR as continuous stream to act only on changing point cloud regions.

Result: Achieves identical feature maps to traditional sparse convolution methods with up to 6.61-fold reduction in processing time, demonstrating significant computational efficiency gains without accuracy loss.

Conclusion: SSCATeR successfully exploits temporal sparsity in LiDAR data through data recycling and sparse scatter-based convolutions, enabling real-time object detection with dramatically reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: This work leverages the continuous sweeping motion of LiDAR scanning to concentrate object detection efforts on specific regions that receive a change in point data from one frame to another. We achieve this by using a sliding time window with short strides and consider the temporal dimension by storing convolution results between passes. This allows us to ignore unchanged regions, significantly reducing the number of convolution operations per forward pass without sacrificing accuracy. This data reuse scheme introduces extreme sparsity to detection data. To exploit this sparsity, we extend our previous work on scatter-based convolutions to allow for data reuse, and as such propose Sparse Scatter-Based Convolution Algorithm with Temporal Data Recycling (SSCATeR). This operation treats incoming LiDAR data as a continuous stream and acts only on the changing parts of the point cloud. By doing so, we achieve the same results with as much as a 6.61-fold reduction in processing time. Our test results show that the feature maps output by our method are identical to those produced by traditional sparse convolution techniques, whilst greatly increasing the computational efficiency of the network.

TL;DR: Astra is an interactive general world model that generates real-world futures for diverse scenarios with precise action interactions, using autoregressive denoising with temporal causal attention and action-aware adapters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While diffusion transformers have advanced video generation, world models that can predict long-horizon futures from past observations and actions remain underexplored for general-purpose scenarios and various action forms.

Method: Autoregressive denoising architecture with temporal causal attention to aggregate past observations; noise-augmented history memory to balance responsiveness with coherence; action-aware adapter for precise action control; mixture of action experts for heterogeneous action modalities.

Result: Astra achieves interactive, consistent, and general long-term video prediction supporting various interactions, with experiments across multiple datasets showing improvements in fidelity, long-range prediction, and action alignment over SOTA world models.

Conclusion: Astra bridges the gap in interactive general world models, enabling precise action-controlled future prediction across diverse real-world scenarios like autonomous driving and robot manipulation.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion transformers have empowered video generation models to generate high-quality video clips from texts or images. However, world models with the ability to predict long-horizon futures from past observations and actions remain underexplored, especially for general-purpose scenarios and various forms of actions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Astra, an interactive general world model that generates real-world futures for diverse scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving, robot grasping) with precise action interactions (e.g., camera motion, robot action). We propose an autoregressive denoising architecture and use temporal causal attention to aggregate past observations and support streaming outputs. We use a noise-augmented history memory to avoid over-reliance on past frames to balance responsiveness with temporal coherence. For precise action control, we introduce an action-aware adapter that directly injects action signals into the denoising process. We further develop a mixture of action experts that dynamically route heterogeneous action modalities, enhancing versatility across diverse real-world tasks such as exploration, manipulation, and camera control. Astra achieves interactive, consistent, and general long-term video prediction and supports various forms of interactions. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate the improvements of Astra in fidelity, long-range prediction, and action alignment over existing state-of-the-art world models.

TL;DR: Large-scale automated framework discovers and explains visual concept representations across human cortex using unsupervised pattern discovery and automated explanation generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how the human brain represents visual concepts and where these representations are encoded remains challenging due to the complexity of brain signals and vast concept space, with most studies being small-scale and lacking systematic validation.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Discover candidate interpretable patterns in fMRI activity through unsupervised data-driven decomposition methods, 2) Explain each pattern by identifying natural images that elicit it and generating natural-language descriptions, using an automated pipeline that tests multiple candidate explanations with reliability scoring.

Result: Framework reveals thousands of interpretable patterns spanning many distinct visual concepts, including fine-grained representations previously unreported.

Conclusion: The automated large-scale framework successfully discovers and explains visual representations across human cortex, overcoming limitations of traditional small-scale studies and revealing previously unreported fine-grained visual concepts.

Abstract: Understanding how the human brain represents visual concepts, and in which brain regions these representations are encoded, remains a long-standing challenge. Decades of work have advanced our understanding of visual representations, yet brain signals remain large and complex, and the space of possible visual concepts is vast. As a result, most studies remain small-scale, rely on manual inspection, focus on specific regions and properties, and rarely include systematic validation. We present a large-scale, automated framework for discovering and explaining visual representations across the human cortex. Our method comprises two main stages. First, we discover candidate interpretable patterns in fMRI activity through unsupervised, data-driven decomposition methods. Next, we explain each pattern by identifying the set of natural images that most strongly elicit it and generating a natural-language description of their shared visual meaning. To scale this process, we introduce an automated pipeline that tests multiple candidate explanations, assigns quantitative reliability scores, and selects the most consistent description for each voxel pattern. Our framework reveals thousands of interpretable patterns spanning many distinct visual concepts, including fine-grained representations previously unreported.

Method: A modular neural image signal processing framework that processes raw inputs through controllable intermediate stages, with variants ranging from 0.5M to 3.9M parameters, enabling user-interactive editing tools.

Result: Achieves competitive qualitative and quantitative results across multiple test sets, supports diverse editing operations and picture styles, and enables unlimited post-editable re-rendering.

Conclusion: The modular neural ISP framework provides superior control, flexibility, and performance compared to prior designs, enabling practical applications in interactive photo editing with high-quality rendering.

Abstract: This paper presents a modular neural image signal processing (ISP) framework that processes raw inputs and renders high-quality display-referred images. Unlike prior neural ISP designs, our method introduces a high degree of modularity, providing full control over multiple intermediate stages of the rendering process.~This modular design not only achieves high rendering accuracy but also improves scalability, debuggability, generalization to unseen cameras, and flexibility to match different user-preference styles. To demonstrate the advantages of this design, we built a user-interactive photo-editing tool that leverages our neural ISP to support diverse editing operations and picture styles. The tool is carefully engineered to take advantage of the high-quality rendering of our neural ISP and to enable unlimited post-editable re-rendering. Our method is a fully learning-based framework with variants of different capacities, all of moderate size (ranging from ~0.5 M to ~3.9 M parameters for the entire pipeline), and consistently delivers competitive qualitative and quantitative results across multiple test sets.

TL;DR: Proposes adaptive pseudo-label adjustment for continual test-time adaptation in semantic segmentation, using class- and instance-aware thresholds to handle varying difficulty across classes and instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CTTA methods use fixed or batch-level thresholds that fail to account for varying difficulty across classes and instances, especially problematic in semantic segmentation where each image requires dense multi-class predictions.

Method: Adaptively adjusts pseudo labels based on confidence distribution within each image, dynamically balances learning toward classes most affected by domain shifts, using fine-grained class- and instance-aware adaptation.

Result: Extensive experiments across eight CTTA and TTA scenarios (including synthetic-to-real and long-term shifts) show consistent outperformance over state-of-the-art techniques, setting new standard for semantic segmentation under evolving conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive approach produces more reliable supervision and mitigates error accumulation throughout continual adaptation, addressing limitations of existing threshold-based methods in semantic segmentation CTTA.

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) enables pre-trained models to adapt to continuously evolving domains. Existing methods have improved robustness but typically rely on fixed or batch-level thresholds, which cannot account for varying difficulty across classes and instances. This limitation is especially problematic in semantic segmentation, where each image requires dense, multi-class predictions. We propose an approach that adaptively adjusts pseudo labels to reflect the confidence distribution within each image and dynamically balances learning toward classes most affected by domain shifts. This fine-grained, class- and instance-aware adaptation produces more reliable supervision and mitigates error accumulation throughout continual adaptation. Extensive experiments across eight CTTA and TTA scenarios, including synthetic-to-real and long-term shifts, show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, setting a new standard for semantic segmentation under evolving conditions.

Motivation: The tumor microenvironment (TME) contains valuable prognostic biomarkers, but current analysis methods fail to capture the complex cellular interactions needed for accurate survival prediction and risk stratification in lung cancer.

Method: HiGINE uses hierarchical graph-based approach to analyze TME from multiplex immunofluorescence images, encoding both local and global cell neighborhood inter-relations including cell types and morphology. It employs multimodal fusion to aggregate cancer stage with mIF-derived features.

Result: Validated on two public datasets, HiGINE demonstrates improved risk stratification, robustness, and generalizability compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: HiGINE effectively leverages TME complexity through hierarchical graph modeling and multimodal fusion to enhance lung cancer survival prediction and risk stratification.

Abstract: The tumor microenvironment (TME) has emerged as a promising source of prognostic biomarkers. To fully leverage its potential, analysis methods must capture complex interactions between different cell types. We propose HiGINE -- a hierarchical graph-based approach to predict patient survival (short vs. long) from TME characterization in multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) images and enhance risk stratification in lung cancer. Our model encodes both local and global inter-relations in cell neighborhoods, incorporating information about cell types and morphology. Multimodal fusion, aggregating cancer stage with mIF-derived features, further boosts performance. We validate HiGINE on two public datasets, demonstrating improved risk stratification, robustness, and generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve and automate pollen grain detection and classification in veterinary cytology using both optical and holographic microscopy, addressing the performance gap between these imaging modalities.

Method: Used YOLOv8s for object detection and MobileNetV3L for classification, evaluated across optical and holographic microscopy images. Applied dataset expansion techniques including automated labeling and bounding box area enlargement specifically for holographic images.

Result: Optical images: 91.3% mAP50 for detection, 97% overall accuracy for classification. Holographic images initially performed poorly (2.49% mAP50 detection, 42% classification), but improved to 13.3% mAP50 and 54% accuracy after dataset expansion techniques.

Conclusion: Deep learning can be effectively paired with cost-effective lensless digital holographic microscopy for image classification tasks, though performance improvements require dataset expansion techniques to address modality-specific challenges.

Abstract: This study explores the application of deep learning to improve and automate pollen grain detection and classification in both optical and holographic microscopy images, with a particular focus on veterinary cytology use cases. We used YOLOv8s for object detection and MobileNetV3L for the classification task, evaluating their performance across imaging modalities. The models achieved 91.3% mAP50 for detection and 97% overall accuracy for classification on optical images, whereas the initial performance on greyscale holographic images was substantially lower. We addressed the performance gap issue through dataset expansion using automated labeling and bounding box area enlargement. These techniques, applied to holographic images, improved detection performance from 2.49% to 13.3% mAP50 and classification performance from 42% to 54%. Our work demonstrates that, at least for image classification tasks, it is possible to pair deep learning techniques with cost-effective lensless digital holographic microscopy devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SLAM systems with semantic understanding often rely on depth sensors or closed-set semantic models, limiting scalability and adaptability in open-world environments. There's a need for monocular SLAM that can handle open-set semantics without specialized hardware or annotations.

Method: The framework integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting with visual foundation models: MASt3R for visual geometry, and SAM and CLIP for open-vocabulary semantics. It uses self-supervised learning objectives without depth input or 3D semantic ground truth, and includes a memory mechanism for managing high-dimensional semantic features to construct Gaussian semantic feature maps.

Result: The approach achieves performance comparable to or surpassing existing baselines in both closed-set and open-set segmentation tasks, operating solely with monocular input and without supplementary sensors like depth maps or semantic annotations.

Conclusion: OpenMonoGS-SLAM successfully demonstrates the feasibility of combining 3D Gaussian Splatting with open-set semantic understanding for monocular SLAM, providing a scalable and adaptable solution for open-world environments using visual foundation models.

Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a foundational component in robotics, AR/VR, and autonomous systems. With the rising focus on spatial AI in recent years, combining SLAM with semantic understanding has become increasingly important for enabling intelligent perception and interaction. Recent efforts have explored this integration, but they often rely on depth sensors or closed-set semantic models, limiting their scalability and adaptability in open-world environments. In this work, we present OpenMonoGS-SLAM, the first monocular SLAM framework that unifies 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with open-set semantic understanding. To achieve our goal, we leverage recent advances in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), including MASt3R for visual geometry and SAM and CLIP for open-vocabulary semantics. These models provide robust generalization across diverse tasks, enabling accurate monocular camera tracking and mapping, as well as a rich understanding of semantics in open-world environments. Our method operates without any depth input or 3D semantic ground truth, relying solely on self-supervised learning objectives. Furthermore, we propose a memory mechanism specifically designed to manage high-dimensional semantic features, which effectively constructs Gaussian semantic feature maps, leading to strong overall performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to or surpassing existing baselines in both closed-set and open-set segmentation tasks, all without relying on supplementary sensors such as depth maps or semantic annotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes method to estimate metric depth from video blur patterns and dense trajectory using joint optical design algorithm


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera rotation during long-exposure causes perspective-based blur that varies with depth, enabling depth estimation from blur patterns

Method: Uses off-the-shelf vision encoder and point tracker, estimates depth via windowed embedding and multi-window aggregation, densifies sparse trajectory using vision-language model

Result: Strong performance on multiple depth datasets across large depth range with good generalization; optical algorithm achieves superior precision compared to real handheld trajectories

Conclusion: Depth can be effectively estimated from perspective-based blur patterns in video streams through joint optical design approach

Abstract: In the absence of a mechanical stabilizer, the camera undergoes inevitable rotational dynamics during capturing, which induces perspective-based blur especially under long-exposure scenarios. From an optical standpoint, perspective-based blur is depth-position-dependent: objects residing at distinct spatial locations incur different blur levels even under the same imaging settings. Inspired by this, we propose a novel method that estimate metric depth by examining the blur pattern of a video stream and dense trajectory via joint optical design algorithm. Specifically, we employ off-the-shelf vision encoder and point tracker to extract video information. Then, we estimate depth map via windowed embedding and multi-window aggregation, and densify the sparse trajectory from the optical algorithm using a vision-language model. Evaluations on multiple depth datasets demonstrate that our method attains strong performance over large depth range, while maintaining favorable generalization. Relative to the real trajectory in handheld shooting settings, our optical algorithm achieves superior precision and the dense reconstruction maintains strong accuracy.

TL;DR: CoIG reframes image generation as a sequential, semantic process using LLMs to decompose prompts into step-by-step instructions, enabling human-interpretable monitoring while maintaining competitive image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image generation models are "black boxes" with opaque internal processes, limiting human observation, intervention, reliability, safety, and control. Their non-human-like workflows make interpretation difficult.

Method: CoIG uses an LLM to decompose complex prompts into sequential, simple instructions. The image generation model then executes this plan by progressively generating and editing images, with each step focusing on a single semantic entity for direct monitoring.

Result: CoIG substantially enhances quantitative monitorability while achieving competitive compositional robustness compared to baseline models. It mitigates entity collapse by decomposing complex tasks into simple subproblems.

Conclusion: CoIG brings Chain-of-Thought-like advantages to image generation, enabling human-interpretable workflows, improved monitoring, and model-agnostic integration while maintaining image quality.

Abstract: While state-of-the-art image generation models achieve remarkable visual quality, their internal generative processes remain a "black box." This opacity limits human observation and intervention, and poses a barrier to ensuring model reliability, safety, and control. Furthermore, their non-human-like workflows make them difficult for human observers to interpret. To address this, we introduce the Chain-of-Image Generation (CoIG) framework, which reframes image generation as a sequential, semantic process analogous to how humans create art. Similar to the advantages in monitorability and performance that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) brought to large language models (LLMs), CoIG can produce equivalent benefits in text-to-image generation. CoIG utilizes an LLM to decompose a complex prompt into a sequence of simple, step-by-step instructions. The image generation model then executes this plan by progressively generating and editing the image. Each step focuses on a single semantic entity, enabling direct monitoring. We formally assess this property using two novel metrics: CoIG Readability, which evaluates the clarity of each intermediate step via its corresponding output; and Causal Relevance, which quantifies the impact of each procedural step on the final generated image. We further show that our framework mitigates entity collapse by decomposing the complex generation task into simple subproblems, analogous to the procedural reasoning employed by CoT. Our experimental results indicate that CoIG substantially enhances quantitative monitorability while achieving competitive compositional robustness compared to established baseline models. The framework is model-agnostic and can be integrated with any image generation model.

TL;DR: C-DIRA is a lightweight driver behavior recognition framework that combines dynamic ROI routing and adversarial learning to achieve efficient, accurate, and domain-invariant performance on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lightweight models for driver distraction recognition fail to capture fine-grained behavioral cues and struggle with generalization to unseen drivers/varying conditions, while ROI-based methods increase computational costs, creating a need for a balanced efficiency-accuracy solution.

Method: Proposes C-DIRA framework with: 1) Saliency-driven Top-K ROI pooling and fused classification for local feature extraction, 2) Dynamic ROI routing that applies ROI inference only to high-difficulty samples, and 3) Pseudo-domain labeling with adversarial learning for domain-invariant features.

Result: C-DIRA maintains high accuracy with significantly fewer FLOPs and lower latency than prior lightweight models on State Farm Distracted Driver Detection Dataset, shows robustness to visual degradation (blur, low-light), and demonstrates stable performance across unseen domains.

Conclusion: C-DIRA effectively achieves compactness, efficiency, and generalization for real-time driver behavior recognition on edge devices, balancing computational constraints with performance requirements.

Abstract: Driver distraction behavior recognition using in-vehicle cameras demands real-time inference on edge devices. However, lightweight models often fail to capture fine-grained behavioral cues, resulting in reduced performance on unseen drivers or under varying conditions. ROI-based methods also increase computational cost, making it difficult to balance efficiency and accuracy. This work addresses the need for a lightweight architecture that overcomes these constraints. We propose Computationally efficient Dynamic region of Interest Routing and domain-invariant Adversarial learning for lightweight driver behavior recognition (C-DIRA). The framework combines saliency-driven Top-K ROI pooling and fused classification for local feature extraction and integration. Dynamic ROI routing enables selective computation by applying ROI inference only to high difficulty data samples. Moreover, pseudo-domain labeling and adversarial learning are used to learn domain-invariant features robust to driver and background variation. Experiments on the State Farm Distracted Driver Detection Dataset show that C-DIRA maintains high accuracy with significantly fewer FLOPs and lower latency than prior lightweight models. It also demonstrates robustness under visual degradation such as blur and low-light, and stable performance across unseen domains. These results confirm C-DIRA's effectiveness in achieving compactness, efficiency, and generalization.

TL;DR: A plug-and-play training framework called MNAME that eliminates dependency on external encoders for generative models by using a memory bank mechanism to provide abundant negative samples for contrastive learning, achieving state-of-the-art FID of 2.40 on ImageNet-256.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Denoising generative models (diffusion, flow-matching) have high training costs and inefficient representation learning. While discriminative representations via auxiliary alignment help, they rely on external pre-trained encoders that introduce overhead and domain shift issues.

Method: Proposes MNAME framework with memory bank mechanism that maintains a large, dynamically updated queue of negative samples across training iterations, decoupling negative sample count from batch size. Uses low-dimensional projection head to minimize memory/bandwidth overhead. No external encoders needed.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art FID of 2.40 on ImageNet-256 within 400k steps, significantly outperforming comparable methods. Offers faster convergence and superior generative quality more efficiently.

Conclusion: MNAME provides a self-contained solution that eliminates dependency on pretrained vision models, introduces no additional inference costs, and enables substantially faster convergence with superior generative quality.

Abstract: The dominance of denoising generative models (e.g., diffusion, flow-matching) in visual synthesis is tempered by their substantial training costs and inefficiencies in representation learning. While injecting discriminative representations via auxiliary alignment has proven effective, this approach still faces key limitations: the reliance on external, pre-trained encoders introduces overhead and domain shift. A dispersed-based strategy that encourages strong separation among in-batch latent representations alleviates this specific dependency. To assess the effect of the number of negative samples in generative modeling, we propose {\mname}, a plug-and-play training framework that requires no external encoders. Our method integrates a memory bank mechanism that maintains a large, dynamically updated queue of negative samples across training iterations. This decouples the number of negatives from the mini-batch size, providing abundant and high-quality negatives for a contrastive objective without a multiplicative increase in computational cost. A low-dimensional projection head is used to further minimize memory and bandwidth overhead. {\mname} offers three principal advantages: (1) it is self-contained, eliminating dependency on pretrained vision foundation models and their associated forward-pass overhead; (2) it introduces no additional parameters or computational cost during inference; and (3) it enables substantially faster convergence, achieving superior generative quality more efficiently. On ImageNet-256, {\mname} achieves a state-of-the-art FID of \textbf{2.40} within 400k steps, significantly outperforming comparable methods.

TL;DR: Proposes CSCon, a dual-branch center-surrounding contrastive learning framework for 3D point clouds that outperforms generative SSL methods on discriminative tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D SSL is dominated by generative MAE methods which struggle with discriminative features, while contrastive methods effective in 2D don't capture 3D local details well when directly applied.

Method: Dual-branch framework with separate masking of center and surrounding parts to create center-biased and surrounding-biased representations, plus patch-level contrastive loss to enhance both high-level information and local sensitivity.

Result: Achieves comparable performance to generative methods under FULL/ALL protocols, and SOTA results under MLP-LINEAR, MLP-3, and ONLY-NEW protocols. Outperforms Point-MAE by 7.9%, 6.7%, and 10.3% on ScanObjectNN variants under MLP-LINEAR.

Conclusion: CSCon effectively addresses limitations of both generative and naive contrastive approaches for 3D point clouds, achieving superior discriminative feature learning and generalization across multiple evaluation protocols.

Abstract: Most existing self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches for 3D point clouds are dominated by generative methods based on Masked Autoencoders (MAE). However, these generative methods have been proven to struggle to capture high-level discriminative features effectively, leading to poor performance on linear probing and other downstream tasks. In contrast, contrastive methods excel in discriminative feature representation and generalization ability on image data. Despite this, contrastive learning (CL) in 3D data remains scarce. Besides, simply applying CL methods designed for 2D data to 3D fails to effectively learn 3D local details. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Dual-Branch \textbf{C}enter-\textbf{S}urrounding \textbf{Con}trast (CSCon) framework. Specifically, we apply masking to the center and surrounding parts separately, constructing dual-branch inputs with center-biased and surrounding-biased representations to better capture rich geometric information. Meanwhile, we introduce a patch-level contrastive loss to further enhance both high-level information and local sensitivity. Under the FULL and ALL protocols, CSCon achieves performance comparable to generative methods; under the MLP-LINEAR, MLP-3, and ONLY-NEW protocols, our method attains state-of-the-art results, even surpassing cross-modal approaches. In particular, under the MLP-LINEAR protocol, our method outperforms the baseline (Point-MAE) by \textbf{7.9\%}, \textbf{6.7\%}, and \textbf{10.3\%} on the three variants of ScanObjectNN, respectively. The code will be made publicly available.

Motivation: Current state-of-the-art person re-identification methods achieve high accuracy but remain opaque, leaving unanswered which high-level semantic attributes these models actually rely on for their decisions.

Method: Proposes MoSAIC-ReID, a Mixture-of-Experts framework using LoRA-based experts (each linked to a single attribute) with an oracle router for controlled attribution analysis, enabling systematic quantification of attribute importance.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on Market-1501 and DukeMTMC datasets when attribute annotations are available at test time, and provides quantitative analysis revealing clothing colors and intrinsic characteristics contribute most strongly, while infrequent cues like accessories have limited effect.

Conclusion: Offers a principled framework for interpretable ReID and highlights requirements for integrating explicit semantic knowledge in practice, providing valuable insights into which pedestrian attributes models actually rely on.

Abstract: State-of-the-art person re-identification methods achieve impressive accuracy but remain largely opaque, leaving open the question: which high-level semantic attributes do these models actually rely on? We propose MoSAIC-ReID, a Mixture-of-Experts framework that systematically quantifies the importance of pedestrian attributes for re-identification. Our approach uses LoRA-based experts, each linked to a single attribute, and an oracle router that enables controlled attribution analysis. While MoSAIC-ReID achieves competitive performance on Market-1501 and DukeMTMC under the assumption that attribute annotations are available at test time, its primary value lies in providing a large-scale, quantitative study of attribute importance across intrinsic and extrinsic cues. Using generalized linear models, statistical tests, and feature-importance analyses, we reveal which attributes, such as clothing colors and intrinsic characteristics, contribute most strongly, while infrequent cues (e.g. accessories) have limited effect. This work offers a principled framework for interpretable ReID and highlights the requirements for integrating explicit semantic knowledge in practice.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes knowledge distillation from foundation models to lightweight networks for full surround monocular depth estimation, addressing computational cost and metric-scale depth challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models show strong generalization but are computationally expensive and predict only relative depth, making them unsuitable for real-time full surround metric-scale depth estimation.

Method: Hybrid regression framework with cross-interaction knowledge distillation (distilling scale-invariant depth bin probabilities) and view-relational knowledge distillation (encoding structural relationships among adjacent camera views).

Result: Outperforms conventional supervised methods and existing knowledge distillation approaches on DDAD and nuScenes datasets while achieving real-time performance.

Conclusion: The proposed knowledge distillation strategy effectively transfers robust depth knowledge from foundation models to lightweight networks, achieving a favorable performance-efficiency trade-off for real-time full surround depth estimation.

Abstract: Recent foundation models demonstrate strong generalization capabilities in monocular depth estimation. However, directly applying these models to Full Surround Monocular Depth Estimation (FSMDE) presents two major challenges: (1) high computational cost, which limits real-time performance, and (2) difficulty in estimating metric-scale depth, as these models are typically trained to predict only relative depth. To address these limitations, we propose a novel knowledge distillation strategy that transfers robust depth knowledge from a foundation model to a lightweight FSMDE network. Our approach leverages a hybrid regression framework combining the knowledge distillation scheme--traditionally used in classification--with a depth binning module to enhance scale consistency. Specifically, we introduce a cross-interaction knowledge distillation scheme that distills the scale-invariant depth bin probabilities of a foundation model into the student network while guiding it to infer metric-scale depth bin centers from ground-truth depth. Furthermore, we propose view-relational knowledge distillation, which encodes structural relationships among adjacent camera views and transfers them to enhance cross-view depth consistency. Experiments on DDAD and nuScenes demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to conventional supervised methods and existing knowledge distillation approaches. Moreover, our method achieves a favorable trade-off between performance and efficiency, meeting real-time requirements.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free OVSS using SAM 3 for remote sensing with mask fusion and presence filtering achieves promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based OVSS methods struggle with precise localization and complex pipelines, especially for dense small targets in remote sensing. SAM 3's unified segmentation-recognition framework offers potential for simpler, more effective solutions.

Method: Two key adaptations: 1) Mask fusion strategy combining SAM 3's semantic segmentation head and Transformer decoder outputs for better land coverage; 2) Using presence scores to filter non-existent categories, reducing false positives from large vocabularies and patch-level processing.

Result: The simple SAM 3 adaptation achieves promising performance on extensive remote sensing datasets, demonstrating SAM 3's potential for remote sensing OVSS tasks.

Conclusion: SAM 3 shows strong potential for training-free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation in remote sensing through simple adaptations like mask fusion and presence filtering, offering a simpler alternative to complex CLIP-based pipelines.

Abstract: Most existing methods for training-free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) are based on CLIP. While these approaches have made progress, they often face challenges in precise localization or require complex pipelines to combine separate modules, especially in remote sensing scenarios where numerous dense and small targets are present. Recently, Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM 3) was proposed, unifying segmentation and recognition in a promptable framework. In this paper, we present a preliminary exploration of applying SAM 3 to the remote sensing OVSS task without any training. First, we implement a mask fusion strategy that combines the outputs from SAM 3's semantic segmentation head and the Transformer decoder (instance head). This allows us to leverage the strengths of both heads for better land coverage. Second, we utilize the presence score from the presence head to filter out categories that do not exist in the scene, reducing false positives caused by the vast vocabulary sizes and patch-level processing in geospatial scenes. We evaluate our method on extensive remote sensing datasets. Experiments show that this simple adaptation achieves promising performance, demonstrating the potential of SAM 3 for remote sensing OVSS.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the unexplored problem of sign-to-sign retrieval (Sign Language Spotting) to bridge communication gap between deaf and hearing communities, moving beyond traditional gloss recognition approaches.

Method: End-to-end model using pose keypoints instead of RGB frames, with encoder-only backbone and binary classification head to detect query sign presence in target sequences.

Result: Achieved 61.88% accuracy and 60.00% F1-score on Word Presence Prediction dataset from WSLP 2025 shared task, demonstrating effectiveness of pose-based approach.

Conclusion: Pose-based framework provides effective foundation for Sign Language Spotting with reduced computational cost and visual noise, enabling future research in automatic sign language retrieval and verification.

Abstract: Automatic Sign Language Recognition (ASLR) has emerged as a vital field for bridging the gap between deaf and hearing communities. However, the problem of sign-to-sign retrieval or detecting a specific sign within a sequence of continuous signs remains largely unexplored. We define this novel task as Sign Language Spotting. In this paper, we present a first step toward sign language retrieval by addressing the challenge of detecting the presence or absence of a query sign video within a sentence-level gloss or sign video. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on intermediate gloss recognition or text-based matching, we propose an end-to-end model that directly operates on pose keypoints extracted from sign videos. Our architecture employs an encoder-only backbone with a binary classification head to determine whether the query sign appears within the target sequence. By focusing on pose representations instead of raw RGB frames, our method significantly reduces computational cost and mitigates visual noise. We evaluate our approach on the Word Presence Prediction dataset from the WSLP 2025 shared task, achieving 61.88\% accuracy and 60.00\% F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our pose-based framework for Sign Language Spotting, establishing a strong foundation for future research in automatic sign language retrieval and verification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial mushroom cultivation needs computer vision for monitoring and harvesting, but creating large annotated datasets is expensive. Synthetic data offers scalability but often lacks realism to generalize to real-world scenarios.

Method: Novel workflow integrating 3D rendering in Blender with constrained diffusion models to automatically generate high-quality annotated, photorealistic synthetic images of Agaricus Bisporus mushrooms, preserving full control over 3D scene configuration and annotations.

Result: Released two synthetic datasets (6,000 images each with over 250k mushroom instances). Mask R-CNN models trained on synthetic data achieved state-of-the-art segmentation performance (F1 = 0.859 on M18K) in zero-shot testing on two independent real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that synthetic data can effectively replace real annotated datasets for mushroom detection/segmentation. The pipeline is adaptable to other mushroom species and agricultural domains like fruit and leaf detection.

Abstract: Industrial mushroom cultivation increasingly relies on computer vision for monitoring and automated harvesting. However, developing accurate detection and segmentation models requires large, precisely annotated datasets that are costly to produce. Synthetic data provides a scalable alternative, yet often lacks sufficient realism to generalize to real-world scenarios. This paper presents a novel workflow that integrates 3D rendering in Blender with a constrained diffusion model to automatically generate high-quality annotated, photorealistic synthetic images of Agaricus Bisporus mushrooms. This approach preserves full control over 3D scene configuration and annotations while achieving photorealism without the need for specialized computer graphics expertise. We release two synthetic datasets (each containing 6,000 images depicting over 250k mushroom instances) and evaluate Mask R-CNN models trained on them in a zero-shot setting. When tested on two independent real-world datasets (including a newly collected benchmark), our method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance (F1 = 0.859 on M18K), despite using only synthetic training data. Although the approach is demonstrated on Agaricus Bisporus mushrooms, the proposed pipeline can be readily adapted to other mushroom species or to other agricultural domains, such as fruit and leaf detection.

TL;DR: Proposes skewness-guided pruning for multimodal Swin Transformers in federated learning, achieving 36% model compression without accuracy loss for medical imaging on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-performance medical vision models are too large for edge deployment, and privacy constraints prevent centralized data management, necessitating federated learning with compressed models.

Method: Skewness-guided pruning method that selectively prunes Multi-Head Self-Attention and Multi-Layer Perceptron layers based on statistical skewness of their output distributions in a multimodal Swin Transformer.

Result: Achieved approximately 36% model size reduction with no loss in accuracy in horizontal federated learning environment using compact Swin Transformer.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of efficient model compression and privacy-preserving distributed learning for multimodal medical AI on edge devices through skewness-guided pruning in federated settings.

Abstract: In recent years, high-performance computer vision models have achieved remarkable success in medical imaging, with some skin lesion classification systems even surpassing dermatology specialists in diagnostic accuracy. However, such models are computationally intensive and large in size, making them unsuitable for deployment on edge devices. In addition, strict privacy constraints hinder centralized data management, motivating the adoption of Federated Learning (FL). To address these challenges, this study proposes a skewness-guided pruning method that selectively prunes the Multi-Head Self-Attention and Multi-Layer Perceptron layers of a multimodal Swin Transformer based on the statistical skewness of their output distributions. The proposed method was validated in a horizontal FL environment and shown to maintain performance while substantially reducing model complexity. Experiments on the compact Swin Transformer demonstrate approximately 36\% model size reduction with no loss in accuracy. These findings highlight the feasibility of achieving efficient model compression and privacy-preserving distributed learning for multimodal medical AI on edge devices.

TL;DR: Wan-Move is a scalable framework that adds precise motion control to video generation models by making condition features motion-aware through dense point trajectories, achieving commercial-level motion quality without architecture changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion-controllable video generation methods suffer from coarse control granularity and limited scalability, making their outputs insufficient for practical applications. There's a need for precise, high-quality motion control that can scale effectively.

Method: Represent object motions with dense point trajectories for fine-grained control, project trajectories into latent space, propagate first frame's features along trajectories to create aligned spatiotemporal feature maps, and integrate these as motion guidance into existing image-to-video models without architecture changes.

Result: Generates 5-second, 480p videos with motion controllability rivaling commercial systems like Kling 1.5 Pro's Motion Brush, as validated by user studies. Outperforms existing methods on MoveBench benchmark and public datasets.

Conclusion: Wan-Move provides a simple, scalable solution for precise motion control in video generation, eliminating need for auxiliary motion encoders and enabling easy fine-tuning of base models while achieving commercial-quality results.

Abstract: We present Wan-Move, a simple and scalable framework that brings motion control to video generative models. Existing motion-controllable methods typically suffer from coarse control granularity and limited scalability, leaving their outputs insufficient for practical use. We narrow this gap by achieving precise and high-quality motion control. Our core idea is to directly make the original condition features motion-aware for guiding video synthesis. To this end, we first represent object motions with dense point trajectories, allowing fine-grained control over the scene. We then project these trajectories into latent space and propagate the first frame's features along each trajectory, producing an aligned spatiotemporal feature map that tells how each scene element should move. This feature map serves as the updated latent condition, which is naturally integrated into the off-the-shelf image-to-video model, e.g., Wan-I2V-14B, as motion guidance without any architecture change. It removes the need for auxiliary motion encoders and makes fine-tuning base models easily scalable. Through scaled training, Wan-Move generates 5-second, 480p videos whose motion controllability rivals Kling 1.5 Pro's commercial Motion Brush, as indicated by user studies. To support comprehensive evaluation, we further design MoveBench, a rigorously curated benchmark featuring diverse content categories and hybrid-verified annotations. It is distinguished by larger data volume, longer video durations, and high-quality motion annotations. Extensive experiments on MoveBench and the public dataset consistently show Wan-Move's superior motion quality. Code, models, and benchmark data are made publicly available.

TL;DR: LoFA predicts personalized priors for fast model adaptation by identifying structured distribution patterns in LoRA parameter changes and using a two-stage hypernetwork to predict high-quality adaptation weights in seconds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current personalization methods like LoRA require task-specific data and lengthy optimization, while existing hypernetwork approaches struggle to map fine-grained user prompts to complex LoRA distributions, limiting practical applicability.

Method: Two-stage hypernetwork: first predicts relative distribution patterns that capture key adaptation regions in LoRA parameter changes, then uses these patterns to guide final LoRA weight prediction.

Result: Consistently predicts high-quality personalized priors within seconds across multiple tasks and user prompts, outperforming conventional LoRA that requires hours of processing.

Conclusion: LoFA bridges the gap between efficient personalization and high-quality adaptation by leveraging structured distribution patterns in parameter changes, enabling practical real-time personalization of visual generative models.

Abstract: Personalizing visual generative models to meet specific user needs has gained increasing attention, yet current methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) remain impractical due to their demand for task-specific data and lengthy optimization. While a few hypernetwork-based approaches attempt to predict adaptation weights directly, they struggle to map fine-grained user prompts to complex LoRA distributions, limiting their practical applicability. To bridge this gap, we propose LoFA, a general framework that efficiently predicts personalized priors for fast model adaptation. We first identify a key property of LoRA: structured distribution patterns emerge in the relative changes between LoRA and base model parameters. Building on this, we design a two-stage hypernetwork: first predicting relative distribution patterns that capture key adaptation regions, then using these to guide final LoRA weight prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently predicts high-quality personalized priors within seconds, across multiple tasks and user prompts, even outperforming conventional LoRA that requires hours of processing.

*Jack Brady,Bernhard Schölkopf,Thomas Kipf,Simon Buchholz,Wieland Brendel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Generative methods with decoder inversion enable compositional generalization, while non-generative encoder methods struggle without large-scale pretraining or added supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether generative approaches (with decoder inversion) are necessary for human-level visual perception, specifically for achieving compositional generalization - a key aspect of human perception that current non-generative vision models may lack.

Method: Theoretical analysis formalizing inductive biases needed for compositional generalization in both generative (decoder-based) and non-generative (encoder-based) methods, followed by empirical evaluation on photorealistic image datasets comparing various generative and non-generative approaches.

Result: Generative methods can enforce necessary inductive biases through decoder constraints and inversion, enabling compositional generalization. Non-generative methods struggle to enforce these biases via regularization or architecture, often requiring large-scale pretraining or added supervision to improve.

Conclusion: Generative approaches with decoder inversion provide a principled path to compositional generalization, supporting the hypothesis that generation may be necessary for human-level visual perception in machines.

Abstract: It has been hypothesized that human-level visual perception requires a generative approach in which internal representations result from inverting a decoder. Yet today's most successful vision models are non-generative, relying on an encoder that maps images to representations without decoder inversion. This raises the question of whether generation is, in fact, necessary for machines to achieve human-level visual perception. To address this, we study whether generative and non-generative methods can achieve compositional generalization, a hallmark of human perception. Under a compositional data generating process, we formalize the inductive biases required to guarantee compositional generalization in decoder-based (generative) and encoder-based (non-generative) methods. We then show theoretically that enforcing these inductive biases on encoders is generally infeasible using regularization or architectural constraints. In contrast, for generative methods, the inductive biases can be enforced straightforwardly, thereby enabling compositional generalization by constraining a decoder and inverting it. We highlight how this inversion can be performed efficiently, either online through gradient-based search or offline through generative replay. We examine the empirical implications of our theory by training a range of generative and non-generative methods on photorealistic image datasets. We find that, without the necessary inductive biases, non-generative methods often fail to generalize compositionally and require large-scale pretraining or added supervision to improve generalization. By comparison, generative methods yield significant improvements in compositional generalization, without requiring additional data, by leveraging suitable inductive biases on a decoder along with search and replay.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models often fail under realistic scene changes despite impressive capabilities. There's a need for verifiable geometric reasoning as a critical component for trustworthy and controllable agentic AI.

Method: Created Tri-Bench with planar triangle problems isolating relative geometric reasoning, testing camera pose (planar vs. tilted) and scene context via object interference. Evaluated four recent VLMs with fixed prompt containing explicit guardrail describing surrounding square border for homography-based correct answers.

Result: Overall accuracy modest (~69% average), aligns more closely with 2D projections (~72%). All VLMs fail on minority shape classes (0% accuracy). Accuracy degrades ~4.1% under camera tilt. Object interference has no significant effect.

Conclusion: VLMs fail to correctly utilize explicit frame-of-reference hints, defaulting to 2D image plane cues instead of 3D reasoning. Demonstrates limitations in geometric reasoning capabilities critical for trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Verifiable geometric reasoning is a critical component for trustworthy and controllable agentic AI. Despite impressive capabilities, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often fail under realistic scene changes. We present Tri-Bench, a compact benchmark of planar triangle problems that isolates relative geometric reasoning while stressing two deployment-critical factors: camera pose (planar vs. tilted) and scene context via object interference (10 everyday objects). To test verifiability and control, we evaluate four recent VLMs using a single, fixed prompt whose guardrail explicitly describes a surrounding square border, enabling correct answers via homography. We evaluate six simple tasks over binary and continuous targets, and observe that the overall accuracy with respect to 3D ground truth is modest, ~69% on average (best ~75%, worst ~64%). The same responses align even more closely with 2D projections in the image plane, where mean accuracy is ~72%. All four VLMs consistently fail, with accuracy falling to ~0%, on recognizing minority shape classes (equilateral, isosceles, right-angled triangles). Additionally, overall VLM accuracy degrades by ~4.1% under camera tilt. This demonstrates that models fail to correctly utilize the explicit frame-of-reference hint provided in the prompt and default to 2D image plane cues. Finally, we find that object interference has no significant effect on VLM accuracy.

Our approach involves finetuning a pretrained VLM on a diverse set of instruction-following tasks, while interfacing a dedicated grounding module through specialized control tokens for localization. This method facilitates joint reasoning over both language and spatial information, significantly enhancing the model's ability to precisely localize objects in complex satellite scenes. We evaluate our framework on several remote sensing benchmarks, consistently improving the state-of-the-art, including a 24.8% relative improvement over previous methods on visual grounding.

Motivation: Current methods for content-aware layout generation either address only subsets of tasks or require separate models for different conditions, lacking a truly unified solution for diverse input-constrained generation sub-tasks.

Method: Proposes UniLayDiff: a Unified Diffusion Transformer using Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer framework to capture interplay between background image, layout elements, and diverse constraints. Treats constraints as distinct modality and integrates relation constraints through LoRA fine-tuning after pretraining on other tasks.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across from unconditional to various conditional generation tasks, and is the first model to unify the full range of content-aware layout generation tasks.

Conclusion: UniLayDiff successfully addresses various content-aware layout generation tasks with a single end-to-end trainable model, achieving unified conditional generation while enhancing overall layout quality.

Abstract: Content-aware layout generation is a critical task in graphic design automation, focused on creating visually appealing arrangements of elements that seamlessly blend with a given background image. The variety of real-world applications makes it highly challenging to develop a single model capable of unifying the diverse range of input-constrained generation sub-tasks, such as those conditioned by element types, sizes, or their relationships. Current methods either address only a subset of these tasks or necessitate separate model parameters for different conditions, failing to offer a truly unified solution. In this paper, we propose UniLayDiff: a Unified Diffusion Transformer, that for the first time, addresses various content-aware layout generation tasks with a single, end-to-end trainable model. Specifically, we treat layout constraints as a distinct modality and employ Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer framework to capture the complex interplay between the background image, layout elements, and diverse constraints. Moreover, we integrate relation constraints through fine-tuning the model with LoRA after pretraining the model on other tasks. Such a schema not only achieves unified conditional generation but also enhances overall layout quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniLayDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance across from unconditional to various conditional generation tasks and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first model to unify the full range of content-aware layout generation tasks.

Conclusion: EvoScene successfully addresses the challenge of generating high-quality, textured 3D scenes from single images by combining complementary strengths of existing models through an iterative refinement process.

Abstract: Generating high-quality, textured 3D scenes from a single image remains a fundamental challenge in vision and graphics. Recent image-to-3D generators recover reasonable geometry from single views, but their object-centric training limits generalization to complex, large-scale scenes with faithful structure and texture. We present EvoScene, a self-evolving, training-free framework that progressively reconstructs complete 3D scenes from single images. The key idea is combining the complementary strengths of existing models: geometric reasoning from 3D generation models and visual knowledge from video generation models. Through three iterative stages--Spatial Prior Initialization, Visual-guided 3D Scene Mesh Generation, and Spatial-guided Novel View Generation--EvoScene alternates between 2D and 3D domains, gradually improving both structure and appearance. Experiments on diverse scenes demonstrate that EvoScene achieves superior geometric stability, view-consistent textures, and unseen-region completion compared to strong baselines, producing ready-to-use 3D meshes for practical applications.

TL;DR: UniT is a unified text restoration framework that combines diffusion transformers, vision-language models, and text spotting to recover high-quality images with accurate text while reducing hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models for image restoration often produce text hallucinations in text-centric tasks due to lack of explicit linguistic knowledge, creating a need for frameworks that can faithfully reconstruct degraded text content.

Method: UniT integrates Diffusion Transformer (DiT), Vision-Language Model (VLM), and Text Spotting Module (TSM) iteratively: VLM extracts text guidance, TSM generates intermediate OCR predictions at each denoising step, and DiT leverages these cues for fine-grained text recovery.

Result: UniT achieves state-of-the-art end-to-end F1-score performance on SA-Text and Real-Text benchmarks, faithfully reconstructing degraded text while substantially reducing hallucinations.

Conclusion: The proposed UniT framework effectively addresses text hallucinations in TAIR tasks by integrating explicit linguistic guidance through iterative refinement, demonstrating superior text restoration capabilities compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Text-Aware Image Restoration (TAIR) aims to recover high-quality images from low-quality inputs containing degraded textual content. While diffusion models provide strong generative priors for general image restoration, they often produce text hallucinations in text-centric tasks due to the absence of explicit linguistic knowledge. To address this, we propose UniT, a unified text restoration framework that integrates a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), a Vision-Language Model (VLM), and a Text Spotting Module (TSM) in an iterative fashion for high-fidelity text restoration. In UniT, the VLM extracts textual content from degraded images to provide explicit textual guidance. Simultaneously, the TSM, trained on diffusion features, generates intermediate OCR predictions at each denoising step, enabling the VLM to iteratively refine its guidance during the denoising process. Finally, the DiT backbone, leveraging its strong representational power, exploit these cues to recover fine-grained textual content while effectively suppressing text hallucinations. Experiments on the SA-Text and Real-Text benchmarks demonstrate that UniT faithfully reconstructs degraded text, substantially reduces hallucinations, and achieves state-of-the-art end-to-end F1-score performance in TAIR task.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art, outperforming previous methods across wide spectrum of 4D reconstruction tasks with lightweight, scalable design enabling efficient training and inference.

Conclusion: D4RT presents an effective solution for dynamic scene reconstruction that balances simplicity, efficiency, and performance through its innovative query-based transformer approach.

Abstract: Understanding and reconstructing the complex geometry and motion of dynamic scenes from video remains a formidable challenge in computer vision. This paper introduces D4RT, a simple yet powerful feedforward model designed to efficiently solve this task. D4RT utilizes a unified transformer architecture to jointly infer depth, spatio-temporal correspondence, and full camera parameters from a single video. Its core innovation is a novel querying mechanism that sidesteps the heavy computation of dense, per-frame decoding and the complexity of managing multiple, task-specific decoders. Our decoding interface allows the model to independently and flexibly probe the 3D position of any point in space and time. The result is a lightweight and highly scalable method that enables remarkably efficient training and inference. We demonstrate that our approach sets a new state of the art, outperforming previous methods across a wide spectrum of 4D reconstruction tasks.

*Youming Deng,Songyou Peng,Junyi Zhang,Kathryn Heal,Tiancheng Sun,John Flynn,Steve Marschner,Lucy Chai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Selfi improves 3D reconstruction by aligning VGGT features for geometric consistency, boosting both novel view synthesis and camera pose estimation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional NVS requires explicit 3D biases and known camera parameters, while VGGT learns 3D implicitly but lacks multi-view geometric consistency in its features, which limits 3D reasoning tasks.

Method: Selfi trains a lightweight feature adapter using reprojection-based consistency loss to distill VGGT outputs into geometrically-aligned features, using VGGT's own outputs as pseudo-ground-truth for self-improvement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in both novel view synthesis and camera pose estimation, demonstrating that feature alignment significantly benefits downstream 3D reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Feature alignment is a crucial step for improving 3D feature consistency in vision foundation models, enabling them to serve as high-fidelity 3D reconstruction engines without explicit geometric priors.

Abstract: Novel View Synthesis (NVS) has traditionally relied on models with explicit 3D inductive biases combined with known camera parameters from Structure-from-Motion (SfM) beforehand. Recent vision foundation models like VGGT take an orthogonal approach -- 3D knowledge is gained implicitly through training data and loss objectives, enabling feed-forward prediction of both camera parameters and 3D representations directly from a set of uncalibrated images. While flexible, VGGT features lack explicit multi-view geometric consistency, and we find that improving such 3D feature consistency benefits both NVS and pose estimation tasks. We introduce Selfi, a self-improving 3D reconstruction pipeline via feature alignment, transforming a VGGT backbone into a high-fidelity 3D reconstruction engine by leveraging its own outputs as pseudo-ground-truth. Specifically, we train a lightweight feature adapter using a reprojection-based consistency loss, which distills VGGT outputs into a new geometrically-aligned feature space that captures spatial proximity in 3D. This enables state-of-the-art performance in both NVS and camera pose estimation, demonstrating that feature alignment is a highly beneficial step for downstream 3D reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DOD outperforms OOD in multi-threaded A* search with better cache efficiency and execution times, though single-threaded versions beat multi-threaded ones due to thread overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the performance gap between multi-core CPUs and main memory by comparing hardware-aware Data Oriented Design (DOD) with traditional Object-Oriented Design (OOD) for cache utilization in multi-threaded environments.

Method: Developed and compared four versions of A* search algorithm: single-threaded OOD (ST-OOD), single-threaded DOD (ST-DOD), multi-threaded OOD (MT-OOD), and multi-threaded DOD (MT-DOD). Evaluated using execution time, memory usage, and CPU cache misses.

Result: DOD showed significant performance gains in multi-threaded tests with faster execution times and fewer cache misses. Single-threaded versions outperformed multi-threaded counterparts in both paradigms due to thread management overhead.

Conclusion: DOD demonstrates foundational architectural superiority for hardware efficiency, making it more effective for complex, large-scale AI and parallel computing tasks despite subtle differences in simple algorithms.

Abstract: The growing performance gap between multi-core CPUs and main memory necessitates hardware-aware software design paradigms. This study provides a comprehensive performance analysis of Data Oriented Design (DOD) versus the traditional Object-Oriented Design (OOD), focusing on cache utilization and efficiency in multi-threaded environments. We developed and compared four distinct versions of the A* search algorithm: single-threaded OOD (ST-OOD), single-threaded DOD (ST-DOD), multi-threaded OOD (MT-OOD), and multi-threaded DOD (MT-DOD). The evaluation was based on metrics including execution time, memory usage, and CPU cache misses. In multi-threaded tests, the DOD implementation demonstrated considerable performance gains, with faster execution times and a lower number of raw system calls and cache misses. While OOD occasionally showed marginal advantages in memory usage or percentage-based cache miss rates, DOD's efficiency in data-intensive operations was more evident. Furthermore, our findings reveal that for a fine-grained task like the A* algorithm, the overhead associated with thread management led to single-threaded versions significantly outperforming their multi-threaded counterparts in both paradigms. We conclude that even when performance differences appear subtle in simple algorithms, the consistent advantages of DOD in critical metrics highlight its foundational architectural superiority, suggesting it is a more effective approach for maximizing hardware efficiency in complex, large-scale AI and parallel computing tasks.

*Arvind Agarwal,Lisa Amini,Sameep Mehta,Horst Samulowitz,Kavitha Srinivas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues for a paradigm shift from AI-assisted data management to fully autonomous data estates using intelligent agents across the entire data lifecycle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI assistants only help specific personas with limited tasks, falling short of full automation despite AI's increasing capability to handle complex tasks. There's an imminent opportunity to achieve fully autonomous data management as AI advances.

Method: Proposes using intelligent agents to autonomously manage each stage of the modern data stack, creating self-sufficient systems that serve both human end-users and AI itself. Examines how agents can streamline the entire data lifecycle.

Result: The paper presents a vision for autonomous data estates but doesn't report specific experimental results. Instead, it identifies open questions and areas needing additional research to achieve this paradigm shift.

Conclusion: A paradigm shift from AI-assisted to fully autonomous data management is both necessary and achievable. The paper aims to inspire debate, stimulate research, motivate collaboration, and facilitate a more autonomous future for data systems.

Abstract: Enterprise data management is a monumental task. It spans data architecture and systems, integration, quality, governance, and continuous improvement. While AI assistants can help specific persona, such as data engineers and stewards, to navigate and configure the data stack, they fall far short of full automation. However, as AI becomes increasingly capable of tackling tasks that have previously resisted automation due to inherent complexities, we believe there is an imminent opportunity to target fully autonomous data estates. Currently, AI is used in different parts of the data stack, but in this paper, we argue for a paradigm shift from the use of AI in independent data component operations towards a more holistic and autonomous handling of the entire data lifecycle. Towards that end, we explore how each stage of the modern data stack can be autonomously managed by intelligent agents to build self-sufficient systems that can be used not only by human end-users, but also by AI itself. We begin by describing the mounting forces and opportunities that demand this paradigm shift, examine how agents can streamline the data lifecycle, and highlight open questions and areas where additional research is needed. We hope this work will inspire lively debate, stimulate further research, motivate collaborative approaches, and facilitate a more autonomous future for data systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SkipKV is a training-free KV cache compression method for large reasoning models that uses sentence-level eviction and generation steering to reduce KV cache overhead while maintaining reasoning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models suffer from significant KV cache overhead that grows linearly with chain-of-thought reasoning, causing memory and throughput bottlenecks. Existing token-level eviction methods fail in multi-batch settings due to unstable scoring and padding issues, and often generate longer sequences through repeated revalidation.

Method: SkipKV operates at sentence-level rather than token-level: 1) Uses a sentence-scoring metric to identify and remove highly similar sentences while maintaining semantic coherence, 2) Dynamically adjusts a steering vector to update hidden activation states during inference to suppress redundant generation and produce concise responses.

Result: SkipKV maintains up to 26.7% improved accuracy compared to alternatives at similar compression budgets, generates up to 1.6× fewer tokens than state-of-the-art methods, and improves throughput up to 1.7× across multiple reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: SkipKV effectively addresses KV cache overhead in large reasoning models through coarse-grained sentence-level compression, overcoming limitations of token-level methods while maintaining reasoning accuracy and improving inference efficiency.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) often cost significant key-value (KV) cache overhead, due to their linear growth with the verbose chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process. This costs both memory and throughput bottleneck limiting their efficient deployment. Towards reducing KV cache size during inference, we first investigate the effectiveness of existing KV cache eviction methods for CoT reasoning. Interestingly, we find that due to unstable token-wise scoring and the reduced effective KV budget caused by padding tokens, state-of-the-art (SoTA) eviction methods fail to maintain accuracy in the multi-batch setting. Additionally, these methods often generate longer sequences than the original model, as semantic-unaware token-wise eviction leads to repeated revalidation during reasoning. To address these issues, we present \textbf{SkipKV}, a \textbf{\textit{training-free}} KV compression method for selective \textit{eviction} and \textit{generation} operating at a coarse-grained sentence-level sequence removal for efficient CoT reasoning. In specific, it introduces a \textit{sentence-scoring metric} to identify and remove highly similar sentences while maintaining semantic coherence. To suppress redundant generation, SkipKV dynamically adjusts a steering vector to update the hidden activation states during inference enforcing the LRM to generate concise response. Extensive evaluations on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SkipKV in maintaining up to $\mathbf{26.7}\%$ improved accuracy compared to the alternatives, at a similar compression budget. Additionally, compared to SoTA, SkipKV yields up to $\mathbf{1.6}\times$ fewer generation length while improving throughput up to $\mathbf{1.7}\times$.

Conclusion: AI-augmented patient-trial matching system addresses key implementation challenges, reduces coordinator burden, intelligently broadens trial consideration, and maintains rigorous security standards for clinical deployment.

Abstract: Screening patients for clinical trial eligibility remains a manual, time-consuming, and resource-intensive process. We present a secure, scalable proof-of-concept system for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-augmented patient-trial matching that addresses key implementation challenges: integrating heterogeneous electronic health record (EHR) data, facilitating expert review, and maintaining rigorous security standards. Leveraging open-source, reasoning-enabled large language models (LLMs), the system moves beyond binary classification to generate structured eligibility assessments with interpretable reasoning chains that support human-in-the-loop review. This decision support tool represents eligibility as a dynamic state rather than a fixed determination, identifying matches when available and offering actionable recommendations that could render a patient eligible in the future. The system aims to reduce coordinator burden, intelligently broaden the set of trials considered for each patient and guarantee comprehensive auditability of all AI-generated outputs.

Key functionalities such as user profile management, activity tracking, and read-intensive prediction operations successfully achieved the desired performance. The system demonstrated the ability to handle up to 10,000 concurrent users without issues, validating its scalability. The implementation of asynchronous communication using RabbitMQ proved crucial in minimizing the error rate for computationally intensive prediction requests, ensuring system reliability by queuing requests and preventing data loss under heavy load.

### [118] [Empowerment Gain and Causal Model Construction: Children and adults are sensitive to controllability and variability in their causal interventions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08230)
*Eunice Yiu,Kelsey Allen,Shiry Ginosar,Alison Gopnik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores empowerment as a bridge between Bayesian causal learning and reinforcement learning, suggesting it explains human causal learning and could enable machines to learn causal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models struggle with causal learning, while humans excel at it. The paper aims to bridge the gap between Bayesian causal learning (Causal Bayes Net formalism) and reinforcement learning through the concept of "empowerment" - an intrinsic reward signal that maximizes mutual information between actions and outcomes.

Method: The paper proposes using empowerment as a theoretical framework connecting causal learning approaches. It conducts an empirical study systematically testing how children and adults use empowerment cues to infer causal relations and design effective interventions.

Result: The abstract doesn't provide specific empirical results, but suggests that empowerment may explain distinctive features of children's causal learning and provide a more tractable computational account of how such learning is possible.

Conclusion: Empowerment serves as a crucial link between Bayesian causal learning and reinforcement learning, potentially explaining human causal learning capabilities and enabling similar capabilities in machines through a more computationally tractable approach.

Abstract: Learning about the causal structure of the world is a fundamental problem for human cognition. Causal models and especially causal learning have proved to be difficult for large pretrained models using standard techniques of deep learning. In contrast, cognitive scientists have applied advances in our formal understanding of causation in computer science, particularly within the Causal Bayes Net formalism, to understand human causal learning. In the very different tradition of reinforcement learning, researchers have described an intrinsic reward signal called "empowerment" which maximizes mutual information between actions and their outcomes. "Empowerment" may be an important bridge between classical Bayesian causal learning and reinforcement learning and may help to characterize causal learning in humans and enable it in machines. If an agent learns an accurate causal world model, they will necessarily increase their empowerment, and increasing empowerment will lead to a more accurate causal world model. Empowerment may also explain distinctive features of childrens causal learning, as well as providing a more tractable computational account of how that learning is possible. In an empirical study, we systematically test how children and adults use cues to empowerment to infer causal relations, and design effective causal interventions.

*Yibowen Zhao,Yinan Zhang,Zhixiang Su,Lizhen Cui,Chunyan Miao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KPI framework uses medical knowledge graphs, disease prototypes, and LLM explanations to improve disease prediction from patient self-reported data, addressing imbalance and interpretability issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing disease prediction methods from patient-side information face challenges with imbalanced disease distributions and lack of interpretability, leading to biased or unreliable predictions that limit clinical utility.

Method: KPI framework integrates medical knowledge into a unified disease knowledge graph, constructs clinically meaningful disease prototypes, uses contrastive learning for accuracy (especially for long-tailed diseases), and employs LLMs to generate patient-specific medical explanations.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show KPI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in predictive accuracy and provides clinically valid explanations that align closely with patient narratives.

Conclusion: KPI demonstrates practical value for patient-centered healthcare delivery by improving both predictive accuracy and interpretability for disease prediction from patient self-reported information.

Abstract: Predicting diseases solely from patient-side information, such as demographics and self-reported symptoms, has attracted significant research attention due to its potential to enhance patient awareness, facilitate early healthcare engagement, and improve healthcare system efficiency. However, existing approaches encounter critical challenges, including imbalanced disease distributions and a lack of interpretability, resulting in biased or unreliable predictions. To address these issues, we propose the Knowledge graph-enhanced, Prototype-aware, and Interpretable (KPI) framework. KPI systematically integrates structured and trusted medical knowledge into a unified disease knowledge graph, constructs clinically meaningful disease prototypes, and employs contrastive learning to enhance predictive accuracy, which is particularly important for long-tailed diseases. Additionally, KPI utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate patient-specific, medically relevant explanations, thereby improving interpretability and reliability. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that KPI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in predictive accuracy and provides clinically valid explanations that closely align with patient narratives, highlighting its practical value for patient-centered healthcare delivery.

Result: Generative Agents provide rapid, cost-effective content evaluation, enabling businesses to streamline content generation and ensure consistent high-quality output.

Conclusion: Generative Agents offer significant advancements in automated content generation and evaluation, enhancing LLMs for producing business-aligned, high-quality content.

Abstract: Modern businesses are increasingly challenged by the time and expense required to generate and assess high-quality content.

This research introduces Generative Agents as a means to tackle these challenges. These agents can rapidly and cost-effectively evaluate AI-generated content, simulating human judgment by rating aspects such as coherence, interestingness, clarity, fairness, and relevance. By incorporating these agents, businesses can streamline content generation and ensure consistent, high-quality output while minimizing reliance on costly human evaluations. The study provides critical insights into enhancing LLMs for producing business-aligned, high-quality content, offering significant advancements in automated content generation and evaluation.

TL;DR: Quantitative scaling principles for LM-based agent systems reveal tool-coordination trade-offs, capability saturation effects, and topology-dependent error amplification across diverse benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite widespread adoption of LM-based agent systems for reasoning, planning, and acting, the principles determining their performance remain underexplored, leaving practitioners to rely on heuristics rather than principled design choices.

Method: Evaluated across four diverse benchmarks (Finance-Agent, BrowseComp-Plus, PlanCraft, Workbench) using five canonical architectures (Single, Independent, Centralized, Decentralized, Hybrid) instantiated across three LLM families, performing controlled evaluation spanning 180 configurations with standardized tools and token budgets.

Result: Derived predictive model using empirical coordination metrics (efficiency, overhead, error amplification, redundancy) achieving cross-validated R^2=0.513. Identified three dominant effects: tool-coordination trade-off, capability saturation (beta=-0.408, p<0.001), and topology-dependent error amplification (independent agents amplify errors 17.2x vs centralized 4.4x). Centralized coordination improves parallelizable tasks by 80.9%, while decentralized excels on dynamic web navigation (+9.2% vs +0.2%).

Conclusion: Framework predicts optimal coordination strategy for 87% of held-out configurations, providing predictive principles for agentic scaling based on measurable task properties, enabling principled design choices rather than heuristic approaches.

Abstract: Agents, language model (LM)-based systems that are capable of reasoning, planning, and acting are becoming the dominant paradigm for real-world AI applications. Despite this widespread adoption, the principles that determine their performance remain underexplored, leaving practitioners to rely on heuristics rather than principled design choices. We address this gap by deriving quantitative scaling principles for agent systems. We evaluate this across four diverse benchmarks: Finance-Agent, BrowseComp-Plus, PlanCraft, and Workbench. Using five canonical architectures (Single, Independent, Centralized, Decentralized, Hybrid) instantiated across three LLM families, we perform a controlled evaluation spanning 180 configurations with standardized tools and token budgets. We derive a predictive model using empirical coordination metrics, including efficiency, overhead, error amplification, and redundancy, that achieves cross-validated R^2=0.513. We identify three dominant effects: (1) a tool-coordination trade-off: under fixed computational budgets, tool-heavy tasks suffer disproportionately from multi-agent overhead. (2) a capability saturation: coordination yields diminishing or negative returns (beta=-0.408, p<0.001) once single-agent baselines exceed ~45%. (3) topology-dependent error amplification: independent agents amplify errors 17.2x through unchecked propagation, while centralized coordination contains this to 4.4x. Centralized coordination improves performance by 80.9% on parallelizable tasks like financial reasoning, while decentralized coordination excels on dynamic web navigation (+9.2% vs. +0.2%). Yet for sequential reasoning tasks, all multi-agent variants degraded performance by 39-70%. The framework predicts the optimal coordination strategy for 87% of held-out configurations, providing a predictive principle of agentic scaling based on measurable task properties.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new method called reinforced strategy injection mechanism (rSIM) uses multi-agent RL to train a small planner that guides LLMs' reasoning, enabling smaller models to outperform much larger ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can evolve into Reasoning Language Models (RLMs) through RL, showing "aha" moments with strategies like self-reflection in chain of thoughts. The paper aims to develop a mechanism to enable any LLM to become an RLM by injecting reasoning strategies.

Method: Proposes rSIM with a small planner (leader agent) that adaptively injects reasoning strategies into LLM's chain of thoughts. Uses multi-agent RL (MARL) with leader-follower framework and rule-based rewards to jointly train planner and LLM.

Result: rSIM enables Qwen2.5-0.5B to become an RLM and significantly outperform Qwen2.5-14B. The planner is generalizable - trained once, works as plug-in for existing LLMs, and supports continual learning across tasks.

Conclusion: rSIM provides an effective approach to enhance reasoning capabilities of LLMs through strategy injection, enabling smaller models to achieve superior performance and offering a reusable, continually improvable planning component.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are post-trained through reinforcement learning (RL) to evolve into Reasoning Language Models (RLMs), where the hallmark of this advanced reasoning is ``aha'' moments when they start to perform strategies, such as self-reflection and deep thinking, within chain of thoughts (CoTs). Motivated by this, this paper proposes a novel reinforced strategy injection mechanism (rSIM), that enables any LLM to become an RLM by employing a small planner to guide the LLM's CoT through the adaptive injection of reasoning strategies. To achieve this, the planner (leader agent) is jointly trained with an LLM (follower agent) using multi-agent RL (MARL), based on a leader-follower framework and straightforward rule-based rewards. Experimental results show that rSIM enables Qwen2.5-0.5B to become an RLM and significantly outperform Qwen2.5-14B. Moreover, the planner is generalizable: it only needs to be trained once and can be applied as a plug-in to substantially improve the reasoning capabilities of existing LLMs. In addition, the planner supports continual learning across various tasks, allowing its planning abilities to gradually improve and generalize to a wider range of problems.

Conclusion: ML models, particularly random forest, offer effective alternative to traditional CBR testing, supporting digital transformation in geotechnical engineering and infrastructure design through intelligent, data-centric approaches.

Abstract: The California Bearing Ratio (CBR) is a key geotechnical indicator used to assess the load-bearing capacity of subgrade soils, especially in transportation infrastructure and foundation design. Traditional CBR determination relies on laboratory penetration tests. Despite their accuracy, these tests are often time-consuming, costly, and can be impractical, particularly for large-scale or diverse soil profiles. Recent progress in artificial intelligence, especially machine learning (ML), has enabled data-driven approaches for modeling complex soil behavior with greater speed and precision. This study introduces a comprehensive ML framework for CBR prediction using a dataset of 382 soil samples collected from various geoclimatic regions in Türkiye. The dataset includes physicochemical soil properties relevant to bearing capacity, allowing multidimensional feature representation in a supervised learning context. Twelve ML algorithms were tested, including decision tree, random forest, extra trees, gradient boosting, xgboost, k-nearest neighbors, support vector regression, multi-layer perceptron, adaboost, bagging, voting, and stacking regressors. Each model was trained, validated, and evaluated to assess its generalization and robustness. Among them, the random forest regressor performed the best, achieving strong R2 scores of 0.95 (training), 0.76 (validation), and 0.83 (test). These outcomes highlight the model's powerful nonlinear mapping ability, making it a promising tool for predictive geotechnical tasks. The study supports the integration of intelligent, data-centric models in geotechnical engineering, offering an effective alternative to traditional methods and promoting digital transformation in infrastructure analysis and design.

TL;DR: A novel XAI framework for GNNs that provides adaptable, efficient explanations by capturing how graph structure influences predictions, addressing limitations of current post-hoc and interpretable methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs are powerful for graph-structured data but their complexity makes decision-making opaque. Current XAI methods struggle with intricate graph relationships - post-hoc methods are computationally expensive and unreliable, while interpretable models lack generalizability.

Method: Proposes a novel XAI framework specifically designed for graph-based ML that moves beyond individual feature analysis to capture structural influences on predictions, aiming for adaptability and computational efficiency.

Result: The thesis seeks to develop this framework (no specific results reported in abstract, as this appears to be a proposal/research plan).

Conclusion: A new XAI approach is needed for GNNs that balances adaptability, efficiency, and structural understanding to overcome limitations of existing explanation methods for graph-based models.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a powerful tool for modeling and analyzing data with graph structures. The wide adoption in numerous applications underscores the value of these models. However, the complexity of these methods often impedes understanding their decision-making processes. Current Explainable AI (XAI) methods struggle to untangle the intricate relationships and interactions within graphs. Several methods have tried to bridge this gap via a post-hoc approach or self-interpretable design. Most of them focus on graph structure analysis to determine essential patterns that correlate with prediction outcomes. While post-hoc explanation methods are adaptable, they require extra computational resources and may be less reliable due to limited access to the model's internal workings. Conversely, Interpretable models can provide immediate explanations, but their generalizability to different scenarios remains a major concern. To address these shortcomings, this thesis seeks to develop a novel XAI framework tailored for graph-based machine learning. The proposed framework aims to offer adaptable, computationally efficient explanations for GNNs, moving beyond individual feature analysis to capture how graph structure influences predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Workplace toxicity harms organizational culture but quantifying its direct impact on operational efficiency is challenging due to ethical and practical difficulties in reproducing conflict with human subjects. There's a need for controlled, ethical methods to measure how social friction affects productivity.

Method: Uses LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems to simulate 1-on-1 adversarial debates in a "sociological sandbox." Employs Monte Carlo method to simulate hundreds of discussions, measuring convergence time (arguments needed to reach conclusion) between baseline control groups and treatment groups with "toxic" system prompts.

The approach demonstrates that workplace toxicity directly increases operational latency, offering quantifiable evidence of its organizational costs.

Abstract: Workplace toxicity is widely recognized as detrimental to organizational culture, yet quantifying its direct impact on operational efficiency remains methodologically challenging due to the ethical and practical difficulties of reproducing conflict in human subjects. This study leverages Large Language Model (LLM) based Multi-Agent Systems to simulate 1-on-1 adversarial debates, creating a controlled "sociological sandbox". We employ a Monte Carlo method to simulate hundrets of discussions, measuring the convergence time (defined as the number of arguments required to reach a conclusion) between a baseline control group and treatment groups involving agents with "toxic" system prompts. Our results demonstrate a statistically significant increase of approximately 25\% in the duration of conversations involving toxic participants. We propose that this "latency of toxicity" serves as a proxy for financial damage in corporate and academic settings. Furthermore, we demonstrate that agent-based modeling provides a reproducible, ethical alternative to human-subject research for measuring the mechanics of social friction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents rely on external demonstrations or retrieval-augmented planning, which leads to brittleness, poor generalization, and high computational overhead. The authors aim to create a more robust and efficient approach inspired by human problem-solving.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ALFWorld (37.1% success with Llama3.1-70B, more than doubling prior best of 13.0%) and Mind2Web (4.02%, also more than doubling strongest baseline). Reduces per-step token consumption by 3-9X while maintaining strong performance.

Conclusion: DuSAR demonstrates that dual-strategy coordination with reflection enables efficient, robust LLM agent performance without external demonstrations, while remaining compatible with optional expert knowledge integration for further improvements.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents often rely on external demonstrations or retrieval-augmented planning, leading to brittleness, poor generalization, and high computational overhead. Inspired by human problem-solving, we propose DuSAR (Dual-Strategy Agent with Reflecting) - a demonstration-free framework that enables a single frozen LLM to perform co-adaptive reasoning via two complementary strategies: a high-level holistic plan and a context-grounded local policy. These strategies interact through a lightweight reflection mechanism, where the agent continuously assesses progress via a Strategy Fitness Score and dynamically revises its global plan when stuck or refines it upon meaningful advancement, mimicking human metacognitive behavior. On ALFWorld and Mind2Web, DuSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance with open-source LLMs (7B-70B), reaching 37.1% success on ALFWorld (Llama3.1-70B) - more than doubling the best prior result (13.0%) - and 4.02% on Mind2Web, also more than doubling the strongest baseline. Remarkably, it reduces per-step token consumption by 3-9X while maintaining strong performance. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of dual-strategy coordination. Moreover, optional integration of expert demonstrations further boosts results, highlighting DuSAR's flexibility and compatibility with external knowledge.

Conclusion: DeepFeature represents a significant advancement in feature extraction for wearable biosignals by leveraging LLMs to create context-aware features that outperform existing methods while ensuring robust implementation through verification mechanisms.

Abstract: Biosignals collected from wearable devices are widely utilized in healthcare applications. Machine learning models used in these applications often rely on features extracted from biosignals due to their effectiveness, lower data dimensionality, and wide compatibility across various model architectures. However, existing feature extraction methods often lack task-specific contextual knowledge, struggle to identify optimal feature extraction settings in high-dimensional feature space, and are prone to code generation and automation errors. In this paper, we propose DeepFeature, the first LLM-empowered, context-aware feature generation framework for wearable biosignals. DeepFeature introduces a multi-source feature generation mechanism that integrates expert knowledge with task settings. It also employs an iterative feature refinement process that uses feature assessment-based feedback for feature re-selection. Additionally, DeepFeature utilizes a robust multi-layer filtering and verification approach for robust feature-to-code translation to ensure that the extraction functions run without crashing. Experimental evaluation results show that DeepFeature achieves an average AUROC improvement of 4.21-9.67% across eight diverse tasks compared to baseline methods. It outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on five tasks while maintaining comparable performance on the remaining tasks.

*Mingwei Li,Xiaoyuan Zhang,Chengwei Yang,Zilong Zheng,Yaodong Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PRISM-WM is a structured world model that decomposes hybrid dynamics into composable primitives using a Mixture-of-Experts framework to accurately model sharp mode transitions and reduce rollout drift in robotic planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model-based planning in robotics struggles with hybrid dynamics where continuous motion is interrupted by discrete events like contacts. Conventional neural world models enforce global continuity, over-smoothing distinct dynamic modes (sticking vs. sliding, flight vs. stance), causing catastrophic compounding errors during long-horizon planning at physical boundaries.

Method: PRISM-WM uses a context-aware Mixture-of-Experts framework where a gating mechanism identifies the current physical mode, and specialized experts predict associated transition dynamics. It includes a latent orthogonalization objective to ensure expert diversity and prevent mode collapse.

Result: PRISM-WM significantly reduces rollout drift by accurately modeling sharp mode transitions in system dynamics. Extensive experiments on challenging continuous control benchmarks (including high-dimensional humanoids and diverse multi-task settings) show it provides superior high-fidelity substrate for trajectory optimization algorithms like TD-MPC.

Conclusion: PRISM-WM demonstrates potential as a powerful foundational model for next-generation model-based agents by effectively addressing the fundamental challenge of hybrid dynamics in robotic planning through structured decomposition of complex dynamics into composable primitives.

Abstract: Model-based planning in robotic domains is fundamentally challenged by the hybrid nature of physical dynamics, where continuous motion is punctuated by discrete events such as contacts and impacts. Conventional latent world models typically employ monolithic neural networks that enforce global continuity, inevitably over-smoothing the distinct dynamic modes (e.g., sticking vs. sliding, flight vs. stance). For a planner, this smoothing results in catastrophic compounding errors during long-horizon lookaheads, rendering the search process unreliable at physical boundaries. To address this, we introduce the Prismatic World Model (PRISM-WM), a structured architecture designed to decompose complex hybrid dynamics into composable primitives. PRISM-WM leverages a context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework where a gating mechanism implicitly identifies the current physical mode, and specialized experts predict the associated transition dynamics. We further introduce a latent orthogonalization objective to ensure expert diversity, effectively preventing mode collapse. By accurately modeling the sharp mode transitions in system dynamics, PRISM-WM significantly reduces rollout drift. Extensive experiments on challenging continuous control benchmarks, including high-dimensional humanoids and diverse multi-task settings, demonstrate that PRISM-WM provides a superior high-fidelity substrate for trajectory optimization algorithms (e.g., TD-MPC), proving its potential as a powerful foundational model for next-generation model-based agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI approaches focus too much on technical metrics while ignoring sociotechnical dimensions and alignment with human values, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare, finance, and public policy.

Method: Maps ToC's five-stage model (Inputs-Activities-Outputs-Outcomes-Impact) to AI architectural layers (Data-Pipeline-Inference-Agentic-Normative) with components like Pareto optimization, multi-agent orchestration, causal DAGs, adversarial debiasing, and RLHF.

Result: Provides formal mathematical formulations and an Assurance Layer for managing assumption failures, demonstrated through three case studies in healthcare, cybersecurity, and software engineering.

Conclusion: IDAIF represents a paradigm shift from model-centric to impact-centric AI development, offering concrete architectural patterns for building ethical, trustworthy, and socially beneficial AI systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Impact-Driven AI Framework (IDAIF), a novel architectural methodology that integrates Theory of Change (ToC) principles with modern artificial intelligence system design. As AI systems increasingly influence high-stakes domains including healthcare, finance, and public policy, the alignment problem--ensuring AI behavior corresponds with human values and intentions--has become critical. Current approaches predominantly optimize technical performance metrics while neglecting the sociotechnical dimensions of AI deployment. IDAIF addresses this gap by establishing a systematic mapping between ToC's five-stage model (Inputs-Activities-Outputs-Outcomes-Impact) and corresponding AI architectural layers (Data Layer-Pipeline Layer-Inference Layer-Agentic Layer-Normative Layer). Each layer incorporates rigorous theoretical foundations: multi-objective Pareto optimization for value alignment, hierarchical multi-agent orchestration for outcome achievement, causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for hallucination mitigation, and adversarial debiasing with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for fairness assurance. We provide formal mathematical formulations for each component and introduce an Assurance Layer that manages assumption failures through guardian architectures. Three case studies demonstrate IDAIF application across healthcare, cybersecurity, and software engineering domains. This framework represents a paradigm shift from model-centric to impact-centric AI development, providing engineers with concrete architectural patterns for building ethical, trustworthy, and socially beneficial AI systems.

*Antonio Terpin,Raffaello D'Andrea*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RL agent learns drag control in water channel using flow feedback; discovers high-performance strategies that work open-loop, showing learning needs richer info than execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study skill acquisition under controlled conditions without human subjects, using a physical system with complex dynamics that's difficult to simulate accurately.

Method: Interfaced RL agent with spinning cylinder in water channel to maximize/minimize drag; used high-dimensional flow feedback during training; compared performance with and without feedback.

Result: Agent discovered high-performance drag-control strategies with minutes of real-world interaction; learned policies worked open-loop without feedback; drag maximization required feedback during training while minimization succeeded without but slower.

Conclusion: Learning high-performance skills can require richer information than executing them; learning conditions can be kind or wicked depending on the goal, not on dynamics or policy complexity.

Abstract: Many high-performance human activities are executed with little or no external feedback: think of a figure skater landing a triple jump, a pitcher throwing a curveball for a strike, or a barista pouring latte art. To study the process of skill acquisition under fully controlled conditions, we bypass human subjects. Instead, we directly interface a generalist reinforcement learning agent with a spinning cylinder in a tabletop circulating water channel to maximize or minimize drag. This setup has several desirable properties. First, it is a physical system, with the rich interactions and complex dynamics that only the physical world has: the flow is highly chaotic and extremely difficult, if not impossible, to model or simulate accurately. Second, the objective -- drag minimization or maximization -- is easy to state and can be captured directly in the reward, yet good strategies are not obvious beforehand. Third, decades-old experimental studies provide recipes for simple, high-performance open-loop policies. Finally, the setup is inexpensive and far easier to reproduce than human studies. In our experiments we find that high-dimensional flow feedback lets the agent discover high-performance drag-control strategies with only minutes of real-world interaction. When we later replay the same action sequences without any feedback, we obtain almost identical performance. This shows that feedback, and in particular flow feedback, is not needed to execute the learned policy. Surprisingly, without flow feedback during training the agent fails to discover any well-performing policy in drag maximization, but still succeeds in drag minimization, albeit more slowly and less reliably. Our studies show that learning a high-performance skill can require richer information than executing it, and learning conditions can be kind or wicked depending solely on the goal, not on dynamics or policy complexity.

Result: Achieved 87.1% resolution rate on SWE-Verified benchmark, demonstrating superior performance over current approaches by directly addressing core limitations of AI code-assistant tools.

Conclusion: The data-centric paradigm shift using DTG provides a more robust foundation for scalable logic repair and zero-touch code maintenance, addressing critical needs in our increasingly software-dependent world.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models have revolutionized function-level code generation; however, repository-scale Automated Program Repair (APR) remains a significant challenge. Current approaches typically employ a control-centric paradigm, forcing agents to navigate complex directory structures and irrelevant control logic. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift from the standard Code Property Graphs (CPGs) to the concept of Data Transformation Graph (DTG) that inverts the topology by modeling data states as nodes and functions as edges, enabling agents to trace logic defects through data lineage rather than control flow. We introduce a multi-agent framework that reconciles data integrity navigation with control flow logic. Our theoretical analysis and case studies demonstrate that this approach resolves the "Semantic Trap" inherent in standard RAG systems in modern coding agents. We provide a comprehensive implementation in the form of Autonomous Issue Resolver (AIR), a self-improvement system for zero-touch code maintenance that utilizes neuro-symbolic reasoning and uses the DTG structure for scalable logic repair. Our approach has demonstrated good results on several SWE benchmarks, reaching a resolution rate of 87.1% on SWE-Verified benchmark. Our approach directly addresses the core limitations of current AI code-assistant tools and tackles the critical need for a more robust foundation for our increasingly software-dependent world.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional TL-based SOH monitoring consumes too many computational resources for portable mobile devices, reducing working endurance. Need lightweight approach for variable working conditions.

Method: Proposes CITL with semi-supervised TL mechanism using unlabeled target data, iteratively adding network nodes. Ensures cross-domain learning through structural risk minimization, transfer mismatching minimization, and manifold consistency maximization.

Result: CITL outperforms SS-TCA, MMD-LSTM-DA, DDAN, BO-CNN-TL, and AS³LSTM by 83.73%, 61.15%, 28.24%, 87.70%, and 57.34% respectively in RMSE on UAV battery dataset.

Conclusion: Lightweight CITL approach effectively enables SOH monitoring in portable devices with reduced computational resources while maintaining high accuracy through constructive incremental learning.

Abstract: Accurate and rapid state-of-health (SOH) monitoring plays an important role in indicating energy information for lithium-ion battery-powered portable mobile devices. To confront their variable working conditions, transfer learning (TL) emerges as a promising technique for leveraging knowledge from data-rich source working conditions, significantly reducing the training data required for SOH monitoring from target working conditions. However, traditional TL-based SOH monitoring is infeasible when applied in portable mobile devices since substantial computational resources are consumed during the TL stage and unexpectedly reduce the working endurance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight TL-based SOH monitoring approach with constructive incremental transfer learning (CITL). First, taking advantage of the unlabeled data in the target domain, a semi-supervised TL mechanism is proposed to minimize the monitoring residual in a constructive way, through iteratively adding network nodes in the CITL. Second, the cross-domain learning ability of node parameters for CITL is comprehensively guaranteed through structural risk minimization, transfer mismatching minimization, and manifold consistency maximization. Moreover, the convergence analysis of the CITL is given, theoretically guaranteeing the efficacy of TL performance and network compactness. Finally, the proposed approach is verified through extensive experiments with a realistic unmanned air vehicles (UAV) battery dataset collected from dozens of flight missions. Specifically, the CITL outperforms SS-TCA, MMD-LSTM-DA, DDAN, BO-CNN-TL, and AS$^3$LSTM, in SOH estimation by 83.73%, 61.15%, 28.24%, 87.70%, and 57.34%, respectively, as evaluated using the index root mean square error.

Abstract: Ethical awareness is critical for robots operating in human environments, yet existing automated planning tools provide little support. Manually specifying ethical rules is labour-intensive and highly context-specific. We present Principles2Plan, an interactive research prototype demonstrating how a human and a Large Language Model (LLM) can collaborate to produce context-sensitive ethical rules and guide automated planning. A domain expert provides the planning domain, problem details, and relevant high-level principles such as beneficence and privacy. The system generates operationalisable ethical rules consistent with these principles, which the user can review, prioritise, and supply to a planner to produce ethically-informed plans. To our knowledge, no prior system supports users in generating principle-grounded rules for classical planning contexts.

Result: Experimental results show CogMCTS outperforms existing LLM-based AHD methods in stability, efficiency, and solution quality.

Conclusion: The proposed CogMCTS framework effectively addresses limitations of existing LLM-based AHD methods by better balancing exploration-exploitation through cognitive-guided MCTS integration, achieving superior automated heuristic optimization performance.

Abstract: Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) is an effective1 framework for solving complex optimization prob-2 lems. The development of large language mod-3 els (LLMs) enables the automated generation of4 heuristics. Existing LLM-based evolutionary meth-5 ods rely on population strategies and are prone6 to local optima. Integrating LLMs with Monte7 Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) improves the trade-off8 between exploration and exploitation, but multi-9 round cognitive integration remains limited and10 search diversity is constrained. To overcome these11 limitations, this paper proposes a novel cognitive-12 guided MCTS framework (CogMCTS). CogMCTS13 tightly integrates the cognitive guidance mecha-14 nism of LLMs with MCTS to achieve efficient au-15 tomated heuristic optimization. The framework16 employs multi-round cognitive feedback to incor-17 porate historical experience, node information, and18 negative outcomes, dynamically improving heuris-19 tic generation. Dual-track node expansion com-20 bined with elite heuristic management balances the21 exploration of diverse heuristics and the exploita-22 tion of high-quality experience. In addition, strate-23 gic mutation modifies the heuristic forms and pa-24 rameters to further enhance the diversity of the so-25 lution and the overall optimization performance.26 The experimental results indicate that CogMCTS27 outperforms existing LLM-based AHD methods in28 stability, efficiency, and solution quality.

Conclusion: Agent-based collaboration provides scalable, interpretable, and clinically robust paradigm for automated oncology decision support by mimicking human MDT workflows.

Abstract: Multimodal clinical reasoning in the field of gastrointestinal (GI) oncology necessitates the integrated interpretation of endoscopic imagery, radiological data, and biochemical markers. Despite the evident potential exhibited by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), they frequently encounter challenges such as context dilution and hallucination when confronted with intricate, heterogeneous medical histories. In order to address these limitations, a hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework is proposed, which emulates the collaborative workflow of a human Multidisciplinary Team (MDT). The system attained a composite expert evaluation score of 4.60/5.00, thereby demonstrating a substantial improvement over the monolithic baseline. It is noteworthy that the agent-based architecture yielded the most substantial enhancements in reasoning logic and medical accuracy. The findings indicate that mimetic, agent-based collaboration provides a scalable, interpretable, and clinically robust paradigm for automated decision support in oncology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the fundamental divide between human experts' implicit intuition (cognitive black box) and AI's untrustworthy decision-making (computational black box), aiming to create a more transparent, auditable, and collaborative system.

Method: Uses a plug-and-play cognitive framework - computable knowledge packages extracted from expert dialogues, loaded into Recursive Adversarial Meta-Thinking Network (RAMTN) through structured meta-interaction protocols.

Result: Enables expert thinking (medical diagnosis, teaching intuition) to be converted into reusable, scalable public assets, shifting from "AI as a tool" to "AI as thinking partner" while providing engineering proof for cognitive equity.

Conclusion: Establishes a new AI governance paradigm through transparency of interaction protocols rather than model internals, promoting technology for good and cognitive inclusion via open-source framework.

Abstract: Currently, there exists a fundamental divide between the "cognitive black box" (implicit intuition) of human experts and the "computational black box" (untrustworthy decision-making) of artificial intelligence (AI). This paper proposes a new paradigm of "human-AI collaborative cognitive enhancement," aiming to transform the dual black boxes into a composable, auditable, and extensible "functional white-box" system through structured "meta-interaction." The core breakthrough lies in the "plug-and-play cognitive framework"--a computable knowledge package that can be extracted from expert dialogues and loaded into the Recursive Adversarial Meta-Thinking Network (RAMTN). This enables expert thinking, such as medical diagnostic logic and teaching intuition, to be converted into reusable and scalable public assets, realizing a paradigm shift from "AI as a tool" to "AI as a thinking partner." This work not only provides the first engineering proof for "cognitive equity" but also opens up a new path for AI governance: constructing a verifiable and intervenable governance paradigm through "transparency of interaction protocols" rather than prying into the internal mechanisms of models. The framework is open-sourced to promote technology for good and cognitive inclusion. This paper is an independent exploratory research conducted by the author. All content presented, including the theoretical framework (RAMTN), methodology (meta-interaction), system implementation, and case validation, constitutes the author's individual research achievements.

### [142] [Towards Foundation Models with Native Multi-Agent Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08743)
*Shuyue Hu,Haoyang Yan,Yiqun Zhang,Yang Chen,Dongzhan Zhou,Lei Bai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Current foundation models lack native multi-agent intelligence despite strong single-agent capabilities; research directions needed to develop FMs with built-in multi-agent understanding, planning, communication, and adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models are becoming AI agent "brains," but while recent work focuses on single-agent abilities (GUI interaction, tool use), the next frontier is native multi-agent intelligence. Current FMs don't automatically develop robust multi-agent capabilities from strong single-agent performance alone.

Method: Identified four core multi-agent capabilities: understanding, planning, efficient communication, and adaptation. Conducted extensive empirical evaluation across 41 large language models to test the assumption that single-agent performance translates to multi-agent intelligence.

Result: Empirical evidence shows strong single-agent performance does not automatically yield robust multi-agent intelligence. The gap exists despite FMs' advancement in single-agent contexts.

Conclusion: Need to develop FMs with native multi-agent intelligence through focused research directions including dataset construction, evaluation frameworks, training paradigms, and safety considerations for multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are increasingly assuming the role of the "brain" of AI agents. While recent efforts have begun to equip FMs with native single-agent abilities -- such as GUI interaction or integrated tool use -- we argue that the next frontier is endowing FMs with native multi-agent intelligence. We identify four core capabilities of FMs in multi-agent contexts: understanding, planning, efficient communication, and adaptation. Contrary to assumptions about the spontaneous emergence of such abilities, we provide extensive empirical evidence across 41 large language models showing that strong single-agent performance alone does not automatically yield robust multi-agent intelligence. To address this gap, we outline key research directions -- spanning dataset construction, evaluation, training paradigms, and safety considerations -- for building FMs with native multi-agent intelligence.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RIS and STAR-RIS on UAVs offer flexible deployment for 6G networks, but comprehensive performance comparison between aerial RIS and STAR-RIS architectures hasn't been thoroughly investigated.

Method: Established accurate channel models with directional radiation patterns, formulated joint optimization problems for both architectures, and proposed efficient solution using weighted minimum mean square error and block coordinate descent algorithms.

Result: STAR-RIS outperforms RIS in low-altitude scenarios due to full-space coverage capability, while RIS delivers better performance near the base station at higher altitudes.

Conclusion: Findings provide practical insights for deployment of aerial intelligent surfaces in future 6G communication systems, with STAR-RIS preferred at low altitudes and RIS at higher altitudes near base stations.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS) have emerged as key enablers for enhancing wireless coverage and capacity in next-generation networks. When mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), they benefit from flexible deployment and improved line-of-sight conditions. Despite their promising potential, a comprehensive performance comparison between aerial RIS and STAR-RIS architectures has not been thoroughly investigated. This letter presents a detailed performance comparison between aerial RIS and STAR-RIS in three-dimensional wireless environments. Accurate channel models incorporating directional radiation patterns are established, and the influence of deployment altitude and orientation is thoroughly examined. To optimize the system sum-rate, we formulate joint optimization problems for both architectures and propose an efficient solution based on the weighted minimum mean square error and block coordinate descent algorithms. Simulation results reveal that STAR-RIS outperforms RIS in low-altitude scenarios due to its full-space coverage capability, whereas RIS delivers better performance near the base station at higher altitudes. The findings provide practical insights for the deployment of aerial intelligent surfaces in future 6G communication systems.

Motivation: As agentic AI adoption accelerates, organizations need practical guidance to build reliable, observable, maintainable, and safe production-grade agentic workflows that integrate multiple specialized agents, tools, and external systems.

Method: Introduces structured engineering lifecycle covering workflow decomposition, multi-agent design patterns, Model Context Protocol (MCP), tool integration, deterministic orchestration, Responsible-AI considerations, and deployment strategies. Presents nine core best practices including tool-first design, pure-function invocation, single-responsibility agents, externalized prompt management, and containerized deployment.

Result: Provides comprehensive case study of a multimodal news-analysis and media-generation workflow demonstrating the principles in practice, offering architectural guidance and operational patterns.

Conclusion: The paper offers foundational reference for building robust, extensible, and production-ready agentic AI workflows by combining architectural guidance, operational patterns, and practical implementation insights.

Abstract: Agentic AI marks a major shift in how autonomous systems reason, plan, and execute multi-step tasks. Unlike traditional single model prompting, agentic workflows integrate multiple specialized agents with different Large Language Models(LLMs), tool-augmented capabilities, orchestration logic, and external system interactions to form dynamic pipelines capable of autonomous decision-making and action. As adoption accelerates across industry and research, organizations face a central challenge: how to design, engineer, and operate production-grade agentic AI workflows that are reliable, observable, maintainable, and aligned with safety and governance requirements. This paper provides a practical, end-to-end guide for designing, developing, and deploying production-quality agentic AI systems. We introduce a structured engineering lifecycle encompassing workflow decomposition, multi-agent design patterns, Model Context Protocol(MCP), and tool integration, deterministic orchestration, Responsible-AI considerations, and environment-aware deployment strategies. We then present nine core best practices for engineering production-grade agentic AI workflows, including tool-first design over MCP, pure-function invocation, single-tool and single-responsibility agents, externalized prompt management, Responsible-AI-aligned model-consortium design, clean separation between workflow logic and MCP servers, containerized deployment for scalable operations, and adherence to the Keep it Simple, Stupid (KISS) principle to maintain simplicity and robustness. To demonstrate these principles in practice, we present a comprehensive case study: a multimodal news-analysis and media-generation workflow. By combining architectural guidance, operational patterns, and practical implementation insights, this paper offers a foundational reference to build robust, extensible, and production-ready agentic AI workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of LoRAs has created an unstructured ecosystem where discovery methods rely on unreliable user descriptions or biased popularity metrics, hindering usability.

Method: Analyze 650+ LoRAs by generating images with various prompts/seeds, using CLIP embeddings and differences from base-model generations to define three-part representation: Directions (semantic shift), Strength (effect significance), and Consistency (effect stability).

Result: Developed efficient retrieval framework that semantically matches textual queries to relevant LoRAs while filtering overly strong/unstable ones, outperforming textual baselines in automated and human evaluations.

Conclusion: CARLoS provides practical LoRA characterization and retrieval, with broader relevance for copyright analysis through linking Strength/Consistency to legal notions of substantiality and volition.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of generative components, such as LoRAs, has created a vast but unstructured ecosystem. Existing discovery methods depend on unreliable user descriptions or biased popularity metrics, hindering usability. We present CARLoS, a large-scale framework for characterizing LoRAs without requiring additional metadata. Analyzing over 650 LoRAs, we employ them in image generation over a variety of prompts and seeds, as a credible way to assess their behavior. Using CLIP embeddings and their difference to a base-model generation, we concisely define a three-part representation: Directions, defining semantic shift; Strength, quantifying the significance of the effect; and Consistency, quantifying how stable the effect is. Using these representations, we develop an efficient retrieval framework that semantically matches textual queries to relevant LoRAs while filtering overly strong or unstable ones, outperforming textual baselines in automated and human evaluations. While retrieval is our primary focus, the same representation also supports analyses linking Strength and Consistency to legal notions of substantiality and volition, key considerations in copyright, positioning CARLoS as a practical system with broader relevance for LoRA analysis.

Conclusion: EcomBench addresses the need for practical evaluation benchmarks by grounding assessment in real e-commerce environments, offering a dynamic framework to measure agent performance on tasks that matter in real-world applications.

Abstract: Foundation agents have rapidly advanced in their ability to reason and interact with real environments, making the evaluation of their core capabilities increasingly important. While many benchmarks have been developed to assess agent performance, most concentrate on academic settings or artificially designed scenarios while overlooking the challenges that arise in real applications. To address this issue, we focus on a highly practical real-world setting, the e-commerce domain, which involves a large volume of diverse user interactions, dynamic market conditions, and tasks directly tied to real decision-making processes. To this end, we introduce EcomBench, a holistic E-commerce Benchmark designed to evaluate agent performance in realistic e-commerce environments. EcomBench is built from genuine user demands embedded in leading global e-commerce ecosystems and is carefully curated and annotated through human experts to ensure clarity, accuracy, and domain relevance. It covers multiple task categories within e-commerce scenarios and defines three difficulty levels that evaluate agents on key capabilities such as deep information retrieval, multi-step reasoning, and cross-source knowledge integration. By grounding evaluation in real e-commerce contexts, EcomBench provides a rigorous and dynamic testbed for measuring the practical capabilities of agents in modern e-commerce.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REST and REST+ benchmarks evaluate cross-modal inconsistency in MLLMs by testing reasoning consistency across image, text, and mixed modalities with identical semantic content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs are trained to represent vision and language in the same embedding space but cannot perform the same tasks consistently across different modalities, revealing a fundamental limitation in their cross-modal understanding.

Method: Created REST and REST+ benchmarks containing samples with identical semantic information in three modalities (image, text, mixed). Evaluated 15 state-of-the-art MLLMs on cross-modal consistency, controlling for OCR issues and testing effects of visual characteristics (color, resolution, font) and vision token count.

Result: MLLMs show significant cross-modal inconsistency even when OCR is correct. Visual characteristics (text color and resolution) and number of vision tokens impact performance. Consistency scores correlate with modality gap between text and images, providing mechanistic interpretation of inconsistency.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs fail to achieve consistent reasoning across modalities despite being trained on joint embedding spaces. Neither rendering text as images nor images as text solves the inconsistency, highlighting a fundamental challenge in multimodal AI that requires new approaches beyond current architectures.

Abstract: We introduce two new benchmarks REST and REST+(Render-Equivalence Stress Tests) to enable systematic evaluation of cross-modal inconsistency in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). MLLMs are trained to represent vision and language in the same embedding space, yet they cannot perform the same tasks in both modalities. Our benchmarks contain samples with the same semantic information in three modalities (image, text, mixed) and we show that state-of-the-art MLLMs cannot consistently reason over these different modalities. We evaluate 15 MLLMs and find that the degree of modality inconsistency varies substantially, even when accounting for problems with text recognition (OCR). Neither rendering text as image nor rendering an image as text solves the inconsistency. Even if OCR is correct, we find that visual characteristics (text colour and resolution, but not font) and the number of vision tokens have an impact on model performance. Finally, we find that our consistency score correlates with the modality gap between text and images, highlighting a mechanistic interpretation of cross-modal inconsistent MLLMs.

*Alan Papalia,Nikolas Sanderson,Haoyu Han,Heng Yang,Hanumant Singh,Michael Everett*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VarPro method for robotic perception that exploits separability and handles gauge symmetries, achieving 2-35× speedup over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic perception involves solving large nonlinear least-squares problems. While sparsity is well-exploited, separability (where some variables appear linearly) is underexploited. Variable projection methods can exploit this but face challenges with gauge symmetries common in perception problems.

Method: Developed a VarPro scheme for problems with gauge symmetries that jointly exploits separability and sparsity. Creates a matrix-free Schur complement operator as a one-time preprocessing step, enabling efficient evaluation of costs, gradients, and Hessian-vector products for the reduced problem.

Result: Achieved 2× to 35× faster runtimes than state-of-the-art methods across synthetic and real benchmarks in SLAM, SNL, and SfM while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed VarPro method effectively handles gauge symmetries in perception problems, significantly accelerates optimization through joint exploitation of separability and sparsity, and provides practical implementation with open-source code and datasets.

Abstract: Robotic perception often requires solving large nonlinear least-squares (NLS) problems. While sparsity has been well-exploited to scale solvers, a complementary and underexploited structure is \emph{separability} -- where some variables (e.g., visual landmarks) appear linearly in the residuals and, for any estimate of the remaining variables (e.g., poses), have a closed-form solution. Variable projection (VarPro) methods are a family of techniques that exploit this structure by analytically eliminating the linear variables and presenting a reduced problem in the remaining variables that has favorable properties. However, VarPro has seen limited use in robotic perception; a major challenge arises from gauge symmetries (e.g., cost invariance to global shifts and rotations), which are common in perception and induce specific computational challenges in standard VarPro approaches. We present a VarPro scheme designed for problems with gauge symmetries that jointly exploits separability and sparsity. Our method can be applied as a one-time preprocessing step to construct a \emph{matrix-free Schur complement operator}. This operator allows efficient evaluation of costs, gradients, and Hessian-vector products of the reduced problem and readily integrates with standard iterative NLS solvers. We provide precise conditions under which our method applies, and describe extensions when these conditions are only partially met. Across synthetic and real benchmarks in SLAM, SNL, and SfM, our approach achieves up to \textbf{2$\times$--35$\times$ faster runtimes} than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining accuracy. We release an open-source C++ implementation and all datasets from our experiments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VLD learning decouples perception from policy learning for robotic navigation, using self-supervised distance prediction on internet-scale video data and RL training in simulation with noise injection to bridge sim-to-real gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing end-to-end navigation policies suffer from sim-to-real gap and limited labeled training data. Need scalable approach that can leverage large-scale visual data while maintaining robust low-level navigation behaviors.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Train self-supervised distance-to-goal predictor on internet-scale video data (generalizes to image/text goals), 2) Train RL policy in simulation using privileged geometric distances with noise injection to mimic distance predictor uncertainty. At deployment, policy uses VLD predictions.

Result: VLD outperforms prior temporal distance approaches (ViNT, VIP). Achieves competitive navigation performance in simulation while supporting flexible goal modalities (image/text). Provides scalable path to reliable multimodal navigation.

Conclusion: Decoupling perception from policy learning enables scalable navigation by leveraging internet-scale visual data for semantic understanding while maintaining robust low-level behaviors learned in simulation, addressing sim-to-real gap and data limitations.

Abstract: Training end-to-end policies from image data to directly predict navigation actions for robotic systems has proven inherently difficult. Existing approaches often suffer from either the sim-to-real gap during policy transfer or a limited amount of training data with action labels. To address this problem, we introduce Vision-Language Distance (VLD) learning, a scalable framework for goal-conditioned navigation that decouples perception learning from policy learning. Instead of relying on raw sensory inputs during policy training, we first train a self-supervised distance-to-goal predictor on internet-scale video data. This predictor generalizes across both image- and text-based goals, providing a distance signal that can be minimized by a reinforcement learning (RL) policy. The RL policy can be trained entirely in simulation using privileged geometric distance signals, with injected noise to mimic the uncertainty of the trained distance predictor. At deployment, the policy consumes VLD predictions, inheriting semantic goal information-"where to go"-from large-scale visual training while retaining the robust low-level navigation behaviors learned in simulation. We propose using ordinal consistency to assess distance functions directly and demonstrate that VLD outperforms prior temporal distance approaches, such as ViNT and VIP. Experiments show that our decoupled design achieves competitive navigation performance in simulation while supporting flexible goal modalities, providing an alternative and, most importantly, scalable path toward reliable, multimodal navigation policies.

DIJIT's design features nine mechanical degrees of freedom, while the cameras and lenses provide an additional four optical degrees of freedom. The ranges and speeds of the mechanical design are comparable to human performance. Our design includes the ranges of motion required for convergent stereo, namely, vergence, version, and cyclotorsion. The exploration of the utility of these to both human and machine vision is ongoing. Here, we present the design of DIJIT and evaluate aspects of its performance. We present a new method for saccadic camera movements. In this method, a direct relationship between camera orientation and motor values is developed. The resulting saccadic camera movements are close to human movements in terms of their accuracy.

TL;DR: A dual-agent LLM framework improves Human-UAV Interaction by separating task planning and execution agents, enabling more personalized and flexible UAV control in complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Human-UAV Interaction systems are engineer-driven with predefined designs, lacking personalization and flexibility. While LLMs offer potential for natural language understanding, existing frameworks struggle with mixed task planning and execution in complex scenarios.

Method: Proposes a dual-agent HUI framework with two independent LLM agents: a task planning agent and an execution agent, using different Prompt Engineering techniques to separately handle task understanding, planning, and execution.

Result: The framework improves HUI smoothness and task execution flexibility across four typical UAV application scenarios, effectively meeting users' personalized needs as demonstrated through user studies and performance metrics.

Conclusion: The dual-agent LLM framework successfully addresses limitations of existing HUI systems by enabling more personalized, flexible, and smooth Human-UAV Interaction through separated planning and execution agents.

Abstract: The future of UAV interaction systems is evolving from engineer-driven to user-driven, aiming to replace traditional predefined Human-UAV Interaction designs. This shift focuses on enabling more personalized task planning and design, thereby achieving a higher quality of interaction experience and greater flexibility, which can be used in many fileds, such as agriculture, aerial photography, logistics, and environmental monitoring. However, due to the lack of a common language between users and the UAVs, such interactions are often difficult to be achieved. The developments of Large Language Models possess the ability to understand nature languages and Robots' (UAVs') behaviors, marking the possibility of personalized Human-UAV Interaction. Recently, some HUI frameworks based on LLMs have been proposed, but they commonly suffer from difficulties in mixed task planning and execution, leading to low adaptability in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-agent HUI framework. This framework constructs two independent LLM agents (a task planning agent, and an execution agent) and applies different Prompt Engineering to separately handle the understanding, planning, and execution of tasks. To verify the effectiveness and performance of the framework, we have built a task database covering four typical application scenarios of UAVs and quantified the performance of the HUI framework using three independent metrics. Meanwhile different LLM models are selected to control the UAVs with compared performance. Our user study experimental results demonstrate that the framework improves the smoothness of HUI and the flexibility of task execution in the tasks scenario we set up, effectively meeting users' personalized needs.

Method: Uses Gluestick pipeline for 2D-3D point/line feature correspondences, analyzes feature distribution impact, adaptively weights features based on quality metrics, and filters inferior features to optimize extrinsic parameters.

Result: Superior robustness and accuracy compared to state-of-the-art techniques across various LiDAR-camera sensors in both indoor and outdoor environments.

Conclusion: The method provides an effective targetless calibration solution with open-source code available, offering improved performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a user-friendly LiDAR-camera calibration toolkit that is compatible with various LiDAR and camera sensors and requires only a single pair of laser points and a camera image in targetless environments. Our approach eliminates the need for an initial transform and remains robust even with large positional and rotational LiDAR-camera extrinsic parameters. We employ the Gluestick pipeline to establish 2D-3D point and line feature correspondences for a robust and automatic initial guess. To enhance accuracy, we quantitatively analyze the impact of feature distribution on calibration results and adaptively weight the cost of each feature based on these metrics. As a result, extrinsic parameters are optimized by filtering out the adverse effects of inferior features. We validated our method through extensive experiments across various LiDAR-camera sensors in both indoor and outdoor settings. The results demonstrate that our method provides superior robustness and accuracy compared to SOTA techniques. Our code is open-sourced on GitHub to benefit the community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLN methods rely on end-to-end pipelines that produce fragmented motions, have high latency, and struggle with dynamic obstacle avoidance. There's a need for a system that can handle real-world challenges while maintaining generalization.

Method: DualVLN integrates two systems: System 2 (VLM-based global planner) performs "slow" image-grounded reasoning to predict mid-term waypoint goals, while System 1 (lightweight Diffusion Transformer policy) performs "fast" trajectory generation using both explicit pixel goals and latent features from System 2.

Result: DualVLN outperforms prior methods across all VLN benchmarks and demonstrates robust long-horizon planning and real-time adaptability in dynamic environments through real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The dual-system design enables robust real-time control and adaptive local decision-making in complex, dynamic environments by decoupling training - the VLM retains generalization while System 1 achieves interpretable and effective local navigation.

Abstract: While recent large vision-language models (VLMs) have improved generalization in vision-language navigation (VLN), existing methods typically rely on end-to-end pipelines that map vision-language inputs directly to short-horizon discrete actions. Such designs often produce fragmented motions, incur high latency, and struggle with real-world challenges like dynamic obstacle avoidance. We propose DualVLN, the first dual-system VLN foundation model that synergistically integrates high-level reasoning with low-level action execution. System 2, a VLM-based global planner, "grounds slowly" by predicting mid-term waypoint goals via image-grounded reasoning. System 1, a lightweight, multi-modal conditioning Diffusion Transformer policy, "moves fast" by leveraging both explicit pixel goals and latent features from System 2 to generate smooth and accurate trajectories. The dual-system design enables robust real-time control and adaptive local decision-making in complex, dynamic environments. By decoupling training, the VLM retains its generalization, while System 1 achieves interpretable and effective local navigation. DualVLN outperforms prior methods across all VLN benchmarks and real-world experiments demonstrate robust long-horizon planning and real-time adaptability in dynamic environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-generation world models lack physical grounding, leading to hallucinations and failure to maintain long-horizon physical constraints in robot manipulation planning.

Method: Embodied Tree of Thoughts (EToT) uses physics-based interactive digital twins as embodied world models, with tree search expanded through Priori Branching (generating diverse candidate paths) and Reflective Branching (using VLMs to diagnose failures and refine plans).

Result: EToT consistently outperforms baselines on short- and long-horizon manipulation tasks by effectively predicting physical dynamics and adapting to potential failures.

Conclusion: Grounding high-level reasoning in physics simulators ensures generated plans adhere to rigid-body dynamics and collision constraints, addressing limitations of traditional video-generation world models.

Abstract: World models have emerged as a pivotal component in robot manipulation planning, enabling agents to predict future environmental states and reason about the consequences of actions before execution. While video-generation models are increasingly adopted, they often lack rigorous physical grounding, leading to hallucinations and a failure to maintain consistency in long-horizon physical constraints. To address these limitations, we propose Embodied Tree of Thoughts (EToT), a novel Real2Sim2Real planning framework that leverages a physics-based interactive digital twin as an embodied world model. EToT formulates manipulation planning as a tree search expanded through two synergistic mechanisms: (1) Priori Branching, which generates diverse candidate execution paths based on semantic and spatial analysis; and (2) Reflective Branching, which utilizes VLMs to diagnose execution failures within the simulator and iteratively refine the planning tree with corrective actions. By grounding high-level reasoning in a physics simulator, our framework ensures that generated plans adhere to rigid-body dynamics and collision constraints. We validate EToT on a suite of short- and long-horizon manipulation tasks, where it consistently outperforms baselines by effectively predicting physical dynamics and adapting to potential failures.

TL;DR: SDAR is a dual-arm TAMP framework for complex tabletop rearrangement tasks where objects are strongly entangled, achieving 100% success rate with superior solution quality over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of dual-arm tabletop rearrangement where objects' start and goal configurations are strongly entangled, requiring close coordination between arms in constrained workspaces.

Method: Combines dependency-driven task planner (SDAR-T) that decomposes object dependency graphs for optimal dual-arm plans, with synchronous dual-arm motion planner (SDAR-M) using GPU SIMD-based layered planning to evaluate many task plans.

Result: Achieves 100% success rate on complex non-monotone long-horizon tasks with solution quality far exceeding state-of-the-art, and successfully transfers to real UR-5e robot hardware.

Conclusion: SDAR provides an effective TAMP framework for complex dual-arm rearrangement through tight integration of task and motion planning, enabling reliable real-world deployment.

Abstract: We propose Synchronous Dual-Arm Rearrangement Planner (SDAR), a task and motion planning (TAMP) framework for tabletop rearrangement, where two robot arms equipped with 2-finger grippers must work together in close proximity to rearrange objects whose start and goal configurations are strongly entangled. To tackle such challenges, SDAR tightly knit together its dependency-driven task planner (SDAR-T) and synchronous dual-arm motion planner (SDAR-M), to intelligently sift through a large number of possible task and motion plans. Specifically, SDAR-T applies a simple yet effective strategy to decompose the global object dependency graph induced by the rearrangement task, to produce more optimal dual-arm task plans than solutions derived from optimal task plans for a single arm. Leveraging state-of-the-art GPU SIMD-based motion planning tools, SDAR-M employs a layered motion planning strategy to sift through many task plans for the best synchronous dual-arm motion plan while ensuring high levels of success rate. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that SDAR delivers a 100% success rate in solving complex, non-monotone, long-horizon tabletop rearrangement tasks with solution quality far exceeding the previous state-of-the-art. Experiments on two UR-5e arms further confirm SDAR directly and reliably transfers to robot hardware.

*Timothy Chen,Marcus Dominguez-Kuhne,Aiden Swann,Xu Liu,Mac Schwager*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A Bayesian framework for learning human-like risk perception from videos using VLM priors and learned likelihoods to produce pixel-dense risk maps for robot planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans perceive safety as continuous, context-dependent risk rather than binary signals. Current autonomous systems lack this nuanced understanding, limiting their ability to navigate dynamic environments in human-like ways.

Method: Bayesian framework with VLM priors and learned ViT likelihoods that maps RGB images + object queries to pixel-dense risk images. Trained on safe human demonstration videos and VLM common sense.

Result: Produces contextual risk maps that align with human preferences, generalizes to novel objects/contexts, and enables downstream applications in robot planning and trajectory optimization.

Conclusion: The framework enables autonomous systems to internalize human-like risk perception, with potential for scaling to larger datasets and fast adaptation through Bayesian formulation.

Abstract: Humans interpret safety not as a binary signal but as a continuous, context- and spatially-dependent notion of risk. While risk is subjective, humans form rational mental models that guide action selection in dynamic environments. This work proposes a framework for extracting implicit human risk models by introducing a novel, semantically-conditioned and spatially-varying parametrization of risk, supervised directly from safe human demonstration videos and VLM common sense. Notably, we define risk through a Bayesian formulation. The prior is furnished by a pretrained vision-language model. In order to encourage the risk estimate to be more human aligned, a likelihood function modulates the prior to produce a relative metric of risk. Specifically, the likelihood is a learned ViT that maps pretrained features, to pixel-aligned risk values. Our pipeline ingests RGB images and a query object string, producing pixel-dense risk images. These images that can then be used as value-predictors in robot planning tasks or be projected into 3D for use in conventional trajectory optimization to produce human-like motion. This learned mapping enables generalization to novel objects and contexts, and has the potential to scale to much larger training datasets. In particular, the Bayesian framework that is introduced enables fast adaptation of our model to additional observations or common sense rules. We demonstrate that our proposed framework produces contextual risk that aligns with human preferences. Additionally, we illustrate several downstream applications of the model; as a value learner for visuomotor planners or in conjunction with a classical trajectory optimization algorithm. Our results suggest that our framework is a significant step toward enabling autonomous systems to internalize human-like risk.

Result: Framework validated through case studies with mobile robot and aerial vehicle navigating cluttered environments, demonstrating effectiveness and scalability

Conclusion: Proposed STT-PINN framework successfully enables control of unknown nonlinear systems to satisfy prescribed time reach-avoid-stay tasks with formal verification guarantees

Abstract: This paper presents a Spatiotemporal Tube (STT)-based control framework for general control-affine MIMO nonlinear pure-feedback systems with unknown dynamics to satisfy prescribed time reach-avoid-stay tasks under external disturbances. The STT is defined as a time-varying ball, whose center and radius are jointly approximated by a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN). The constraints governing the STT are first formulated as loss functions of the PINN, and a training algorithm is proposed to minimize the overall violation. The PINN being trained on certain collocation points, we propose a Lipschitz-based validity condition to formally verify that the learned PINN satisfies the conditions over the continuous time horizon. Building on the learned STT representation, an approximation-free closed-form controller is defined to guarantee satisfaction of the T-RAS specification. Finally, the effectiveness and scalability of the framework are validated through two case studies involving a mobile robot and an aerial vehicle navigating through cluttered environments.

TL;DR: MPDiffuser is a compositional diffusion framework for offline decision-making that combines planning, dynamics modeling, and ranking to generate feasible, task-aligned trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative approaches for offline decision-making often produce dynamically infeasible trajectories, requiring a method that can synthesize reliable behaviors from fixed datasets without interaction.

Method: A three-component framework: (1) planner generates diverse task-aligned trajectories, (2) dynamics model enforces system dynamics consistency, (3) ranker selects behaviors aligned with task objectives. Uses alternating diffusion sampling where planner and dynamics updates interleave to refine trajectories.

Result: Demonstrates consistent gains over existing approaches on D4RL and DSRL benchmarks, shows improved sample efficiency, adapts to novel dynamics, scales to vision-based control, and works on real quadrupedal robot.

Conclusion: MPDiffuser provides a practical compositional approach for offline decision-making that balances data priors with dynamics consistency, enabling reliable behavior synthesis from fixed datasets with real-world applicability.

Abstract: Offline decision-making requires synthesizing reliable behaviors from fixed datasets without further interaction, yet existing generative approaches often yield trajectories that are dynamically infeasible. We propose Model Predictive Diffuser (MPDiffuser), a compositional model-based diffusion framework consisting of: (i) a planner that generates diverse, task-aligned trajectories; (ii) a dynamics model that enforces consistency with the underlying system dynamics; and (iii) a ranker module that selects behaviors aligned with the task objectives. MPDiffuser employs an alternating diffusion sampling scheme, where planner and dynamics updates are interleaved to progressively refine trajectories for both task alignment and feasibility during the sampling process. We also provide a theoretical rationale for this procedure, showing how it balances fidelity to data priors with dynamics consistency. Empirically, the compositional design improves sample efficiency, as it leverages even low-quality data for dynamics learning and adapts seamlessly to novel dynamics. We evaluate MPDiffuser on both unconstrained (D4RL) and constrained (DSRL) offline decision-making benchmarks, demonstrating consistent gains over existing approaches. Furthermore, we present a preliminary study extending MPDiffuser to vision-based control tasks, showing its potential to scale to high-dimensional sensory inputs. Finally, we deploy our method on a real quadrupedal robot, showcasing its practicality for real-world control.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Weight interpolation between pretrained and finetuned models preserves generalist abilities while learning new tasks robustly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalist robot policies overfit to new task demonstrations, losing both prior general abilities and failing to generalize within the new task itself.

Method: Simple weight interpolation strategy: merge weights of finetuned model with pretrained model through model merging.

Result: Model merging produces single model that inherits generalist abilities and learns new tasks robustly, outperforming both pretrained and finetuned models on out-of-distribution variations.

Conclusion: Weight interpolation enables continual skill acquisition in lifelong learning without sacrificing previously learned generalist abilities.

Abstract: Generalist robot policies, trained on large and diverse datasets, have demonstrated the ability to generalize across a wide spectrum of behaviors, enabling a single policy to act in varied real-world environments. However, they still fall short on new tasks not covered in the training data. When finetuned on limited demonstrations of a new task, these policies often overfit to the specific demonstrations--not only losing their prior abilities to solve a wide variety of generalist tasks but also failing to generalize within the new task itself. In this work, we aim to develop a method that preserves the generalization capabilities of the generalist policy during finetuning, allowing a single policy to robustly incorporate a new skill into its repertoire. Our goal is a single policy that both learns to generalize to variations of the new task and retains the broad competencies gained from pretraining. We show that this can be achieved through a simple yet effective strategy: interpolating the weights of a finetuned model with that of the pretrained model. We show, across extensive simulated and real-world experiments, that such model merging produces a single model that inherits the generalist abilities of the base model and learns to solve the new task robustly, outperforming both the pretrained and finetuned model on out-of-distribution variations of the new task. Moreover, we show that model merging enables continual acquisition of new skills in a lifelong learning setting, without sacrificing previously learned generalist abilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many robotic tasks require multimodal reasoning where visual information alone is ambiguous or incomplete (e.g., filling a bottle with water requires reasoning about audio changes). Current methods lack effective future audio prediction capabilities needed for tasks involving in-the-wild audio or music signals.

Method: Develops a generative latent flow matching model that anticipates future audio observations. This model enables reasoning about long-term consequences when integrated into robot policies for manipulation tasks requiring audio perception.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance on two manipulation tasks requiring perception of in-the-wild audio or music signals, outperforming methods without future lookahead capabilities.

Conclusion: Successful robot action learning for audio-involved tasks depends not just on multimodal input, but critically on accurate prediction of future audio states that capture intrinsic rhythmic patterns. The proposed generative latent flow matching model effectively addresses this need.

Abstract: World models have demonstrated impressive performance on robotic learning tasks. Many such tasks inherently demand multimodal reasoning; for example, filling a bottle with water will lead to visual information alone being ambiguous or incomplete, thereby requiring reasoning over the temporal evolution of audio, accounting for its underlying physical properties and pitch patterns. In this paper, we propose a generative latent flow matching model to anticipate future audio observations, enabling the system to reason about long-term consequences when integrated into a robot policy. We demonstrate the superior capabilities of our system through two manipulation tasks that require perceiving in-the-wild audio or music signals, compared to methods without future lookahead. We further emphasize that successful robot action learning for these tasks relies not merely on multi-modal input, but critically on the accurate prediction of future audio states that embody intrinsic rhythmic patterns.

Method: Multi-agent LLM framework integrates multi-modal reasoning with 3D simulation and profiling tools, using specialized agents for user input interpretation, design point generation, execution orchestration, and analysis of visual/textual outputs.

Result: Outperforms genetic algorithm baseline by identifying more Pareto-optimal, cost-efficient solutions with reduced navigation time under same exploration budget in robotaxi case study.

Conclusion: The LLM-based framework enables automated interpretation of execution outputs and efficient DSE, paving the way for design automation of autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Designing autonomous driving systems requires efficient exploration of large hardware/software configuration spaces under diverse environmental conditions, e.g., with varying traffic, weather, and road layouts. Traditional design space exploration (DSE) approaches struggle with multi-modal execution outputs and complex performance trade-offs, and often require human involvement to assess correctness based on execution outputs. This paper presents a multi-agent, large language model (LLM)-based DSE framework, which integrates multi-modal reasoning with 3D simulation and profiling tools to automate the interpretation of execution outputs and guide the exploration of system designs. Specialized LLM agents are leveraged to handle user input interpretation, design point generation, execution orchestration, and analysis of both visual and textual execution outputs, which enables identification of potential bottlenecks without human intervention. A prototype implementation is developed and evaluated on a robotaxi case study (an SAE Level 4 autonomous driving application). Compared with a genetic algorithm baseline, the proposed framework identifies more Pareto-optimal, cost-efficient solutions with reduced navigation time under the same exploration budget. Experimental results also demonstrate the efficiency of the adoption of the LLM-based approach for DSE. We believe that this framework paves the way to the design automation of autonomous driving systems.

*Yixiang Lin,Tiancheng Yang,Jonathan Eden,Ying Tan*

TL;DR: Human decision-making in physical human-robot interaction shows individualized responses to uncertainty, with two distinct behavioral clusters emerging: one group adjusts to probability while another shows consistent risk aversion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pHRI control frameworks assume optimal human behavior, but humans often deviate from optimal patterns under uncertainty involving trust, comfort, and safety. Better understanding of human responses to uncertainty is needed for safer pHRI design.

Method: Pilot study using physically coupled target-reaching task where robot delivered assistance or disturbances with systematically varied probabilities (10-90%). Analyzed participants' force inputs and decision-making strategies.

Result: Two distinct behavioral clusters identified: "trade-off" group modulated physical responses according to disturbance likelihood, while "always-compensate" group showed strong risk aversion irrespective of probability. Human decision-making is highly individualized with perception of probability differing from true value.

Conclusion: Need for more interpretable behavioral models like cumulative prospect theory to accurately capture individualized human behaviors and inform design of adaptive robot controllers for pHRI.

Abstract: Understanding how humans respond to uncertainty is critical for designing safe and effective physical human-robot interaction (pHRI), as physically working with robots introduces multiple sources of uncertainty, including trust, comfort, and perceived safety. Conventional pHRI control frameworks typically build on optimal control theory, which assumes that human actions minimize a cost function; however, human behavior under uncertainty often departs from such optimal patterns. To address this gap, additional understanding of human behavior under uncertainty is needed. This pilot study implemented a physically coupled target-reaching task in which the robot delivered assistance or disturbances with systematically varied probabilities (10\% to 90\%). Analysis of participants' force inputs and decision-making strategies revealed two distinct behavioral clusters: a "trade-off" group that modulated their physical responses according to disturbance likelihood, and an "always-compensate" group characterized by strong risk aversion irrespective of probability. These findings provide empirical evidence that human decision-making in pHRI is highly individualized and that the perception of probability can differ to its true value. Accordingly, the study highlights the need for more interpretable behavioral models, such as cumulative prospect theory (CPT), to more accurately capture these behaviors and inform the design of future adaptive robot controllers.

TL;DR: Decision Tree classifier outperforms Transformers for estimating human comfort with robots using eye-tracking, with pupil diameter as key predictor, revealing different physiological thresholds than human-human interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social robots need to adapt to human proxemic norms for user comfort, but existing eye-tracking comfort estimation methods from human-human interactions haven't been tested with humanoid robots.

Method: Studied user comfort with Ameca robot across four distances (0.5-2.0m) using mobile eye-tracking and subjective reports (N=19), evaluating multiple ML/DL models on gaze features.

Result: Decision Tree classifier achieved highest performance (F1=0.73), outperforming Transformers; minimum pupil diameter was most critical predictor, contrary to human-human interaction findings.

Conclusion: Human-robot interaction comfort thresholds differ from human-human dynamics and can be effectively modeled using interpretable logic rather than complex deep learning approaches.

Abstract: Social robots must adjust to human proxemic norms to ensure user comfort and engagement. While prior research demonstrates that eye-tracking features reliably estimate comfort in human-human interactions, their applicability to interactions with humanoid robots remains unexplored. In this study, we investigate user comfort with the robot "Ameca" across four experimentally controlled distances (0.5 m to 2.0 m) using mobile eye-tracking and subjective reporting (N=19). We evaluate multiple machine learning and deep learning models to estimate comfort based on gaze features. Contrary to previous human-human studies where Transformer models excelled, a Decision Tree classifier achieved the highest performance (F1-score = 0.73), with minimum pupil diameter identified as the most critical predictor. These findings suggest that physiological comfort thresholds in human-robot interaction differ from human-human dynamics and can be effectively modeled using interpretable logic.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CARLA simulator lacks capability for real-time simulation of complete automated driving vehicles with their full sensor and actuation stacks, limiting its use for Hardware-in-the-Loop testing in the development workflow.

Method: Derived requirements, specified and implemented a simulation architecture, created vEDGAR framework with modified CARLA fork to enable real-time HiL testing.

Result: Developed open-source vEDGAR framework that enables CARLA to be used for Hardware-in-the-Loop testing, making it a consistent evaluation tool throughout the entire automated driving development process.

Conclusion: vEDGAR successfully extends CARLA's applicability to HiL testing, benefiting open-source development workflow by providing a consistent evaluation tool across the entire automated driving development lifecycle.

Abstract: Simulation offers advantages throughout the development process of automated driving functions, both in research and product development. Common open-source simulators like CARLA are extensively used in training, evaluation, and software-in-the-loop testing of new automated driving algorithms. However, the CARLA simulator lacks an evaluation where research and automated driving vehicles are simulated with their entire sensor and actuation stack in real time. The goal of this work is therefore to create a simulation framework for testing the automation software on its dedicated hardware and identifying its limits. Achieving this goal would greatly benefit the open-source development workflow of automated driving functions, designating CARLA as a consistent evaluation tool along the entire development process. To achieve this goal, in a first step, requirements are derived, and a simulation architecture is specified and implemented. Based on the formulated requirements, the proposed vEDGAR software is evaluated, resulting in a final conclusion on the applicability of CARLA for HiL testing of automated vehicles. The tool is available open source: Modified CARLA fork: https://github.com/TUMFTM/carla, vEDGAR Framework: https://github.com/TUMFTM/vEDGAR

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a semantically grounded linguistic representation for robotic actions that normalizes numerical variations across platforms, improving pretraining generalization and transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distribution shifts in robotic action data due to numerical variations across different robotic platforms and tasks hinder effective transfer of pretrained knowledge in end-to-end manipulation systems.

Method: Develops a motion representation that disregards numeric scale effects and emphasizes directionality, normalizing actions for efficient pretraining and reducing modality gaps between action tokens and vocabulary tokens.

Result: Multi-task experiments on two benchmarks show significant improvements in generalization performance and transferability for robotic manipulation tasks compared to conventional discretized action representations.

Conclusion: The semantically grounded linguistic representation effectively mitigates distribution shifts in robotic action data, enabling more robust and generalizable pretraining for robotic manipulation systems.

Abstract: Recent end-to-end robotic manipulation research increasingly adopts architectures inspired by large language models to enable robust manipulation. However, a critical challenge arises from severe distribution shifts between robotic action data, primarily due to substantial numerical variations in action commands across diverse robotic platforms and tasks, hindering the effective transfer of pretrained knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose a semantically grounded linguistic representation to normalize actions for efficient pretraining. Unlike conventional discretized action representations that are sensitive to numerical scales, the motion representation specifically disregards numeric scale effects, emphasizing directionality instead. This abstraction mitigates distribution shifts, yielding a more generalizable pretraining representation. Moreover, using the motion representation narrows the feature distance between action tokens and standard vocabulary tokens, mitigating modality gaps. Multi-task experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves generalization performance and transferability in robotic manipulation tasks.

TL;DR: NMPC-based collision avoidance using time-dependent Reciprocal Velocity Constraints without communication, achieving 100Hz processing for agile UAV flight with 31% flight time reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a collision avoidance system for UAVs that doesn't require excessive communication between robots, relying only on observable information while maintaining high processing rates for agile flight.

Method: Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) with time-dependent Reciprocal Velocity Constraints (RVCs) that are directly integrated into the controller formulation, using only observable information about other robots without communication.

Result: The system runs at 100 Hz, was tested with up to 10 UAVs at speeds up to 25 m/s, and showed 31% improvement in flight time reduction compared to state-of-the-art while maintaining collision-free navigation in all trials.

Conclusion: The proposed NMPC approach with time-dependent RVCs provides effective, communication-free collision avoidance for agile UAVs with significant performance improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: This paper presents an approach to mutual collision avoidance based on Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) with time-dependent Reciprocal Velocity Constraints (RVCs). Unlike most existing methods, the proposed approach relies solely on observable information about other robots, eliminating the necessity of excessive communication use. The computationally efficient algorithm for computing RVCs, together with the direct integration of these constraints into NMPC problem formulation on a controller level, allows the whole pipeline to run at 100 Hz. This high processing rate, combined with modeled nonlinear dynamics of the controlled Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), is a key feature that facilitates the use of the proposed approach for an agile UAV flight. The proposed approach was evaluated through extensive simulations emulating real-world conditions in scenarios involving up to 10 UAVs and velocities of up to 25 m/s, and in real-world experiments with accelerations up to 30 m/s$^2$. Comparison with state of the art shows 31% improvement in terms of flight time reduction in challenging scenarios, while maintaining a collision-free navigation in all trials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While AI systems have developed broad reasoning capabilities from internet-scale data, grounding these abilities in physical action remains a major challenge. The paper aims to bridge the gap between semantic reasoning and physical execution in robotics.

Method: Three-stage pre-training pipeline: 1) Continued VLM pre-training on curated vision-language data for embodied reasoning skills, 2) Co-training on cross-embodiment robot data with vision-language data, 3) Action training with reasoning process on trajectories from Astribot S1 bimanual manipulator, plus reinforcement learning for reasoning-action consistency.

Result: Lumo-1 achieves significant improvements in embodied vision-language reasoning and surpasses strong baselines across challenging robotic tasks, with strong generalization to novel objects/environments, particularly excelling in long-horizon tasks and responding to human-natural instructions requiring complex reasoning.

Conclusion: The paper presents Lumo-1 as a successful approach to unifying robot reasoning and action, demonstrating that progressive extension of vision-language models to embodied reasoning and action prediction enables effective generalist robotic control with strong reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Humans act with context and intention, with reasoning playing a central role. While internet-scale data has enabled broad reasoning capabilities in AI systems, grounding these abilities in physical action remains a major challenge. We introduce Lumo-1, a generalist vision-language-action (VLA) model that unifies robot reasoning ("mind") with robot action ("hand"). Our approach builds upon the general multi-modal reasoning capabilities of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), progressively extending them to embodied reasoning and action prediction, and ultimately towards structured reasoning and reasoning-action alignment. This results in a three-stage pre-training pipeline: (1) Continued VLM pre-training on curated vision-language data to enhance embodied reasoning skills such as planning, spatial understanding, and trajectory prediction; (2) Co-training on cross-embodiment robot data alongside vision-language data; and (3) Action training with reasoning process on trajectories collected on Astribot S1, a bimanual mobile manipulator with human-like dexterity and agility. Finally, we integrate reinforcement learning to further refine reasoning-action consistency and close the loop between semantic inference and motor control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Lumo-1 achieves significant performance improvements in embodied vision-language reasoning, a critical component for generalist robotic control. Real-world evaluations further show that Lumo-1 surpasses strong baselines across a wide range of challenging robotic tasks, with strong generalization to novel objects and environments, excelling particularly in long-horizon tasks and responding to human-natural instructions that require reasoning over strategy, concepts and space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need efficient optimization methods for tuning decentralized trajectory generation algorithms in multi-drone systems, especially as swarm sizes grow and computational costs increase.

Method: Use Multi-Task Bayesian Optimization with Multi-Task Gaussian Processes to model relationships across different trajectory generation scenarios (tasks defined by drone-to-drone interactions). Compare two optimization strategies: optimizing average mission time across all tasks vs optimizing each task individually.

Result: Single-task optimization achieves progressively shorter mission times as swarm size grows, but requires significantly more optimization time than the average-task approach.

Conclusion: Multi-Task Bayesian Optimization with average-task strategy offers a computationally efficient alternative to individual task optimization for tuning decentralized drone trajectory algorithms, with trade-offs between optimization time and mission performance.

Abstract: This paper investigates the use of Multi-Task Bayesian Optimization for tuning decentralized trajectory generation algorithms in multi-drone systems. We treat each task as a trajectory generation scenario defined by a specific number of drone-to-drone interactions. To model relationships across scenarios, we employ Multi-Task Gaussian Processes, which capture shared structure across tasks and enable efficient information transfer during optimization. We compare two strategies: optimizing the average mission time across all tasks and optimizing each task individually. Through a comprehensive simulation campaign, we show that single-task optimization leads to progressively shorter mission times as swarm size grows, but requires significantly more optimization time than the average-task approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lidar SLAM robustness evaluation methods lack physical grounding or fail to capture sensor-specific degradation behavior, making it difficult to systematically test SLAM systems under realistic adverse conditions.

Method: Phenomenological framework that applies interpretable lidar degradations directly to real point clouds while preserving geometry, intensity, and temporal structure. Includes structured dropout, FoV reduction, Gaussian noise, occlusion masking, sparsification, and motion distortion with modular configuration and four severity tiers.

Result: Experimental validation across three lidar architectures and five state-of-the-art SLAM systems reveals distinct robustness patterns shaped by sensor design and environmental context. Framework achieves real-time performance (<20ms per frame) compatible with ROS workflows.

Conclusion: The open-source implementation provides a practical foundation for benchmarking lidar-based SLAM under physically meaningful degradation scenarios, enabling reproducible and controlled stress testing that captures sensor-specific behavior.

Abstract: Lidar-based SLAM systems are highly sensitive to adverse conditions such as occlusion, noise, and field-of-view (FoV) degradation, yet existing robustness evaluation methods either lack physical grounding or do not capture sensor-specific behavior. This paper presents a sensor-aware, phenomenological framework for simulating interpretable lidar degradations directly on real point clouds, enabling controlled and reproducible SLAM stress testing. Unlike image-derived corruption benchmarks (e.g., SemanticKITTI-C) or simulation-only approaches (e.g., lidarsim), the proposed system preserves per-point geometry, intensity, and temporal structure while applying structured dropout, FoV reduction, Gaussian noise, occlusion masking, sparsification, and motion distortion. The framework features autonomous topic and sensor detection, modular configuration with four severity tiers (light--extreme), and real-time performance (less than 20 ms per frame) compatible with ROS workflows. Experimental validation across three lidar architectures and five state-of-the-art SLAM systems reveals distinct robustness patterns shaped by sensor design and environmental context. The open-source implementation provides a practical foundation for benchmarking lidar-based SLAM under physically meaningful degradation scenarios.

TL;DR: First zero-shot sim2real DRL velocity controller for AUVs enabling agile 6DOF maneuvering with just 3 minutes of training, validated in pool trials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Holonomic AUVs have hardware capability for agile maneuvering but face control challenges due to complex hydrodynamics, parametric uncertainties, and payload changes. Current approaches require careful tuning for specific configurations and re-tuning for different conditions, limiting practical use of agile 6DOF maneuvering.

Method: Sim2Swim approach uses deep reinforcement learning with domain randomization and massively parallelized training to create zero-shot sim2real velocity controllers. Inspired by state-of-the-art DRL-based position control, it trains deployable policies for AUVs with variable characteristics without post-processing or tuning.

Result: Successfully developed general velocity controller enabling path following and agile 6DOF maneuvering with only 3 minutes of training time. Extensively validated in pool trials for various configurations, demonstrating robust control for highly agile motions.

Conclusion: Sim2Swim presents a breakthrough in AUV control by enabling agile 6DOF maneuvering through efficient zero-shot sim2real DRL approach that eliminates the need for platform-specific tuning and adapts to varying payloads and hydrodynamic conditions.

Abstract: Holonomic autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have the hardware ability for agile maneuvering in both translational and rotational degrees of freedom (DOFs). However, due to challenges inherent to underwater vehicles, such as complex hydrostatics and hydrodynamics, parametric uncertainties, and frequent changes in dynamics due to payload changes, control is challenging. Performance typically relies on carefully tuned controllers targeting unique platform configurations, and a need for re-tuning for deployment under varying payloads and hydrodynamic conditions. As a consequence, agile maneuvering with simultaneous tracking of time-varying references in both translational and rotational DOFs is rarely utilized in practice. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first general zero-shot sim2real deep reinforcement learning-based (DRL) velocity controller enabling path following and agile 6DOF maneuvering with a training duration of just 3 minutes. Sim2Swim, the proposed approach, inspired by state-of-the-art DRL-based position control, leverages domain randomization and massively parallelized training to converge to field-deployable control policies for AUVs of variable characteristics without post-processing or tuning. Sim2Swim is extensively validated in pool trials for a variety of configurations, showcasing robust control for highly agile motions.

TL;DR: Proposes ergodic planning with dynamic sensor footprints, optimizing both trajectories and sensor parameters for better information gathering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ergodic planning oversimplifies sensing models, assuming point sensors or constant footprints, while real sensors (like aerial cameras) have dynamic footprints that change with robot motion.

Method: Develops new metric for dynamic sensor footprints, analyzes theoretical local optimality conditions, and proposes numerical trajectory optimization algorithms.

Result: Achieves up to order-of-magnitude better ergodicity than conventional methods, successfully deployed in multi-drone system for 3D object coverage.

Conclusion: The approach effectively handles dynamic sensor footprints in ergodic planning, enabling simultaneous optimization of trajectories and sensor parameters for improved information gathering.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of trajectory planning for information gathering with a dynamic and resolution-varying sensor footprint. Ergodic planning offers a principled framework that balances exploration (visiting all areas) and exploitation (focusing on high-information regions) by planning trajectories such that the time spent in a region is proportional to the amount of information in that region. Existing ergodic planning often oversimplifies the sensing model by assuming a point sensor or a footprint with constant shape and resolution. In practice, the sensor footprint can drastically change over time as the robot moves, such as aerial robots equipped with downward-facing cameras, whose field of view depends on the orientation and altitude. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new metric that accounts for dynamic sensor footprints, analyze the theoretic local optimality conditions, and propose numerical trajectory optimization algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can simultaneously optimize both the trajectories and sensor footprints, with up to an order of magnitude better ergodicity than conventional methods. We also deploy our approach in a multi-drone system to ergodically cover an object in 3D space.

Motivation: Enable safe and cooperative human-robot navigation in shared workspaces where both agents must satisfy shared safety constraints while working on common tasks

Method: Proposes a dynamic game formulation with non-normalized equilibrium structure for shared constraints, embedded in a receding-horizon optimal control scheme

Result: Allows human and robot to contribute different levels of effort towards enforcing safety requirements like collision avoidance and inter-player spacing

Conclusion: The non-normalized equilibrium structure enables flexible cooperation where agents can asymmetrically contribute to shared safety constraints in dynamic navigation tasks

Abstract: This paper proposes a dynamic game formulation for cooperative human-robot navigation in shared workspaces with obstacles, where the human and robot jointly satisfy shared safety constraints while pursuing a common task. A key contribution is the introduction of a non-normalized equilibrium structure for the shared constraints. This structure allows the two agents to contribute different levels of effort towards enforcing safety requirements such as collision avoidance and inter-players spacing. We embed this non-normalized equilibrium into a receding-horizon optimal control scheme.

Uses attention mechanisms to capture temporal and spatial dependencies.

Result: Best configuration (sequence length 64, 64 Hz, four layers, 32 heads) achieved validation R² of 0.8633. Mass and inertia estimated with near-perfect accuracy, Coulomb friction with moderate-to-high accuracy, while viscous friction and distal link center-of-mass remained more challenging.

Conclusion: Combining Transformers with automated dataset generation and kinematic enrichment enables scalable, accurate dynamic parameter estimation, contributing to improved sim-to-real transfer in robotic systems.

Abstract: Bridging the sim-to-real gap remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, as accurate dynamic parameter estimation is essential for reliable model-based control, realistic simulation, and safe deployment of manipulators. Traditional analytical approaches often fall short when faced with complex robot structures and interactions. Data-driven methods offer a promising alternative, yet conventional neural networks such as recurrent models struggle to capture long-range dependencies critical for accurate estimation. In this study, we propose a Transformer-based approach for dynamic parameter estimation, supported by an automated pipeline that generates diverse robot models and enriched trajectory data using Jacobian-derived features. The dataset consists of 8,192 robots with varied inertial and frictional properties. Leveraging attention mechanisms, our model effectively captures both temporal and spatial dependencies. Experimental results highlight the influence of sequence length, sampling rate, and architecture, with the best configuration (sequence length 64, 64 Hz, four layers, 32 heads) achieving a validation R2 of 0.8633. Mass and inertia are estimated with near-perfect accuracy, Coulomb friction with moderate-to-high accuracy, while viscous friction and distal link center-of-mass remain more challenging.

TL;DR: Multi-robot teams balance continuous patrolling with urgent signal detection; behavioral heterogeneity (specialized roles) provides optimal trade-offs, and limited sensing-capable agents can match homogeneous teams for cost savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-robot systems face performance trade-offs when interrupted by urgent, time-critical sub-tasks while performing continuous tasks like area patrolling. The paper investigates how to balance these conflicting time demands in scenarios where teams must patrol areas while also locating anomalous radio signals.

Method: The study evaluates two types of heterogeneity: (1) behavioral heterogeneity through agent role specialization (creating "patrollers" and "searchers"), and (2) sensing heterogeneity where only searchers can detect the radio signal. The approach uses simulation to analyze performance trade-offs under varying team compositions.

Result: Behaviorally heterogeneous teams demonstrate the most balanced trade-offs in most cases. When sensing capability is restricted, heterogeneous teams with half the sensing-capable agents perform comparably to homogeneous teams, providing cost-saving rationale for limiting sensor deployment.

Conclusion: Pre-deployment role and sensing specialization are powerful design considerations for multi-robot systems facing time-conflicting tasks. Varying the degree of behavioral heterogeneity allows tuning system performance toward either task, offering flexible optimization strategies for real-world applications.

Abstract: Multi-robot systems performing continuous tasks face a performance trade-off when interrupted by urgent, time-critical sub-tasks. We investigate this trade-off in a scenario where a team must balance area patrolling with locating an anomalous radio signal. To address this trade-off, we evaluate both behavioral heterogeneity through agent role specialization ("patrollers" and "searchers") and sensing heterogeneity (i.e., only the searchers can sense the radio signal). Through simulation, we identify the Pareto-optimal trade-offs under varying team compositions, with behaviorally heterogeneous teams demonstrating the most balanced trade-offs in the majority of cases. When sensing capability is restricted, heterogeneous teams with half of the sensing-capable agents perform comparably to homogeneous teams, providing cost-saving rationale for restricting sensor payload deployment. Our findings demonstrate that pre-deployment role and sensing specialization are powerful design considerations for multi-robot systems facing time-conflicting tasks, where varying the degree of behavioral heterogeneity can tune system performance toward either task.

TL;DR: Self-play PPO agents in heterogeneous MARL show surprising generalization to novel teammates, matching performance of diverse training approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether self-play MARL agents learn general coordination strategies or overfit to training partners' behaviors, especially in heterogeneous settings with distinct agent types.

Method: Introduces Rotating Policy Training (RPT) that rotates heterogeneous teammate policies of different learning algorithms during training, tested in HeMAC environment with Observer and Drone agents.

Result: RPT achieves similar performance to standard self-play IPPO baseline when playing with withheld teammate policy (DDQN), showing IPPO generalizes to novel teammates despite no training diversity.

Conclusion: Simple IPPO baseline possesses sufficient generalization to novel teammates that diverse training regimens aim to achieve, challenging assumptions about overfitting in self-play MARL.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is commonly deployed in settings where agents are trained via self-play with homogeneous teammates, often using parameter sharing and a single policy architecture. This opens the question: to what extent do self-play PPO agents learn general coordination strategies grounded in the underlying game, compared to overfitting to their training partners' behaviors? This paper investigates the question using the Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Challenge (HeMAC) environment, which features distinct Observer and Drone agents with complementary capabilities. We introduce Rotating Policy Training (RPT), an approach that rotates heterogeneous teammate policies of different learning algorithms during training, to expose the agent to a broader range of partner strategies. When playing alongside a withheld teammate policy (DDQN), we find that RPT achieves similar performance to a standard self-play baseline, IPPO, where all agents were trained sharing a single PPO policy. This result indicates that in this heterogeneous multi-agent setting, the IPPO baseline generalizes to novel teammate algorithms despite not experiencing teammate diversity during training. This shows that a simple IPPO baseline may possess the level of generalization to novel teammates that a diverse training regimen was designed to achieve.

TL;DR: OSMO is an open-source tactile glove that enables human-to-robot skill transfer by capturing rich contact signals during human demonstrations, allowing robots to learn contact-rich manipulation tasks without real robot data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human video demonstrations lack the critical contact signals needed for mastering manipulation tasks, creating a gap between human demonstrations and robot execution capabilities.

Method: Developed OSMO, a wearable tactile glove with 12 three-axis tactile sensors across fingertips and palm, compatible with hand-tracking methods for in-the-wild data collection. Both human and robot wear the same glove to minimize visual and tactile embodiment gaps.

Result: A robot policy trained exclusively on human demonstrations collected with OSMO achieved 72% success rate on a real-world wiping task requiring sustained contact pressure, outperforming vision-only baselines by eliminating contact-related failure modes.

Conclusion: OSMO enables effective transfer of contact-rich manipulation skills from humans to robots by providing continuous shear and normal force feedback, bridging the tactile sensing gap in human demonstration data.

Abstract: Human video demonstrations provide abundant training data for learning robot policies, but video alone cannot capture the rich contact signals critical for mastering manipulation. We introduce OSMO, an open-source wearable tactile glove designed for human-to-robot skill transfer. The glove features 12 three-axis tactile sensors across the fingertips and palm and is designed to be compatible with state-of-the-art hand-tracking methods for in-the-wild data collection. We demonstrate that a robot policy trained exclusively on human demonstrations collected with OSMO, without any real robot data, is capable of executing a challenging contact-rich manipulation task. By equipping both the human and the robot with the same glove, OSMO minimizes the visual and tactile embodiment gap, enabling the transfer of continuous shear and normal force feedback while avoiding the need for image inpainting or other vision-based force inference. On a real-world wiping task requiring sustained contact pressure, our tactile-aware policy achieves a 72% success rate, outperforming vision-only baselines by eliminating contact-related failure modes. We release complete hardware designs, firmware, and assembly instructions to support community adoption.
