While recent methods leverage\npre-trained vision backbones and more training corpus to achieve impressive\nresults, they predominantly focus on simple expressions--short, clear noun\nphrases like \"red car\" or \"left girl\". This simplification often reduces RIS to\na key word/concept matching problem, limiting the model's ability to handle\nreferential ambiguity in expressions. In this work, we identify two challenging\nreal-world scenarios: object-distracting expressions, which involve multiple\nentities with contextual cues, and category-implicit expressions, where the\nobject class is not explicitly stated. To address the challenges, we propose a\nnovel framework, SaFiRe, which mimics the human two-phase cognitive\nprocess--first forming a global understanding, then refining it through\ndetail-oriented inspection. This is naturally supported by Mamba's\nscan-then-update property, which aligns with our phased design and enables\nefficient multi-cycle refinement with linear complexity.

Experimental results show that DRM provides\neffective supervision signals, guides the optimization of LLMs and enhances\ntheir reasoning ability. In particular, DRM-supervised training achieves\nconsistent gains on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution open-domain\ntasks, including mathematics, question answering, code execution, and puzzles.\nOur findings demonstrate that multidimensional supervision of the reasoning\nprocess can improve the generalized reasoning ability of LLMs beyond the\ntraining distribution.", "AI": {"tldr": "DRM is a new supervision framework that evaluates reasoning processes along three interpretable dimensions (Confidence, Relevance, Coherence) to provide better training signals than outcome-only or process-level rewards, improving LLM reasoning across diverse tasks.", "motivation": "Current RLVR methods only reward correct final answers, propagating flawed reasoning with sparse rewards, while PRMs lack generalizability and require task-specific segmentation.

Determining the scale bars is an important first step of\naccurate SEM analysis; however, currently, it mainly relies on manual\noperations, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this\nissue, we propose a multi-modal and automated scale bar detection and\nextraction framework that provides concurrent object detection, text detection\nand text recognition with a Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The proposed\nframework operates in four phases; i) Automatic Dataset Generation (Auto-DG)\nmodel to synthesize a diverse dataset of SEM images ensuring robust training\nand high generalizability of the model, ii) scale bar object detection, iii)\ninformation extraction using a hybrid Optical Character Recognition (OCR)\nsystem with DenseNet and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) based\nalgorithms, iv) an LLM agent to analyze and verify accuracy of the results. The\nproposed model demonstrates a strong performance in object detection and\naccurate localization with a precision of 100%, recall of 95.8%, and a mean\nAverage Precision (mAP) of 99.2% at IoU=0.5 and 69.1% at IoU=0.5:0.95. The\nhybrid OCR system achieved 89% precision, 65% recall, and a 75% F1 score on the\nAuto-DG dataset, significantly outperforming several mainstream standalone\nengines, highlighting its reliability for scientific image analysis. The LLM is\nintroduced as a reasoning engine as well as an intelligent assistant that\nsuggests follow-up steps and verifies the results. This automated method\npowered by an LLM agent significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of\nscale bar detection and extraction in SEM images, providing a valuable tool for\nmicroscopic analysis and advancing the field of scientific imaging.", "AI": {"tldr": "Automated multi-modal framework for SEM scale bar detection using object detection, hybrid OCR, and LLM agent to eliminate manual operations and improve accuracy.", "motivation": "Manual scale bar detection in SEM images is time-consuming and error-prone, creating a need for automated solutions to improve efficiency and accuracy in microscopic analysis.", "method": "Four-phase framework: 1) Auto-DG for synthetic dataset generation, 2) object detection for scale bar localization, 3) hybrid OCR with DenseNet and CRNN for text extraction, 4) LLM agent for result verification and analysis.", "result": "Object detection achieved 100% precision, 95.8% recall, 99.2% mAP@0.5; OCR achieved 89% precision, 65% recall, 75% F1 score; outperformed standalone OCR engines.", "conclusion": "The automated LLM-powered framework significantly enhances SEM scale bar detection efficiency and accuracy, providing a valuable tool for scientific imaging advancement."}}
