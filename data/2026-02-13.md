*Manuel Hetzel,Kerim Turacan,Hannes Reichert,Konrad Doll,Bernhard Sick*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DD-MDN is a probabilistic human trajectory forecasting model that achieves high accuracy, calibrated uncertainty, and robustness to short observation periods using few-shot denoising diffusion and dual mixture density networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior HTF work has focused on accuracy, social interaction, and diversity, but neglected uncertainty modeling, calibration, and performance with short observation periods - all crucial for real-world applications like autonomous driving and collision avoidance.

Method: Combines few-shot denoising diffusion backbone with dual mixture density network to learn self-calibrated residence areas and probability-ranked anchor paths, generating diverse trajectory hypotheses without predefined anchors or endpoints.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on ETH/UCY, SDD, inD, and IMPTC datasets, demonstrating superior accuracy, robustness at short observation intervals, and reliable uncertainty modeling.

Conclusion: DD-MDN effectively addresses key limitations in HTF by providing accurate, calibrated, and robust trajectory forecasts suitable for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving and human-robot interaction.

Abstract: Human Trajectory Forecasting (HTF) predicts future human movements from past trajectories and environmental context, with applications in Autonomous Driving, Smart Surveillance, and Human-Robot Interaction. While prior work has focused on accuracy, social interaction modeling, and diversity, little attention has been paid to uncertainty modeling, calibration, and forecasts from short observation periods, which are crucial for downstream tasks such as path planning and collision avoidance. We propose DD-MDN, an end-to-end probabilistic HTF model that combines high positional accuracy, calibrated uncertainty, and robustness to short observations. Using a few-shot denoising diffusion backbone and a dual mixture density network, our method learns self-calibrated residence areas and probability-ranked anchor paths, from which diverse trajectory hypotheses are derived, without predefined anchors or endpoints. Experiments on the ETH/UCY, SDD, inD, and IMPTC datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy, robustness at short observation intervals, and reliable uncertainty modeling.

*Yandan Yang,Shuang Zeng,Tong Lin,Xinyuan Chang,Dekang Qi,Junjin Xiao,Haoyun Liu,Ronghan Chen,Yuzhi Chen,Dongjie Huo,Feng Xiong,Xing Wei,Zhiheng Ma,Mu Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ABot-M0 is a framework for building general-purpose embodied agents across diverse hardware by creating unified data representations and efficient action prediction through manifold learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The "one-brain, many-forms" paradigm for embodied AI is hindered by fragmented data, inconsistent representations, and misaligned training objectives across different robot platforms.

Method: 1) Systematic data curation pipeline creating UniACT-dataset from 6 public datasets; 2) Action Manifold Learning (AML) using DiT backbone for efficient action prediction; 3) Modular perception with dual-stream VLM semantics and geometric priors.

Result: Created UniACT-dataset with 6M+ trajectories and 9,500+ hours of data; Unified pre-training improves knowledge transfer; AML improves decoding speed and policy stability; Modular components operate independently with additive benefits.

Conclusion: ABot-M0 enables end-to-end transformation of heterogeneous data into unified representations, supporting general-purpose embodied intelligence across diverse hardware platforms with improved efficiency and stability.

Abstract: Building general-purpose embodied agents across diverse hardware remains a central challenge in robotics, often framed as the ''one-brain, many-forms'' paradigm. Progress is hindered by fragmented data, inconsistent representations, and misaligned training objectives. We present ABot-M0, a framework that builds a systematic data curation pipeline while jointly optimizing model architecture and training strategies, enabling end-to-end transformation of heterogeneous raw data into unified, efficient representations. From six public datasets, we clean, standardize, and balance samples to construct UniACT-dataset, a large-scale dataset with over 6 million trajectories and 9,500 hours of data, covering diverse robot morphologies and task scenarios. Unified pre-training improves knowledge transfer and generalization across platforms and tasks, supporting general-purpose embodied intelligence. To improve action prediction efficiency and stability, we propose the Action Manifold Hypothesis: effective robot actions lie not in the full high-dimensional space but on a low-dimensional, smooth manifold governed by physical laws and task constraints. Based on this, we introduce Action Manifold Learning (AML), which uses a DiT backbone to predict clean, continuous action sequences directly. This shifts learning from denoising to projection onto feasible manifolds, improving decoding speed and policy stability. ABot-M0 supports modular perception via a dual-stream mechanism that integrates VLM semantics with geometric priors and multi-view inputs from plug-and-play 3D modules such as VGGT and Qwen-Image-Edit, enhancing spatial understanding without modifying the backbone and mitigating standard VLM limitations in 3D reasoning. Experiments show components operate independently with additive benefits. We will release all code and pipelines for reproducibility and future research.

*Samanta Ghosh,Jannatul Adan Mahi,Shayan Abrar,Md Parvez Mia,Asaduzzaman Rayhan,Abdul Awal Yasir,Asaduzzaman Hridoy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automated deep learning model for tea leaf disease classification using DenseNet201 and EfficientNetB3 achieves 91-93% accuracy on TeaLeafBD dataset with 5,278 images across 7 categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tea is economically important for Bangladesh, but tea plants are vulnerable to leaf diseases that reduce production quality and quantity. Manual disease detection is time-consuming and error-prone, necessitating an automated solution.

Method: Developed deep learning pipeline with data preprocessing, splitting, adversarial training, augmentation, and model training using DenseNet201 and EfficientNetB3 on TeaLeafBD dataset (5,278 images, 7 categories). Used Explainable AI strategies including Grad-CAM visualization.

Result: EfficientNetB3 achieved highest classification accuracy of 93%, while DenseNet201 reached 91%. The models demonstrated robustness through adversarial training and provided interpretable predictions via Grad-CAM visualization.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively detects tea leaf diseases with high accuracy, offering a practical automated solution for agricultural management that can boost tea production quality and economic benefits in Bangladesh.

Abstract: Tea is a valuable asset for the economy of Bangladesh. So, tea cultivation plays an important role to boost the economy. These valuable plants are vulnerable to various kinds of leaf infections which may cause less production and low quality. It is not so easy to detect these diseases manually. It may take time and there could be some errors in the detection.Therefore, the purpose of the study is to develop an automated deep learning model for tea leaf disease classification based on the teaLeafBD dataset so that anyone can detect the diseases more easily and efficiently. There are 5,278 high-resolution images in this dataset. The images are classified into seven categories. Six of them represents various diseases and the rest one represents healthy leaves. The proposed pipeline contains data preprocessing, data splitting, adversarial training, augmentation, model training, evaluation, and comprehension made possible with Explainable AI strategies. DenseNet201 and EfficientNetB3 were employed to perform the classification task. To prepare the model more robustly, we applied adversarial training so it can operate effectively even with noisy or disturbed inputs. In addition, Grad-CAM visualization was executed to analyze the model's predictions by identifying the most influential regions of each image. Our experimental outcomes revealed that EfficientNetB3 achieved the highest classification accuracy of 93%, while DenseNet201 reached 91%. The outcomes prove that the effectiveness of the proposed approach can accurately detect tea leaf diseases and provide a practical solution for advanced agricultural management.

### [4] [Active Zero: Self-Evolving Vision-Language Models through Active Environment Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11241)
*Jinghan He,Junfeng Fang,Feng Xiong,Zijun Yao,Fei Shen,Haiyun Guo,Jinqiao Wang,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Active-Zero is a framework for vision-language models that replaces passive self-play with active exploration using three co-evolving agents to autonomously create learning curricula, achieving significant performance improvements on reasoning and understanding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-play methods for vision-language models rely on passive interaction with static image collections, leading to strong dataset dependence and inefficient learning. Models waste computational effort on samples that are either too trivial or too difficult for their current skill level, lacking the ability to actively seek visual data tailored to their evolving capabilities.

Method: Active-Zero employs three co-evolving agents: 1) a Searcher that retrieves images from open-world repositories based on the model's capability frontier, 2) a Questioner that synthesizes calibrated reasoning tasks, and 3) a Solver refined through accuracy rewards. This creates a closed-loop self-scaffolding auto-curricula where the model autonomously constructs its learning trajectory.

Result: On Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct across 12 benchmarks, Active-Zero achieves 53.97 average accuracy on reasoning tasks (5.7% improvement) and 59.77 on general understanding (3.9% improvement), consistently outperforming existing self-play baselines.

Conclusion: Active exploration is a key ingredient for scalable and adaptive self-evolving vision-language systems, enabling more efficient learning through autonomous curriculum construction tailored to the model's evolving capabilities.

Abstract: Self-play has enabled large language models to autonomously improve through self-generated challenges. However, existing self-play methods for vision-language models rely on passive interaction with static image collections, resulting in strong dependence on initial datasets and inefficient learning. Without the ability to actively seek visual data tailored to their evolving capabilities, agents waste computational effort on samples that are either trivial or beyond their current skill level. To address these limitations, we propose Active-Zero, a framework that shifts from passive interaction to active exploration of visual environments. Active-Zero employs three co-evolving agents: a Searcher that retrieves images from open-world repositories based on the model's capability frontier, a Questioner that synthesizes calibrated reasoning tasks, and a Solver refined through accuracy rewards. This closed loop enables self-scaffolding auto-curricula where the model autonomously constructs its learning trajectory. On Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct across 12 benchmarks, Active-Zero achieves 53.97 average accuracy on reasoning tasks (5.7% improvement) and 59.77 on general understanding (3.9% improvement), consistently outperforming existing self-play baselines. These results highlight active exploration as a key ingredient for scalable and adaptive self-evolving vision-language systems.

### [5] [ReTracing: An Archaeological Approach Through Body, Machine, and Generative Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11242)
*Yitong Wang,Yue Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReTracing is a multi-agent performance art using LLMs and AI to generate choreography for human and robot performers, creating a digital archive of movement traces to examine AI's influence on bodily movement and socio-cultural biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how artificial intelligence shapes, constrains, and produces bodily movement, and to reveal how generative systems encode socio-cultural biases through choreographed movements. The project confronts the question of what it means to be human among AIs that move, think, and leave traces.

Method: Extracts sentences about human-machine interaction from sci-fi novels, uses LLMs to generate "what to do/what not to do" prompts, employs diffusion-based text-to-video models to create choreographic guides for human performers and motor commands for quadruped robots, captures movements on mirrored floor with multi-camera tracking, and reconstructs into 3D point clouds and motion trails.

Result: Creates a digital archive of motion traces through the interplay of AI, human, and robot performers, forming a novel approach to studying AI's influence on movement and revealing encoded biases in generative systems.

Conclusion: ReTracing serves as an innovative method for examining AI's impact on bodily movement and socio-cultural biases, using performance art to explore fundamental questions about human identity in an age of moving, thinking AIs that leave their own traces.

Abstract: We present ReTracing, a multi-agent embodied performance art that adopts an archaeological approach to examine how artificial intelligence shapes, constrains, and produces bodily movement. Drawing from science-fiction novels, the project extracts sentences that describe human-machine interaction. We use large language models (LLMs) to generate paired prompts "what to do" and "what not to do" for each excerpt. A diffusion-based text-to-video model transforms these prompts into choreographic guides for a human performer and motor commands for a quadruped robot. Both agents enact the actions on a mirrored floor, captured by multi-camera motion tracking and reconstructed into 3D point clouds and motion trails, forming a digital archive of motion traces. Through this process, ReTracing serves as a novel approach to reveal how generative systems encode socio-cultural biases through choreographed movements. Through an immersive interplay of AI, human, and robot, ReTracing confronts a critical question of our time: What does it mean to be human among AIs that also move, think, and leave traces behind?

### [6] [Stress Tests REVEAL Fragile Temporal and Visual Grounding in Video-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11244)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REVEAL is a diagnostic benchmark that reveals fundamental weaknesses in Video-Language Models (VidLMs) through five stress tests, showing they often fail at basic video understanding tasks that humans handle easily.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Video-Language Models robustly account for video content, temporal sequence, and motion - fundamental capabilities that should be expected from video understanding models.

Method: Introduces REVEAL, a diagnostic benchmark with five controlled stress tests: temporal expectation bias, language-only shortcuts, video sycophancy, camera motion sensitivity, and spatiotemporal occlusion robustness. Includes an automatic data pipeline for generating diagnostic examples.

Result: Leading VidLMs fail across all stress tests - they describe reversed scenes as forward, answer questions ignoring video content, agree with false claims, struggle with camera motion, and fail to aggregate temporal information with simple masking. Humans succeed easily at these same tasks.

Conclusion: Current Video-Language Models lack fundamental video understanding capabilities despite their apparent sophistication. The REVEAL benchmark and data pipeline will be released to support future research in developing more robust video understanding models.

Abstract: This work investigates a fundamental question: Do Video-Language Models (VidLMs) robustly account for video content, temporal sequence, and motion? Our investigation shows that, surprisingly, they often do not. We introduce REVEAL{}, a diagnostic benchmark that probes fundamental weaknesses of contemporary VidLMs through five controlled stress tests; assessing temporal expectation bias, reliance on language-only shortcuts, video sycophancy, camera motion sensitivity, and robustness to spatiotemporal occlusion. We test leading open- and closed-source VidLMs and find that these models confidently describe reversed scenes as forward, answer questions while neglecting video content, agree with false claims, struggle with basic camera motion, and fail to aggregate temporal information amidst simple spatiotemporal masking. Humans, on the other hand, succeed at these tasks with ease. Alongside our benchmark, we provide a data pipeline that automatically generates diagnostic examples for our stress tests, enabling broader and more scalable evaluation. We will release our benchmark and code to support future research.

### [7] [Advancing Digital Twin Generation Through a Novel Simulation Framework and Quantitative Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11314)
*Jacob Rubinstein,Avi Donaty,Don Engel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel pipeline for generating synthetic images from 3D models to enable quantifiable testing of photogrammetry methods against ground truth data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current photogrammetry approaches for 3D model generation from real-world objects rely on qualitative comparisons, lacking standardized quantitative evaluation methods against ground truth data.

Method: Developed a pipeline that generates synthetic images from high-quality 3D models using programmatically generated camera poses, enabling repeatable experiments with known ground truth camera parameters and object geometry.

Result: Enables systematic comparison between ground-truth virtual camera parameters/object data and reconstructed estimations from photogrammetry, providing quantitative evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The synthetic image generation pipeline provides a robust framework for quantitatively evaluating and comparing different photogrammetry approaches using controlled, repeatable experiments with known ground truth.

Abstract: The generation of 3D models from real-world objects has often been accomplished through photogrammetry, i.e., by taking 2D photos from a variety of perspectives and then triangulating matched point-based features to create a textured mesh. Many design choices exist within this framework for the generation of digital twins, and differences between such approaches are largely judged qualitatively. Here, we present and test a novel pipeline for generating synthetic images from high-quality 3D models and programmatically generated camera poses. This enables a wide variety of repeatable, quantifiable experiments which can compare ground-truth knowledge of virtual camera parameters and of virtual objects against the reconstructed estimations of those perspectives and subjects.

### [8] [Selective Prior Synchronization via SYNC Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11316)
*Ishan Mishra,Jiajie Li,Deepak Mishra,Jinjun Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SYNC loss integrates ad-hoc and post-hoc selective prediction methods by using softmax response (selective prior) during SelectiveNet training, improving generalization and setting new SOTA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current selective prediction methods are either ad-hoc (modifying architecture/objective) or post-hoc (analyzing probabilistic outputs). Post-hoc methods generate valuable uncertainty information (selective prior) that's only used during inference, but this information should also be leveraged during training to improve selective prediction capabilities.

Method: Proposes SYNC loss that integrates ad-hoc SelectiveNet with post-hoc softmax response. Incorporates the selective prior (uncertainty information from softmax response) into the training process of SelectiveNet, creating a novel hybrid approach that uses uncertainty information during both training and inference.

Result: Evaluated on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Stanford Cars datasets. The method enhances model generalization capabilities, surpasses previous selective prediction works, and sets new state-of-the-art performance benchmarks.

Conclusion: The selective prior generated by post-hoc methods is valuable not just for inference but also for training. Integrating ad-hoc and post-hoc approaches through SYNC loss significantly improves selective prediction performance and generalization, establishing a new direction for uncertainty-aware deep learning.

Abstract: Prediction under uncertainty is a critical requirement for the deep neural network to succeed responsibly. This paper focuses on selective prediction, which allows DNNs to make informed decisions about when to predict or abstain based on the uncertainty level of their predictions. Current methods are either ad-hoc such as SelectiveNet, focusing on how to modify the network architecture or objective function, or post-hoc such as softmax response, achieving selective prediction through analyzing the model's probabilistic outputs. We observe that post-hoc methods implicitly generate uncertainty information, termed the selective prior, which has traditionally been used only during inference. We argue that the selective prior provided by the selection mechanism is equally vital during the training stage. Therefore, we propose the SYNC loss which introduces a novel integration of ad-hoc and post-hoc method. Specifically, our approach incorporates the softmax response into the training process of SelectiveNet, enhancing its selective prediction capabilities by examining the selective prior. Evaluated across various datasets, including CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Stanford Cars, our method not only enhances the model's generalization capabilities but also surpasses previous works in selective prediction performance, and sets new benchmarks for state-of-the-art performance.

### [9] [MDE-VIO: Enhancing Visual-Inertial Odometry Using Learned Depth Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11323)
*Arda Alniak,Sinan Kalkan,Mustafa Mert Ankarali,Afsar Saranli,Abdullah Aydin Alatan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Integrates dense depth priors from Vision Transformers into VINS-Mono backend for robust monocular VIO in low-texture environments, achieving real-time edge deployment with 28.3% ATE reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional monocular VIO systems fail in low-texture environments due to insufficient sparse visual features. While dense MDE from ViT models provides geometrically consistent depth, their computational complexity prevents real-time edge deployment.

Method: Proposes a framework integrating learned depth priors into VINS-Mono optimization backend with affine-invariant depth consistency and pairwise ordinal constraints, filtering unstable artifacts via variance-based gating to maintain edge device computational limits.

Result: Extensive experiments on TartanGround and M3ED datasets show the method prevents divergence in challenging scenarios and reduces Absolute Trajectory Error by up to 28.3% while maintaining real-time performance on edge devices.

Conclusion: Successfully bridges the gap between computationally intensive ViT-based depth estimation and real-time edge deployment for monocular VIO, enabling robust metric scale recovery in low-texture environments through efficient integration of learned depth priors.

Abstract: Traditional monocular Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) systems struggle in low-texture environments where sparse visual features are insufficient for accurate pose estimation. To address this, dense Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) has been widely explored as a complementary information source. While recent Vision Transformer (ViT) based complex foundational models offer dense, geometrically consistent depth, their computational demands typically preclude them from real-time edge deployment. Our work bridges this gap by integrating learned depth priors directly into the VINS-Mono optimization backend. We propose a novel framework that enforces affine-invariant depth consistency and pairwise ordinal constraints, explicitly filtering unstable artifacts via variance-based gating. This approach strictly adheres to the computational limits of edge devices while robustly recovering metric scale. Extensive experiments on the TartanGround and M3ED datasets demonstrate that our method prevents divergence in challenging scenarios and delivers significant accuracy gains, reducing Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by up to 28.3%. Code will be made available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed StreamSR dataset from YouTube for streaming video super-resolution, benchmarked 11 SOTA models, and introduced EfRLFN with Efficient Channel Attention and tanh activation for real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing real-time super-resolution methods struggle with compressed video content, and current datasets don't reflect real streaming media characteristics, limiting relevance for streaming applications.

Method: 1) Created StreamSR dataset from YouTube covering various genres/resolutions; 2) Benchmarked 11 SOTA real-time SR models; 3) Proposed EfRLFN model with Efficient Channel Attention, tanh activation, optimized architecture, and composite loss function.

Result: EfRLFN improves both visual quality and runtime performance over existing architectures. Fine-tuning other models on StreamSR dataset yields significant performance gains that generalize across standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: StreamSR dataset addresses streaming media gap, EfRLFN offers efficient real-time SR solution, and dataset enables better model training for streaming applications. All resources made publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advancements in real-time super-resolution have enabled higher-quality video streaming, yet existing methods struggle with the unique challenges of compressed video content. Commonly used datasets do not accurately reflect the characteristics of streaming media, limiting the relevance of current benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive dataset - StreamSR - sourced from YouTube, covering a wide range of video genres and resolutions representative of real-world streaming scenarios. We benchmark 11 state-of-the-art real-time super-resolution models to evaluate their performance for the streaming use-case.
  Furthermore, we propose EfRLFN, an efficient real-time model that integrates Efficient Channel Attention and a hyperbolic tangent activation function - a novel design choice in the context of real-time super-resolution. We extensively optimized the architecture to maximize efficiency and designed a composite loss function that improves training convergence. EfRLFN combines the strengths of existing architectures while improving both visual quality and runtime performance.
  Finally, we show that fine-tuning other models on our dataset results in significant performance gains that generalize well across various standard benchmarks. We made the dataset, the code, and the benchmark available at https://github.com/EvgeneyBogatyrev/EfRLFN.

*Samuel Waugh,Stuart James*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArtContext pipeline uses CLIP with LoRA adaptation to annotate artworks with information from art history articles and Wikidata, creating PaintingCLIP model that outperforms standard CLIP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Art history articles discuss artworks and their specific aspects, but it's difficult to identify what different articles say about particular pieces when viewing them.

Method: Developed ArtContext pipeline that collects corpus from Open-Access Art History articles and Wikidata, then creates PaintingCLIP using CLIP adapted with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for domain-specific learning with weak supervision from collected corpus.

Result: PaintingCLIP outperforms standard CLIP and provides contextual information for artworks. The pipeline is generalizable and applicable to other humanities areas.

Conclusion: ArtContext successfully creates a domain-specific model for art history that can annotate artworks with relevant contextual information from scholarly articles and knowledge bases.

Abstract: Many Art History articles discuss artworks in general as well as specific parts of works, such as layout, iconography, or material culture. However, when viewing an artwork, it is not trivial to identify what different articles have said about the piece. Therefore, we propose ArtContext, a pipeline for taking a corpus of Open-Access Art History articles and Wikidata Knowledge and annotating Artworks with this information. We do this using a novel corpus collection pipeline, then learn a bespoke CLIP model adapted using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to make it domain-specific. We show that the new model, PaintingCLIP, which is weakly supervised by the collected corpus, outperforms CLIP and provides context for a given artwork. The proposed pipeline is generalisable and can be readily applied to numerous humanities areas.

*Alan Baade,Eric Ryan Chan,Kyle Sargent,Changan Chen,Justin Johnson,Ehsan Adeli,Li Fei-Fei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Latent Forcing modifies diffusion architectures to jointly process latents and pixels with separate noise schedules, achieving latent diffusion efficiency while operating directly on raw images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent diffusion models lose end-to-end modeling benefits by discarding information during encoding, requiring separate decoders, and modeling auxiliary distributions rather than raw data.

Method: Proposes Latent Forcing which orders the denoising trajectory by jointly processing latents and pixels with separately tuned noise schedules, allowing latents to act as computational scratchpad before generating high-frequency pixel features.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art for diffusion transformer-based pixel generation on ImageNet at their compute scale, while analyzing critical conditioning signal order and relationships between tokenizer reconstruction quality and diffusability.

Conclusion: Latent Forcing combines the efficiency of latent diffusion with direct raw image modeling, addressing limitations of traditional latent diffusion while maintaining computational benefits.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images but lose the benefits of end-to-end modeling. They discard information during image encoding, require a separately trained decoder, and model an auxiliary distribution to the raw data. In this paper, we propose Latent Forcing, a simple modification to existing architectures that achieves the efficiency of latent diffusion while operating on raw natural images. Our approach orders the denoising trajectory by jointly processing latents and pixels with separately tuned noise schedules. This allows the latents to act as a scratchpad for intermediate computation before high-frequency pixel features are generated. We find that the order of conditioning signals is critical, and we analyze this to explain differences between REPA distillation in the tokenizer and the diffusion model, conditional versus unconditional generation, and how tokenizer reconstruction quality relates to diffusability. Applied to ImageNet, Latent Forcing achieves a new state-of-the-art for diffusion transformer-based pixel generation at our compute scale.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using CTA data to train neural implicit functions for reconstructing cardiac shapes from anisotropic CMRI, achieving accurate RV and myocardium reconstructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anisotropic nature of short-axis CMRI limits cardiac shape analysis, so the paper aims to leverage near-isotropic CTA data to improve reconstruction quality.

Method: Train a single neural implicit function using high-resolution CTA data to jointly represent cardiac shapes from CMRI at any resolution, focusing on RV and myocardium reconstruction.

Result: Achieved Dice scores of 0.91±0.07 (RV) and 0.75±0.13 (MYO), and Hausdorff distances of 6.21±3.97mm (RV) and 7.53±5.13mm (MYO) when compared to reference 4CH segmentations.

Conclusion: The method enables accurate, smooth, anatomically plausible cardiac shape reconstruction from anisotropic CMRI, supporting improvements in cardiac shape analysis.

Abstract: The anisotropic nature of short-axis (SAX) cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) limits cardiac shape analysis. To address this, we propose to leverage near-isotropic, higher resolution computed tomography angiography (CTA) data of the heart. We use this data to train a single neural implicit function to jointly represent cardiac shapes from CMRI at any resolution. We evaluate the method for the reconstruction of right ventricle (RV) and myocardium (MYO), where MYO simultaneously models endocardial and epicardial left-ventricle surfaces. Since high-resolution SAX reference segmentations are unavailable, we evaluate performance by extracting a 4-chamber (4CH) slice of RV and MYO from their reconstructed shapes. When compared with the reference 4CH segmentation masks from CMRI, our method achieved a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.91 $\pm$ 0.07 and 0.75 $\pm$ 0.13, and a Hausdorff distance of 6.21 $\pm$ 3.97 mm and 7.53 $\pm$ 5.13 mm for RV and MYO, respectively. Quantitative and qualitative assessment demonstrate the model's ability to reconstruct accurate, smooth and anatomically plausible shapes, supporting improvements in cardiac shape analysis.

*Penghui Ruan,Bojia Zi,Xianbiao Qi,Youze Huang,Rong Xiao,Pichao Wang,Jiannong Cao,Yuhui Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ctrl&Shift is a diffusion framework for geometry-consistent object manipulation without explicit 3D reconstruction, achieving background preservation, viewpoint consistency, and user control through a two-stage removal/inpainting approach with explicit camera pose control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing object manipulation methods struggle to jointly achieve background preservation, geometric consistency under viewpoint shifts, and user-controllable transformations. Geometry-based approaches require explicit 3D reconstruction and generalize poorly, while diffusion-based methods lack fine-grained geometric control.

Method: Decomposes manipulation into object removal and reference-guided inpainting under explicit camera pose control within a unified diffusion process. Uses multi-task, multi-stage training to separate background, identity, and pose signals. Introduces scalable real-world dataset construction pipeline with paired image/video samples and estimated relative camera poses.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results in fidelity, viewpoint consistency, and controllability. Achieves geometry-consistent object manipulation without explicit 3D representations.

Conclusion: First framework to unify fine-grained geometric control and real-world generalization for object manipulation without relying on explicit 3D modeling, addressing the core challenges of background preservation, geometric consistency, and user control simultaneously.

Abstract: Object-level manipulation, relocating or reorienting objects in images or videos while preserving scene realism, is central to film post-production, AR, and creative editing. Yet existing methods struggle to jointly achieve three core goals: background preservation, geometric consistency under viewpoint shifts, and user-controllable transformations. Geometry-based approaches offer precise control but require explicit 3D reconstruction and generalize poorly; diffusion-based methods generalize better but lack fine-grained geometric control. We present Ctrl&Shift, an end-to-end diffusion framework to achieve geometry-consistent object manipulation without explicit 3D representations. Our key insight is to decompose manipulation into two stages, object removal and reference-guided inpainting under explicit camera pose control, and encode both within a unified diffusion process. To enable precise, disentangled control, we design a multi-task, multi-stage training strategy that separates background, identity, and pose signals across tasks. To improve generalization, we introduce a scalable real-world dataset construction pipeline that generates paired image and video samples with estimated relative camera poses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ctrl&Shift achieves state-of-the-art results in fidelity, viewpoint consistency, and controllability. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to unify fine-grained geometric control and real-world generalization for object manipulation, without relying on any explicit 3D modeling.

TL;DR: Developed a 9-direction ULF DTI sequence with Bayesian bias correction and CNN-based superresolution (DiffSR) to improve white matter imaging at ultra-low-field MRI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ULF MRI offers portability but suffers from poor resolution and SNR, especially for DTI which is sensitive to imaging degradation. Current ULF DTI has artifacts in both spatial and angular domains that need specialized correction methods.

Method: Created a 9-direction single-shell ULF DTI sequence with two companion algorithms: 1) Bayesian bias field correction with angular dependence, and 2) CNN-based superresolution (DiffSR) that generalizes across DTI datasets without retraining.

Result: Algorithms successfully recovered microstructural and volumetric white matter information at ULF in synthetic downsampling experiments and real matched ULF/high-field scans. DiffSR improved Alzheimer's disease classification in degraded scans and enhanced agreement between DTI metrics.

Conclusion: The developed ULF DTI sequence with Bayesian correction and DiffSR enables better white matter assessment at ultra-low-field, with potential for portable neuroimaging and DTI harmonization. Code is publicly released for community use.

Abstract: Portable, ultra-low-field (ULF) magnetic resonance imaging has the potential to expand access to neuroimaging but currently suffers from coarse spatial and angular resolutions and low signal-to-noise ratios. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a sequence tailored to detect and reconstruct white matter tracts within the brain, is particularly prone to such imaging degradation due to inherent sequence design coupled with prolonged scan times. In addition, ULF DTI scans exhibit artifacting that spans both the space and angular domains, requiring a custom modelling algorithm for subsequent correction. We introduce a nine-direction, single-shell ULF DTI sequence, as well as a companion Bayesian bias field correction algorithm that possesses angular dependence and convolutional neural network-based superresolution algorithm that is generalizable across DTI datasets and does not require re-training (''DiffSR''). We show through a synthetic downsampling experiment and white matter assessment in real, matched ULF and high-field DTI scans that these algorithms can recover microstructural and volumetric white matter information at ULF. We also show that DiffSR can be directly applied to white matter-based Alzheimers disease classification in synthetically degraded scans, with notable improvements in agreement between DTI metrics, as compared to un-degraded scans. We freely disseminate the Bayesian bias correction algorithm and DiffSR with the goal of furthering progress on both ULF reconstruction methods and general DTI sequence harmonization. We release all code related to DiffSR for $\href{https://github.com/markolchanyi/DiffSR}{public \space use}$.

TL;DR: DBTANet: A dual-branch network for semantic change detection that combines SAM's global context with ResNet34's local details, enhanced by temporal modeling and boundary refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic change detection methods suffer from blurred boundaries and inadequate temporal modeling, limiting segmentation accuracy in bi-temporal remote sensing images.

Method: Dual-branch Siamese encoder with frozen SAM branch for global semantics/boundaries and ResNet34 for local details; Bidirectional Temporal Awareness Module for temporal dependencies; Gaussian-smoothed Projection Module for boundary refinement.

Result: Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, effectively integrating global semantics, local details, temporal reasoning, and boundary awareness.

Conclusion: DBTANet successfully addresses boundary blurring and temporal modeling limitations in semantic change detection, achieving superior performance through complementary feature integration and boundary-aware constraints.

Abstract: Semantic Change Detection (SCD) aims to detect and categorize land-cover changes from bi-temporal remote sensing images. Existing methods often suffer from blurred boundaries and inadequate temporal modeling, limiting segmentation accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a Dual-Branch Framework for Semantic Change Detection with Boundary and Temporal Awareness, termed DBTANet. Specifically, we utilize a dual-branch Siamese encoder where a frozen SAM branch captures global semantic context and boundary priors, while a ResNet34 branch provides local spatial details, ensuring complementary feature representations. On this basis, we design a Bidirectional Temporal Awareness Module (BTAM) to aggregate multi-scale features and capture temporal dependencies in a symmetric manner. Furthermore, a Gaussian-smoothed Projection Module (GSPM) refines shallow SAM features, suppressing noise while enhancing edge information for boundary-aware constraints. Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate that DBTANet effectively integrates global semantics, local details, temporal reasoning, and boundary awareness, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: ARFC is a flexible feature compression framework that supports any compression ratio with a single model using auto-regressive token prediction, enhanced by MoS and ERGC modules for better quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feature compression methods lack flexibility - they require dedicated models for specific compression ratios and need retraining for new ratios, limiting practical application in resource-constrained scenarios.

Method: Proposes ARFC framework with Arbitrary Ratio Compressor (auto-regressive model for compression via next-token prediction), Mixture of Solutions module to refine compressed tokens, and Entity Relation Graph Constraint to preserve semantic relationships.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches across cross-modal retrieval, image classification, and image retrieval tasks at various compression ratios, sometimes even surpassing uncompressed feature performance.

Conclusion: ARFC provides an effective, versatile solution for feature compression in practical scenarios, eliminating the need for multiple specialized models while maintaining or improving performance.

Abstract: Feature compression is increasingly important for improving the efficiency of downstream tasks, especially in applications involving large-scale or multi-modal data. While existing methods typically rely on dedicated models for achieving specific compression ratios, they are often limited in flexibility and generalization. In particular, retraining is necessary when adapting to a new compression ratio. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and flexible Arbitrary Ratio Feature Compression (ARFC) framework, which supports any compression ratio with a single model, eliminating the need for multiple specialized models. At its core, the Arbitrary Ratio Compressor (ARC) is an auto-regressive model that performs compression via next-token prediction. This allows the compression ratio to be controlled at inference simply by adjusting the number of generated tokens. To enhance the quality of the compressed features, two key modules are introduced. The Mixture of Solutions (MoS) module refines the compressed tokens by utilizing multiple compression results (solutions), reducing uncertainty and improving robustness. The Entity Relation Graph Constraint (ERGC) is integrated into the training process to preserve semantic and structural relationships during compression. Extensive experiments on cross-modal retrieval, image classification, and image retrieval tasks across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches at various compression ratios. Notably, in some cases, it even surpasses the performance of the original, uncompressed features. These results validate the effectiveness and versatility of ARFC for practical, resource-constrained scenarios.

Motivation: Multimodal LLMs show promise in visual-textual reasoning but have limited capabilities in Open-Vocabulary Human-Object Interaction due to cross-modal hallucinations and occlusion-induced ambiguity.

Method: Proposes ImagineAgent framework that constructs cognitive maps modeling entity-action relationships, dynamically invokes tools (retrieval augmentation, image cropping, diffusion models) for domain knowledge and visual evidence, and uses composite reward balancing accuracy and efficiency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET datasets while requiring only ~20% of training data compared to existing methods, demonstrating robustness and efficiency.

Conclusion: ImagineAgent effectively addresses OV-HOI challenges by harmonizing cognitive reasoning with generative imagination, enabling robust visual understanding with reduced training data requirements.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models have shown promising capabilities in bridging visual and textual reasoning, yet their reasoning capabilities in Open-Vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (OV-HOI) are limited by cross-modal hallucinations and occlusion-induced ambiguity. To address this, we propose \textbf{ImagineAgent}, an agentic framework that harmonizes cognitive reasoning with generative imagination for robust visual understanding. Specifically, our method innovatively constructs cognitive maps that explicitly model plausible relationships between detected entities and candidate actions. Subsequently, it dynamically invokes tools including retrieval augmentation, image cropping, and diffusion models to gather domain-specific knowledge and enriched visual evidence, thereby achieving cross-modal alignment in ambiguous scenarios. Moreover, we propose a composite reward that balances prediction accuracy and tool efficiency. Evaluations on SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET datasets demonstrate our SOTA performance, requiring approximately 20\% of training data compared to existing methods, validating our robustness and efficiency.

TL;DR: VasoMIM is a vascular anatomy-aware masked image modeling framework for self-supervised learning on X-ray angiograms, combined with XA-170K dataset, achieving SOTA performance on downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning for X-ray angiogram analysis is limited by scarce annotated data, and existing self-supervised learning approaches lack effective frameworks and large-scale datasets for this medical imaging domain.

Method: VasoMIM integrates domain-specific anatomical knowledge through two key designs: 1) anatomy-guided masking strategy that selectively masks vessel-containing patches, and 2) anatomical consistency loss that preserves structural consistency between original and reconstructed images.

Result: VasoMIM demonstrates superior transferability and achieves state-of-the-art performance on four downstream tasks across six datasets when validated against existing methods.

Conclusion: VasoMIM shows significant potential as a foundation model for advancing X-ray angiogram analysis tasks, with both the framework and XA-170K dataset made publicly available.

Abstract: X-ray angiography is the gold standard imaging modality for cardiovascular diseases. However, current deep learning approaches for X-ray angiogram analysis are severely constrained by the scarcity of annotated data. While large-scale self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising solution, its potential in this domain remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the lack of effective SSL frameworks and large-scale datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce a vascular anatomy-aware masked image modeling (VasoMIM) framework that explicitly integrates domain-specific anatomical knowledge. Specifically, VasoMIM comprises two key designs: an anatomy-guided masking strategy and an anatomical consistency loss. The former strategically masks vessel-containing patches to compel the model to learn robust vascular semantics, while the latter preserves structural consistency of vessels between original and reconstructed images, enhancing the discriminability of the learned representations. In conjunction with VasoMIM, we curate XA-170K, the largest X-ray angiogram pre-training dataset to date. We validate VasoMIM on four downstream tasks across six datasets, where it demonstrates superior transferability and achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. These findings highlight the significant potential of VasoMIM as a foundation model for advancing a wide range of X-ray angiogram analysis tasks. VasoMIM and XA-170K will be available at https://github.com/Dxhuang-CASIA/XA-SSL.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MFdiff: A supervise-assisted multi-modality fusion diffusion model that uses MR images to restore high-quality standard-dose PET from low-dose PET, addressing structure-texture inconsistencies and OOD data challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PET imaging involves radiation exposure, and reducing dose or scan time degrades image quality. Using MR images to restore standard-dose PET is promising but faces challenges with multi-modality fusion inconsistencies and out-of-distribution data mismatches.

Method: 1) Multi-modality feature fusion module to learn optimized fusion features from MR images without introducing extraneous details. 2) Diffusion model using fusion features as additional condition to iteratively generate SPET images. 3) Two-stage supervise-assisted learning strategy using generalized priors from simulated data and specific priors from in-vivo OOD data.

Result: MFdiff effectively restores high-quality SPET images from multi-modality inputs and outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed MFdiff successfully addresses challenges in multi-modality PET restoration by combining optimized feature fusion, diffusion modeling, and supervise-assisted learning, achieving superior performance in restoring high-quality PET images while reducing radiation exposure.

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) offers powerful functional imaging but involves radiation exposure. Efforts to reduce this exposure by lowering the radiotracer dose or scan time can degrade image quality. While using magnetic resonance (MR) images with clearer anatomical information to restore standard-dose PET (SPET) from low-dose PET (LPET) is a promising approach, it faces challenges with the inconsistencies in the structure and texture of multi-modality fusion, as well as the mismatch in out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In this paper, we propose a supervise-assisted multi-modality fusion diffusion model (MFdiff) for addressing these challenges for high-quality PET restoration. Firstly, to fully utilize auxiliary MR images without introducing extraneous details in the restored image, a multi-modality feature fusion module is designed to learn an optimized fusion feature. Secondly, using the fusion feature as an additional condition, high-quality SPET images are iteratively generated based on the diffusion model. Furthermore, we introduce a two-stage supervise-assisted learning strategy that harnesses both generalized priors from simulated in-distribution datasets and specific priors tailored to in-vivo OOD data. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed MFdiff effectively restores high-quality SPET images from multi-modality inputs and outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

TL;DR: Proposes a generative compression framework for perception-based image denoising using entropy-coded latent representations and generative decoders to balance distortion, perception, and rate trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional distortion-driven denoising methods often produce over-smoothed reconstructions, especially under strong noise and distribution shift, failing to preserve perceptual realism and structural details.

Method: Two complementary approaches: (1) conditional Wasserstein GAN-based compression denoiser with explicit RDP trade-off control, and (2) conditional diffusion-based reconstruction with iterative denoising guided by compressed latents using LPIPS loss and Wasserstein distance.

Result: Establishes non-asymptotic guarantees for compression-based maximum-likelihood denoiser under additive Gaussian noise, with experiments showing consistent perceptual improvements while maintaining competitive distortion performance on synthetic and real-noise benchmarks.

Conclusion: The generative compression framework effectively addresses the limitations of distortion-only denoising by balancing rate, distortion, and perception trade-offs, achieving better perceptual quality without sacrificing distortion performance.

Abstract: Image denoising aims to remove noise while preserving structural details and perceptual realism, yet distortion-driven methods often produce over-smoothed reconstructions, especially under strong noise and distribution shift. This paper proposes a generative compression framework for perception-based denoising, where restoration is achieved by reconstructing from entropy-coded latent representations that enforce low-complexity structure, while generative decoders recover realistic textures via perceptual measures such as learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) loss and Wasserstein distance. Two complementary instantiations are introduced: (i) a conditional Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)-based compression denoiser that explicitly controls the rate-distortion-perception (RDP) trade-off, and (ii) a conditional diffusion-based reconstruction strategy that performs iterative denoising guided by compressed latents. We further establish non-asymptotic guarantees for the compression-based maximum-likelihood denoiser under additive Gaussian noise, including bounds on reconstruction error and decoding error probability. Experiments on synthetic and real-noise benchmarks demonstrate consistent perceptual improvements while maintaining competitive distortion performance.

Motivation: Current video diffusion models struggle with ultra-high-resolution video generation due to compounded difficulties in motion modeling, semantic planning, and detail synthesis, despite improvements in visual quality.

Method: Three-stage architecture: 1) Low-resolution motion generation for motion-consistent latent synthesis, 2) Video latent upsampling in latent space to reduce memory/computational overhead, 3) High-resolution content refinement using low-frequency and high-frequency experts for semantic coherence and fine-grained details.

Conclusion: LUVE successfully addresses UHR video generation challenges through its latent-cascaded framework with dual frequency experts, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in generating high-quality ultra-high-resolution videos.

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have significantly improved visual quality, yet ultra-high-resolution (UHR) video generation remains a formidable challenge due to the compounded difficulties of motion modeling, semantic planning, and detail synthesis. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{LUVE}, a \textbf{L}atent-cascaded \textbf{U}HR \textbf{V}ideo generation framework built upon dual frequency \textbf{E}xperts. LUVE employs a three-stage architecture comprising low-resolution motion generation for motion-consistent latent synthesis, video latent upsampling that performs resolution upsampling directly in the latent space to mitigate memory and computational overhead, and high-resolution content refinement that integrates low-frequency and high-frequency experts to jointly enhance semantic coherence and fine-grained detail generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LUVE achieves superior photorealism and content fidelity in UHR video generation, and comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component.

TL;DR: FlowAdapt is a parameter-efficient domain adaptation framework for V2X collaborative perception that uses optimal transport theory to address redundancy and semantic degradation with only 1% trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct application of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) to multi-agent V2X collaborative perception leads to significant performance degradation and training instability due to inter-frame redundancy in heterogeneous sensory streams and erosion of fine-grained semantics in deep-layer representations.

Method: FlowAdapt uses optimal transport theory with two key components: 1) Wasserstein Greedy Sampling to selectively filter redundant samples via bounded covering radius, and 2) Progressive Knowledge Transfer module to progressively inject compressed early-stage representations into later stages through learnable pathways.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with only 1% of trainable parameters, effectively bridging domain gaps with superior sample efficiency and generalization.

Conclusion: FlowAdapt provides an effective parameter-efficient framework for fast domain adaptation in V2X collaborative perception, addressing key challenges of redundancy and semantic degradation while maintaining high performance with minimal trainable parameters.

Abstract: Fast domain adaptation remains a fundamental challenge for deploying multi-agent systems across diverse environments in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) collaborative perception. Despite the success of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) in natural language processing and conventional vision tasks, directly applying PEFT to multi-agent settings leads to significant performance degradation and training instability. In this work, we conduct a detailed analysis and identify two key factors: (i) inter-frame redundancy in heterogeneous sensory streams, and (ii) erosion of fine-grained semantics in deep-layer representations under PEFT adaptation. To address these issues, we propose FlowAdapt, a parameter-efficient framework grounded in optimal transport theory, which minimizes information transport costs across both data distributions and network hierarchies. Specifically, we introduce a Wasserstein Greedy Sampling strategy to selectively filter redundant samples via a bounded covering radius. Furthermore, Progressive Knowledge Transfer module is designed to progressively inject compressed early-stage representations into later stages through learnable pathways, alleviating semantic degradation in late-stage adaptation. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that FlowAdapt achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1% of trainable parameters, effectively bridging domain gaps with superior sample efficiency and generalization.

TL;DR: Proposes LLM-DRS framework that uses Large Language Models to generate comprehensive disaster reconnaissance reports from vision-based structural health monitoring data, moving beyond discrete outputs to automated summary generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional vision-based SHM only produces discrete outputs (damage labels, coordinates) requiring manual analysis. LLMs offer new potential to automate comprehensive report generation for post-disaster reconnaissance.

Method: LLM-DRS framework with standardized reconnaissance plan, unified data format, deep CNN extraction of damage attributes (state, material, level), and LLM integration with carefully designed prompts to generate summary reports.

Result: Framework demonstrates promising potential for improving built environment resilience through effective rapid post-disaster reconnaissance by automating comprehensive report generation.

Conclusion: Integrating LLMs into vision-based SHM enables automated disaster reconnaissance summarization, moving beyond discrete outputs to comprehensive reporting that supports better decision-making for structural assessment.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-aided vision-based Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has emerged as an effective approach for monitoring and assessing structural condition by analyzing image and video data. By integrating Computer Vision (CV) and Deep Learning (DL), vision-based SHM can automatically identify and localize visual patterns associated with structural damage. However, previous works typically generate only discrete outputs, such as damage class labels and damage region coordinates, requiring engineers to further reorganize and analyze these results for evaluation and decision-making. In late 2022, Large Language Models (LLMs) became popular across multiple fields, providing new insights into AI-aided vision-based SHM. In this study, a novel LLM-based Disaster Reconnaissance Summarization (LLM-DRS) framework is proposed. It introduces a standard reconnaissance plan in which the collection of vision data and corresponding metadata follows a well-designed on-site investigation process. Text-based metadata and image-based vision data are then processed and integrated into a unified format, where well-trained Deep Convolutional Neural Networks extract key attributes, including damage state, material type, and damage level. Finally, all data are fed into an LLM with carefully designed prompts, enabling the LLM-DRS to generate summary reports for individual structures or affected regions based on aggregated attributes and metadata. Results show that integrating LLMs into vision-based SHM, particularly for rapid post-disaster reconnaissance, demonstrates promising potential for improving resilience of the built environment through effective reconnaissance.

TL;DR: PLOT-CT is a novel CT reconstruction framework that uses Voronoi decomposition on pre-log sinograms to separate data components, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 2.36dB PSNR improvement over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-dose CT reconstruction faces severe noise and data fidelity issues under reduced radiation. Existing methods in image or post-log domains fail to exploit pre-log structural information while being highly susceptible to noise amplification from logarithmic transformation.

Method: PLOT-CT applies Voronoi decomposition to pre-log sinograms to disentangle data into distinct underlying components, which are embedded in separate latent spaces. This explicit decomposition enhances learning of discriminative features and improves reconstruction accuracy by mitigating noise while preserving pre-log domain information.

Result: Extensive experiments show PLOT-CT achieves state-of-the-art performance with 2.36dB PSNR improvement over traditional methods at the 1e4 incident photon level in the pre-log domain.

Conclusion: The proposed PLOT-CT framework successfully overcomes challenges in low-dose CT reconstruction by leveraging pre-log domain information through Voronoi decomposition, significantly improving reconstruction accuracy and noise mitigation compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reconstruction is fundamentally challenged by severe noise and compromised data fidelity under reduced radiation exposure. Most existing methods operate either in the image or post-log projection domain, which fails to fully exploit the rich structural information in pre-log measurements while being highly susceptible to noise. The requisite logarithmic transformation critically amplifies noise within these data, imposing exceptional demands on reconstruction precision. To overcome these challenges, we propose PLOT-CT, a novel framework for Pre-Log vOronoi decomposiTion-assisted CT generation. Our method begins by applying Voronoi decomposition to pre-log sinograms, disentangling the data into distinct underlying components, which are embedded in separate latent spaces. This explicit decomposition significantly enhances the model's capacity to learn discriminative features, directly improving reconstruction accuracy by mitigating noise and preserving information inherent in the pre-log domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PLOT-CT achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining a 2.36dB PSNR improvement over traditional methods at the 1e4 incident photon level in the pre-log domain.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PLESS improves scribble-based medical image segmentation by enhancing pseudo-labels through hierarchical region partitioning and scribble information propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scribble annotations reduce labeling costs but suffer from noisy/incomplete supervision. Existing pseudo-label methods are limited by poor pseudo-label quality.

Method: PLESS uses hierarchical partitioning to create spatially coherent regions, then propagates scribble information within semantically coherent areas to refine pseudo-labels.

Result: Consistent improvements in segmentation accuracy across four scribble-supervised algorithms on two cardiac MRI datasets (ACDC and MSCMRseg).

Conclusion: PLESS is a model-agnostic pseudo-label enhancement strategy that improves reliability and spatial consistency for scribble-based medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Weakly supervised learning with scribble annotations uses sparse user-drawn strokes to indicate segmentation labels on a small subset of pixels. This annotation reduces the cost of dense pixel-wise labeling, but suffers inherently from noisy and incomplete supervision. Recent scribble-based approaches in medical image segmentation address this limitation using pseudo-label-based training; however, the quality of the pseudo-labels remains a key performance limit. We propose PLESS, a generic pseudo-label enhancement strategy which improves reliability and spatial consistency. It builds on a hierarchical partitioning of the image into a hierarchy of spatially coherent regions. PLESS propagates scribble information to refine pseudo-labels within semantically coherent regions. The framework is model-agnostic and easily integrates into existing pseudo-label methods. Experiments on two public cardiac MRI datasets (ACDC and MSCMRseg) across four scribble-supervised algorithms show consistent improvements in segmentation accuracy. Code will be made available on GitHub upon acceptance.

TL;DR: ScalSelect is a scalable, training-free multimodal data selection method for vision-language models that achieves near-full performance with only 16% of data using linear-time complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale visual instruction tuning is computationally expensive due to data redundancy, but existing data selection methods are either costly (requiring training/gradient computation) or limited by proxy dependencies, quadratic complexity, and poor scalability.

Method: ScalSelect constructs sample representations by extracting visual features most attended by instruction tokens in the target VLM, then identifies samples whose representations best approximate the dominant subspace of the full dataset representations, enabling scalable importance scoring without pairwise comparisons.

Result: Extensive experiments show ScalSelect achieves over 97.5% of full dataset performance using only 16% of data, and even outperforms full-data training in some settings, across multiple VLMs, datasets, and selection budgets.

Conclusion: ScalSelect provides an efficient, scalable solution for multimodal data selection that eliminates the need for external models, auxiliary datasets, or costly training while maintaining high performance with minimal data.

Abstract: Large-scale Visual Instruction Tuning (VIT) has become a key paradigm for advancing the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) across various multimodal tasks. However, training on the large-scale datasets is computationally expensive and inefficient due to redundancy in the data, which motivates the need for multimodal data selection to improve training efficiency. Existing data selection methods for VIT either require costly training or gradient computation. Training-free alternatives often depend on proxy models or datasets, instruction-agnostic representations, and pairwise similarity with quadratic complexity, limiting scalability and representation fidelity. In this work, we propose ScalSelect, a scalable training-free multimodal data selection method with linear-time complexity with respect to the number of samples, eliminating the need for external models or auxiliary datasets. ScalSelect first constructs sample representations by extracting visual features most attended by instruction tokens in the target VLM, capturing instruction-relevant information. It then identifies samples whose representations best approximate the dominant subspace of the full dataset representations, enabling scalable importance scoring without pairwise comparisons. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs, datasets, and selection budgets demonstrate that ScalSelect achieves over 97.5% of the performance of training on the full dataset using only 16% of the data, and even outperforms full-data training in some settings.

Motivation: Current implicit shape representation methods using SDFs and Eikonal PDEs have limitations in capturing high-frequency details. The authors propose using Poisson's equation as an alternative proxy PDE to overcome these limitations.

Method: Encode surface reconstruction as solution to Poisson's equation, use Green's functions to obtain closed-form parametric expression, leverage linearity of Poisson's equation to find implicit field as superposition of solutions.

Result: Improved results in approximating high-frequency details, even with a small number of shape priors.

Conclusion: Poisson's equation provides an effective alternative to Eikonal equation for surface reconstruction, enabling better detail preservation through Green's functions and superposition principles.

Abstract: Implicit shape representation, such as SDFs, is a popular approach to recover the surface of a 3D shape as the level sets of a scalar field. Several methods approximate SDFs using machine learning strategies that exploit the knowledge that SDFs are solutions of the Eikonal partial differential equation (PDEs). In this work, we present a novel approach to surface reconstruction by encoding it as a solution to a proxy PDE, namely Poisson's equation. Then, we explore the connection between Poisson's equation and physics, e.g., the electrostatic potential due to a positive charge density. We employ Green's functions to obtain a closed-form parametric expression for the PDE's solution, and leverage the linearity of our proxy PDE to find the target shape's implicit field as a superposition of solutions. Our method shows improved results in approximating high-frequency details, even with a small number of shape priors.

*Ryan Deem,Garrett Goodman,Waqas Majeed,Md Abdullah Al Hafiz Khan,Michail S. Alexiou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Brain tumor classification models (BrainNet, BrainNeXt, DilationNet) show varying adversarial robustness to FGSM/PGD attacks, with BrainNeXt most robust but producing weaker transferable attacks, while shrunk non-augmented data reduces resilience despite high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial robustness in deep learning models for brain tumor classification is underexplored but critical for clinical deployment, especially with MRI data where reliability is essential.

Method: Evaluated three ResNet-based architectures (BrainNet, BrainNeXt, DilationNet) against gradient-based attacks (FGSM, PGD) across three preprocessing configurations: full-sized augmented, shrunk augmented, and shrunk non-augmented MRI datasets.

Result: BrainNeXt models showed highest robustness to black-box attacks (likely due to increased cardinality) but produced weaker transferable adversarial samples. BrainNet and Dilation models were more vulnerable to attacks from each other, especially under PGD with higher iterations. Shrunk non-augmented data significantly reduced model resilience despite high untampered test accuracy.

Conclusion: Joint evaluation of classification performance and adversarial robustness is crucial for reliable real-world deployment in brain MRI analysis, highlighting trade-offs between input resolution and adversarial vulnerability.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in deep learning models for brain tumor classification remains an underexplored yet critical challenge, particularly for clinical deployment scenarios involving MRI data. In this work, we investigate the susceptibility and resilience of several ResNet-based architectures, referred to as BrainNet, BrainNeXt and DilationNet, against gradient-based adversarial attacks, namely FGSM and PGD. These models, based on ResNet, ResNeXt, and dilated ResNet variants respectively, are evaluated across three preprocessing configurations (i) full-sized augmented, (ii) shrunk augmented and (iii) shrunk non-augmented MRI datasets. Our experiments reveal that BrainNeXt models exhibit the highest robustness to black-box attacks, likely due to their increased cardinality, though they produce weaker transferable adversarial samples. In contrast, BrainNet and Dilation models are more vulnerable to attacks from each other, especially under PGD with higher iteration steps and $α$ values. Notably, shrunk and non-augmented data significantly reduce model resilience, even when the untampered test accuracy remains high, highlighting a key trade-off between input resolution and adversarial vulnerability. These results underscore the importance of jointly evaluating classification performance and adversarial robustness for reliable real-world deployment in brain MRI analysis.

*Mengxiao Geng,Zijie Chen,Ran Hong,Bingxuan Li,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GR-Diffusion integrates 3D discrete Gaussian representation with diffusion models for improved low-dose whole-body PET reconstruction, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PET reconstruction faces challenges with noise amplification, structural blurring, and detail loss due to sparse sampling and ill-posed inverse problems. Existing methods have low-pass limitations that need to be overcome.

Method: Proposes GR-Diffusion framework that synergistically integrates geometric priors from 3D discrete Gaussian representation (GR) with diffusion models. GR generates a reference 3D PET image from projection data, which serves as dual guidance during diffusion. Uses hierarchical guidance: fine-grained guidance leverages differences to refine local details, while coarse-grained guidance uses multi-scale difference maps to correct deviations.

Result: Experimental results on UDPET and Clinical datasets with varying dose levels show that GR-Diffusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enhancing 3D whole-body PET image quality and preserving physiological details.

Conclusion: GR-Diffusion effectively integrates geometric priors from GR with diffusion models for superior PET reconstruction, overcoming limitations of conventional methods and recovering sub-voxel information.

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction is a critical challenge in molecular imaging, often hampered by noise amplification, structural blurring, and detail loss due to sparse sampling and the ill-posed nature of inverse problems. The three-dimensional discrete Gaussian representation (GR), which efficiently encodes 3D scenes using parameterized discrete Gaussian distributions, has shown promise in computer vision. In this work, we pro-pose a novel GR-Diffusion framework that synergistically integrates the geometric priors of GR with the generative power of diffusion models for 3D low-dose whole-body PET reconstruction. GR-Diffusion employs GR to generate a reference 3D PET image from projection data, establishing a physically grounded and structurally explicit benchmark that overcomes the low-pass limitations of conventional point-based or voxel-based methods. This reference image serves as a dual guide during the diffusion process, ensuring both global consistency and local accuracy. Specifically, we employ a hierarchical guidance mechanism based on the GR reference. Fine-grained guidance leverages differences to refine local details, while coarse-grained guidance uses multi-scale difference maps to correct deviations. This strategy allows the diffusion model to sequentially integrate the strong geometric prior from GR and recover sub-voxel information. Experimental results on the UDPET and Clinical datasets with varying dose levels show that GR-Diffusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enhancing 3D whole-body PET image quality and preserving physiological details.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SToRM is a supervised token reduction framework for multi-modal LLMs in autonomous driving that maintains performance while reducing computational costs by up to 30x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end driving systems using MLLMs for human-vehicle interaction require substantial computational resources due to LLM reliance and numerous visual tokens from sensor inputs, which are limited in autonomous vehicles. Existing token reduction methods often suffer performance degradation.

Method: Proposes SToRM framework with three key elements: 1) lightweight importance predictor with sliding windows to estimate token importance, 2) supervised training using auxiliary path for pseudo-supervision from all-token LLM, 3) anchor-context merging module that partitions tokens and merges context tokens into relevant anchors to reduce redundancy.

Result: Experiments on LangAuto benchmark show SToRM outperforms state-of-the-art E2E driving MLLMs under same reduced-token budget, maintaining all-token performance while reducing computational cost by up to 30x.

Conclusion: SToRM enables efficient end-to-end driving while maintaining performance comparable to using all tokens, addressing computational limitations in autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: In autonomous driving, end-to-end (E2E) driving systems that predict control commands directly from sensor data have achieved significant advancements. For safe driving in unexpected scenarios, these systems may additionally rely on human interventions such as natural language instructions. Using a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) facilitates human-vehicle interaction and can improve performance in such scenarios. However, this approach requires substantial computational resources due to its reliance on an LLM and numerous visual tokens from sensor inputs, which are limited in autonomous vehicles. Many MLLM studies have explored reducing visual tokens, but often suffer end-task performance degradation compared to using all tokens.
  To enable efficient E2E driving while maintaining performance comparable to using all tokens, this paper proposes the first Supervised Token Reduction framework for multi-modal LLMs (SToRM). The proposed framework consists of three key elements. First, a lightweight importance predictor with short-term sliding windows estimates token importance scores. Second, a supervised training approach uses an auxiliary path to obtain pseudo-supervision signals from an all-token LLM pass. Third, an anchor-context merging module partitions tokens into anchors and context tokens, and merges context tokens into relevant anchors to reduce redundancy while minimizing information loss. Experiments on the LangAuto benchmark show that SToRM outperforms state-of-the-art E2E driving MLLMs under the same reduced-token budget, maintaining all-token performance while reducing computational cost by up to 30x.

Motivation: Current generative methods for VR content creation fail to capture nuanced emotional semantics and lack fine-grained control needed for immersive experiences, limiting the creation of emotionally rich VR content.

Method: Uses hierarchical emotion representation with learnable prototypes that evolve during training, and a controllable generation pipeline with multi-prototype guidance, temporal blending, and attention reweighting for emotional control without explicit labels.

Conclusion: EmoSpace facilitates immersive visual content generation with fine-grained emotion control, supporting applications in therapy, education, storytelling, artistic creation, and cultural preservation.

Abstract: Emotion is important for creating compelling virtual reality (VR) content. Although some generative methods have been applied to lower the barrier to creating emotionally rich content, they fail to capture the nuanced emotional semantics and the fine-grained control essential for immersive experiences. To address these limitations, we introduce EmoSpace, a novel framework for emotion-aware content generation that learns dynamic, interpretable emotion prototypes through vision-language alignment. We employ a hierarchical emotion representation with rich learnable prototypes that evolve during training, enabling fine-grained emotional control without requiring explicit emotion labels. We develop a controllable generation pipeline featuring multi-prototype guidance, temporal blending, and attention reweighting that supports diverse applications, including emotional image outpainting, stylized generation, and emotional panorama generation for VR environments. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of EmoSpace over existing methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Additionally, we present a comprehensive user study investigating how VR environments affect emotional perception compared to desktop settings. Our work facilitates immersive visual content generation with fine-grained emotion control and supports applications like therapy, education, storytelling, artistic creation, and cultural preservation. Code and models will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Clutt3R-Seg is a zero-shot 3D instance segmentation pipeline for language-grounded robotic grasping in cluttered scenes, using hierarchical instance trees to handle noisy masks and achieve robust segmentation with minimal views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D instance segmentation in cluttered environments suffers from occlusions, limited viewpoints, and noisy masks, degrading perception for language-grounded robotic manipulation tasks.

Method: Introduces hierarchical instance tree of semantic cues that leverages noisy masks as informative cues through cross-view grouping and conditional substitution. Uses open-vocabulary semantic embeddings for language grounding and consistency-aware updates for multi-stage tasks.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cluttered and sparse-view scenarios. Achieves AP@25 of 61.66 on heavy-clutter sequences (2.2x higher than baselines). With only 4 input views, surpasses MaskClustering with 8 views by more than 2x.

Conclusion: Clutt3R-Seg provides robust 3D instance segmentation for language-grounded grasping in cluttered scenes, handling noisy masks effectively and enabling efficient adaptation to scene changes with minimal views.

Abstract: Reliable 3D instance segmentation is fundamental to language-grounded robotic manipulation. Its critical application lies in cluttered environments, where occlusions, limited viewpoints, and noisy masks degrade perception. To address these challenges, we present Clutt3R-Seg, a zero-shot pipeline for robust 3D instance segmentation for language-grounded grasping in cluttered scenes. Our key idea is to introduce a hierarchical instance tree of semantic cues. Unlike prior approaches that attempt to refine noisy masks, our method leverages them as informative cues: through cross-view grouping and conditional substitution, the tree suppresses over- and under-segmentation, yielding view-consistent masks and robust 3D instances. Each instance is enriched with open-vocabulary semantic embeddings, enabling accurate target selection from natural language instructions. To handle scene changes during multi-stage tasks, we further introduce a consistency-aware update that preserves instance correspondences from only a single post-interaction image, allowing efficient adaptation without rescanning. Clutt3R-Seg is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and validated on a real robot. Across all settings, it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cluttered and sparse-view scenarios. Even on the most challenging heavy-clutter sequences, Clutt3R-Seg achieves an AP@25 of 61.66, over 2.2x higher than baselines, and with only four input views it surpasses MaskClustering with eight views by more than 2x.

TL;DR: Introduces neck-mounted view gaze estimation task, collects first dataset, evaluates transformer model with gaze out-of-bound classification and multi-view co-learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior egocentric gaze estimation focuses mainly on head-mounted cameras, leaving alternative viewpoints like neck-mounted cameras underexplored, creating a gap in gaze estimation research.

Method: Collects first neck-mounted gaze dataset (4 hours from 8 participants), evaluates GLC transformer model, proposes two extensions: auxiliary gaze out-of-bound classification task and multi-view co-learning with geometry-aware auxiliary loss.

Result: Gaze out-of-bound classification improves performance over standard fine-tuning, but multi-view co-learning approach does not yield gains. Analysis provides insights for neck-mounted gaze estimation.

Conclusion: Neck-mounted gaze estimation is a viable new task, with gaze out-of-bound classification showing promise but multi-view co-learning needing further investigation. The dataset enables future research in this underexplored area.

Abstract: This paper introduces neck-mounted view gaze estimation, a new task that estimates user gaze from the neck-mounted camera perspective. Prior work on egocentric gaze estimation, which predicts device wearer's gaze location within the camera's field of view, mainly focuses on head-mounted cameras while alternative viewpoints remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we collect the first dataset for this task, consisting of approximately 4 hours of video collected from 8 participants during everyday activities. We evaluate a transformer-based gaze estimation model, GLC, on the new dataset and propose two extensions: an auxiliary gaze out-of-bound classification task and a multi-view co-learning approach that jointly trains head-view and neck-view models using a geometry-aware auxiliary loss. Experimental results show that incorporating gaze out-of-bound classification improves performance over standard fine-tuning, while the co-learning approach does not yield gains. We further analyze these results and discuss implications for neck-mounted gaze estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed latent space fusion model successfully balances accuracy and efficiency in lightweight setting, making it suitable for real-time wildfire prediction in resource-limited environments.

Abstract: We developed a lightweight and computationally efficient tool for next-day wildfire spread prediction using multimodal satellite data as input. The deep learning model, which we call Transform Domain Fusion UNet (TD-FusionUNet), incorporates trainable Hadamard Transform and Discrete Cosine Transform layers that apply two-dimensional transforms, enabling the network to capture essential "frequency" components in orthogonalized latent spaces. Additionally, we introduce custom preprocessing techniques, including random margin cropping and a Gaussian mixture model, to enrich the representation of the sparse pre-fire masks and enhance the model's generalization capability. The TD-FusionUNet is evaluated on two datasets which are the Next-Day Wildfire Spread dataset released by Google Research in 2023, and WildfireSpreadTS dataset. Our proposed TD-FusionUNet achieves an F1 score of 0.591 with 370k parameters, outperforming the UNet baseline using ResNet18 as the encoder reported in the WildfireSpreadTS dataset while using substantially fewer parameters. These results show that the proposed latent space fusion model balances accuracy and efficiency under a lightweight setting, making it suitable for real time wildfire prediction applications in resource limited environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based 3D scene generation lacks domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design, leading to reduced control and poor scalability for agricultural simulation environments.

Method: Developed modular multi-LLM pipeline integrating 3D asset retrieval, domain knowledge injection, and Unreal Engine code generation via API. Uses hybrid LLM optimization (few-shot prompting, RAG, finetuning, validation) for structured data handling and intermediate verification.

Result: System generates realistic agricultural environments from prompts. User study shows good realism/familiarity vs real images. Expert comparison demonstrates significant time savings over manual scene design. Multi-LLM approach improves reliability and precision.

Conclusion: Multi-LLM pipelines effectively automate domain-specific 3D scene generation with improved reliability. Future work includes expanding asset hierarchy, real-time generation, and adapting pipeline to other simulation domains beyond agriculture.

Abstract: Procedural generation techniques in 3D rendering engines have revolutionized the creation of complex environments, reducing reliance on manual design. Recent approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) for 3D scene generation show promise but often lack domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design. These limitations lead to reduced control and poor scalability. This paper investigates the use of LLMs to generate agricultural synthetic simulation environments from natural language prompts, specifically to address the limitations of lacking domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design. A modular multi-LLM pipeline was developed, integrating 3D asset retrieval, domain knowledge injection, and code generation for the Unreal rendering engine using its API. This results in a 3D environment with realistic planting layouts and environmental context, all based on the input prompt and the domain knowledge. To enhance accuracy and scalability, the system employs a hybrid strategy combining LLM optimization techniques such as few-shot prompting, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), finetuning, and validation. Unlike monolithic models, the modular architecture enables structured data handling, intermediate verification, and flexible expansion. The system was evaluated using structured prompts and semantic accuracy metrics. A user study assessed realism and familiarity against real-world images, while an expert comparison demonstrated significant time savings over manual scene design. The results confirm the effectiveness of multi-LLM pipelines in automating domain-specific 3D scene generation with improved reliability and precision. Future work will explore expanding the asset hierarchy, incorporating real-time generation, and adapting the pipeline to other simulation domains beyond agriculture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-shape retrieval methods require canonical poses and support few object categories, limiting real-world applicability where objects belong to diverse classes and appear in random orientations.

Method: Proposes RI-Mamba with global/local reference frames to disentangle pose from geometry, Hilbert sorting for structured token sequences, orientational embeddings with feature-wise linear modulation, and cross-modal contrastive learning with automated triplet generation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on OmniObject3D benchmark across 200+ object categories under arbitrary orientations, demonstrating superior representational capacity and robustness.

Conclusion: RI-Mamba effectively addresses rotation invariance in 3D shape retrieval, enabling practical applications with diverse object categories and random orientations through efficient linear-time processing.

Abstract: 3D assets have rapidly expanded in quantity and diversity due to the growing popularity of virtual reality and gaming. As a result, text-to-shape retrieval has become essential in facilitating intuitive search within large repositories. However, existing methods require canonical poses and support few object categories, limiting their real-world applicability where objects can belong to diverse classes and appear in random orientations. To address this challenge, we propose RI-Mamba, the first rotation-invariant state-space model for point clouds. RI-Mamba defines global and local reference frames to disentangle pose from geometry and uses Hilbert sorting to construct token sequences with meaningful geometric structure while maintaining rotation invariance. We further introduce a novel strategy to compute orientational embeddings and reintegrate them via feature-wise linear modulation, effectively recovering spatial context and enhancing model expressiveness. Our strategy is inherently compatible with state-space models and operates in linear time. To scale up retrieval, we adopt cross-modal contrastive learning with automated triplet generation, allowing training on diverse datasets without manual annotation. Extensive experiments demonstrate RI-Mamba's superior representational capacity and robustness, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the OmniObject3D benchmark across more than 200 object categories under arbitrary orientations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SLAM methods either couple tracking and mapping with unified scenes (high computational cost) or loosely integrate them with structured tracking frameworks (introducing redundancies). The authors aim to create a more efficient real-time system that avoids these limitations.

Method: The method uses bidirectional coupling between Visual Odometry and Gaussian Splatting within an Expectation-Maximization framework for joint optimization. It also introduces Gaussian Splat Initialization that leverages VO outputs (image info, keyframe poses, pixel associations) to create close approximations to the final Gaussian scene, eliminating heuristic methods.

Result: The system operates in real-time and achieves state-of-the-art performance in both geometric/photometric fidelity of reconstructed scenes and tracking accuracy, as validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: GSO-SLAM successfully demonstrates that bidirectional coupling of VO and GS through an EM framework enables real-time dense SLAM with superior reconstruction quality and tracking accuracy while avoiding computational overhead and heuristic initialization methods.

Abstract: We propose GSO-SLAM, a real-time monocular dense SLAM system that leverages Gaussian scene representation. Unlike existing methods that couple tracking and mapping with a unified scene, incurring computational costs, or loosely integrate them with well-structured tracking frameworks, introducing redundancies, our method bidirectionally couples Visual Odometry (VO) and Gaussian Splatting (GS). Specifically, our approach formulates joint optimization within an Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework, enabling the simultaneous refinement of VO-derived semi-dense depth estimates and the GS representation without additional computational overhead. Moreover, we present Gaussian Splat Initialization, which utilizes image information, keyframe poses, and pixel associations from VO to produce close approximations to the final Gaussian scene, thereby eliminating the need for heuristic methods. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our method, showing that it not only operates in real time but also achieves state-of-the-art geometric/photometric fidelity of the reconstructed scene and tracking accuracy.

TL;DR: A semantically conditioned latent diffusion model generates realistic synthetic cerebral DSA images with explicit control over anatomy and C-arm positions, achieving high clinical realism scores and low FID metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DSA is crucial for cerebrovascular disease but is invasive and expensive, limiting large-scale data collection and public sharing. There's a need for realistic synthetic DSA data for research and training purposes.

Method: Developed a semantically conditioned latent diffusion model (LDM) trained on 99,349 DSA frames from a single-center dataset. Used text embeddings to encode anatomical circulation (anterior vs. posterior) and C-arm positions for explicit control over image generation.

Result: Generated images received Likert scores of 3.1-3.3 from medical experts with high inter-rater reliability (ICC 0.80-0.87). Achieved low median Fréchet inception distance of 15.27, indicating strong distributional similarity to real DSA frames.

Conclusion: Semantically controlled LDMs can produce clinically realistic synthetic DSA images suitable for downstream algorithm development, research, and training applications.

Abstract: Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) plays a central role in the diagnosis and treatment of cerebrovascular disease, yet its invasive nature and high acquisition cost severely limit large-scale data collection and public data sharing. Therefore, we developed a semantically conditioned latent diffusion model (LDM) that synthesizes arterial-phase cerebral DSA frames under explicit control of anatomical circulation (anterior vs.\ posterior) and canonical C-arm positions. We curated a large single-centre DSA dataset of 99,349 frames and trained a conditional LDM using text embeddings that encoded anatomy and acquisition geometry. To assess clinical realism, four medical experts, including two neuroradiologists, one neurosurgeon, and one internal medicine expert, systematically rated 400 synthetic DSA images using a 5-grade Likert scale for evaluating proximal large, medium, and small peripheral vessels. The generated images achieved image-wise overall Likert scores ranging from 3.1 to 3.3, with high inter-rater reliability (ICC(2,k) = 0.80--0.87). Distributional similarity to real DSA frames was supported by a low median Fréchet inception distance (FID) of 15.27. Our results indicate that semantically controlled LDMs can produce realistic synthetic DSAs suitable for downstream algorithm development, research, and training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models suffer from low sample efficiency and limited generalization due to inadequate pretrained visual representations that fail to capture task-relevant environment information and effective policy priors.

Method: Introduces JEPA-VLA, which adaptively integrates predictive embeddings (specifically V-JEPA 2) into existing VLAs to leverage their ability to encode task-relevant temporal dynamics while discarding unpredictable environment factors.

Result: JEPA-VLA yields substantial performance gains across multiple benchmarks including LIBERO, LIBERO-plus, RoboTwin2.0, and real-robot tasks, demonstrating improved sample efficiency and generalization.

Conclusion: Predictive video embeddings effectively compensate for key shortcomings of existing visual representations in VLAs, and their integration through JEPA-VLA provides a simple yet effective approach to enhance robotic manipulation capabilities.

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models built upon pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved significant improvements in robotic manipulation. However, current VLAs still suffer from low sample efficiency and limited generalization. This paper argues that these limitations are closely tied to an overlooked component, pretrained visual representation, which offers insufficient knowledge on both aspects of environment understanding and policy prior. Through an in-depth analysis, we find that commonly used visual representations in VLAs, whether pretrained via language-image contrastive learning or image-based self-supervised learning, remain inadequate at capturing crucial, task-relevant environment information and at inducing effective policy priors, i.e., anticipatory knowledge of how the environment evolves under successful task execution. In contrast, we discover that predictive embeddings pretrained on videos, in particular V-JEPA 2, are adept at flexibly discarding unpredictable environment factors and encoding task-relevant temporal dynamics, thereby effectively compensating for key shortcomings of existing visual representations in VLAs. Building on these observations, we introduce JEPA-VLA, a simple yet effective approach that adaptively integrates predictive embeddings into existing VLAs. Our experiments demonstrate that JEPA-VLA yields substantial performance gains across a range of benchmarks, including LIBERO, LIBERO-plus, RoboTwin2.0, and real-robot tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian Splatting adaptations for CT struggle with severe artifacts under highly sparse-view projections and dynamic motions, requiring better regularization and temporal coherence handling.

Method: Uses multi-resolution hash encoder for spatial priors, time-conditioned representations with spatiotemporal attention for dynamic cases, and motion-flow network for respiratory motion tracking.

Result: Extensive experiments show TG-Field consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy under highly sparse-view conditions.

Conclusion: TG-Field effectively addresses sparse-view and dynamic CT reconstruction challenges through geometry-aware regularization and spatiotemporal modeling.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized 3D scene representation with superior efficiency and quality. While recent adaptations for computed tomography (CT) show promise, they struggle with severe artifacts under highly sparse-view projections and dynamic motions. To address these challenges, we propose Tomographic Geometry Field (TG-Field), a geometry-aware Gaussian deformation framework tailored for both static and dynamic CT reconstruction. A multi-resolution hash encoder is employed to capture local spatial priors, regularizing primitive parameters under ultra-sparse settings. We further extend the framework to dynamic reconstruction by introducing time-conditioned representations and a spatiotemporal attention block to adaptively aggregate features, thereby resolving spatiotemporal ambiguities and enforcing temporal coherence. In addition, a motion-flow network models fine-grained respiratory motion to track local anatomical deformations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that TG-Field consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy under highly sparse-view conditions.

Abstract: Generative models have advanced significantly in realistic image synthesis, with diffusion models excelling in quality and stability. Recent multi-view diffusion models improve 3D-aware street view generation, but they struggle to produce place-aware and background-consistent urban scenes from text, BEV maps, and object bounding boxes. This limits their effectiveness in generating realistic samples for place recognition tasks. To address these challenges, we propose DiffPlace, a novel framework that introduces a place-ID controller to enable place-controllable multi-view image generation. The place-ID controller employs linear projection, perceiver transformer, and contrastive learning to map place-ID embeddings into a fixed CLIP space, allowing the model to synthesize images with consistent background buildings while flexibly modifying foreground objects and weather conditions. Extensive experiments, including quantitative comparisons and augmented training evaluations, demonstrate that DiffPlace outperforms existing methods in both generation quality and training support for visual place recognition.

*Xiaowen Zhang,Zhi Gao,Licheng Jiao,Lingling Li,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STVG-R1: A reinforcement learning framework for spatial-temporal video grounding that reformulates coordinate prediction as instance-level ID assignment with visual prompts, achieving SOTA performance with strong zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs suffer from misalignment between textual descriptions and visual coordinates, causing severe hallucinations in dense prediction tasks like spatial-temporal video grounding. Existing approaches require additional trainable modules with high annotation costs and computational overhead.

Method: Proposes visual prompting paradigm that avoids coordinate alignment by reformulating per-frame coordinate prediction as instance-level ID assignment with unique, temporally consistent IDs embedded as visual prompts. Introduces STVG-R1, the first RL framework for STVG with task-driven reward optimizing temporal accuracy, spatial consistency, and structural format regularization.

Result: STVG-R1 surpasses baseline Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 20.9% m_IoU on HCSTVG-v2 benchmark, establishing new SOTA. Also shows strong zero-shot generalization to multi-object referring video object segmentation, achieving SOTA 47.3% J&F on MeViS.

Conclusion: The visual prompting paradigm effectively addresses coordinate-text misalignment in VLMs for dense prediction tasks, and the RL framework STVG-R1 demonstrates superior performance and generalization capabilities without requiring additional trainable modules.

Abstract: In vision-language models (VLMs), misalignment between textual descriptions and visual coordinates often induces hallucinations. This issue becomes particularly severe in dense prediction tasks such as spatial-temporal video grounding (STVG). Prior approaches typically focus on enhancing visual-textual alignment or attaching auxiliary decoders. However, these strategies inevitably introduce additional trainable modules, leading to significant annotation costs and computational overhead. In this work, we propose a novel visual prompting paradigm that avoids the difficult problem of aligning coordinates across modalities. Specifically, we reformulate per-frame coordinate prediction as a compact instance-level identification problem by assigning each object a unique, temporally consistent ID. These IDs are embedded into the video as visual prompts, providing explicit and interpretable inputs to the VLMs. Furthermore, we introduce STVG-R1, the first reinforcement learning framework for STVG, which employs a task-driven reward to jointly optimize temporal accuracy, spatial consistency, and structural format regularization. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. STVG-R1 surpasses the baseline Qwen2.5-VL-7B by a remarkable margin of 20.9% on m_IoU on the HCSTVG-v2 benchmark, establishing a new state of the art (SOTA). Surprisingly, STVG-R1 also exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to multi-object referring video object segmentation tasks, achieving a SOTA 47.3% J&F on MeViS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: E-commerce requires strong multimodal comprehension from text, images, and structured attributes, but general VLMs lack documented strategies for adapting to e-commerce's attribute-centric, multi-image, noisy nature without sacrificing general performance.

Method: Conducted large-scale experimental study on targeted adaptation of general VLMs for e-commerce, and proposed novel extensive evaluation suite covering deep product understanding, strict instruction following, and dynamic attribute extraction.

Abstract: E-commerce product understanding demands by nature, strong multimodal comprehension from text, images, and structured attributes. General-purpose Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable generalizable multimodal latent modelling, yet there is no documented, well-known strategy for adapting them to the attribute-centric, multi-image, and noisy nature of e-commerce data, without sacrificing general performance. In this work, we show through a large-scale experimental study, how targeted adaptation of general VLMs can substantially improve e-commerce performance while preserving broad multimodal capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a novel extensive evaluation suite covering deep product understanding, strict instruction following, and dynamic attribute extraction.

Abstract: We study object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and improve visual contrastive decoding (VCD) by constructing an object-aligned auxiliary view. We leverage object-centric attention in self-supervised Vision Transformers. In particular, we remove the most salient visual evidence to construct an auxiliary view that disrupts unsupported tokens and produces a stronger contrast signal. Our method is prompt-agnostic, model-agnostic, and can be seamlessly plugged into the existing VCD pipeline with little computation overhead, i.e., a single cacheable forward pass.

### [46] [Adaptive Debiasing Tsallis Entropy for Test-Time Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11743)
*Xiangyu Wu,Dongming Jiang,Feng Yu,Yueying Tian,Jiaqi Tang,Qing-Guo Chen,Yang Yang,Jianfeng Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADTE introduces Adaptive Debiasing Tsallis Entropy to address CLIP's pretraining bias in Test-Time Adaptation, outperforming Shannon Entropy methods on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP's pretraining on imbalanced web data creates built-in bias, making Shannon Entropy unreliable for measuring uncertainty in Test-Time Adaptation, leading to biased predictions.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Debiasing Tsallis Entropy (ADTE) that customizes class-specific parameters q^l by normalizing estimated label bias from test instances, enabling accurate high-confidence view selection and label adjustment without hyperparameter tuning.

Result: ADTE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet and its five variants, and achieves highest average performance on 10 cross-domain benchmarks across different model architectures and text prompts.

Conclusion: Tsallis Entropy and ADTE provide superior alternatives to Shannon Entropy for TTA, effectively addressing CLIP's pretraining bias and improving adaptation performance without additional modifications.

Abstract: Mainstream Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods for adapting vision-language models, e.g., CLIP, typically rely on Shannon Entropy (SE) at test time to measure prediction uncertainty and inconsistency. However, since CLIP has a built-in bias from pretraining on highly imbalanced web-crawled data, SE inevitably results in producing biased estimates of uncertainty entropy. To address this issue, we notably find and demonstrate that Tsallis Entropy (TE), a generalized form of SE, is naturally suited for characterizing biased distributions by introducing a non-extensive parameter q, with the performance of SE serving as a lower bound for TE. Building upon this, we generalize TE into Adaptive Debiasing Tsallis Entropy (ADTE) for TTA, customizing a class-specific parameter q^l derived by normalizing the estimated label bias from continuously incoming test instances, for each category. This adaptive approach allows ADTE to accurately select high-confidence views and seamlessly integrate with a label adjustment strategy to enhance adaptation, without introducing distribution-specific hyperparameter tuning. Besides, our investigation reveals that both TE and ADTE can serve as direct, advanced alternatives to SE in TTA, without any other modifications. Experimental results show that ADTE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet and its five variants, and achieves the highest average performance on 10 cross-domain benchmarks, regardless of the model architecture or text prompts used.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for 3D scene generation are static and lack dynamic fidelity. There's a need to move beyond visual plausibility to build world simulators grounded in physical laws, addressing challenges of multi-scale context entanglement and semantic-physical execution gaps in 4D dynamics generation.

Method: Code2Worlds formulates 4D generation as language-to-simulation code generation using: 1) dual-stream architecture disentangling retrieval-augmented object generation from hierarchical environmental orchestration, and 2) physics-aware closed-loop mechanism with PostProcess Agent scripting dynamics and VLM-Motion Critic performing self-reflection to iteratively refine simulation code.

Result: On the Code4D benchmark, Code2Worlds outperforms baselines with 41% SGS gain and 49% higher Richness, while uniquely generating physics-aware dynamics absent in prior static methods.

Conclusion: Code2Worlds successfully addresses the challenges of 4D dynamics generation by combining language-to-code formulation with physics-aware refinement, enabling the creation of world simulators that move beyond static visual plausibility to physically-grounded dynamic simulations.

Abstract: Achieving spatial intelligence requires moving beyond visual plausibility to build world simulators grounded in physical laws. While coding LLMs have advanced static 3D scene generation, extending this paradigm to 4D dynamics remains a critical frontier. This task presents two fundamental challenges: multi-scale context entanglement, where monolithic generation fails to balance local object structures with global environmental layouts; and a semantic-physical execution gap, where open-loop code generation leads to physical hallucinations lacking dynamic fidelity. We introduce Code2Worlds, a framework that formulates 4D generation as language-to-simulation code generation. First, we propose a dual-stream architecture that disentangles retrieval-augmented object generation from hierarchical environmental orchestration. Second, to ensure dynamic fidelity, we establish a physics-aware closed-loop mechanism in which a PostProcess Agent scripts dynamics, coupled with a VLM-Motion Critic that performs self-reflection to iteratively refine simulation code. Evaluations on the Code4D benchmark show Code2Worlds outperforms baselines with a 41% SGS gain and 49% higher Richness, while uniquely generating physics-aware dynamics absent in prior static methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based models struggle with 4D relighting due to scarcity of paired training data and difficulty maintaining temporal consistency across extreme viewpoints.

Method: Proposes Disentangled Flow Guidance for lighting control in latent space, and Temporal Consistent Attention with deterministic regularization to eliminate appearance flickering.

Result: Achieves competitive performance in temporal consistency and lighting fidelity, robustly handling camera rotations from -90 to 90 degrees.

Conclusion: Light4D provides an effective training-free solution for consistent 4D video relighting under target illumination, addressing key challenges in the field.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have established a new paradigm for image and video relighting. However, extending these capabilities to 4D relighting remains challenging, due primarily to the scarcity of paired 4D relighting training data and the difficulty of maintaining temporal consistency across extreme viewpoints. In this work, we propose Light4D, a novel training-free framework designed to synthesize consistent 4D videos under target illumination, even under extreme viewpoint changes. First, we introduce Disentangled Flow Guidance, a time-aware strategy that effectively injects lighting control into the latent space while preserving geometric integrity. Second, to reinforce temporal consistency, we develop Temporal Consistent Attention within the IC-Light architecture and further incorporate deterministic regularization to eliminate appearance flickering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance in temporal consistency and lighting fidelity, robustly handling camera rotations from -90 to 90.

TL;DR: Using 3D fractals as synthetic video data for action recognition pre-training, with a new Targeted Smart Filtering method that speeds up generation 100x and improves downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic datasets like Formula Driven Supervised Learning (FDSL) offer advantages over real data: infinite perfectly labeled data, no manual labor, and no privacy/ethical concerns. 3D fractals can be transformed into video sequences for action recognition pre-training.

Method: Generate 3D fractals using 3D Iterated Function Systems (IFS), temporally transform them into video sequences for pre-training. Propose Targeted Smart Filtering method to address slow generation speed and degenerate fractal issues while maintaining diversity important for downstream tasks.

Result: Targeted Smart Filtering achieves roughly 100 times faster sampling speed compared to standard methods and shows superior downstream performance in action recognition tasks compared to other 3D fractal filtering approaches.

Conclusion: 3D fractals can serve as effective synthetic pre-training data for action recognition when generated with appropriate filtering methods. Targeted Smart Filtering successfully addresses both speed and diversity challenges, making 3D fractal-based pre-training practical and effective.

Abstract: Synthetic datasets are being recognized in the deep learning realm as a valuable alternative to exhaustively labeled real data. One such synthetic data generation method is Formula Driven Supervised Learning (FDSL), which can provide an infinite number of perfectly labeled data through a formula driven approach, such as fractals or contours. FDSL does not have common drawbacks like manual labor, privacy and other ethical concerns. In this work we generate 3D fractals using 3D Iterated Function Systems (IFS) for pre-training an action recognition model. The fractals are temporally transformed to form a video that is used as a pre-training dataset for downstream task of action recognition. We find that standard methods of generating fractals are slow and produce degenerate 3D fractals. Therefore, we systematically explore alternative ways of generating fractals and finds that overly-restrictive approaches, while generating aesthetically pleasing fractals, are detrimental for downstream task performance. We propose a novel method, Targeted Smart Filtering, to address both the generation speed and fractal diversity issue. The method reports roughly 100 times faster sampling speed and achieves superior downstream performance against other 3D fractal filtering methods.

TL;DR: Proximal-Mean Inversion (PMI) improves Rectified-Flow inversion stability by using gradient correction with historical velocity averaging, plus mimic-CFG for better editing fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Rectified-Flow inversion methods suffer from approximation errors that accumulate across timesteps, leading to unstable velocity fields and degraded reconstruction/editing quality.

Method: Proposed PMI: training-free gradient correction method that stabilizes velocity field by guiding it toward running average of past velocities within theoretically derived spherical Gaussian. Also introduced mimic-CFG: lightweight velocity correction scheme for editing tasks that interpolates between current velocity and its projection onto historical average.

Result: Extensive experiments on PIE-Bench show significant improvements in inversion stability, image reconstruction quality, and editing fidelity while reducing required neural function evaluations. Achieves state-of-the-art performance on PIE-Bench with enhanced efficiency.

Conclusion: PMI and mimic-CFG provide theoretically sound approach to address inversion instability in Rectified-Flow models, enabling better reconstruction and editing with improved efficiency.

Abstract: Rectified-Flow (RF)-based generative models have recently emerged as strong alternatives to traditional diffusion models, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. By learning a continuous velocity field that transforms simple noise into complex data, RF-based models not only enable high-quality generation, but also support training-free inversion, which facilitates downstream tasks such as reconstruction and editing. However, existing inversion methods, such as vanilla RF-based inversion, suffer from approximation errors that accumulate across timesteps, leading to unstable velocity fields and degraded reconstruction and editing quality. To address this challenge, we propose Proximal-Mean Inversion (PMI), a training-free gradient correction method that stabilizes the velocity field by guiding it toward a running average of past velocities, constrained within a theoretically derived spherical Gaussian. Furthermore, we introduce mimic-CFG, a lightweight velocity correction scheme for editing tasks, which interpolates between the current velocity and its projection onto the historical average, balancing editing effectiveness and structural consistency. Extensive experiments on PIE-Bench demonstrate that our methods significantly improve inversion stability, image reconstruction quality, and editing fidelity, while reducing the required number of neural function evaluations. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PIE-Bench with enhanced efficiency and theoretical soundness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training method that internalizes zooming benefits into MLLMs via region-to-image distillation, eliminating need for iterative zooming at inference time while improving fine-grained perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with fine-grained perception where small evidence is overwhelmed by global context. Existing "Thinking-with-Images" methods require iterative zooming during inference, causing high latency from repeated tool calls and visual re-encoding.

Method: Region-to-Image Distillation: 1) Zoom into micro-cropped regions to let teacher models generate high-quality VQA data, 2) Distill region-grounded supervision back to full image, 3) Train student model on this data to internalize zooming benefits into single forward pass. Also introduce ZoomBench benchmark with 845 VQA data across six fine-grained perceptual dimensions.

Result: Models achieve leading performance across multiple fine-grained perception benchmarks, improve general multimodal cognition on visual reasoning and GUI agents, and eliminate need for tool use at inference time.

Conclusion: Region-to-Image Distillation successfully transforms zooming from inference-time tool to training-time primitive, enabling MLLMs to perform fine-grained perception in single forward pass while maintaining performance gains. Also provides analysis of when "Thinking-with-Images" is necessary vs. when gains can be distilled.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at broad visual understanding but still struggle with fine-grained perception, where decisive evidence is small and easily overwhelmed by global context. Recent "Thinking-with-Images" methods alleviate this by iteratively zooming in and out regions of interest during inference, but incur high latency due to repeated tool calls and visual re-encoding. To address this, we propose Region-to-Image Distillation, which transforms zooming from an inference-time tool into a training-time primitive, thereby internalizing the benefits of agentic zooming into a single forward pass of an MLLM. In particular, we first zoom in to micro-cropped regions to let strong teacher models generate high-quality VQA data, and then distill this region-grounded supervision back to the full image. After training on such data, the smaller student model improves "single-glance" fine-grained perception without tool use. To rigorously evaluate this capability, we further present ZoomBench, a hybrid-annotated benchmark of 845 VQA data spanning six fine-grained perceptual dimensions, together with a dual-view protocol that quantifies the global--regional "zooming gap". Experiments show that our models achieve leading performance across multiple fine-grained perception benchmarks, and also improve general multimodal cognition on benchmarks such as visual reasoning and GUI agents. We further discuss when "Thinking-with-Images" is necessary versus when its gains can be distilled into a single forward pass.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel ring artifact reduction method using an unrolled network that leverages intrinsic correlations between sinogram and image domains, trained on synthetic data to avoid costly real clinical data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing supervised deep learning methods for ring artifact reduction require expensive real clinical datasets and focus on either image or sinogram domain separately, ignoring CT geometry correlations.

Method: Reformulates ring artifact reduction as an inverse problem using an unrolled network that incorporates non-ideal detector responses and CT forward-projection geometry, trained on synthetic data from natural images.

Result: Model trained on synthetic data consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse scanning geometries and anatomical regions without requiring real clinical data.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively reduces ring artifacts by leveraging CT geometry correlations through synthetic data training, eliminating the need for costly real clinical datasets while achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Defective and inconsistent responses in CT detectors can cause ring and streak artifacts in the reconstructed images, making them unusable for clinical purposes. In recent years, several ring artifact reduction solutions have been proposed in the image domain or in the sinogram domain using supervised deep learning methods. However, these methods require dedicated datasets for training, leading to a high data collection cost. Furthermore, existing approaches focus exclusively on either image-space or sinogram-space correction, neglecting the intrinsic correlations from the forward operation of the CT geometry. Based on the theoretical analysis of non-ideal CT detector responses, the RAR problem is reformulated as an inverse problem by using an unrolled network, which considers non-ideal response together with linear forward-projection with CT geometry. Additionally, the intrinsic correlations of ring artifacts between the sinogram and image domains are leveraged through synthetic data derived from natural images, enabling the trained model to correct artifacts without requiring real-world clinical data. Extensive evaluations on diverse scanning geometries and anatomical regions demonstrate that the model trained on synthetic data consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework using implicit neural representations and diffusion models to synthesize LGE cardiac MRI images with corresponding segmentation masks for data augmentation, improving fibrosis segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging is the clinical standard for myocardial scar assessment, but limited annotated datasets hinder the development of automated segmentation methods. There's a need to address data scarcity in medical imaging without requiring extensive manual annotations.

Method: Proposes a framework that first trains implicit neural representations (INRs) to capture continuous spatial representations of LGE data and associated myocardium and fibrosis masks. These INRs are compressed into compact latent embeddings, then a diffusion model operates on this latent space to generate new representations, which are decoded into synthetic LGE images with anatomically consistent segmentation masks.

Result: Experiments on 133 cardiac MRI scans show that augmenting training data with 200 synthetic volumes improves fibrosis segmentation performance, with Dice score increasing from 0.509 to 0.524. The approach provides an annotation-free method to mitigate data scarcity.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully synthesizes both LGE images and corresponding segmentation masks using implicit neural representations combined with denoising diffusion models, offering a promising solution to address data scarcity in medical imaging without requiring manual annotations.

Abstract: Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging is the clinical standard for myocardial scar assessment, but limited annotated datasets hinder the development of automated segmentation methods. We propose a novel framework that synthesises both LGE images and their corresponding segmentation masks using implicit neural representations (INRs) combined with denoising diffusion models. Our approach first trains INRs to capture continuous spatial representations of LGE data and associated myocardium and fibrosis masks. These INRs are then compressed into compact latent embeddings, preserving essential anatomical information. A diffusion model operates on this latent space to generate new representations, which are decoded into synthetic LGE images with anatomically consistent segmentation masks. Experiments on 133 cardiac MRI scans suggest that augmenting training data with 200 synthetic volumes contributes to improved fibrosis segmentation performance, with the Dice score showing an increase from 0.509 to 0.524. Our approach provides an annotation-free method to help mitigate data scarcity.The code for this research is publicly available.

*Bruno Rigal,Victor Dupriez,Alexis Mignon,Ronan Le Hy,Nicolas Mery*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Evaluation of PDF-to-Markdown conversion using Vision-Language Models on challenging French documents, with a new benchmark targeting concrete failure modes and category-specific normalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Document parsing is critical for RAG pipelines, but existing benchmarks often focus on English/Chinese and penalize benign formatting differences irrelevant for downstream use. Need for better evaluation of French document parsing.

Method: Created French-focused benchmark using model-disagreement sampling from 60,000 documents covering difficult cases (handwritten forms, complex layouts, dense tables, graphics-rich pages). Used unit-test-style checks targeting concrete failure modes (text presence, reading order, local table constraints) with category-specific normalization.

Result: Proprietary models showed substantially higher robustness on handwriting and forms, while several open-weights systems remained competitive on standard printed layouts across 15 evaluated models.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides better evaluation of PDF-to-Markdown conversion for French documents, revealing performance differences between proprietary and open models on different document types.

Abstract: This report evaluates PDF-to-Markdown conversion using recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on challenging French documents. Document parsing is a critical step for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, where transcription and layout errors propagate to downstream retrieval and grounding. Existing benchmarks often emphasize English or Chinese and can over-penalize benign formatting and linearization choices (e.g., line breaks, list segmentation, alternative table renderings) that are largely irrelevant for downstream use.
  We introduce a French-focused benchmark of difficult pages selected via model-disagreement sampling from a corpus of 60{,}000 documents, covering handwritten forms, complex layouts, dense tables, and graphics-rich pages. Evaluation is performed with unit-test-style checks that target concrete failure modes (text presence, reading order, and local table constraints) combined with category-specific normalization designed to discount presentation-only variance. Across 15 models, we observe substantially higher robustness for the strongest proprietary models on handwriting and forms, while several open-weights systems remain competitive on standard printed layouts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a Bayesian deep learning framework with Confidence-Uncertainty Boundary Loss (CUB-Loss) and Dual Temperature Scaling (DTS) to improve uncertainty calibration in medical AI, validated on pneumonia screening, diabetic retinopathy, and skin lesion detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In medical imaging AI, reliability and uncertainty quantification are as important as accuracy for clinical acceptance. Current deep learning models often suffer from miscalibration (overconfidence in wrong predictions), making it hard for clinicians to identify unreliable outputs.

Method: 1) Confidence-Uncertainty Boundary Loss (CUB-Loss) that penalizes high-certainty errors and low-certainty correct predictions during training. 2) Dual Temperature Scaling (DTS) for post-hoc calibration to refine posterior distributions. Both are part of a Bayesian deep learning framework.

Result: The framework achieves consistent calibration improvements across three medical imaging tasks (pneumonia screening, diabetic retinopathy detection, skin lesion identification), maintains robust performance in data-scarce scenarios, and works effectively on severely imbalanced datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed probabilistic optimization framework successfully aligns prediction correctness with uncertainty estimates, demonstrating potential for real clinical deployment by providing clinicians with reliable uncertainty quantification to identify unreliable predictions.

Abstract: In critical decision support systems based on medical imaging, the reliability of AI-assisted decision-making is as relevant as predictive accuracy. Although deep learning models have demonstrated significant accuracy, they frequently suffer from miscalibration, manifested as overconfidence in erroneous predictions. To facilitate clinical acceptance, it is imperative that models quantify uncertainty in a manner that correlates with prediction correctness, allowing clinicians to identify unreliable outputs for further review. In order to address this necessity, the present paper proposes a generalizable probabilistic optimization framework grounded in Bayesian deep learning. Specifically, a novel Confidence-Uncertainty Boundary Loss (CUB-Loss) is introduced that imposes penalties on high-certainty errors and low-certainty correct predictions, explicitly enforcing alignment between prediction correctness and uncertainty estimates. Complementing this training-time optimization, a Dual Temperature Scaling (DTS) strategy is devised for post-hoc calibration, further refining the posterior distribution to improve intuitive explainability. The proposed framework is validated on three distinct medical imaging tasks: automatic screening of pneumonia, diabetic retinopathy detection, and identification of skin lesions. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves consistent calibration improvements across diverse modalities, maintains robust performance in data-scarce scenarios, and remains effective on severely imbalanced datasets, underscoring its potential for real clinical deployment.

TL;DR: SCoT framework bridges MLLM spatial reasoning with diffusion models using layout-aware training and plug-and-play planning for better image generation and editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models struggle with complex spatial understanding, while existing MLLM approaches are either computationally expensive or lose spatial information when using only text prompts.

Method: Proposes Spatial Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) framework: 1) Train diffusion model on interleaved text-coordinate instructions for layout awareness, 2) Use MLLMs as planners to generate comprehensive layout plans that transfer spatial reasoning to generation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on image generation benchmarks, significantly outperforms baselines on complex reasoning tasks, and shows strong efficacy in image editing scenarios.

Conclusion: SCoT effectively bridges MLLM reasoning capabilities with diffusion model generation through a plug-and-play approach that enhances spatial understanding without high computational costs.

Abstract: While diffusion models have shown exceptional capabilities in aesthetic image synthesis, they often struggle with complex spatial understanding and reasoning. Existing approaches resort to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance this capability. However, they either incur high computational costs through joint training or suffer from spatial information loss when relying solely on textual prompts. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a Spatial Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) framework, a plug-and-play approach that effectively bridges the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs with the generative power of diffusion models. Specifically, we first enhance the diffusion model's layout awareness by training it on an interleaved text-coordinate instruction format. We then leverage state-of-the-art MLLMs as planners to generate comprehensive layout plans, transferring their spatial planning capabilities directly to the generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on image generation benchmarks and significantly outperforms baselines on complex reasoning tasks, while also showing strong efficacy in image editing scenarios.

TL;DR: Fine-tuned local vision-language models with LoRA outperform supervised TimeSFormer for newborn resuscitation activity recognition, achieving F1 score of 0.91 vs 0.70.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate documentation of newborn resuscitation is crucial for quality improvement and guideline adherence, but current methods using 3D-CNNs and Vision Transformers struggle with fine-grained activity recognition in resuscitation videos.

Method: Explored generative AI methods using local vision-language models combined with LLMs, comparing to supervised TimeSFormer baseline. Evaluated zero-shot VLM strategies and fine-tuned VLMs with classification heads including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on 13.26 hours of simulated newborn resuscitation videos.

Result: Small local VLMs initially struggled with hallucinations, but when fine-tuned with LoRA achieved F1 score of 0.91, significantly surpassing TimeSFormer's 0.70 performance.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning local VLMs with LoRA is an effective approach for improving fine-grained activity recognition in newborn resuscitation videos, offering substantial performance gains over traditional supervised methods.

Abstract: Accurate documentation of newborn resuscitation is essential for quality improvement and adherence to clinical guidelines, yet remains underutilized in practice. Previous work using 3D-CNNs and Vision Transformers (ViT) has shown promising results in detecting key activities from newborn resuscitation videos, but also highlighted the challenges in recognizing such fine-grained activities. This work investigates the potential of generative AI (GenAI) methods to improve activity recognition from such videos. Specifically, we explore the use of local vision-language models (VLMs), combined with large language models (LLMs), and compare them to a supervised TimeSFormer baseline. Using a simulated dataset comprising 13.26 hours of newborn resuscitation videos, we evaluate several zero-shot VLM-based strategies and fine-tuned VLMs with classification heads, including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our results suggest that small (local) VLMs struggle with hallucinations, but when fine-tuned with LoRA, the results reach F1 score at 0.91, surpassing the TimeSformer results of 0.70.

Conclusion: Integrating world model-based reinforcement learning significantly enhances VLA models' capabilities for complex robotic manipulation tasks, enabling robust cross-task adaptation and reliable long-horizon execution.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models that directly predict multi-step action chunks from current observations face inherent limitations due to constrained scene understanding and weak future anticipation capabilities.

TL;DR: PosterOmni: A unified framework for image-to-poster generation that combines local editing (entity preservation) and global creation (design concepts) through data distillation and reward feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image-to-poster generation requires both local adjustments (preserving visual entities) and global design understanding (layout, style, concepts), creating a multi-dimensional challenge that existing approaches don't fully address.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: (1) Build multi-scenario datasets covering 6 task types across entity-based and concept-based creation, (2) Distill knowledge between local and global experts for supervised fine-tuning, (3) Apply unified PosterOmni Reward Feedback to align visual entity preservation and aesthetic preferences across all tasks.

Result: PosterOmni significantly outperforms all open-source baselines and even surpasses several proprietary systems in reference adherence, global composition quality, and aesthetic harmony.

Conclusion: PosterOmni successfully integrates local editing and global creation into a unified framework, demonstrating superior performance in multi-task image-to-poster generation through its data-distillation-reward pipeline and establishing a comprehensive benchmark for evaluation.

Abstract: Image-to-poster generation is a high-demand task requiring not only local adjustments but also high-level design understanding. Models must generate text, layout, style, and visual elements while preserving semantic fidelity and aesthetic coherence. The process spans two regimes: local editing, where ID-driven generation, rescaling, filling, and extending must preserve concrete visual entities; and global creation, where layout- and style-driven tasks rely on understanding abstract design concepts. These intertwined demands make image-to-poster a multi-dimensional process coupling entity-preserving editing with concept-driven creation under image-prompt control. To address these challenges, we propose PosterOmni, a generalized artistic poster creation framework that unlocks the potential of a base edit model for multi-task image-to-poster generation. PosterOmni integrates the two regimes, namely local editing and global creation, within a single system through an efficient data-distillation-reward pipeline: (i) constructing multi-scenario image-to-poster datasets covering six task types across entity-based and concept-based creation; (ii) distilling knowledge between local and global experts for supervised fine-tuning; and (iii) applying unified PosterOmni Reward Feedback to jointly align visual entity-preserving and aesthetic preference across all tasks. Additionally, we establish PosterOmni-Bench, a unified benchmark for evaluating both local editing and global creation. Extensive experiments show that PosterOmni significantly enhances reference adherence, global composition quality, and aesthetic harmony, outperforming all open-source baselines and even surpassing several proprietary systems.

TL;DR: FAIL proposes adversarial imitation learning for flow matching models, offering two algorithms (FAIL-PD and FAIL-PG) that fine-tune models without explicit rewards or preference pairs, achieving competitive performance with minimal demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current post-training methods for flow matching models have limitations: Supervised Fine-Tuning suffers from policy drift in unseen states, while preference optimization methods require costly preference pairs or reward modeling. There's a need for an efficient method that aligns model outputs with high-quality targets without these drawbacks.

Method: FAIL (Flow Matching Adversarial Imitation Learning) minimizes policy-expert divergence through adversarial training without explicit rewards or pairwise comparisons. Two algorithms are derived: FAIL-PD uses differentiable ODE solvers for low-variance pathwise gradients, while FAIL-PG provides a black-box alternative for discrete or computationally constrained settings.

Result: Fine-tuning FLUX with only 13,000 demonstrations from Nano Banana pro, FAIL achieves competitive performance on prompt following and aesthetic benchmarks. The framework generalizes effectively to discrete image and video generation and functions as a robust regularizer to mitigate reward hacking in reward-based optimization.

Conclusion: FAIL provides an effective adversarial imitation learning approach for flow matching models that addresses limitations of existing methods, requiring minimal demonstrations while achieving strong performance across multiple domains and serving as a regularization technique against reward hacking.

Abstract: Post-training of flow matching models-aligning the output distribution with a high-quality target-is mathematically equivalent to imitation learning. While Supervised Fine-Tuning mimics expert demonstrations effectively, it cannot correct policy drift in unseen states. Preference optimization methods address this but require costly preference pairs or reward modeling. We propose Flow Matching Adversarial Imitation Learning (FAIL), which minimizes policy-expert divergence through adversarial training without explicit rewards or pairwise comparisons. We derive two algorithms: FAIL-PD exploits differentiable ODE solvers for low-variance pathwise gradients, while FAIL-PG provides a black-box alternative for discrete or computationally constrained settings. Fine-tuning FLUX with only 13,000 demonstrations from Nano Banana pro, FAIL achieves competitive performance on prompt following and aesthetic benchmarks.

TL;DR: TexSpot introduces a novel 3D texture representation called Texlet that combines point-based geometric expressiveness with UV-based compactness, enabling high-quality texture enhancement through diffusion-based refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D texture generation suffers from view-inconsistency in multi-view diffusion pipelines, with existing representations having limitations: UV maps suffer from distortion during unwrapping, while point-based methods tie texture fidelity to geometric density, limiting high-resolution generation.

Method: TexSpot introduces Texlet, a novel 3D texture representation that merges point-based geometric expressiveness with UV-based compactness. Each Texlet latent vector encodes local texture patches via 2D encoder and aggregates them with 3D encoder for global shape context. A cascaded 3D-to-2D decoder reconstructs texture patches. A diffusion transformer conditioned on Texlets refines textures from multi-view diffusion methods.

Result: Extensive experiments show TexSpot significantly improves visual fidelity, geometric consistency, and robustness over existing state-of-the-art 3D texture generation and enhancement approaches.

Conclusion: TexSpot addresses fundamental limitations in 3D texture generation by introducing a novel Texlet representation that enables high-quality texture enhancement through diffusion-based refinement, overcoming view-inconsistency and resolution limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: High-quality 3D texture generation remains a fundamental challenge due to the view-inconsistency inherent in current mainstream multi-view diffusion pipelines. Existing representations either rely on UV maps, which suffer from distortion during unwrapping, or point-based methods, which tightly couple texture fidelity to geometric density that limits high-resolution texture generation. To address these limitations, we introduce TexSpot, a diffusion-based texture enhancement framework. At its core is Texlet, a novel 3D texture representation that merges the geometric expressiveness of point-based 3D textures with the compactness of UV-based representation. Each Texlet latent vector encodes a local texture patch via a 2D encoder and is further aggregated using a 3D encoder to incorporate global shape context. A cascaded 3D-to-2D decoder reconstructs high-quality texture patches, enabling the Texlet space learning. Leveraging this representation, we train a diffusion transformer conditioned on Texlets to refine and enhance textures produced by multi-view diffusion methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TexSpot significantly improves visual fidelity, geometric consistency, and robustness over existing state-of-the-art 3D texture generation and enhancement approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches treat human-centric audio-video tasks (reference-based generation, video editing, audio-driven animation) as isolated objectives, and struggle with precise control over multiple character identities and voice timbres in multi-person scenarios due to identity-timbre binding failures and speaker confusion.

Method: 1) Symmetric Conditional Diffusion Transformer with symmetric conditional injection for heterogeneous signals; 2) Dual-Level Disentanglement: Synchronized RoPE for rigid attention-space binding at signal level, Structured Captions for explicit attribute-subject mappings at semantic level; 3) Multi-Task Progressive Training using weakly-constrained priors to regularize strongly-constrained tasks.

Result: Achieves comprehensive state-of-the-art performance across video, audio, and audio-visual consistency metrics, outperforming leading proprietary commercial models.

Conclusion: DreamID-Omni provides a unified solution for controllable human-centric audio-video generation with effective multi-person identity-timbre disentanglement, bridging academic research and commercial-grade applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models have revolutionized joint audio-video generation. However, existing approaches typically treat human-centric tasks including reference-based audio-video generation (R2AV), video editing (RV2AV) and audio-driven video animation (RA2V) as isolated objectives. Furthermore, achieving precise, disentangled control over multiple character identities and voice timbres within a single framework remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose DreamID-Omni, a unified framework for controllable human-centric audio-video generation. Specifically, we design a Symmetric Conditional Diffusion Transformer that integrates heterogeneous conditioning signals via a symmetric conditional injection scheme. To resolve the pervasive identity-timbre binding failures and speaker confusion in multi-person scenarios, we introduce a Dual-Level Disentanglement strategy: Synchronized RoPE at the signal level to ensure rigid attention-space binding, and Structured Captions at the semantic level to establish explicit attribute-subject mappings. Furthermore, we devise a Multi-Task Progressive Training scheme that leverages weakly-constrained generative priors to regularize strongly-constrained tasks, preventing overfitting and harmonizing disparate objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamID-Omni achieves comprehensive state-of-the-art performance across video, audio, and audio-visual consistency, even outperforming leading proprietary commercial models. We will release our code to bridge the gap between academic research and commercial-grade applications.

Abstract: State-of-the-art generative image and video models rely heavily on tokenizers that compress high-dimensional inputs into more efficient latent representations. While this paradigm has revolutionized RGB generation, Earth observation (EO) data presents unique challenges due to diverse sensor specifications and variable spectral channels. We propose EO-VAE, a multi-sensor variational autoencoder designed to serve as a foundational tokenizer for the EO domain. Unlike prior approaches that train separate tokenizers for each modality, EO-VAE utilizes a single model to encode and reconstruct flexible channel combinations via dynamic hypernetworks.

TL;DR: DeepGen 1.0 is a lightweight 5B unified multimodal model for image generation/editing that achieves SOTA performance despite being much smaller than competitors (80B/27B models), using novel deep alignment and training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unified multimodal models require massive parameter scales (>10B) with prohibitive training costs and deployment footprints. There's a need for lightweight yet capable alternatives to democratize multimodal research.

Method: 1) Stacked Channel Bridging (SCB): deep alignment framework extracting hierarchical VLM features fused with learnable 'think tokens' for structured guidance. 2) Three-stage training: Alignment Pre-training on image-text pairs, Joint Supervised Fine-tuning on generation/editing/reasoning tasks, and Reinforcement Learning with MR-GRPO using mixture rewards.

Result: Despite training on only ~50M samples, DeepGen 1.0 surpasses 80B HunyuanImage by 28% on WISE and 27B Qwen-Image-Edit by 37% on UniREditBench, achieving leading performance across diverse benchmarks with stable training and no visual artifacts.

Conclusion: DeepGen 1.0 provides an efficient, high-performance alternative to large models, democratizing unified multimodal research through open-sourcing of training code, weights, and datasets while maintaining competitive capabilities.

Abstract: Current unified multimodal models for image generation and editing typically rely on massive parameter scales (e.g., >10B), entailing prohibitive training costs and deployment footprints. In this work, we present DeepGen 1.0, a lightweight 5B unified model that achieves comprehensive capabilities competitive with or surpassing much larger counterparts. To overcome the limitations of compact models in semantic understanding and fine-grained control, we introduce Stacked Channel Bridging (SCB), a deep alignment framework that extracts hierarchical features from multiple VLM layers and fuses them with learnable 'think tokens' to provide the generative backbone with structured, reasoning-rich guidance. We further design a data-centric training strategy spanning three progressive stages: (1) Alignment Pre-training on large-scale image-text pairs and editing triplets to synchronize VLM and DiT representations, (2) Joint Supervised Fine-tuning on a high-quality mixture of generation, editing, and reasoning tasks to foster omni-capabilities, and (3) Reinforcement Learning with MR-GRPO, which leverages a mixture of reward functions and supervision signals, resulting in substantial gains in generation quality and alignment with human preferences, while maintaining stable training progress and avoiding visual artifacts. Despite being trained on only ~50M samples, DeepGen 1.0 achieves leading performance across diverse benchmarks, surpassing the 80B HunyuanImage by 28% on WISE and the 27B Qwen-Image-Edit by 37% on UniREditBench. By open-sourcing our training code, weights, and datasets, we provide an efficient, high-performance alternative to democratize unified multimodal research.

TL;DR: Monarch-RT: Structured attention using Monarch matrices enables efficient real-time video generation with Diffusion Transformers, achieving 95% sparsity and 1.4-11.8X kernel speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time video generation with Diffusion Transformers suffers from quadratic cost of 3D self-attention, especially in few-step autoregressive regimes where errors compound. Prior sparse-attention approximations fail in this setting despite working for bidirectional, many-step diffusion.

Method: Proposes Monarch-RT, a structured attention parameterization using Monarch matrices that factorizes attention with aligned block structure and extended tiled Monarch parameterization. Uses finetuning with custom Triton kernels to overcome parameterization overhead.

Result: Monarch-RT achieves 95% attention sparsity with no quality loss when applied to state-of-the-art Self-Forcing model. Optimized implementation outperforms FlashAttention-2/3/4 kernels on various GPUs (1.4-11.8X speedups). Enables true real-time video generation at 16 FPS on single RTX 5090.

Conclusion: Monarch-RT is a pioneering sparse attention parameterization for real-time video generation that successfully addresses the limitations of prior sparse-attention methods in few-step autoregressive regimes, enabling efficient high-quality video synthesis.

Abstract: Real-time video generation with Diffusion Transformers is bottlenecked by the quadratic cost of 3D self-attention, especially in real-time regimes that are both few-step and autoregressive, where errors compound across time and each denoising step must carry substantially more information. In this setting, we find that prior sparse-attention approximations break down, despite showing strong results for bidirectional, many-step diffusion. Specifically, we observe that video attention is not reliably sparse, but instead combines pronounced periodic structure driven by spatiotemporal position with dynamic, sparse semantic correspondences and dense mixing, exceeding the representational capacity of even oracle top-k attention. Building on this insight, we propose Monarch-RT, a structured attention parameterization for video diffusion models that factorizes attention using Monarch matrices. Through appropriately aligned block structure and our extended tiled Monarch parameterization, we achieve high expressivity while preserving computational efficiency. We further overcome the overhead of parameterization through finetuning, with custom Triton kernels. We first validate the high efficacy of Monarch-RT over existing sparse baselines designed only for bidirectional models. We further observe that Monarch-RT attains up to 95% attention sparsity with no loss in quality when applied to the state-of-the-art model Self-Forcing, making Monarch-RT a pioneering work on highly-capable sparse attention parameterization for real-time video generation. Our optimized implementation outperforms FlashAttention-2, FlashAttention-3, and FlashAttention-4 kernels on Nvidia RTX 5090, H100, and B200 GPUs respectively, providing kernel speedups in the range of 1.4-11.8X. This enables us, for the first time, to achieve true real-time video generation with Self-Forcing at 16 FPS on a single RTX 5090.

TL;DR: UniT enables unified multimodal models to perform iterative reasoning through chain-of-thought test-time scaling, improving performance on complex tasks requiring decomposition, verification, and refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unified multimodal models operate in single passes without iterative refinement, but complex tasks involving spatial compositions, multiple objects, or evolving instructions require decomposition, verification, and iterative corrections.

Method: UniT framework combines agentic data synthesis, unified model training, and flexible test-time inference to enable multimodal chain-of-thought test-time scaling, supporting verification, subgoal decomposition, and content memory.

Result: Three key findings: (1) models trained on short reasoning trajectories generalize to longer inference chains; (2) sequential chain-of-thought reasoning is more scalable and compute-efficient than parallel sampling; (3) training on generation/editing trajectories improves out-of-distribution visual reasoning.

Conclusion: Multimodal test-time scaling is an effective paradigm for advancing both generation and understanding in unified models, enabling iterative reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Unified models can handle both multimodal understanding and generation within a single architecture, yet they typically operate in a single pass without iteratively refining their outputs. Many multimodal tasks, especially those involving complex spatial compositions, multiple interacting objects, or evolving instructions, require decomposing instructions, verifying intermediate results, and making iterative corrections. While test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated that allocating additional inference compute for iterative reasoning substantially improves language model performance, extending this paradigm to unified multimodal models remains an open challenge. We introduce UniT, a framework for multimodal chain-of-thought test-time scaling that enables a single unified model to reason, verify, and refine across multiple rounds. UniT combines agentic data synthesis, unified model training, and flexible test-time inference to elicit cognitive behaviors including verification, subgoal decomposition, and content memory. Our key findings are: (1) unified models trained on short reasoning trajectories generalize to longer inference chains at test time; (2) sequential chain-of-thought reasoning provides a more scalable and compute-efficient TTS strategy than parallel sampling; (3) training on generation and editing trajectories improves out-of-distribution visual reasoning. These results establish multimodal test-time scaling as an effective paradigm for advancing both generation and understanding in unified models.

*Huai-Hsun Cheng,Siang-Ling Zhang,Yu-Lun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Progressive Semantic Illusions: A vector sketching framework where a single sketch transforms semantically through sequential stroke addition, optimized to satisfy different interpretations at different drawing stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional visual illusions rely on spatial manipulations like multi-view consistency. This work aims to expand visual illusions from spatial to temporal dimension by creating sketches that undergo dramatic semantic transformations as strokes are progressively added.

Method: Stroke of Surprise framework uses sequence-aware joint optimization with dual-branch Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to address the "dual-constraint" problem. It dynamically adjusts prefix strokes to find a "common structural subspace" valid for both semantic targets, plus an Overlay Loss for spatial complementarity.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recognizability and illusion strength, successfully expanding visual anagrams from spatial to temporal dimension.

Conclusion: The work introduces Progressive Semantic Illusions as a novel temporal dimension for visual illusions, demonstrating effective optimization of vector strokes for semantic transformations through sequential drawing stages.

Abstract: Visual illusions traditionally rely on spatial manipulations such as multi-view consistency. In this work, we introduce Progressive Semantic Illusions, a novel vector sketching task where a single sketch undergoes a dramatic semantic transformation through the sequential addition of strokes. We present Stroke of Surprise, a generative framework that optimizes vector strokes to satisfy distinct semantic interpretations at different drawing stages. The core challenge lies in the "dual-constraint": initial prefix strokes must form a coherent object (e.g., a duck) while simultaneously serving as the structural foundation for a second concept (e.g., a sheep) upon adding delta strokes. To address this, we propose a sequence-aware joint optimization framework driven by a dual-branch Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) mechanism. Unlike sequential approaches that freeze the initial state, our method dynamically adjusts prefix strokes to discover a "common structural subspace" valid for both targets. Furthermore, we introduce a novel Overlay Loss that enforces spatial complementarity, ensuring structural integration rather than occlusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recognizability and illusion strength, successfully expanding visual anagrams from the spatial to the temporal dimension.

TL;DR: Researchers integrated XAI techniques (PDP, PFI, KernelSHAP) into DashAI no-code ML platform and found high usability for novices but experts wanted more detailed explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ML is increasingly used in sensitive domains requiring transparency, but XAI methods often require technical expertise, creating a gap in no-code ML platforms that aim to democratize AI.

Method: Developed human-centered XAI module in DashAI (open-source no-code platform) integrating three complementary techniques: Partial Dependence Plots, Permutation Feature Importance, and KernelSHAP for tabular classification. Conducted user study with 20 participants (ML novices and experts).

Result: High task success (≥80%) across all explainability tasks; novices rated explanations as useful, accurate, and trustworthy (ESS α=0.74), while experts were more critical of sufficiency/completeness; explanations improved perceived predictability and confidence (TiA α=0.60), with novices showing higher trust than experts.

Conclusion: XAI in no-code ML faces the challenge of making explanations both accessible to novices and sufficiently detailed for experts, highlighting the need for adaptable explanation systems.

Abstract: The increasing use of Machine Learning (ML) in sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and public policy has raised concerns about the transparency of automated decisions. Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this by clarifying how models generate predictions, yet most methods demand technical expertise, limiting their value for novices. This gap is especially critical in no-code ML platforms, which seek to democratize AI but rarely include explainability. We present a human-centered XAI module in DashAI, an open-source no-code ML platform. The module integrates three complementary techniques, which are Partial Dependence Plots (PDP), Permutation Feature Importance (PFI), and KernelSHAP, into DashAI's workflow for tabular classification. A user study (N = 20; ML novices and experts) evaluated usability and the impact of explanations. Results show: (i) high task success ($\geq80\%$) across all explainability tasks; (ii) novices rated explanations as useful, accurate, and trustworthy on the Explanation Satisfaction Scale (ESS, Cronbach's $α$ = 0.74, a measure of internal consistency), while experts were more critical of sufficiency and completeness; and (iii) explanations improved perceived predictability and confidence on the Trust in Automation scale (TiA, $α$ = 0.60), with novices showing higher trust than experts. These findings highlight a central challenge for XAI in no-code ML, making explanations both accessible to novices and sufficiently detailed for experts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Latent Generative Solvers (LGS) is a two-stage framework for long-horizon PDE simulation that uses latent space dynamics with uncertainty correction and flow forcing for stable autoregressive prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create generalizable, uncertainty-aware neural PDE solvers that are reliable for long-term forecasting across heterogeneous PDE systems, addressing rollout drift and computational efficiency challenges.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) map diverse PDE states to shared latent physics space using pretrained VAE, (2) learn probabilistic latent dynamics with Transformer trained by flow matching. Key mechanisms: uncertainty knob for correcting off-manifold drift, flow forcing for system descriptor updates, and latent space learning for efficiency.

Result: Matches strong deterministic neural-operator baselines on short horizons while substantially reducing rollout drift on long horizons. Achieves up to 70× lower FLOPs than non-generative baselines. Successfully adapts to out-of-distribution 256² Kolmogorov flow with limited finetuning.

Conclusion: LGS provides a practical route toward generalizable, uncertainty-aware neural PDE solvers that are more reliable for long-term forecasting and downstream scientific workflows, enabling scalable pretraining and efficient adaptation.

Abstract: We study long-horizon surrogate simulation across heterogeneous PDE systems. We introduce Latent Generative Solvers (LGS), a two-stage framework that (i) maps diverse PDE states into a shared latent physics space with a pretrained VAE, and (ii) learns probabilistic latent dynamics with a Transformer trained by flow matching. Our key mechanism is an uncertainty knob that perturbs latent inputs during training and inference, teaching the solver to correct off-manifold rollout drift and stabilizing autoregressive prediction. We further use flow forcing to update a system descriptor (context) from model-generated trajectories, aligning train/test conditioning and improving long-term stability. We pretrain on a curated corpus of $\sim$2.5M trajectories at $128^2$ resolution spanning 12 PDE families. LGS matches strong deterministic neural-operator baselines on short horizons while substantially reducing rollout drift on long horizons. Learning in latent space plus efficient architectural choices yields up to \textbf{70$\times$} lower FLOPs than non-generative baselines, enabling scalable pretraining. We also show efficient adaptation to an out-of-distribution $256^2$ Kolmogorov flow dataset under limited finetuning budgets. Overall, LGS provides a practical route toward generalizable, uncertainty-aware neural PDE solvers that are more reliable for long-term forecasting and downstream scientific workflows.

TL;DR: DecisionDB: Infrastructure for logging, replaying, and auditing computational decisions across different data representations, ensuring deterministic reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Different representations of the same data can produce different computational outcomes, creating reproducibility challenges. There's a need to systematically track which representations preserve results versus change them.

Method: Formalizes decision-valued maps that associate representations with discrete outcomes. Develops DecisionDB infrastructure that logs, replays, and audits these relationships using content-derived identifiers and write-once artifact storage.

Result: Creates a system that partitions representation space into persistence regions (where outcomes are preserved) and boundaries (where outcomes change), with deterministic replay that exactly recovers recorded decision identifiers.

Conclusion: Provides a framework for treating decision reuse as a mechanically checkable condition, enabling reliable reproducibility auditing across different data representations.

Abstract: A computational engine applied to different representations of the same data can produce different discrete outcomes, with some representations preserving the result and others changing it entirely. A decision-valued map records which representations preserve the outcome and which change it, associating each member of a declared representation family with the discrete result it produces. This paper formalizes decision-valued maps and describes DecisionDB, an infrastructure that logs, replays and audits these relationships using identifiers computed from content and artifacts stored in write-once form. Deterministic replay recovers each recorded decision identifier exactly from stored artifacts, with all three identifying fields matching their persisted values. The contribution partitions representation space into persistence regions and boundaries, and treats decision reuse as a mechanically checkable condition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI governance frameworks (like NIST AI RMF) provide principles but lack implementable architectures for securing complex AI estates - socio-technical systems combining models, agents, data pipelines, and infrastructure in production environments.

Method: Proposes PBSAI Governance Ecosystem with 12-domain taxonomy, bounded agent families mediating between tools/policy via shared context envelopes and structured output contracts, plus lightweight formal model for traceability and provenance guarantees.

Result: Architecture demonstrates alignment with NIST AI RMF functions and shows applicability in enterprise SOC and hyperscale defensive environments, providing structured foundation for ecosystem development.

Conclusion: PBSAI offers an evidence-centric, implementable architecture for securing AI estates that existing frameworks lack, serving as foundation for open ecosystem development and future empirical validation.

Abstract: Enterprises are rapidly deploying large language models, retrieval augmented generation pipelines, and tool using agents into production, often on shared high performance computing clusters and cloud accelerator platforms that also support defensive analytics. These systems increasingly function not as isolated models but as AI estates: socio technical systems spanning models, agents, data pipelines, security tooling, human workflows, and hyperscale infrastructure. Existing governance and security frameworks, including the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and systems security engineering guidance, articulate principles and risk functions but do not provide implementable architectures for multi agent, AI enabled cyber defense.
  This paper introduces the Practitioners Blueprint for Secure AI (PBSAI) Governance Ecosystem, a multi agent reference architecture for securing enterprise and hyperscale AI estates. PBSAI organizes responsibilities into a twelve domain taxonomy and defines bounded agent families that mediate between tools and policy through shared context envelopes and structured output contracts. The architecture assumes baseline enterprise security capabilities and encodes key systems security techniques, including analytic monitoring, coordinated defense, and adaptive response. A lightweight formal model of agents, context envelopes, and ecosystem level invariants clarifies the traceability, provenance, and human in the loop guarantees enforced across domains. We demonstrate alignment with NIST AI RMF functions and illustrate application in enterprise SOC and hyperscale defensive environments. PBSAI is proposed as a structured, evidence centric foundation for open ecosystem development and future empirical validation.

TL;DR: The paper critiques the "ground truth" paradigm in ML, arguing it treats human disagreement as noise rather than valuable sociotechnical signal, and proposes pluralistic annotation infrastructures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the positivistic fallacy in ML's "ground truth" paradigm that treats human disagreement as technical noise rather than a vital sociotechnical signal, and to investigate how data annotation practices create a "consensus trap" that erases cultural diversity.

Method: Systematic literature review (2020-2025) across 7 premier venues (ACL, AIES, CHI, CSCW, EAAMO, FAccT, NeurIPS) using tiered keyword filtration from 30,897 records to 3,042 for manual screening, resulting in 346 papers for qualitative synthesis via reflexive thematic analysis.

Result: Reveals systemic failures in positional legibility combined with human-as-verifier models introduce anchoring bias and remove human voices; geographic hegemony imposes Western norms as universal benchmarks; precarious data workers prioritize compliance over honest subjectivity; statistical models misdiagnose cultural pluralism as random error.

Conclusion: Proposes reclaiming disagreement as high-fidelity signal essential for culturally competent models and advocates for pluralistic annotation infrastructures that map diversity of human experience rather than seeking singular "right" answers.

Abstract: In machine learning, "ground truth" refers to the assumed correct labels used to train and evaluate models. However, the foundational "ground truth" paradigm rests on a positivistic fallacy that treats human disagreement as technical noise rather than a vital sociotechnical signal. This systematic literature review analyzes research published between 2020 and 2025 across seven premier venues: ACL, AIES, CHI, CSCW, EAAMO, FAccT, and NeurIPS, investigating the mechanisms in data annotation practices that facilitate this "consensus trap". Our identification phase captured 30,897 records, which were refined via a tiered keyword filtration schema to a high-recall corpus of 3,042 records for manual screening, resulting in a final included corpus of 346 papers for qualitative synthesis. Our reflexive thematic analysis reveals that systemic failures in positional legibility, combined with the recent architectural shift toward human-as-verifier models, specifically the reliance on model-mediated annotations, introduce deep-seated anchoring bias and effectively remove human voices from the loop. We further demonstrate how geographic hegemony imposes Western norms as universal benchmarks, often enforced by the performative alignment of precarious data workers who prioritize requester compliance over honest subjectivity to avoid economic penalties. Critiquing the "noisy sensor" fallacy, where statistical models misdiagnose cultural pluralism as random error, we argue for reclaiming disagreement as a high-fidelity signal essential for building culturally competent models. To address these systemic tensions, we propose a roadmap for pluralistic annotation infrastructures that shift the objective from discovering a singular "right" answer to mapping the diversity of human experience.

TL;DR: BLPO: Bi-level prompt optimization framework for multimodal LLM judges that converts images to text representations to overcome context window limitations, improving alignment with human judgments for AI-generated image evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are widely used as automated judges for AI-generated content, but aligning them with human judgments is challenging. Supervised fine-tuning is costly and inflexible, while existing auto prompt optimization methods focus on text-only evaluations and don't work well for multimodal settings due to context window constraints limiting visual example processing.

Method: Proposes BLPO, a bi-level prompt optimization framework that converts images into textual representations while preserving evaluation-relevant visual cues. Uses bi-level optimization to jointly refine both the judge prompt and the image-to-text (I2T) prompt to maintain fidelity under limited context budgets.

Result: Experiments on four datasets and three LLM judges demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in improving multimodal LLM-based evaluation of AI-generated images.

Conclusion: BLPO provides an efficient alternative to supervised fine-tuning for improving LLM-based multimodal evaluation, overcoming context window limitations through bi-level optimization of prompts and image-to-text representations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become widely adopted as automated judges for evaluating AI-generated content. Despite their success, aligning LLM-based evaluations with human judgments remains challenging. While supervised fine-tuning on human-labeled data can improve alignment, it is costly and inflexible, requiring new training for each task or dataset. Recent progress in auto prompt optimization (APO) offers a more efficient alternative by automatically improving the instructions that guide LLM judges. However, existing APO methods primarily target text-only evaluations and remain underexplored in multimodal settings. In this work, we study auto prompt optimization for multimodal LLM-as-a-judge, particularly for evaluating AI-generated images. We identify a key bottleneck: multimodal models can only process a limited number of visual examples due to context window constraints, which hinders effective trial-and-error prompt refinement. To overcome this, we propose BLPO, a bi-level prompt optimization framework that converts images into textual representations while preserving evaluation-relevant visual cues. Our bi-level optimization approach jointly refines the judge prompt and the I2T prompt to maintain fidelity under limited context budgets. Experiments on four datasets and three LLM judges demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Method: 1) Analyze real-world noise patterns and categorize into user-noise and tool-noise. 2) Develop automated pipeline to inject controllable noise into existing agent benchmarks while preserving task solvability. 3) Evaluate diverse models across architectures and scales.

Result: Consistent performance variations under different noise conditions, revealing sensitivity of current agentic models to realistic environmental perturbations.

Conclusion: AgentNoiseBench provides systematic framework to evaluate agent robustness, highlighting need for noise-aware training and evaluation to improve real-world deployment reliability.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled LLM-based agents to achieve strong performance on a variety of benchmarks. However, their performance in real-world deployments often that observed on benchmark settings, especially in complex and imperfect environments. This discrepancy largely arises because prevailing training and evaluation paradigms are typically built on idealized assumptions, overlooking the inherent stochasticity and noise present in real-world interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentNoiseBench, a framework for systematically evaluating the robustness of agentic models under noisy environments. We first conduct an in-depth analysis of biases and uncertainties in real-world scenarios and categorize environmental noise into two primary types: user-noise and tool-noise. Building on this analysis, we develop an automated pipeline that injects controllable noise into existing agent-centric benchmarks while preserving task solvability. Leveraging this pipeline, we perform extensive evaluations across a wide range of models with diverse architectures and parameter scales. Our results reveal consistent performance variations under different noise conditions, highlighting the sensitivity of current agentic models to realistic environmental perturbations.

TL;DR: BAO is an agentic RL framework that balances proactive reasoning with user engagement by combining behavior enhancement for proactive capabilities and behavior regularization to suppress inefficient interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing proactive LLM agent training pipelines struggle to balance task performance with user engagement - passive agents can't adapt to user intentions while excessive human feedback reduces user satisfaction.

Method: BAO combines behavior enhancement (enriching proactive reasoning and information-gathering capabilities) with behavior regularization (suppressing inefficient/redundant interactions to align with user expectations).

Result: BAO substantially outperforms proactive agentic RL baselines on UserRL benchmark tasks and achieves comparable or superior performance to commercial LLM agents.

Conclusion: BAO effectively trains proactive, user-aligned LLM agents for complex multi-turn scenarios by balancing proactive capabilities with user engagement through its dual enhancement-regularization approach.

Abstract: Proactive large language model (LLM) agents aim to actively plan, query, and interact over multiple turns, enabling efficient task completion beyond passive instruction following and making them essential for real-world, user-centric applications. Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a promising solution for training such agents in multi-turn settings, allowing interaction strategies to be learned from feedback. However, existing pipelines face a critical challenge in balancing task performance with user engagement, as passive agents can not efficiently adapt to users' intentions while overuse of human feedback reduces their satisfaction. To address this trade-off, we propose BAO, an agentic RL framework that combines behavior enhancement to enrich proactive reasoning and information-gathering capabilities with behavior regularization to suppress inefficient or redundant interactions and align agent behavior with user expectations. We evaluate BAO on multiple tasks from the UserRL benchmark suite, and demonstrate that it substantially outperforms proactive agentic RL baselines while achieving comparable or even superior performance to commercial LLM agents, highlighting its effectiveness for training proactive, user-aligned LLM agents in complex multi-turn scenarios.

*Bang Nguyen,Dominik Soós,Qian Ma,Rochana R. Obadage,Zack Ranjan,Sai Koneru,Timothy M. Errington,Shakhlo Nematova,Sarah Rajtmajer,Jian Wu,Meng Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReplicatorBench is a new benchmark for evaluating AI agents' ability to replicate scientific research, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks by including both replicable and non-replicable claims and testing the full replication process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for AI paper assessment focus too narrowly on computational reproduction with available code/data, missing real-world challenges like inconsistent data availability and inability to identify non-replicable research.

Method: Created ReplicatorBench with human-verified replicable/non-replicable social/behavioral science claims, testing agents across three stages: data extraction/retrieval, experiment design/execution, and result interpretation. Developed ReplicatorAgent framework with tools like web search and sandboxed environments.

Result: Current LLM agents can effectively design and execute computational experiments but struggle with retrieving necessary resources like new data for replication. Evaluation across four LLMs showed varying performance based on programming language and code access levels.

Conclusion: ReplicatorBench provides a more comprehensive evaluation of AI agents' research replication capabilities, revealing current limitations in resource retrieval while demonstrating strengths in experimental design and execution.

Abstract: The literature has witnessed an emerging interest in AI agents for automated assessment of scientific papers. Existing benchmarks focus primarily on the computational aspect of this task, testing agents' ability to reproduce or replicate research outcomes when having access to the code and data. This setting, while foundational, (1) fails to capture the inconsistent availability of new data for replication as opposed to reproduction, and (2) lacks ground-truth diversity by focusing only on reproducible papers, thereby failing to evaluate an agent's ability to identify non-replicable research. Furthermore, most benchmarks only evaluate outcomes rather than the replication process. In response, we introduce ReplicatorBench, an end-to-end benchmark, including human-verified replicable and non-replicable research claims in social and behavioral sciences for evaluating AI agents in research replication across three stages: (1) extraction and retrieval of replication data; (2) design and execution of computational experiments; and (3) interpretation of results, allowing a test of AI agents' capability to mimic the activities of human replicators in real world. To set a baseline of AI agents' capability, we develop ReplicatorAgent, an agentic framework equipped with necessary tools, like web search and iterative interaction with sandboxed environments, to accomplish tasks in ReplicatorBench. We evaluate ReplicatorAgent across four underlying large language models (LLMs), as well as different design choices of programming language and levels of code access. Our findings reveal that while current LLM agents are capable of effectively designing and executing computational experiments, they struggle with retrieving resources, such as new data, necessary to replicate a claim.

*Heejeong Nam,Quentin Le Lidec,Lucas Maes,Yann LeCun,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: C-JEPA extends masked joint embedding prediction to object-centric representations with object-level masking, improving relational reasoning and planning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object-centric representations alone are insufficient for capturing interaction-dependent dynamics in world models, requiring better relational understanding for prediction, reasoning, and control.

Method: C-JEPA applies object-level masking to object-centric representations, forcing the model to infer an object's state from other objects, which creates latent interventions and prevents shortcut solutions.

Result: C-JEPA achieves ~20% absolute improvement in counterfactual reasoning for visual QA, enables planning with only 1% of latent features compared to patch-based models while maintaining comparable performance, and provides formal analysis showing causal inductive bias.

Conclusion: Object-level masking in object-centric world models induces causal inductive bias through latent interventions, significantly improving relational reasoning and planning efficiency.

Abstract: World models require robust relational understanding to support prediction, reasoning, and control. While object-centric representations provide a useful abstraction, they are not sufficient to capture interaction-dependent dynamics. We therefore propose C-JEPA, a simple and flexible object-centric world model that extends masked joint embedding prediction from image patches to object-centric representations. By applying object-level masking that requires an object's state to be inferred from other objects, C-JEPA induces latent interventions with counterfactual-like effects and prevents shortcut solutions, making interaction reasoning essential. Empirically, C-JEPA leads to consistent gains in visual question answering, with an absolute improvement of about 20\% in counterfactual reasoning compared to the same architecture without object-level masking. On agent control tasks, C-JEPA enables substantially more efficient planning by using only 1\% of the total latent input features required by patch-based world models, while achieving comparable performance. Finally, we provide a formal analysis demonstrating that object-level masking induces a causal inductive bias via latent interventions.

*Michael Menezes,Anastasios Kyrillidis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GHOST is a structured pruning framework for Mamba2 that reduces state dimension by 50% with minimal perplexity increase, using forward-pass statistics instead of backpropagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba2's expanded state dimension improves temporal modeling but causes substantial inference overhead during autoregressive generation, saturating bandwidth. Existing pruning methods fail to address this bottleneck effectively.

Method: GHOST (Grouped Hidden-state Output-aware Selection and Truncation) uses structured pruning that approximates control-theoretic balanced truncation using only forward-pass statistics, jointly measuring controllability and observability without requiring backpropagation.

Result: Achieves 50% state-dimension reduction with approximately 1 perplexity point increase on WikiText-2 across models ranging from 130M to 2.7B parameters, rivaling gradient-based methods without backpropagation costs.

Conclusion: GHOST provides an efficient structured pruning solution for Mamba2 that significantly reduces inference overhead while maintaining model fidelity, offering a practical approach to address bandwidth saturation during autoregressive generation.

Abstract: While Mamba2's expanded state dimension enhances temporal modeling, it incurs substantial inference overhead that saturates bandwidth during autoregressive generation. Standard pruning methods fail to address this bottleneck: unstructured sparsity leaves activations dense, magnitude-based selection ignores runtime dynamics, and gradient-based methods impose prohibitive costs. We introduce GHOST (Grouped Hidden-state Output-aware Selection and Truncation), a structured pruning framework that approximates control-theoretic balanced truncation using only forward-pass statistics. By jointly measuring controllability and observability, GHOST rivals the fidelity of gradient-based methods without requiring backpropagation. As a highlight, on models ranging from 130M to 2.7B parameters, our approach achieves a 50\% state-dimension reduction with approximately 1 perplexity point increase on WikiText-2.

*Sina Tayebati,Divake Kumar,Nastaran Darabi,Davide Ettori,Ranganath Krishnan,Amit Ranjan Trivedi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRACER is a trajectory-level uncertainty metric for AI agents in multi-turn tool-use interactions that detects critical failure episodes using content-aware surprisal, repetition signals, and coherence gaps, outperforming single-shot baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing uncertainty metrics focus on single-shot text generation and miss trajectory-level breakdown signals in multi-turn tool-use interactions, where failures often occur due to sparse critical episodes like looping, incoherent tool use, or user-agent miscoordination.

Method: TRACER combines content-aware surprisal with situational-awareness signals, semantic/lexical repetition, and tool-grounded coherence gaps, aggregating them using a tail-focused risk functional with MAX-composite step risk to surface decisive anomalies.

Result: TRACER improves AUROC by up to 37.1% and AUARC by up to 55% over baselines on τ²-bench for predicting task failure and selective task execution, enabling earlier and more accurate detection of uncertainty in complex conversational tool-use settings.

Conclusion: TRACER provides an effective trajectory-level uncertainty metric that captures critical failure episodes in multi-turn tool-use interactions, significantly outperforming existing single-shot uncertainty proxies and enabling better failure prediction and selective execution.

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty for AI agents in real-world multi-turn tool-using interaction with humans is difficult because failures are often triggered by sparse critical episodes (e.g., looping, incoherent tool use, or user-agent miscoordination) even when local generation appears confident. Existing uncertainty proxies focus on single-shot text generation and therefore miss these trajectory-level breakdown signals. We introduce TRACER, a trajectory-level uncertainty metric for dual-control Tool-Agent-User interaction. TRACER combines content-aware surprisal with situational-awareness signals, semantic and lexical repetition, and tool-grounded coherence gaps, and aggregates them using a tail-focused risk functional with a MAX-composite step risk to surface decisive anomalies. We evaluate TRACER on $τ^2$-bench by predicting task failure and selective task execution. To this end, TRACER improves AUROC by up to 37.1% and AUARC by up to 55% over baselines, enabling earlier and more accurate detection of uncertainty in complex conversational tool-use settings.

*Chengrui Qu,Christopher Yeh,Kishan Panaganti,Eric Mazumdar,Adam Wierman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DrIGM introduces distributionally robust value factorization for multi-agent RL to improve robustness against environmental uncertainties while maintaining decentralized execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current centralized training with decentralized execution methods in MARL rely on IGM principle but are unreliable in real-world settings due to environmental uncertainties (sim-to-real gap, model mismatch, system noise).

Method: Proposes Distributionally robust IGM (DrIGM) principle requiring agents' robust greedy actions to align with robust team-optimal joint action. Derives robust individual action values compatible with decentralized execution, and creates DrIGM-compliant variants of existing architectures (VDN/QMIX/QTRAN) that train on robust Q-targets while preserving scalability.

Result: Methods consistently improve out-of-distribution performance on high-fidelity SustainGym simulators and StarCraft game environment, with provable robustness guarantees for the whole system.

Conclusion: DrIGM provides a principled approach to robust multi-agent RL that maintains decentralized execution while improving reliability against environmental uncertainties, with seamless integration into existing codebases.

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) commonly adopts centralized training with decentralized execution, where value-factorization methods enforce the individual-global-maximum (IGM) principle so that decentralized greedy actions recover the team-optimal joint action. However, the reliability of this recipe in real-world settings remains unreliable due to environmental uncertainties arising from the sim-to-real gap, model mismatch, and system noise. We address this gap by introducing Distributionally robust IGM (DrIGM), a principle that requires each agent's robust greedy action to align with the robust team-optimal joint action. We show that DrIGM holds for a novel definition of robust individual action values, which is compatible with decentralized greedy execution and yields a provable robustness guarantee for the whole system. Building on this foundation, we derive DrIGM-compliant robust variants of existing value-factorization architectures (e.g., VDN/QMIX/QTRAN) that (i) train on robust Q-targets, (ii) preserve scalability, and (iii) integrate seamlessly with existing codebases without bespoke per-agent reward shaping. Empirically, on high-fidelity SustainGym simulators and a StarCraft game environment, our methods consistently improve out-of-distribution performance.

*Zhengbo Jiao,Shaobo Wang,Zifan Zhang,Wei Wang,Bing Zhao,Hu Wei,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AT-RL selectively reinforces high-connectivity visual-textual tokens via graph clustering, achieving superior performance with minimal overhead by focusing credit assignment on visual anchors rather than all tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While RLVR improves MLLM reasoning, it's unclear how visual evidence is integrated during reasoning. The authors aim to understand cross-modal attention connectivity and improve multimodal reinforcement learning efficiency.

Method: Analyze multimodal RLVR through cross-modal attention connectivity, identify high-connectivity anchor tokens (~15%), and propose Anchor-Token Reinforcement Learning (AT-RL) that selectively reinforces these anchors via graph-based clustering of attention topology.

Result: AT-RL adds only 1.2% overhead but enables 32B model to surpass 72B-Instruct baseline on MathVista (80.2), with consistent gains across STEM, video, and general tasks. Training on low-connectivity tokens causes severe degradation.

Conclusion: Reasoning quality depends on fidelity of cross-modal anchoring rather than token quantity. Effective multimodal RL requires precise credit assignment to visual anchors, not reinforcement of all tokens.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), yet how visual evidence is integrated during reasoning remains poorly understood. We explore multimodal RLVR through the lens of cross-modal attention connectivity and find that only a small fraction of tokens (approximately 15%) exhibit strong visual-textual coupling. These high-connectivity tokens act as anchors that ground reasoning in the image, while the majority follow linguistic patterns. During RLVR training, credit assignment naturally concentrates on these anchors, sharpening their visual grounding over time. Building on this insight, we propose Anchor-Token Reinforcement Learning (AT-RL), a lightweight framework that selectively reinforces high-connectivity tokens via graph-based clustering of attention topology. Evaluated across the series (3B-32B), AT-RL introduces only 1.2% overhead yet enables the 32B model to surpass the 72B-Instruct baseline on MathVista (80.2), with consistent gains observed across STEM, video and general tasks. Conversely, training solely on low-connectivity tokens causes severe degradation, confirming that effective multimodal RL hinges on precise credit assignment to visual anchors. Our work reveals that reasoning quality is governed not by token quantity but by the fidelity of cross-modal anchoring.

### [90] [AgentLeak: A Full-Stack Benchmark for Privacy Leakage in Multi-Agent LLM Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11510)
*Faouzi El Yagoubi,Ranwa Al Mallah,Godwin Badu-Marfo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentLeak is the first full-stack benchmark for measuring privacy leakage in multi-agent LLM systems across internal channels (inter-agent messages, shared memory, tool arguments), revealing that output-only audits miss 41.7% of violations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current privacy benchmarks for LLM systems only measure output leakage, but multi-agent systems create new privacy risks through internal channels like inter-agent messages, shared memory, and tool arguments that current methods cannot detect.

Method: Developed AgentLeak benchmark with 1,000 scenarios across healthcare, finance, legal, and corporate domains, featuring 32-class attack taxonomy and three-tier detection pipeline. Tested 5 LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mistral Large, Llama 3.3 70B) across 4,979 traces, measuring leakage across different channels.

Result: Multi-agent systems reduce output channel leakage (27.2% vs 43.2% single-agent) but increase total system exposure to 68.9% due to internal channels. Inter-agent messages leak at 68.8% vs 27.2% on output channel. Output-only audits miss 41.7% of violations. Claude 3.5 Sonnet had lowest leakage (3.3% external, 28.1% internal). Pattern C2 > C1 holds consistently across all models and domains.

Conclusion: Inter-agent communication is the primary vulnerability in multi-agent LLM systems. Current output-only privacy audits are insufficient, requiring new coordination frameworks with internal-channel privacy protections and privacy controls on inter-agent communication.

Abstract: Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems create privacy risks that current benchmarks cannot measure. When agents coordinate on tasks, sensitive data passes through inter-agent messages, shared memory, and tool arguments; pathways that output-only audits never inspect. We introduce AgentLeak, to the best of our knowledge the first full-stack benchmark for privacy leakage covering internal channels, spanning 1,000 scenarios across healthcare, finance, legal, and corporate domains, paired with a 32-class attack taxonomy and three-tier detection pipeline. Testing GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mistral Large, and Llama 3.3 70B across 4,979 traces reveals that multi-agent configurations reduce per-channel output leakage (C1: 27.2% vs 43.2% in single-agent) but introduce unmonitored internal channels that raise total system exposure to 68.9% (OR-aggregated across C1, C2, C5). Internal channels account for most of this gap: inter-agent messages (C2) leak at 68.8%, compared to 27.2% on C1 (output channel). This means that output-only audits miss 41.7% of violations. Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which emphasizes safety alignment in its design, achieves the lowest leakage rates on both external (3.3%) and internal (28.1%) channels, suggesting that model-level safety training may transfer to internal channel protection. Across all five models and four domains, the pattern C2 > C1 holds consistently, confirming that inter-agent communication is the primary vulnerability. These findings underscore the need for coordination frameworks that incorporate internal-channel privacy protections and enforce privacy controls on inter-agent communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI approaches focus on task-specific outputs or static knowledge, but neglect continuous refinement of internal reasoning structures, action scheduling policies, and learning mechanisms themselves, which is crucial for sustained adaptation in dynamic real-world environments.

Method: Human-inspired continuous learning framework that unifies reasoning, action, reflection, and verification within sequential reasoning enhanced by parallel learning. It records internal reasoning trajectories and environmental interactions as structured learning material, enabling optimization of reasoning organization, scheduling, and evolution. Supports controlled replacement of predefined logic with learned procedures and hierarchical learning-to-learn mechanisms.

Result: Experimental results on temperature sensor abnormality detection show 23.9% reduction in average runtime when incorporating internal-process learning.

Conclusion: The framework enables AI systems to progressively evolve their internal cognitive architecture while preserving operational stability, representing a significant advancement toward more adaptive and efficient AI systems.

Abstract: Learning internal reasoning processes is crucial for developing AI systems capable of sustained adaptation in dynamic real-world environments. However, most existing approaches primarily emphasize learning task-specific outputs or static knowledge representations, while overlooking the continuous refinement of internal reasoning structures, action scheduling policies, and learning mechanisms themselves. In this paper, we propose a human-inspired continuous learning framework that unifies reasoning, action, reflection, and verification within a sequential reasoning model enhanced by parallel learning. The framework explicitly treats internal thinking processes as primary learning objects. It systematically records internal reasoning trajectories and environmental interactions as structured learning material, enabling the system to optimize not only task-level content but also the organization, scheduling, and evolution of reasoning activities. This design realizes learning alongside processing, allowing cognitive structures to improve during execution. Furthermore, the framework supports controlled replacement of predefined logic with learned procedures and introduces a hierarchical learning-to-learn mechanism that jointly adapts task-level parameters and learning strategies. As a result, the system progressively evolves its internal cognitive architecture while preserving operational stability. Experimental results on a temperature sensor abnormality detection task show that incorporating internal-process learning reduces average runtime by 23.9%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional causal analysis requires dual expertise in statistics and computer science, involves manual algorithm selection, data quality handling, and complex result interpretation, creating significant technical barriers for researchers.

Method: Integrates Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Model Context Protocol (MCP) to automate the entire causal inference workflow from data cleaning to report generation through natural language interaction.

Conclusion: CausalAgent represents a novel user-centered human-AI collaboration paradigm that explicitly models analysis workflows, making causal inference more accessible without compromising methodological rigor.

Abstract: Causal inference holds immense value in fields such as healthcare, economics, and social sciences. However, traditional causal analysis workflows impose significant technical barriers, requiring researchers to possess dual backgrounds in statistics and computer science, while manually selecting algorithms, handling data quality issues, and interpreting complex results. To address these challenges, we propose CausalAgent, a conversational multi-agent system for end-to-end causal inference. The system innovatively integrates Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to achieve automation from data cleaning and causal structure learning to bias correction and report generation through natural language interaction. Users need only upload a dataset and pose questions in natural language to receive a rigorous, interactive analysis report. As a novel user-centered human-AI collaboration paradigm, CausalAgent explicitly models the analysis workflow. By leveraging interactive visualizations, it significantly lowers the barrier to entry for causal analysis while ensuring the rigor and interpretability of the process.

Result: On cost-augmented StableToolBench, INTENT strictly enforces hard budget feasibility while substantially improving task success over baselines, and remains robust under dynamic market shifts like tool price changes and varying budgets.

Conclusion: INTENT effectively addresses the challenges of budget-constrained tool-augmented agents through inference-time planning with intention-aware hierarchical modeling, enabling practical deployment of LLM agents with strict monetary constraints.

Abstract: We study budget-constrained tool-augmented agents, where a large language model must solve multi-step tasks by invoking external tools under a strict monetary budget. We formalize this setting as sequential decision making in context space with priced and stochastic tool executions, making direct planning intractable due to massive state-action spaces, high variance of outcomes and prohibitive exploration cost. To address these challenges, we propose INTENT, an inference-time planning framework that leverages an intention-aware hierarchical world model to anticipate future tool usage, risk-calibrated cost, and guide decisions online. Across cost-augmented StableToolBench, INTENT strictly enforces hard budget feasibility while substantially improving task success over baselines, and remains robust under dynamic market shifts such as tool price changes and varying budgets.

TL;DR: SemaPop-GAN integrates LLMs with generative modeling for semantic-statistical population synthesis, using persona representations from survey data as conditioning signals while enforcing marginal alignment with target distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing population synthesis methods focus on structured attributes and statistical constraints, lacking semantic-conditioned generation that captures abstract behavioral patterns implicit in survey data.

Method: Proposes SemaPop framework using WGAN-GP backbone, deriving high-level persona representations from individual survey records as semantic conditioning signals, with marginal regularization for alignment with target population marginals.

Result: SemaPop-GAN achieves improved generative performance with closer alignment to target marginal and joint distributions while maintaining sample-level feasibility and diversity under semantic conditioning.

Conclusion: SemaPop-GAN enables controllable and interpretable population synthesis through effective semantic-statistical fusion, providing a modular foundation for generative population projection systems.

Abstract: Population synthesis is a critical component of individual-level socio-economic simulation, yet remains challenging due to the need to jointly represent statistical structure and latent behavioral semantics. Existing population synthesis approaches predominantly rely on structured attributes and statistical constraints, leaving a gap in semantic-conditioned population generation that can capture abstract behavioral patterns implicitly in survey data. This study proposes SemaPop, a semantic-statistical population synthesis model that integrates large language models (LLMs) with generative population modeling. SemaPop derives high-level persona representations from individual survey records and incorporates them as semantic conditioning signals for population generation, while marginal regularization is introduced to enforce alignment with target population marginals. In this study, the framework is instantiated using a Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) backbone, referred to as SemaPop-GAN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemaPop-GAN achieves improved generative performance, yielding closer alignment with target marginal and joint distributions while maintaining sample-level feasibility and diversity under semantic conditioning. Ablation studies further confirm the contribution of semantic persona conditioning and architectural design choices to balancing marginal consistency and structural realism. These results demonstrate that SemaPop-GAN enables controllable and interpretable population synthesis through effective semantic-statistical information fusion. SemaPop-GAN also provides a promising modular foundation for developing generative population projection systems that integrate individual-level behavioral semantics with population-level statistical constraints.

TL;DR: ARC learns dynamic per-query agent configurations via RL, outperforming fixed templates with 25% higher accuracy and lower costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based agent systems use fixed templates or hand-tuned heuristics for configuration, leading to brittle behavior and unnecessary compute since the same cumbersome configuration is applied to both easy and hard queries.

Method: Formulates agent configuration as a query-wise decision problem and introduces ARC (Agentic Resource & Configuration learner), which learns a light-weight hierarchical policy using reinforcement learning to dynamically tailor configurations (workflows, tools, token budgets, prompts).

Result: Across multiple benchmarks spanning reasoning and tool-augmented question answering, the learned policy consistently outperforms strong hand-designed and other baselines, achieving up to 25% higher task accuracy while also reducing token and runtime costs.

Conclusion: Learning per-query agent configurations is a powerful alternative to "one size fits all" designs, demonstrating that dynamic configuration can significantly improve both performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Configuring LLM-based agent systems involves choosing workflows, tools, token budgets, and prompts from a large combinatorial design space, and is typically handled today by fixed large templates or hand-tuned heuristics. This leads to brittle behavior and unnecessary compute, since the same cumbersome configuration is often applied to both easy and hard input queries. We formulate agent configuration as a query-wise decision problem and introduce ARC (Agentic Resource & Configuration learner), which learns a light-weight hierarchical policy using reinforcement learning to dynamically tailor these configurations. Across multiple benchmarks spanning reasoning and tool-augmented question answering, the learned policy consistently outperforms strong hand-designed and other baselines, achieving up to 25% higher task accuracy while also reducing token and runtime costs. These results demonstrate that learning per-query agent configurations is a powerful alternative to "one size fits all" designs.

TL;DR: Survey of multi-agent communication (MA-Comm) frameworks through the Five Ws lens, tracing evolution from MARL to Emergent Language to LLM-based systems, highlighting trade-offs and open challenges for hybrid approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Communication is essential for multi-agent collaboration in dynamic, partially observable environments, but existing approaches have limitations in interpretability, generalization, and scalability that need systematic analysis.

Method: Uses the Five Ws framework (who, what, when, where, why) to analyze multi-agent communication across three paradigms: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), Emergent Language (EL), and Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems.

Result: Identifies evolution from hand-designed protocols in MARL to end-to-end learned communication, then to structured symbolic communication in EL, and finally to natural language priors in LLMs, with each having distinct trade-offs in task-specificity, interpretability, grounding, and scalability.

Conclusion: Future hybrid systems should combine learning, language, and control for scalable and interpretable multi-agent collaboration, addressing remaining challenges in grounding, generalization, and practical design patterns.

Abstract: Multi-agent sequential decision-making powers many real-world systems, from autonomous vehicles and robotics to collaborative AI assistants. In dynamic, partially observable environments, communication is often what reduces uncertainty and makes collaboration possible. This survey reviews multi-agent communication (MA-Comm) through the Five Ws: who communicates with whom, what is communicated, when communication occurs, and why communication is beneficial. This framing offers a clean way to connect ideas across otherwise separate research threads. We trace how communication approaches have evolved across three major paradigms. In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), early methods used hand-designed or implicit protocols, followed by end-to-end learned communication optimized for reward and control. While successful, these protocols are frequently task-specific and hard to interpret, motivating work on Emergent Language (EL), where agents can develop more structured or symbolic communication through interaction. EL methods, however, still struggle with grounding, generalization, and scalability, which has fueled recent interest in large language models (LLMs) that bring natural language priors for reasoning, planning, and collaboration in more open-ended settings. Across MARL, EL, and LLM-based systems, we highlight how different choices shape communication design, where the main trade-offs lie, and what remains unsolved. We distill practical design patterns and open challenges to support future hybrid systems that combine learning, language, and control for scalable and interpretable multi-agent collaboration.

TL;DR: MAPLE introduces modality-aware RL post-training with benchmark annotation, policy optimization, and adaptive curriculum to address modality-blind training issues in multimodal language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL post-training pipelines treat all input signals equally, ignoring which modalities each task actually requires, leading to inflated policy-gradient variance, slow convergence, and poor robustness to real-world distribution shifts where signals may be missing, added, or reweighted.

Method: MAPLE consists of: (1) MAPLE-bench benchmark annotating minimal signal combinations per task; (2) MAPO modality-aware policy optimization framework that stratifies batches by modality requirement; (3) Adaptive weighting and curriculum scheduling that balances and prioritizes harder signal combinations.

Result: MAPLE narrows uni/multi-modal accuracy gaps by 30.24%, converges 3.18x faster, and maintains stability across all modality combinations under realistic reduced signal access.

Conclusion: MAPLE constitutes a complete recipe for deployment-ready multimodal RL post-training that addresses modality-aware training challenges through systematic benchmark annotation, policy optimization, and adaptive curriculum design.

Abstract: Multimodal language models now integrate text, audio, and video for unified reasoning. Yet existing RL post-training pipelines treat all input signals as equally relevant, ignoring which modalities each task actually requires. This modality-blind training inflates policy-gradient variance, slows convergence, and degrades robustness to real-world distribution shifts where signals may be missing, added, or reweighted. We introduce MAPLE, a complete modality-aware post-training and learning ecosystem comprising: (1) MAPLE-bench, the first benchmark explicitly annotating minimal signal combinations required per task; (2) MAPO, a modality-aware policy optimization framework that stratifies batches by modality requirement to reduce gradient variance from heterogeneous group advantages; (3) Adaptive weighting and curriculum scheduling that balances and prioritizes harder signal combinations. Systematic analysis across loss aggregation, clipping, sampling, and curriculum design establishes MAPO's optimal training strategy. Adaptive weighting and curriculum focused learning further boost performance across signal combinations. MAPLE narrows uni/multi-modal accuracy gaps by 30.24%, converges 3.18x faster, and maintains stability across all modality combinations under realistic reduced signal access. MAPLE constitutes a complete recipe for deployment-ready multimodal RL post-training.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: scPilot is the first framework enabling LLMs to perform omics-native reasoning by directly inspecting single-cell RNA-seq data and using bioinformatics tools for step-by-step analysis tasks like cell-type annotation and trajectory reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM approaches lack direct grounding in raw omics data, limiting their ability to perform transparent, auditable, and diagnostically informative single-cell analyses with proper justification and evidence-based revision.

Method: Converts core single-cell analyses into step-by-step reasoning problems where LLMs converse in natural language while directly inspecting scRNA-seq data and using on-demand bioinformatics tools, with iterative reasoning and revision based on new evidence.

Result: Iterative omics-native reasoning improves average accuracy by 11% for cell-type annotation (o1 model), Gemini-2.5-Pro reduces trajectory graph-edit distance by 30% vs one-shot prompting, and generates transparent reasoning traces explaining marker gene ambiguity and regulatory logic.

Conclusion: scPilot enables auditable, interpretable, and diagnostically informative single-cell analyses by grounding LLMs in raw omics data, with released scBench evaluation suite showing significant improvements over conventional prompting methods.

Abstract: We present scPilot, the first systematic framework to practice omics-native reasoning: a large language model (LLM) converses in natural language while directly inspecting single-cell RNA-seq data and on-demand bioinformatics tools. scPilot converts core single-cell analyses, i.e., cell-type annotation, developmental-trajectory reconstruction, and transcription-factor targeting, into step-by-step reasoning problems that the model must solve, justify, and, when needed, revise with new evidence.
  To measure progress, we release scBench, a suite of 9 expertly curated datasets and graders that faithfully evaluate the omics-native reasoning capability of scPilot w.r.t various LLMs. Experiments with o1 show that iterative omics-native reasoning lifts average accuracy by 11% for cell-type annotation and Gemini-2.5-Pro cuts trajectory graph-edit distance by 30% versus one-shot prompting, while generating transparent reasoning traces explain marker gene ambiguity and regulatory logic. By grounding LLMs in raw omics data, scPilot enables auditable, interpretable, and diagnostically informative single-cell analyses.

*Aman Mehta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM agents show inconsistent behavior across identical task runs, with variance predicting failure - consistent tasks achieve 80-92% accuracy while inconsistent ones drop to 25-60%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLM agents produce consistent behavior when running the same task multiple times, and whether this consistency relates to task success.

Method: Conducted 3,000 agent runs across three models (Llama 3.1 70B, GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4.5) on HotpotQA using ReAct-style agents, measuring distinct action sequences per 10 runs and analyzing when divergence occurs.

Result: Agents produce 2.0-4.2 distinct action sequences per 10 runs on average. Variance predicts failure: consistent tasks (≤2 unique paths) achieve 80-92% accuracy, while inconsistent ones (≥6 unique paths) drop to 25-60%. 69% of divergence occurs at step 2 (first search query).

Conclusion: Monitoring behavioral consistency during execution could enable early error detection and improve agent reliability, as variance emerges early and strongly predicts failure.

Abstract: Run the same LLM agent on the same task twice: do you get the same behavior? We find the answer is often no. In a study of 3,000 agent runs across three models (Llama 3.1 70B, GPT-4o, and Claude Sonnet 4.5) on HotpotQA, we observe that ReAct-style agents produce 2.0--4.2 distinct action sequences per 10 runs on average, even with identical inputs. More importantly, this variance predicts failure: tasks with consistent behavior ($\leq$2 unique paths) achieve 80--92% accuracy, while highly inconsistent tasks ($\geq$6 unique paths) achieve only 25--60%, a 32--55 percentage point gap depending on model. We trace variance to early decisions: 69% of divergence occurs at step 2, the first search query. Our results suggest that monitoring behavioral consistency during execution could enable early error detection and improve agent reliability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NMIPS is a neuro-assisted multitasking symbolic PDE solver that discovers analytical solutions for PDE families using multifactorial optimization and affine transfer, achieving ~35.7% higher accuracy than baselines while providing interpretable expressions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical methods require solving each PDE instance independently, incurring massive computational costs. Machine learning PDE solvers offer speed but lack interpretability as they only provide numerical approximations without analytical expressions needed for scientific insight.

Method: Proposes NMIPS framework using multifactorial optimization to simultaneously discover analytical solutions for PDE families. Introduces affine transfer method to transfer learned mathematical structures among related PDEs, avoiding solving each from scratch.

Result: Experimental results across multiple cases show promising improvements over existing baselines, achieving up to ~35.7% increase in accuracy while providing interpretable analytical solutions.

Conclusion: NMIPS addresses limitations of both traditional numerical methods and machine learning PDE solvers by providing computationally efficient, interpretable analytical solutions for PDE families through neuro-assisted symbolic solving with structure transfer.

Abstract: Solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is fundamental to numerous scientific and engineering disciplines. A common challenge arises from solving the PDE families, which are characterized by sharing an identical mathematical structure but varying in specific parameters. Traditional numerical methods, such as the finite element method, need to independently solve each instance within a PDE family, which incurs massive computational cost. On the other hand, while recent advancements in machine learning PDE solvers offer impressive computational speed and accuracy, their inherent ``black-box" nature presents a considerable limitation. These methods primarily yield numerical approximations, thereby lacking the crucial interpretability provided by analytical expressions, which are essential for deeper scientific insight. To address these limitations, we propose a neuro-assisted multitasking symbolic PDE solver framework for PDE family solving, dubbed NMIPS. In particular, we employ multifactorial optimization to simultaneously discover the analytical solutions of PDEs. To enhance computational efficiency, we devise an affine transfer method by transferring learned mathematical structures among PDEs in a family, avoiding solving each PDE from scratch. Experimental results across multiple cases demonstrate promising improvements over existing baselines, achieving up to a $\sim$35.7% increase in accuracy while providing interpretable analytical solutions.

TL;DR: MathSpatial is a framework for evaluating and improving mathematical spatial reasoning in MLLMs, featuring a benchmark, training corpus, and structured reasoning method that achieves competitive accuracy with 25% fewer tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs perform poorly on mathematical spatial reasoning tasks (below 60% accuracy) despite humans achieving over 95% accuracy, revealing a fundamental weakness in current models that needs to be addressed.

Method: MathSpatial includes three components: (1) MathSpatial-Bench benchmark with 2K problems across 3 categories and 11 subtypes, (2) MathSpatial-Corpus training dataset with 8K verified problems, and (3) MathSpatial-SRT structured reasoning method using three atomic operations (Correlate, Constrain, Infer).

Result: Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on MathSpatial achieves competitive accuracy while reducing tokens by 25%, demonstrating effective improvement in spatial reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: MathSpatial provides the first large-scale resource that disentangles perception from reasoning, enabling precise measurement and comprehensive understanding of mathematical spatial reasoning in MLLMs, addressing a critical gap in current multimodal AI capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on perception-oriented tasks, yet their ability to perform mathematical spatial reasoning, defined as the capacity to parse and manipulate two- and three-dimensional relations, remains unclear. Humans easily solve textbook-style spatial reasoning problems with over 95\% accuracy, but we find that most leading MLLMs fail to reach even 60\% on the same tasks. This striking gap highlights spatial reasoning as a fundamental weakness of current models. To investigate this gap, we present MathSpatial, a unified framework for evaluating and improving spatial reasoning in MLLMs. MathSpatial includes three complementary components: (i) MathSpatial-Bench, a benchmark of 2K problems across three categories and eleven subtypes, designed to isolate reasoning difficulty from perceptual noise; (ii) MathSpatial-Corpus, a training dataset of 8K additional problems with verified solutions; and (iii) MathSpatial-SRT, which models reasoning as structured traces composed of three atomic operations--Correlate, Constrain, and Infer. Experiments show that fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on MathSpatial achieves competitive accuracy while reducing tokens by 25\%. MathSpatial provides the first large-scale resource that disentangles perception from reasoning, enabling precise measurement and comprehensive understanding of mathematical spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

TL;DR: Proposes a new medical alignment paradigm with multi-dimensional matrix and unified optimization to address RLHF limitations in medical QA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF for LLM alignment has paradigm mismatch in medical QA: expensive preference annotations don't reflect absolute correctness, lack of effective automatic verifiers, and multi-objective optimization conflicts in medical alignment.

Method: Construct holistic multi-dimensional medical alignment matrix with 4 categories (fundamental capabilities, expert knowledge, online feedback, format specs) with closed-loop metrics→diagnosis→rewards. Use Reference-Frozen Normalization for scale alignment and Tri-Factor Adaptive Dynamic Weighting for collaborative optimization.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness in real-world medical scenario evaluations, establishing new paradigm for complex alignment in vertical domains.

Conclusion: Proposes robust medical alignment paradigm that addresses RLHF limitations through structured matrix and unified optimization mechanism for medical QA alignment.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning for large language model alignment has progressed rapidly in recent years, transferring these paradigms to high-stakes medical question answering reveals a fundamental paradigm mismatch. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback relies on preference annotations that are prohibitively expensive and often fail to reflect the absolute correctness of medical facts. Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards lacks effective automatic verifiers and struggles to handle complex clinical contexts. Meanwhile, medical alignment requires the simultaneous optimization of correctness, safety, and compliance, yet multi-objective heterogeneous reward signals are prone to scale mismatch and optimization conflicts.To address these challenges, we propose a robust medical alignment paradigm. We first construct a holistic multi-dimensional medical alignment matrix that decomposes alignment objectives into four categories: fundamental capabilities, expert knowledge, online feedback, and format specifications. Within each category, we establish a closed loop of where observable metrics inform attributable diagnosis, which in turn drives optimizable rewards, thereby providing fine-grained, high-resolution supervision signals for subsequent iterative optimization. To resolve gradient domination and optimization instability problem caused by heterogeneous signals, we further propose a unified optimization mechanism. This mechanism employs Reference-Frozen Normalization to align reward scales and implements a Tri-Factor Adaptive Dynamic Weighting strategy to achieve collaborative optimization that is weakness-oriented, risk-prioritized, and redundancy-reducing. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed paradigm in real-world medical scenario evaluations, establishing a new paradigm for complex alignment in vertical domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PhyNiKCE is a neurosymbolic framework that decouples neural planning from symbolic validation to ensure physical correctness in autonomous CFD simulations, achieving 96% improvement over baselines while reducing error loops by 59% and token usage by 17%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based autonomous agents for CFD struggle with enforcing strict conservation laws and numerical stability due to their probabilistic nature, leading to physically invalid configurations through "context poisoning" from purely semantic RAG approaches.

Method: PhyNiKCE employs a Symbolic Knowledge Engine that treats simulation setup as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem, using a Deterministic RAG Engine with specialized retrieval for solvers, turbulence models, and boundary conditions to rigidly enforce physical constraints.

Result: The framework demonstrated 96% relative improvement over state-of-the-art baselines in OpenFOAM experiments on practical CFD tasks, reduced autonomous self-correction loops by 59%, and lowered LLM token consumption by 17%.

Conclusion: Decoupling neural generation from symbolic constraint enforcement significantly enhances robustness and efficiency in autonomous engineering simulations, offering a scalable, auditable paradigm for Trustworthy AI in broader industrial automation beyond CFD.

Abstract: The deployment of autonomous agents for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), is critically limited by the probabilistic nature of Large Language Models (LLMs), which struggle to enforce the strict conservation laws and numerical stability required for physics-based simulations. Reliance on purely semantic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) often leads to "context poisoning," where agents generate linguistically plausible but physically invalid configurations due to a fundamental Semantic-Physical Disconnect. To bridge this gap, this work introduces PhyNiKCE (Physical and Numerical Knowledgeable Context Engineering), a neurosymbolic agentic framework for trustworthy engineering. Unlike standard black-box agents, PhyNiKCE decouples neural planning from symbolic validation. It employs a Symbolic Knowledge Engine that treats simulation setup as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem, rigidly enforcing physical constraints via a Deterministic RAG Engine with specialized retrieval strategies for solvers, turbulence models, and boundary conditions. Validated through rigorous OpenFOAM experiments on practical, non-tutorial CFD tasks using Gemini-2.5-Pro/Flash, PhyNiKCE demonstrates a 96% relative improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, by replacing trial-and-error with knowledge-driven initialization, the framework reduced autonomous self-correction loops by 59% while simultaneously lowering LLM token consumption by 17%. These results demonstrate that decoupling neural generation from symbolic constraint enforcement significantly enhances robustness and efficiency. While validated on CFD, this architecture offers a scalable, auditable paradigm for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in broader industrial automation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LLM benchmarks are becoming unreliable due to score inflation and selective reporting, creating uncertainty about trustworthy evaluation results.

Method: Introduces Benchmark Health Index (BHI) with three orthogonal axes: Capability Discrimination (separates performance beyond noise), Anti-Saturation (estimates remaining headroom), and Impact (quantifies ecosystem influence). Analyzes 106 benchmarks from 91 models in 2025.

Result: Systematically characterizes the evaluation landscape and provides the first framework to quantify benchmark health at macro level for principled benchmark selection.

Conclusion: BHI enables dynamic lifecycle management for next-generation evaluation protocols by providing a data-driven approach to benchmark auditing and selection.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are advancing rapidly, yet the benchmarks used to measure this progress are becoming increasingly unreliable. Score inflation and selective reporting have eroded the authority of standard benchmarks, leaving the community uncertain about which evaluation results remain trustworthy. We introduce the Benchmark Health Index (BHI), a pure data-driven framework for auditing evaluation sets along three orthogonal and complementary axes: (1) Capability Discrimination, measuring how sharply a benchmark separates model performance beyond noise; (2) Anti-Saturation, estimating remaining headroom before ceiling effects erode resolution and thus the benchmark's expected longevity; and (3) Impact, quantifying influence across academic and industrial ecosystems via adoption breadth and practice-shaping power. By distilling 106 validated benchmarks from the technical reports of 91 representative models in 2025, we systematically characterize the evaluation landscape. BHI is the first framework to quantify benchmark health at a macro level, providing a principled basis for benchmark selection and enabling dynamic lifecycle management for next-generation evaluation protocols.

### [105] [Right for the Wrong Reasons: Epistemic Regret Minimization for Causal Rung Collapse in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11675)
*Edward Y. Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies "Rung Collapse" as a causal pathology in autoregressive training where models learn associations instead of interventions, leading to "Aleatoric Entrenchment" where correct answers reinforce flawed reasoning. The authors propose Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM) to penalize causal reasoning errors independently of task success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning systems often achieve high performance through shortcuts that fail under distributional shift - being "right for the wrong reasons." This pathology has a precise causal origin in how autoregressive training fails to distinguish between association P(Y|X) and intervention P(Y|do(X)), leading to entrenched flawed reasoning.

Method: Propose Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM), a belief revision objective that penalizes errors in causal reasoning independently of task success. Implement a three-layer architecture with: (1) Physical Grounding Theorem proving actions satisfying actuator independence implement valid do-operations; (2) ERM as causal belief revision operator satisfying AGM postulates; (3) failure mode taxonomy with domain-independent guards for cross-domain transfer.

Result: Experiments on 1,360 causal trap scenarios across six frontier LLMs show Rung Collapse persists even in reasoning-enhanced models (3.7% for GPT-5.2), steerability exhibits inverse scaling where advanced models resist generic correction, and targeted ERM feedback recovers 53-59% of entrenched errors where outcome-level feedback fails. Prove asymptotic recovery of true interventional distribution with finite-sample bounds.

Conclusion: The paper provides a causal framework for understanding and addressing the "right for the wrong reasons" problem in ML systems. ERM offers a principled approach to prevent entrenchment in flawed causal reasoning while maintaining task performance, with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation across state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Machine learning systems that are "right for the wrong reasons" achieve high performance through shortcuts that collapse under distributional shift. We show this pathology has a precise causal origin: autoregressive training provides no gradient signal to distinguish association P(Y|X) from intervention P(Y|do(X)), a failure we formalize as Rung Collapse. When outcome-based learning reinforces correct answers obtained through incorrect causal models, the agent becomes entrenched in flawed reasoning, a phenomenon we term Aleatoric Entrenchment. We propose Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM), a belief revision objective that penalizes errors in causal reasoning independently of task success, and embed it within a three-layer architecture with three contributions grounded in knowledge representation: (1) a Physical Grounding Theorem proving that actions satisfying actuator independence implement valid do-operations, bridging action languages and do-calculus; (2) ERM as a causal belief revision operator satisfying AGM postulates, preventing entrenchment even when the agent succeeds for the wrong reasons; and (3) a failure mode taxonomy that classifies recurring reasoning errors and injects domain-independent guards, enabling cross-domain transfer. We prove asymptotic recovery of the true interventional distribution with finite-sample bounds. Experiments on 1,360 causal trap scenarios across six frontier LLMs reveal that Rung Collapse persists even in reasoning-enhanced models (3.7% for GPT-5.2), that steerability exhibits inverse scaling where advanced models resist generic correction, and that targeted ERM feedback recovers 53-59% of entrenched errors where outcome-level feedback fails.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs suffer from structural blindness - they fail to capture topology and symbolic logic in engineering schematics because their pixel-driven paradigm discards explicit vector-defined relations needed for reasoning.

Method: Proposes Vector-to-Graph (V2G) pipeline that converts CAD diagrams into property graphs where nodes represent components and edges encode connectivity, making structural dependencies explicit and machine-auditable.

Result: On a diagnostic benchmark of electrical compliance checks, V2G yields large accuracy gains across all error categories, while leading MLLMs remain near chance level.

Conclusion: Structure-aware representations provide a reliable path toward practical deployment of multimodal AI in engineering domains, highlighting the systemic inadequacy of pixel-based methods.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable progress in visual understanding, yet they suffer from a critical limitation: structural blindness. Even state-of-the-art models fail to capture topology and symbolic logic in engineering schematics, as their pixel-driven paradigm discards the explicit vector-defined relations needed for reasoning. To overcome this, we propose a Vector-to-Graph (V2G) pipeline that converts CAD diagrams into property graphs where nodes represent components and edges encode connectivity, making structural dependencies explicit and machine-auditable. On a diagnostic benchmark of electrical compliance checks, V2G yields large accuracy gains across all error categories, while leading MLLMs remain near chance level. These results highlight the systemic inadequacy of pixel-based methods and demonstrate that structure-aware representations provide a reliable path toward practical deployment of multimodal AI in engineering domains.

*Xin Xu,Tong Yu,Xiang Chen,Haoliang Wang,Julian McAuley,Saayan Mitra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ThinkRouter is a confidence-aware routing mechanism that dynamically switches between explicit token-based reasoning and latent space reasoning based on model confidence, improving accuracy while reducing generation length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent reasoning efficiency varies across settings, and analysis shows that incorrect reasoning trajectories contain fewer low-confidence steps than correct ones. Soft embeddings from multiple low-confidence alternatives may introduce noise, leading to high confidence in unreliable reasoning.

Method: ThinkRouter routes thinking to discrete token space when model confidence is low (to avoid noise propagation), and to latent space when confidence is high (for efficiency). This inference-time routing mechanism dynamically balances explicit and latent reasoning.

Result: ThinkRouter outperforms explicit CoT, random routing, and latent reasoning baselines on STEM reasoning and coding benchmarks, achieving average 19.70 point improvement in Pass@1 while reducing generation length by up to 15.55%.

Conclusion: ThinkRouter effectively calibrates errors from both explicit CoT and latent reasoning by globally lowering model confidence, accelerating end-of-thinking token generation while maintaining high accuracy through confidence-aware routing.

Abstract: Recent work explores latent reasoning to improve reasoning efficiency by replacing explicit reasoning trajectories with continuous representations in a latent space, yet its effectiveness varies across settings. Analysis of model confidence dynamics under latent reasoning reveals that thinking trajectories ending in incorrect answers contain fewer low-confidence steps than those ending in correct answers. Meanwhile, we suggest that soft embeddings aggregated by multiple low-confidence thinking alternatives may introduce and propagate noise, leading to high confidence in unreliable reasoning trajectories. Motivated by these observations, ThinkRouter, an inference-time confidence-aware routing mechanism is proposed to avoid high confidence and noise for efficient reasoning. ThinkRouter routes thinking to the discrete token space when model confidence is low, and to the latent space otherwise. Extensive experiments on STEM reasoning and coding benchmarks across diverse large reasoning models demonstrate that ThinkRouter outperforms explicit CoT, random routing, and latent reasoning baselines in terms of accuracy, achieving an average improvement of 19.70 points in Pass@1, while reducing generation length by up to 15.55%. Further comprehensive analysis reveals that ThinkRouter can calibrate errors arising from explicit CoT and latent reasoning, and accelerates end-of-thinking token generation by globally lowering model confidence.

TL;DR: SCF-RKL is a novel model merging framework that uses reverse KL divergence and sparse complementary fusion to reduce interference and improve stability compared to existing parameter-space heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model merging methods rely on parameter-space heuristics that cause severe interference, leading to degraded generalization and unstable generation behaviors like repetition and incoherent outputs.

Method: SCF-RKL measures functional divergence between models using reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence and selectively incorporates complementary parameters through sparse, distribution-aware updates, avoiding the assumption of linear additivity in parameter space.

Result: SCF-RKL consistently outperforms existing model merging methods across 24 benchmarks spanning advanced reasoning, general reasoning and knowledge, instruction following, and safety, while maintaining strong generalization and generation stability.

Conclusion: The proposed SCF-RKL framework effectively controls functional interference through sparse complementary fusion, enabling better integration of specialized models without costly retraining while preserving stable representations.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising paradigm for composing the capabilities of large language models by directly operating in weight space, enabling the integration of specialized models without costly retraining. However, existing merging methods largely rely on parameter-space heuristics, which often introduce severe interference, leading to degraded generalization and unstable generation behaviors such as repetition and incoherent outputs. In this work, we propose Sparse Complementary Fusion with reverse KL (SCF-RKL), a novel model merging framework that explicitly controls functional interference through sparse, distribution-aware updates. Instead of assuming linear additivity in parameter space, SCF-RKL measures the functional divergence between models using reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence and selectively incorporates complementary parameters. This mode-seeking, sparsity-inducing design effectively preserves stable representations while integrating new capabilities. We evaluate SCF-RKL across a wide range of model scales and architectures, covering both reasoning-focused and instruction-tuned models. Extensive experiments on 24 benchmarks spanning advanced reasoning, general reasoning and knowledge, instruction following, and safety demonstrate, vision classification that SCF-RKL consistently outperforms existing model merging methods while maintaining strong generalization and generation stability.

Result: Successfully identified specific features: Chinese Communist Party alignment in Qwen3-8B and Deepseek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, American exceptionalism in Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, and copyright refusal mechanism in GPT-OSS-20B.

Conclusion: Cross-architecture crosscoder model diffing with DFCs is an effective method for identifying meaningful behavioral differences between AI models, advancing model safety analysis.

Abstract: Model diffing, the process of comparing models' internal representations to identify their differences, is a promising approach for uncovering safety-critical behaviors in new models. However, its application has so far been primarily focused on comparing a base model with its finetune. Since new LLM releases are often novel architectures, cross-architecture methods are essential to make model diffing widely applicable. Crosscoders are one solution capable of cross-architecture model diffing but have only ever been applied to base vs finetune comparisons. We provide the first application of crosscoders to cross-architecture model diffing and introduce Dedicated Feature Crosscoders (DFCs), an architectural modification designed to better isolate features unique to one model. Using this technique, we find in an unsupervised fashion features including Chinese Communist Party alignment in Qwen3-8B and Deepseek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, American exceptionalism in Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, and a copyright refusal mechanism in GPT-OSS-20B. Together, our results work towards establishing cross-architecture crosscoder model diffing as an effective method for identifying meaningful behavioral differences between AI models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Text2GQL-Bench is a comprehensive benchmark for Text-to-Graph-Query-Language systems with 178K question-query pairs across 13 domains, featuring multi-GQL support and a novel evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Text-to-GQL datasets are limited in domain coverage, supported query languages, and evaluation scope, hindering systematic advancement of LLM-based graph query systems.

Method: Created Text2GQL-Bench with a scalable framework generating datasets across domains, abstraction levels, and graph query languages (including ISO-GQL), plus a multi-metric evaluation method assessing grammatical validity, similarity, semantic alignment, and execution accuracy.

Result: LLMs show stark dialect gap in ISO-GQL generation (≤4% execution accuracy zero-shot, ~50% with 3-shot prompting). Fine-tuned 8B model achieves 45.1% execution accuracy and 90.8% grammatical validity, showing performance jump requires sufficient ISO-GQL examples.

Conclusion: Text2GQL-Bench addresses critical gaps in Text-to-GQL evaluation, revealing significant challenges in ISO-GQL generation that require specialized training data and prompting strategies for effective graph query translation.

Abstract: Graph models are fundamental to data analysis in domains rich with complex relationships. Text-to-Graph-Query-Language (Text-to-GQL) systems act as a translator, converting natural language into executable graph queries. This capability allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to directly analyze and manipulate graph data, posi-tioning them as powerful agent infrastructures for Graph Database Management System (GDBMS). Despite recent progress, existing datasets are often limited in domain coverage, supported graph query languages, or evaluation scope. The advancement of Text-to-GQL systems is hindered by the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets and evaluation methods to systematically compare model capabilities across different graph query languages and domains. In this work, we present Text2GQL-Bench, a unified Text-to-GQL benchmark designed to address these limitations. Text2GQL-Bench couples a multi-GQL dataset that has 178,184 (Question, Query) pairs spanning 13 domains, with a scalable construction framework that generates datasets in different domains, question abstraction levels, and GQLs with heterogeneous resources. To support compre-hensive assessment, we introduce an evaluation method that goes beyond a single end-to-end metric by jointly reporting grammatical validity, similarity, semantic alignment, and execution accuracy. Our evaluation uncovers a stark dialect gap in ISO-GQL generation: even strong LLMs achieve only at most 4% execution accuracy (EX) in zero-shot settings, though a fixed 3-shot prompt raises accuracy to around 50%, the grammatical validity remains lower than 70%. Moreover, a fine-tuned 8B open-weight model reaches 45.1% EX, and 90.8% grammatical validity, demonstrating that most of the performance jump is unlocked by exposure to sufficient ISO-GQL examples.

### [111] [AIR: Improving Agent Safety through Incident Response](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11749)
*Zibo Xiao,Jun Sun,Junjie Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AIR is an incident response framework for LLM agents that autonomously detects, contains, recovers from, and prevents future incidents through semantic checks, guided remediation, and synthesized guardrail rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agent safety mechanisms focus only on preventing failures in advance, lacking capabilities for responding to, containing, or recovering from incidents after they inevitably occur, creating a critical gap in agent safety.

Method: AIR introduces a domain-specific language for managing incident response lifecycle, integrated into agent execution loop to: (1) detect incidents via semantic checks grounded in environment state and context, (2) guide agents to execute containment/recovery actions via tools, and (3) synthesize guardrail rules during eradication to block similar future incidents.

Result: AIR achieves detection, remediation, and eradication success rates all exceeding 90% across three representative agent types. LLM-generated rules approach effectiveness of developer-authored rules, with moderate overhead and demonstrated timeliness.

Conclusion: Incident response is both feasible and essential as a first-class mechanism for improving LLM agent safety, moving beyond prevention-only approaches to comprehensive safety lifecycle management.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in practice across a wide range of autonomous applications. Yet current safety mechanisms for LLM agents focus almost exclusively on preventing failures in advance, providing limited capabilities for responding to, containing, or recovering from incidents after they inevitably arise. In this work, we introduce AIR, the first incident response framework for LLM agent systems. AIR defines a domain-specific language for managing the incident response lifecycle autonomously in LLM agent systems, and integrates it into the agent's execution loop to (1) detect incidents via semantic checks grounded in the current environment state and recent context, (2) guide the agent to execute containment and recovery actions via its tools, and (3) synthesize guardrail rules during eradication to block similar incidents in future executions. We evaluate AIR on three representative agent types. Results show that AIR achieves detection, remediation, and eradication success rates all exceeding 90%. Extensive experiments further confirm the necessity of AIR's key design components, show the timeliness and moderate overhead of AIR, and demonstrate that LLM-generated rules can approach the effectiveness of developer-authored rules across domains. These results show that incident response is both feasible and essential as a first-class mechanism for improving agent safety.

*Aladin Djuhera,Swanand Ravindra Kadhe,Farhan Ahmed,Holger Boche*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TSR (Trajectory-Search Rollouts) improves multi-turn RL training by using lightweight tree search during rollout generation to select high-scoring actions, boosting performance by up to 15% with stable learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-turn RL is challenging due to sparse/delayed rewards and stochastic environments. Naive trajectory sampling can hinder exploitation and cause mode collapse, limiting agent learning effectiveness.

Method: TSR performs lightweight tree-style search at training time to construct high-quality trajectories by selecting high-scoring actions using task-specific feedback. It's optimizer-agnostic and can be instantiated with best-of-N, beam, or shallow lookahead search.

Result: TSR achieves up to 15% performance gains and more stable learning on Sokoban, FrozenLake, and WebShop tasks with a one-time increase in training compute, when paired with PPO and GRPO.

Conclusion: By moving search from inference time to the rollout stage of training, TSR provides a simple, general mechanism for stronger multi-turn agent learning that complements existing frameworks and rejection-sampling methods.

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) are driving a shift toward using reinforcement learning (RL) to train agents from iterative, multi-turn interactions across tasks. However, multi-turn RL remains challenging as rewards are often sparse or delayed, and environments can be stochastic. In this regime, naive trajectory sampling can hinder exploitation and induce mode collapse. We propose TSR (Trajectory-Search Rollouts), a training-time approach that repurposes test-time scaling ideas for improved per-turn rollout generation. TSR performs lightweight tree-style search to construct high-quality trajectories by selecting high-scoring actions at each turn using task-specific feedback. This improves rollout quality and stabilizes learning while leaving the underlying optimization objective unchanged, making TSR optimizer-agnostic. We instantiate TSR with best-of-N, beam, and shallow lookahead search, and pair it with PPO and GRPO, achieving up to 15% performance gains and more stable learning on Sokoban, FrozenLake, and WebShop tasks at a one-time increase in training compute. By moving search from inference time to the rollout stage of training, TSR provides a simple and general mechanism for stronger multi-turn agent learning, complementary to existing frameworks and rejection-sampling-style selection methods.

TL;DR: MaxExp is a decision-driven framework for converting probabilistic SDM predictions to binary presence-absence maps by maximizing evaluation metrics, outperforming traditional thresholding methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current binarization methods for species distribution models are heuristic and distort estimates of species prevalence and community composition, requiring more robust approaches.

Method: MaxExp framework selects most probable species assemblage by directly maximizing chosen evaluation metrics without calibration data; also introduces Set Size Expectation (SSE) method for computationally efficient predictions based on expected species richness.

Result: MaxExp consistently matches or surpasses widely used thresholding and calibration methods across diverse taxa, species counts, and performance metrics, especially under strong class imbalance and high rarity; SSE offers simpler competitive alternative.

Conclusion: MaxExp and SSE provide robust, reproducible tools for multispecies SDM binarization that improve ecological inference and conservation planning.

Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs) commonly produce probabilistic occurrence predictions that must be converted into binary presence-absence maps for ecological inference and conservation planning. However, this binarization step is typically heuristic and can substantially distort estimates of species prevalence and community composition. We present MaxExp, a decision-driven binarization framework that selects the most probable species assemblage by directly maximizing a chosen evaluation metric. MaxExp requires no calibration data and is flexible across several scores. We also introduce the Set Size Expectation (SSE) method, a computationally efficient alternative that predicts assemblages based on expected species richness. Using three case studies spanning diverse taxa, species counts, and performance metrics, we show that MaxExp consistently matches or surpasses widely used thresholding and calibration methods, especially under strong class imbalance and high rarity. SSE offers a simpler yet competitive option. Together, these methods provide robust, reproducible tools for multispecies SDM binarization.

TL;DR: DTAPP-IICR is a scalable preflight planning method for large UAV fleets that uses prioritized planning with iterative conflict resolution, achieving near-100% success for 1,000 UAVs with 50% runtime reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MAPF methods lack scalability and flexibility for real-world UTM with temporal NFZs, heterogeneous UAVs, and strict delivery deadlines in dynamic shared airspace.

Method: Prioritizes missions by urgency, uses SFIPP-ST (4D single-agent planner) for roundtrip trajectories with soft conflict constraints, then performs iterative Large Neighborhood Search guided by geometric conflict graph with directional pruning.

Result: Achieves near-100% success with fleets up to 1,000 UAVs, 50% runtime reduction from pruning, outperforms batch Enhanced Conflict-Based Search, and scales in city-scale operations where other priority-based methods fail.

Conclusion: DTAPP-IICR provides a practical and scalable solution for preflight planning in dense, dynamic urban airspace, positioning it as effective for real-world UTM applications.

Abstract: Preflight planning for large-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) fleets in dynamic, shared airspace presents significant challenges, including temporal No-Fly Zones (NFZs), heterogeneous vehicle profiles, and strict delivery deadlines. While Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) provides a formal framework, existing methods often lack the scalability and flexibility required for real-world Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM). We propose DTAPP-IICR: a Delivery-Time Aware Prioritized Planning method with Incremental and Iterative Conflict Resolution. Our framework first generates an initial solution by prioritizing missions based on urgency. Secondly, it computes roundtrip trajectories using SFIPP-ST, a novel 4D single-agent planner (Safe Flight Interval Path Planning with Soft and Temporal Constraints). SFIPP-ST handles heterogeneous UAVs, strictly enforces temporal NFZs, and models inter-agent conflicts as soft constraints. Subsequently, an iterative Large Neighborhood Search, guided by a geometric conflict graph, efficiently resolves any residual conflicts. A completeness-preserving directional pruning technique further accelerates the 3D search. On benchmarks with temporal NFZs, DTAPP-IICR achieves near-100% success with fleets of up to 1,000 UAVs and gains up to 50% runtime reduction from pruning, outperforming batch Enhanced Conflict-Based Search in the UTM context. Scaling successfully in realistic city-scale operations where other priority-based methods fail even at moderate deployments, DTAPP-IICR is positioned as a practical and scalable solution for preflight planning in dense, dynamic urban airspace.

*Jinfang Wang,Jiajie Liu,Jianwei Wu,Ziqin Luo,Zhen Chen,Chunlei Li,Biao Han,Tao Deng,Yi Li,Shuanglong Li,Lin Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RELATE is a reinforcement learning framework that unifies ad text generation and performance alignment in one model, improving conversion rates while maintaining policy compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current industrial ad systems use a two-stage approach (generate then align) that creates misaligned optimization objectives and low funnel efficiency, limiting global optimality.

Method: RELATE uses reinforcement learning to integrate generation and alignment in a single end-to-end model, incorporating conversion metrics and compliance constraints as multi-dimensional rewards for policy learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on industrial datasets show RELATE outperforms baselines, and online deployment yields statistically significant improvements in click-through conversion rate under strict policy constraints.

Conclusion: RELATE demonstrates robust real-world effectiveness by unifying ad text generation and performance alignment, improving conversion performance while maintaining compliance.

Abstract: In online advertising, advertising text plays a critical role in attracting user engagement and driving advertiser value. Existing industrial systems typically follow a two-stage paradigm, where candidate texts are first generated and subsequently aligned with online performance metrics such as click-through rate(CTR). This separation often leads to misaligned optimization objectives and low funnel efficiency, limiting global optimality.
  To address these limitations, we propose RELATE, a reinforcement learning-based end-to-end framework that unifies generation and objective alignment within a single model. Instead of decoupling text generation from downstream metric alignment, RELATE integrates performance and compliance objectives directly into the generation process via policy learning. To better capture ultimate advertiser value beyond click-level signals, We incorporate conversion-oriented metrics into the objective and jointly model them with compliance constraints as multi-dimensional rewards, enabling the model to generate high-quality ad texts that improve conversion performance under policy constraints.
  Extensive experiments on large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate that RELATE consistently outperforms baselines. Furthermore, online deployment on a production advertising platform yields statistically significant improvements in click-through conversion rate(CTCVR) under strict policy constraints, validating the robustness and real-world effectiveness of the proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs can solve complex tasks through reasoning and tool use, accurately translating these solutions into structured workflows remains challenging. Current approaches that build workflows during execution suffer from inaccuracies due to interference between solving tasks and constructing workflows.

Method: Propose Execute-Summarize (ES) framework that decouples task execution from workflow construction: model first completes task using available tools, then independently reconstructs structured workflow from execution traces.

Result: Introduce FlowBench and show through extensive experiments that ES approach outperforms existing methods, providing reliable paradigm for grounding free-form LLM reasoning into structured workflows.

Conclusion: The separation of execution and workflow construction improves workflow accuracy and robustness, offering a better solution for translating LLM reasoning into structured workflows.

Abstract: LLMs can solve complex tasks through reasoning and tool use, but accurately translating these solutions into structured workflows remains challenging. We model workflows as sequences of tool use and reformulate the problem as designing a mechanism that can both solve tasks and reliably construct workflows. Prior approaches that build workflows during execution often suffer from inaccuracies due to interference between the two processes. We propose an Execute-Summarize(ES) framework that decouples task execution from workflow construction: the model first completes the task using available tools, then independently reconstructs a structured workflow from execution traces. This separation improves workflow accuracy and robustness. We introduce FlowBench and show through extensive experiments that our approach outperforms existing methods, providing a reliable paradigm for grounding free-form LLM reasoning into structured workflows.

*Lingyong Yan,Jiulong Wu,Dong Xie,Weixian Shi,Deguo Xia,Jizhou Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LAVES is an LLM-based multi-agent system that generates high-quality instructional videos from educational problems through structured executable scripts rather than direct pixel synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end video generation models lack logical rigor and precise knowledge representation needed for instructional/educational content, and prior approaches suffer from low procedural fidelity, high production costs, and limited controllability.

Method: Hierarchical multi-agent system with specialized agents (Solution, Illustration, Narration) coordinated by an Orchestrating Agent, using quality gates, iterative critique mechanisms, semantic checks, rule-based constraints, and template-driven assembly of executable video scripts.

Result: Achieves throughput exceeding 1 million videos per day with over 95% cost reduction compared to industry standards while maintaining high acceptance rate.

Conclusion: LAVES demonstrates that structured, deterministic compilation of executable video scripts via specialized multi-agent coordination can overcome limitations of direct pixel synthesis for educational video generation.

Abstract: Although recent end-to-end video generation models demonstrate impressive performance in visually oriented content creation, they remain limited in scenarios that require strict logical rigor and precise knowledge representation, such as instructional and educational media. To address this problem, we propose LAVES, a hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent system for generating high-quality instructional videos from educational problems. The LAVES formulates educational video generation as a multi-objective task that simultaneously demands correct step-by-step reasoning, pedagogically coherent narration, semantically faithful visual demonstrations, and precise audio--visual alignment. To address the limitations of prior approaches--including low procedural fidelity, high production cost, and limited controllability--LAVES decomposes the generation workflow into specialized agents coordinated by a central Orchestrating Agent with explicit quality gates and iterative critique mechanisms. Specifically, the Orchestrating Agent supervises a Solution Agent for rigorous problem solving, an Illustration Agent that produces executable visualization codes, and a Narration Agent for learner-oriented instructional scripts. In addition, all outputs from the working agents are subject to semantic critique, rule-based constraints, and tool-based compilation checks. Rather than directly synthesizing pixels, the system constructs a structured executable video script that is deterministically compiled into synchronized visuals and narration using template-driven assembly rules, enabling fully automated end-to-end production without manual editing. In large-scale deployments, LAVES achieves a throughput exceeding one million videos per day, delivering over a 95% reduction in cost compared to current industry-standard approaches while maintaining a high acceptance rate.

*Hongbo Zhang,Yue Yang,Jianhao Yan,Guangsheng Bao,Yue Zhang,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Min-kNN Distance detects RLVR contamination by measuring reduced diversity in model outputs for RL-trained prompts vs unseen ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR training data contamination is hard to detect with conventional likelihood methods since RLVR uses reward feedback rather than token probabilities, creating need for new detection approaches.

Method: Min-kNN Distance: sample multiple completions per prompt, compute average of k smallest nearest-neighbor edit distances to quantify output diversity collapse from RLVR training.

Result: Min-kNN Distance reliably distinguishes RL-seen from unseen examples across multiple RLVR-trained reasoning models, outperforming existing membership inference and contamination detection baselines.

Conclusion: RLVR creates distinctive behavioral signature of reduced output diversity, which Min-kNN Distance effectively detects without needing reference models or token probabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is central to training modern reasoning models, but the undisclosed training data raises concerns about benchmark contamination. Unlike pretraining methods, which optimize models using token-level probabilities, RLVR fine-tunes models based on reward feedback from self-generated reasoning trajectories, making conventional likelihood-based detection methods less effective. We show that RLVR induces a distinctive behavioral signature: prompts encountered during RLVR training result in more rigid and similar generations, while unseen prompts retain greater diversity. We introduce Min-$k$NN Distance, a simple black-box detector that quantifies this collapse by sampling multiple completions for a given prompt and computing the average of the $k$ smallest nearest-neighbor edit distances. Min-$k$NN Distance requires no access to the reference model or token probabilities. Experiments across multiple RLVR-trained reasoning models show that Min-$k$NN Distance reliably distinguishes RL-seen examples from unseen ones and outperforms existing membership inference and RL contamination detection baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hi-SAM: Hierarchical framework for multi-modal recommendation using disentangled semantic tokenization and hierarchical transformers to address tokenization and architecture limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal recommendation systems face two key challenges: (1) suboptimal tokenization where existing methods lack disentanglement between shared cross-modal semantics and modality-specific details, causing redundancy or collapse, and (2) architecture-data mismatch where vanilla Transformers treat semantic IDs as flat streams, ignoring the hierarchy of user interactions, items, and tokens.

Method: Proposes Hi-SAM with two designs: (1) Disentangled Semantic Tokenizer (DST) that unifies modalities via geometry-aware alignment and quantizes them via coarse-to-fine strategy with shared codebooks for consensus and modality-specific ones for nuances, enforced by mutual information minimization; (2) Hierarchical Memory-Anchor Transformer (HMAT) that splits positional encoding into inter- and intra-item subspaces via Hierarchical RoPE and inserts Anchor Tokens to condense items into compact memory while retaining details for current items.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, especially in cold-start scenarios. Deployment on a large-scale social platform serving millions of users achieved a 6.55% gain in the core online metric.

Conclusion: Hi-SAM effectively addresses the limitations of existing multi-modal recommendation systems by introducing hierarchical structure-aware approaches for both tokenization and transformer architecture, leading to significant performance improvements in both offline experiments and real-world deployment.

Abstract: Multi-modal recommendation has gained traction as items possess rich attributes like text and images. Semantic ID-based approaches effectively discretize this information into compact tokens. However, two challenges persist: (1) Suboptimal Tokenization: existing methods (e.g., RQ-VAE) lack disentanglement between shared cross-modal semantics and modality-specific details, causing redundancy or collapse; (2) Architecture-Data Mismatch: vanilla Transformers treat semantic IDs as flat streams, ignoring the hierarchy of user interactions, items, and tokens. Expanding items into multiple tokens amplifies length and noise, biasing attention toward local details over holistic semantics. We propose Hi-SAM, a Hierarchical Structure-Aware Multi-modal framework with two designs: (1) Disentangled Semantic Tokenizer (DST): unifies modalities via geometry-aware alignment and quantizes them via a coarse-to-fine strategy. Shared codebooks distill consensus while modality-specific ones recover nuances from residuals, enforced by mutual information minimization; (2) Hierarchical Memory-Anchor Transformer (HMAT): splits positional encoding into inter- and intra-item subspaces via Hierarchical RoPE to restore hierarchy. It inserts Anchor Tokens to condense items into compact memory, retaining details for the current item while accessing history only through compressed summaries. Experiments on real-world datasets show consistent improvements over SOTA baselines, especially in cold-start scenarios. Deployed on a large-scale social platform serving millions of users, Hi-SAM achieved a 6.55% gain in the core online metric.

TL;DR: PuYun-LDM improves weather forecasting by enhancing latent diffusion models with 3D-MAE encoding and variable-aware frequency masking to address spectral heterogeneity in meteorological data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent diffusion models have limited diffusability for high-resolution ensemble weather forecasting due to lack of foundation models in meteorology and inappropriate spectral regularization that doesn't account for inter-variable spectral heterogeneity.

Method: Proposes PuYun-LDM with two key components: 1) 3D Masked AutoEncoder (3D-MAE) to encode weather-state evolution features as additional conditioning, and 2) Variable-Aware Masked Frequency Modeling (VA-MFM) that adaptively selects thresholds based on each variable's spectral energy distribution.

Result: Achieves superior performance to ENS at short lead times while remaining comparable at longer horizons. Generates 15-day global forecasts with 6-hour resolution in 5 minutes on a single H200 GPU, with efficient parallel ensemble forecasting.

Conclusion: PuYun-LDM successfully addresses latent diffusability limitations in weather forecasting by incorporating weather-state evolution features and variable-aware spectral regularization, enabling efficient high-resolution ensemble forecasting.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) suffer from limited diffusability in high-resolution (<=0.25°) ensemble weather forecasting, where diffusability characterizes how easily a latent data distribution can be modeled by a diffusion process. Unlike natural image fields, meteorological fields lack task-agnostic foundation models and explicit semantic structures, making VFM-based regularization inapplicable. Moreover, existing frequency-based approaches impose identical spectral regularization across channels under a homogeneity assumption, which leads to uneven regularization strength under the inter-variable spectral heterogeneity in multivariate meteorological data. To address these challenges, we propose a 3D Masked AutoEncoder (3D-MAE) that encodes weather-state evolution features as an additional conditioning for the diffusion model, together with a Variable-Aware Masked Frequency Modeling (VA-MFM) strategy that adaptively selects thresholds based on the spectral energy distribution of each variable. Together, we propose PuYun-LDM, which enhances latent diffusability and achieves superior performance to ENS at short lead times while remaining comparable to ENS at longer horizons. PuYun-LDM generates a 15-day global forecast with a 6-hour temporal resolution in five minutes on a single NVIDIA H200 GPU, while ensemble forecasts can be efficiently produced in parallel.

TL;DR: Lightweight framework reuses LLM hidden states for efficient sequence length prediction, reducing padding waste in batched inference through entropy-guided pooling and progressive prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-tailed sequence length distributions in LLM serving and RL sampling cause computational waste from excessive padding in batched inference. Existing methods using auxiliary models have high overhead, poor generalization, and fail in stochastic "one-to-many" sampling scenarios.

Method: Two-component framework: 1) Entropy-Guided Token Pooling (EGTP) uses on-the-fly activations and token entropy for accurate static prediction with negligible cost; 2) Progressive Length Prediction (PLP) dynamically estimates remaining length at each decoding step for stochastic generation.

Result: EGTP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ForeLen benchmark, reducing MAE by 29.16% over best baseline. Integration with length-aware scheduler yields significant end-to-end throughput gains.

Conclusion: The work provides new technical and evaluation baseline for efficient LLM inference by reusing main model's internal states for lightweight length prediction, addressing padding waste in long-tailed sequence distributions.

Abstract: The long-tailed distribution of sequence lengths in LLM serving and reinforcement learning (RL) sampling causes significant computational waste due to excessive padding in batched inference. Existing methods rely on auxiliary models for static length prediction, but they incur high overhead, generalize poorly, and fail in stochastic "one-to-many" sampling scenarios. We introduce a lightweight framework that reuses the main model's internal hidden states for efficient length prediction. Our framework features two core components: 1) Entropy-Guided Token Pooling (EGTP), which uses on-the-fly activations and token entropy for highly accurate static prediction with negligible cost, and 2) Progressive Length Prediction (PLP), which dynamically estimates the remaining length at each decoding step to handle stochastic generation. To validate our approach, we build and release ForeLen, a comprehensive benchmark with long-sequence, Chain-of-Thought, and RL data. On ForeLen, EGTP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, reducing MAE by 29.16\% over the best baseline. Integrating our methods with a length-aware scheduler yields significant end-to-end throughput gains. Our work provides a new technical and evaluation baseline for efficient LLM inference.

TL;DR: REVIS reduces object hallucination in LVLMs by reactivating suppressed visual information through orthogonal projection and sparse intervention at specific network depths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models suffer from object hallucination because visual features and pretrained textual representations become intertwined in deeper layers, suppressing visual information.

Method: REVIS uses orthogonal projection to extract pure visual information vectors and performs calibrated sparse intervention only at the precise depth where visual suppression occurs.

Result: REVIS reduces object hallucination rates by approximately 19% compared to state-of-the-art baselines while preserving general reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The training-free REVIS framework effectively addresses object hallucination in LVLMs by reactivating suppressed visual information through targeted interventions based on latent space geometry.

Abstract: Despite the advanced capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), they frequently suffer from object hallucination. One reason is that visual features and pretrained textual representations often become intertwined in the deeper network layers. To address this, we propose REVIS, a training-free framework designed to explicitly re-activate this suppressed visual information. Rooted in latent space geometry, REVIS extracts the pure visual information vector via orthogonal projection and employs a calibrated strategy to perform sparse intervention only at the precise depth where suppression occurs. This surgical approach effectively restores visual information with minimal computational cost.

TL;DR: ProtoT is a prototype-based transformer architecture that enables interpretable reasoning through learnable prototypes while maintaining competitive performance and linear sequence scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language models have opaque reasoning processes that undermine trust and introduce risks like deception and hallucination. There's a need for interpretable-by-design architectures that maintain performance while providing transparency.

Method: ProtoT replaces standard self-attention with prototype-based communication. It uses parameter vectors (prototypes) that engage in two-way communication with input sequences, automatically capturing nameable concepts during training and creating interpretable communication channels.

Result: ProtoT scales linearly with sequence length (vs quadratic for standard transformers), performs competitively on text generation and GLUE tasks, shows robustness to input perturbations, and provides interpretable pathways showing how robustness/sensitivity arises.

Conclusion: ProtoT demonstrates that interpretable-by-design language models can achieve near state-of-the-art performance while providing transparency through automatically learned prototypes, paving the way for more trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: While state-of-the-art language models (LMs) surpass the vast majority of humans in certain domains, their reasoning remains largely opaque, undermining trust in their output. Furthermore, while autoregressive LMs can output explicit reasoning, their true reasoning process is opaque, which introduces risks like deception and hallucination. In this work, we introduce the Prototype Transformer (ProtoT) -- an autoregressive LM architecture based on prototypes (parameter vectors), posed as an alternative to the standard self-attention-based transformers. ProtoT works by means of two-way communication between the input sequence and the prototypes, and we show that this leads to the prototypes automatically capturing nameable concepts (e.g. "woman") during training. They provide the potential to interpret the model's reasoning and allow for targeted edits of its behavior. Furthermore, by design, the prototypes create communication channels that aggregate contextual information at different time scales, aiding interpretability. In terms of computation scalability, ProtoT scales linearly with sequence length vs the quadratic scalability of SOTA self-attention transformers. Compared to baselines, ProtoT scales well with model and data size, and performs well on text generation and downstream tasks (GLUE). ProtoT exhibits robustness to input perturbations on par or better than some baselines, but differs from them by providing interpretable pathways showing how robustness and sensitivity arises. Reaching close to the performance of state-of-the-art architectures, ProtoT paves the way to creating well-performing autoregressive LMs interpretable by design.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VRCsim simulation framework generates VRC cooperative perception data, enabling creation of VRC-QA dataset for spatial reasoning. Talk2DM module adds natural language querying to dynamic maps using chain-of-prompt mechanism combining human rules with LLM commonsense knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic maps lack natural language interfaces for human interaction, limiting their usability despite being fundamental infrastructure for cooperative autonomous driving in China and Japan.

Method: Develop VRCsim simulation framework for generating streaming VRC cooperative perception data, create VRC-QA dataset for spatial querying, and build Talk2DM module using chain-of-prompt mechanism that integrates human-defined rules with LLM commonsense knowledge.

Result: Talk2DM achieves over 93% NLS query accuracy with 2-5 second response times across different LLMs (Qwen3:8B, Gemma3:27B, GPT-oss), showing strong generalization while revealing efficiency trade-offs with larger models.

Conclusion: Talk2DM successfully adds natural language querying capabilities to dynamic maps, demonstrating practical potential for enhancing human-DM interaction in cooperative autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Dynamic maps (DM) serve as the fundamental information infrastructure for vehicle-road-cloud (VRC) cooperative autonomous driving in China and Japan. By providing comprehensive traffic scene representations, DM overcome the limitations of standalone autonomous driving systems (ADS), such as physical occlusions. Although DM-enhanced ADS have been successfully deployed in real-world applications in Japan, existing DM systems still lack a natural-language-supported (NLS) human interface, which could substantially enhance human-DM interaction. To address this gap, this paper introduces VRCsim, a VRC cooperative perception (CP) simulation framework designed to generate streaming VRC-CP data. Based on VRCsim, we construct a question-answering data set, VRC-QA, focused on spatial querying and reasoning in mixed-traffic scenes. Building upon VRCsim and VRC-QA, we further propose Talk2DM, a plug-and-play module that extends VRC-DM systems with NLS querying and commonsense reasoning capabilities. Talk2DM is built upon a novel chain-of-prompt (CoP) mechanism that progressively integrates human-defined rules with the commonsense knowledge of large language models (LLMs). Experiments on VRC-QA show that Talk2DM can seamlessly switch across different LLMs while maintaining high NLS query accuracy, demonstrating strong generalization capability. Although larger models tend to achieve higher accuracy, they incur significant efficiency degradation. Our results reveal that Talk2DM, powered by Qwen3:8B, Gemma3:27B, and GPT-oss models, achieves over 93\% NLS query accuracy with an average response time of only 2-5 seconds, indicating strong practical potential.

TL;DR: Proposes an adaptive framework for intelligent AI delegation that goes beyond simple task allocation to include authority transfer, responsibility, accountability, role specifications, and trust mechanisms for complex delegation networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI task decomposition and delegation methods rely on simple heuristics that cannot dynamically adapt to environmental changes or handle unexpected failures robustly, limiting AI agents' ability to tackle increasingly complex tasks through meaningful collaboration.

Method: An adaptive framework for intelligent AI delegation that involves a sequence of decisions including task allocation, transfer of authority, responsibility, accountability, clear role specifications, intent clarity, and trust establishment mechanisms between delegators and delegatees.

Result: The proposed framework is applicable to both human and AI delegators/delegatees in complex delegation networks and aims to inform development of protocols for the emerging agentic web.

Conclusion: The framework addresses limitations of current delegation methods by incorporating comprehensive delegation elements beyond simple task allocation, enabling more robust and adaptive AI collaboration in complex environments.

Abstract: AI agents are able to tackle increasingly complex tasks. To achieve more ambitious goals, AI agents need to be able to meaningfully decompose problems into manageable sub-components, and safely delegate their completion across to other AI agents and humans alike. Yet, existing task decomposition and delegation methods rely on simple heuristics, and are not able to dynamically adapt to environmental changes and robustly handle unexpected failures. Here we propose an adaptive framework for intelligent AI delegation - a sequence of decisions involving task allocation, that also incorporates transfer of authority, responsibility, accountability, clear specifications regarding roles and boundaries, clarity of intent, and mechanisms for establishing trust between the two (or more) parties. The proposed framework is applicable to both human and AI delegators and delegatees in complex delegation networks, aiming to inform the development of protocols in the emerging agentic web.

*Yifan Luo,Yang Zhan,Jiedong Jiang,Tianyang Liu,Mingrui Wu,Zhennan Zhou,Bin Dong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HSAE is a hierarchical sparse autoencoder that jointly learns multiple SAE layers with parent-child relationships to capture the hierarchical structure of features in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard SAEs extract monosemantic features in isolation, but evidence suggests LLMs capture hierarchical language structure (feature splitting phenomenon). Current methods don't capture these hierarchical relationships between features.

Method: HSAE learns a series of SAEs with parent-child relationships using two novel mechanisms: structural constraint loss and random feature perturbation mechanism to strengthen parent-child alignment.

Result: HSAE consistently recovers semantically meaningful hierarchies across various LLMs and layers, validated by both qualitative case studies and rigorous quantitative metrics, while preserving reconstruction fidelity and interpretability.

Conclusion: HSAE provides a powerful, scalable tool for discovering and analyzing multi-scale conceptual structures embedded in LLM representations, capturing hierarchical feature relationships that standard SAEs miss.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have proven effective for extracting monosemantic features from large language models (LLMs), yet these features are typically identified in isolation. However, broad evidence suggests that LLMs capture the intrinsic structure of natural language, where the phenomenon of "feature splitting" in particular indicates that such structure is hierarchical. To capture this, we propose the Hierarchical Sparse Autoencoder (HSAE), which jointly learns a series of SAEs and the parent-child relationships between their features. HSAE strengthens the alignment between parent and child features through two novel mechanisms: a structural constraint loss and a random feature perturbation mechanism. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and layers demonstrate that HSAE consistently recovers semantically meaningful hierarchies, supported by both qualitative case studies and rigorous quantitative metrics. At the same time, HSAE preserves the reconstruction fidelity and interpretability of standard SAEs across different dictionary sizes. Our work provides a powerful, scalable tool for discovering and analyzing the multi-scale conceptual structures embedded in LLM representations.

### [127] [When Should LLMs Be Less Specific? Selective Abstraction for Reliable Long-Form Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11908)
*Shani Goren,Ido Galil,Ran El-Yaniv*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Selective Abstraction (SA) framework enables LLMs to trade specificity for reliability by replacing uncertain detailed content with higher-confidence abstractions instead of binary abstention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs suffer from factual errors that limit trust and adoption in high-risk settings. Current uncertainty estimation uses binary abstention which is too restrictive for long-form content, often discarding valuable information.

Method: Introduces Selective Abstraction (SA) framework formalized through selective risk and coverage. Proposes Atom-wise Selective Abstraction that decomposes responses into atomic claims and replaces uncertain atoms with higher-confidence, less specific abstractions.

Result: Across six open-source models on FactScore and LongFact-Objects benchmarks, atom-wise SA consistently outperforms baselines, improving area under risk-coverage curve by up to 27.73% over claim removal, boosting accuracy while preserving meaning.

Conclusion: Reducing specificity through selective abstraction can significantly improve LLM reliability while retaining most original information, offering a better alternative to binary abstention for factual accuracy in long-form generation.

Abstract: LLMs are widely used, yet they remain prone to factual errors that erode user trust and limit adoption in high-risk settings. One approach to mitigate this risk is to equip models with uncertainty estimation mechanisms that abstain when confidence is low. However, this binary "all-or-nothing" approach is excessively restrictive in long-form settings, often discarding valuable information. We introduce Selective Abstraction (SA), a framework that enables LLMs to trade specificity for reliability by selectively reducing the detail of uncertain content. We first formalize SA through the lenses of selective risk and coverage. We then propose Atom-wise Selective Abstraction, a claim-level instantiation that decomposes responses into atomic claims (short, self-contained statements each expressing a single fact) and replaces uncertain atoms with higher confidence, less specific abstractions. To evaluate this framework, we develop a novel end-to-end pipeline for open-ended generation that instantiates risk as factual correctness and measures coverage using an information-theoretic measure of retained information. Across six open-source models on the FactScore and LongFact-Objects benchmarks, atom-wise SA consistently outperforms existing baselines, improving the area under the risk-coverage curve (AURC) by up to 27.73% over claim removal, demonstrating that reducing specificity can boost accuracy and reliability while preserving most of their original meaning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AlphaPROBE reframes alpha mining as strategic navigation of a DAG, using Bayesian retrieval and DAG-aware generation to improve factor discovery efficiency and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated alpha mining methods (Decoupled Factor Generation and Iterative Factor Evolution) lack global structural view, treating factor pools as unstructured collections or fragmented chains, leading to redundant search and limited diversity.

Method: AlphaPROBE models factors as nodes and evolutionary links as edges in a DAG. It has two core components: 1) Bayesian Factor Retriever that balances exploitation/exploration through posterior probability, and 2) DAG-aware Factor Generator that uses full ancestral trace for context-aware, nonredundant optimizations.

Result: Extensive experiments on three major Chinese stock market datasets against 8 baselines show AlphaPROBE significantly improves predictive accuracy, return stability, and training efficiency.

Conclusion: Leveraging global evolutionary topology is essential for efficient and robust automated alpha discovery, and AlphaPROBE demonstrates this through principled DAG-based navigation of factor space.

Abstract: Extracting signals through alpha factor mining is a fundamental challenge in quantitative finance. Existing automated methods primarily follow two paradigms: Decoupled Factor Generation, which treats factor discovery as isolated events, and Iterative Factor Evolution, which focuses on local parent-child refinements. However, both paradigms lack a global structural view, often treating factor pools as unstructured collections or fragmented chains, which leads to redundant search and limited diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AlphaPROBE (Alpha Mining via Principled Retrieval and On-graph Biased Evolution), a framework that reframes alpha mining as the strategic navigation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). By modeling factors as nodes and evolutionary links as edges, AlphaPROBE treats the factor pool as a dynamic, interconnected ecosystem. The framework consists of two core components: a Bayesian Factor Retriever that identifies high-potential seeds by balancing exploitation and exploration through a posterior probability model, and a DAG-aware Factor Generator that leverages the full ancestral trace of factors to produce context-aware, nonredundant optimizations. Extensive experiments on three major Chinese stock market datasets against 8 competitive baselines demonstrate that AlphaPROBE significantly gains enhanced performance in predictive accuracy, return stability and training efficiency. Our results confirm that leveraging global evolutionary topology is essential for efficient and robust automated alpha discovery. We have open-sourced our implementation at https://github.com/gta0804/AlphaPROBE.

TL;DR: MEME: A logic-oriented framework that models financial markets as evolving ecosystems of investment narratives, outperforming SOTA baselines in Chinese stock pools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based methods in quantitative finance are either asset-centric (individual stock prediction) or market-centric (portfolio allocation), but remain agnostic to the underlying reasoning that drives market movements. There's a need to model financial markets as dynamic ecosystems of competing investment narratives.

Method: MEME employs a multi-agent extraction module to transform noisy data into high-fidelity Investment Arguments, uses Gaussian Mixture Modeling to uncover latent consensus in semantic space, and implements temporal evaluation/alignment to track the lifecycle and historical profitability of evolving market logics (Modes of Thought).

Result: Extensive experiments on three heterogeneous Chinese stock pools from 2023-2025 show MEME consistently outperforms seven SOTA baselines. Ablation studies, sensitivity analysis, lifecycle case study, and cost analysis validate its capacity to identify and adapt to evolving market consensus.

Conclusion: MEME successfully models financial markets as evolutionary ecosystems of competing investment narratives, prioritizing enduring market wisdom over transient anomalies to guide robust portfolio construction. The logic-oriented perspective provides a more sophisticated understanding of market dynamics than previous approaches.

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in quantitative finance by processing vast unstructured data to emulate human-like analytical workflows. However, current LLM-based methods primarily follow either an Asset-Centric paradigm focused on individual stock prediction or a Market-Centric approach for portfolio allocation, often remaining agnostic to the underlying reasoning that drives market movements. In this paper, we propose a Logic-Oriented perspective, modeling the financial market as a dynamic, evolutionary ecosystem of competing investment narratives, termed Modes of Thought. To operationalize this view, we introduce MEME (Modeling the Evolutionary Modes of Financial Markets), designed to reconstruct market dynamics through the lens of evolving logics. MEME employs a multi-agent extraction module to transform noisy data into high-fidelity Investment Arguments and utilizes Gaussian Mixture Modeling to uncover latent consensus within a semantic space. To model semantic drift among different market conditions, we also implement a temporal evaluation and alignment mechanism to track the lifecycle and historical profitability of these modes. By prioritizing enduring market wisdom over transient anomalies, MEME ensures that portfolio construction is guided by robust reasoning. Extensive experiments on three heterogeneous Chinese stock pools from 2023 to 2025 demonstrate that MEME consistently outperforms seven SOTA baselines. Further ablation studies, sensitivity analysis, lifecycle case study and cost analysis validate MEME's capacity to identify and adapt to the evolving consensus of financial markets.

TL;DR: Gaia2 is a benchmark for evaluating LLM agents in realistic, asynchronous environments with temporal constraints, dynamic events, and multi-agent collaboration, featuring fine-grained action-level evaluation usable for RL training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior benchmarks are static or synchronous, lacking realistic asynchronous environments where agents must handle temporal constraints, adapt to dynamic events, resolve ambiguity, and collaborate with other agents.

Method: Gaia2 introduces asynchronous scenarios with independent environment evolution, paired with write-action verifiers for fine-grained evaluation. Built on the open-source Agents Research Environments platform with consumer environment integration.

Result: No model dominates across capabilities: GPT-5 (high) achieves 42% pass@1 but fails on time-sensitive tasks, Claude-4 Sonnet trades accuracy/speed for cost, Kimi-K2 leads open-source models with 21% pass@1, revealing trade-offs between reasoning, efficiency, and robustness.

Conclusion: Gaia2 exposes fundamental challenges in closing the "sim2real" gap and provides a flexible infrastructure for developing, benchmarking, and training practical agent systems, released alongside the ARE framework to advance the field.

Abstract: We introduce Gaia2, a benchmark for evaluating large language model agents in realistic, asynchronous environments. Unlike prior static or synchronous evaluations, Gaia2 introduces scenarios where environments evolve independently of agent actions, requiring agents to operate under temporal constraints, adapt to noisy and dynamic events, resolve ambiguity, and collaborate with other agents. Each scenario is paired with a write-action verifier, enabling fine-grained, action-level evaluation and making Gaia2 directly usable for reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models shows that no model dominates across capabilities: GPT-5 (high) reaches the strongest overall score of 42% pass@1 but fails on time-sensitive tasks, Claude-4 Sonnet trades accuracy and speed for cost, Kimi-K2 leads among open-source models with 21% pass@1. These results highlight fundamental trade-offs between reasoning, efficiency, robustness, and expose challenges in closing the "sim2real" gap. Gaia2 is built on a consumer environment with the open-source Agents Research Environments platform and designed to be easy to extend. By releasing Gaia2 alongside the foundational ARE framework, we aim to provide the community with a flexible infrastructure for developing, benchmarking, and training the next generation of practical agent systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for medical text-to-image generation focus on image realism/diversity but fail to assess whether generated images reflect intended clinical semantics like anatomical location and pathology, which is crucial for safe healthcare adoption.

Method: Proposed Clinical Semantics Evaluator (CSEval) framework that leverages language models to assess clinical semantic alignment between generated medical images and their conditioning prompts.

Result: CSEval identifies semantic inconsistencies overlooked by other metrics and correlates with expert judgment, providing clinically meaningful evaluation.

Conclusion: CSEval offers a scalable, clinically meaningful complement to existing evaluation methods, supporting safe adoption of generative models in healthcare by ensuring clinical semantic accuracy.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has been increasingly applied in medical domains for various purposes such as data augmentation and education. Evaluating the quality and clinical reliability of these generated images is essential. However, existing methods mainly assess image realism or diversity, while failing to capture whether the generated images reflect the intended clinical semantics, such as anatomical location and pathology. In this study, we propose the Clinical Semantics Evaluator (CSEval), a framework that leverages language models to assess clinical semantic alignment between the generated images and their conditioning prompts. Our experiments show that CSEval identifies semantic inconsistencies overlooked by other metrics and correlates with expert judgment.

TL;DR: The paper proposes two parameter-free optimization methods (InjectCorrect and InjectRLOpt) that leverage behavioral patterns from LLM reasoning to improve performance on reasoning tasks without model updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to enhance LLM reasoning through prompt adjustment are largely intuitive and lack systematic analysis of underlying behavioral patterns. The authors aim to investigate how models' reasoning behaviors shape reasoning from a behavioral pattern perspective.

Method: Two optimization methods: 1) InjectCorrect - guides models by imitating behavioral patterns from their own past correct answers; 2) InjectRLOpt - learns a value function from historical behavior-pattern data and uses a Reliability-Aware Softmax Policy to generate behavioral injectants during inference.

Result: Both methods improve model performance across various reasoning tasks without parameter updates, achieving gains of up to 5.34% (InjectCorrect) and 8.67% (InjectRLOpt).

Conclusion: Models exhibit adaptive distributions of reasoning behaviors for specific question types, and structurally injecting these patterns can significantly influence reasoning quality. The proposed parameter-free optimization methods effectively leverage behavioral patterns to enhance LLM reasoning performance.

Abstract: Reasoning can significantly enhance the performance of Large Language Models. While recent studies have exploited behavior-related prompts adjustment to enhance reasoning, these designs remain largely intuitive and lack a systematic analysis of the underlying behavioral patterns. Motivated by this, we investigate how models' reasoning behaviors shape reasoning from the perspective of behavioral patterns. We observe that models exhibit adaptive distributions of reasoning behaviors when responding to specific types of questions, and that structurally injecting these patterns can substantially influence the quality of the models' reasoning processes and outcomes. Building on these findings, we propose two optimization methods that require no parameter updates: InjectCorrect and InjectRLOpt. InjectCorrect guides the model by imitating behavioral patterns derived from its own past correct answers. InjectRLOpt learns a value function from historical behavior-pattern data and, via our proposed Reliability-Aware Softmax Policy, generates behavioral injectant during inference to steer the reasoning process. Our experiments demonstrate that both methods can improve model performance across various reasoning tasks without requiring any modifications to model parameters, achieving gains of up to 5.34% and 8.67%, respectively.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing legal reasoning methods lack mechanisms to verify intermediate reasoning steps, allowing errors like inapplicable statute citations to propagate undetected through the reasoning chain.

Method: LawThinker adopts an Explore-Verify-Memorize strategy with a DeepVerifier module that examines each retrieval result along three dimensions: knowledge accuracy, fact-law relevance, and procedural compliance, plus a memory module for cross-round knowledge reuse.

Result: On the dynamic benchmark J1-EVAL, LawThinker achieves 24% improvement over direct reasoning and 11% gain over workflow-based methods, with strong improvements on process-oriented metrics. Evaluations on three static benchmarks confirm generalization capability.

Conclusion: LawThinker effectively addresses the procedural compliance gap in legal reasoning through atomic verification and memory-based knowledge reuse, demonstrating significant performance improvements in dynamic judicial environments.

Abstract: Legal reasoning requires not only correct outcomes but also procedurally compliant reasoning processes. However, existing methods lack mechanisms to verify intermediate reasoning steps, allowing errors such as inapplicable statute citations to propagate undetected through the reasoning chain. To address this, we propose LawThinker, an autonomous legal research agent that adopts an Explore-Verify-Memorize strategy for dynamic judicial environments. The core idea is to enforce verification as an atomic operation after every knowledge exploration step. A DeepVerifier module examines each retrieval result along three dimensions of knowledge accuracy, fact-law relevance, and procedural compliance, with a memory module for cross-round knowledge reuse in long-horizon tasks. Experiments on the dynamic benchmark J1-EVAL show that LawThinker achieves a 24% improvement over direct reasoning and an 11% gain over workflow-based methods, with particularly strong improvements on process-oriented metrics.

TL;DR: Mamba-2 hybrid operators in recursive reasoning models improve solution coverage on ARC-AGI-1 while maintaining similar top-1 performance, validating SSM-based operators for recursive reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Mamba-2's state space recurrence, which is itself a form of iterative refinement, can preserve reasoning capability when introduced into recursive reasoning models like TRM, and to explore operator choice in recursive reasoning design.

Method: Replaced Transformer blocks in TRM with Mamba-2 hybrid operators while maintaining parameter parity (6.83M vs 6.86M parameters), then evaluated on ARC-AGI-1 reasoning tasks.

Result: Mamba-2 hybrid improves pass@2 by +2.0% (45.88% vs 43.88%) and consistently outperforms at higher K values (+4.75% at pass@100), while maintaining pass@1 parity, suggesting improved candidate coverage with similar top-1 selection.

Conclusion: Mamba-2 hybrid operators preserve reasoning capability within recursive scaffolds, establishing SSM-based operators as viable candidates in recursive operator design space and providing a first step toward understanding optimal mixing strategies for recursive reasoning.

Abstract: Recent work on recursive reasoning models like TRM demonstrates that tiny networks (7M parameters) can achieve strong performance on abstract reasoning tasks through latent recursion -- iterative refinement in hidden representation space without emitting intermediate tokens. This raises a natural question about operator choice: Mamba-2's state space recurrence is itself a form of iterative refinement, making it a natural candidate for recursive reasoning -- but does introducing Mamba-2 into the recursive scaffold preserve reasoning capability? We investigate this by replacing the Transformer blocks in TRM with Mamba-2 hybrid operators while maintaining parameter parity (6.83M vs 6.86M parameters). On ARC-AGI-1, we find that the hybrid improves pass@2 (the official metric) by +2.0\% (45.88\% vs 43.88\%) and consistently outperforms at higher K values (+4.75\% at pass@100), whilst maintaining pass@1 parity. This suggests improved candidate coverage -- the model generates correct solutions more reliably -- with similar top-1 selection. Our results validate that Mamba-2 hybrid operators preserve reasoning capability within the recursive scaffold, establishing SSM-based operators as viable candidates in the recursive operator design space and taking a first step towards understanding the best mixing strategies for recursive reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Differentiable Modal Logic (DML) enables learning trust networks, causal chains, and regulatory boundaries from behavioral data in multi-agent systems, providing interpretable neurosymbolic debugging through epistemic, temporal, deontic, and doxastic modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent AI systems are evolving from simple chatbots to autonomous swarms, requiring debugging of semantic failures that involve reasoning about knowledge, belief, causality, and obligation. Traditional modal logic requires manual specification of relationship structures that are unknown or dynamic in real systems.

Method: Differentiable Modal Logic (DML) implemented via Modal Logical Neural Networks (MLNNs) enables systems to learn trust networks, causal chains, and regulatory boundaries from behavioral data alone. The framework uses four modalities: epistemic (trust), temporal (event causality), deontic (permitted actions), and doxastic (agent confidence interpretation).

Result: The approach provides interpretable learned structures where trust and causality are explicit parameters, enables knowledge injection via differentiable axioms for sparse data learning, supports compositional multi-modal reasoning combining epistemic, temporal, and deontic constraints, and offers practical deployment patterns for monitoring and controlling multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: DML offers a unified neurosymbolic debugging framework that makes logical contradictions learnable optimization objectives, with applications ranging from discovering deceptive alliances in diplomacy games to detecting LLM hallucinations, providing complete implementations as executable Jupyter notebooks.

Abstract: As multi-agent AI systems evolve from simple chatbots to autonomous swarms, debugging semantic failures requires reasoning about knowledge, belief, causality, and obligation, precisely what modal logic was designed to formalize. However, traditional modal logic requires manual specification of relationship structures that are unknown or dynamic in real systems. This tutorial demonstrates differentiable modal logic (DML), implemented via Modal Logical Neural Networks (MLNNs), enabling systems to learn trust networks, causal chains, and regulatory boundaries from behavioral data alone.
  We present a unified neurosymbolic debugging framework through four modalities: epistemic (who to trust), temporal (when events cause failures), deontic (what actions are permitted), and doxastic (how to interpret agent confidence). Each modality is demonstrated on concrete multi-agent scenarios, from discovering deceptive alliances in diplomacy games to detecting LLM hallucinations, with complete implementations showing how logical contradictions become learnable optimization objectives. Key contributions for the neurosymbolic community: (1) interpretable learned structures where trust and causality are explicit parameters, not opaque embeddings; (2) knowledge injection via differentiable axioms that guide learning with sparse data (3) compositional multi-modal reasoning that combines epistemic, temporal, and deontic constraints; and (4) practical deployment patterns for monitoring, active control and communication of multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs lack agency to actively manage their memory/context like Dumbledore's Pensieve - they passively accept manually engineered context as their entire memory, trapped in architectural constraints of fixed context windows.

Method: Introduces StateLM, a new class of foundation models with internal reasoning loops to manage state. Equips models with memory tools (context pruning, document indexing, note-taking) and trains them to actively manage these tools for dynamic context engineering.

Result: StateLMs consistently outperform standard LLMs across all model scales on long-document QA; achieve 10-20% absolute accuracy improvements on chat memory tasks; and show dramatic 52% vs 5% performance gap on BrowseComp-Plus deep research tasks.

Conclusion: StateLM shifts LLMs from passive predictors to state-aware agents where reasoning becomes a stateful and manageable process, breaking free from fixed context window limitations through active memory management.

Abstract: In the world of Harry Potter, when Dumbledore's mind is overburdened, he extracts memories into a Pensieve to be revisited later. In the world of AI, while we possess the Pensieve-mature databases and retrieval systems, our models inexplicably lack the "wand" to operate it. They remain like a Dumbledore without agency, passively accepting a manually engineered context as their entire memory. This work finally places the wand in the model's hand. We introduce StateLM, a new class of foundation models endowed with an internal reasoning loop to manage their own state. We equip our model with a suite of memory tools, such as context pruning, document indexing, and note-taking, and train it to actively manage these tools. By learning to dynamically engineering its own context, our model breaks free from the architectural prison of a fixed window. Experiments across various model sizes demonstrate StateLM's effectiveness across diverse scenarios. On long-document QA tasks, StateLMs consistently outperform standard LLMs across all model scales; on the chat memory task, they achieve absolute accuracy improvements of 10% to 20% over standard LLMs. On the deep research task BrowseComp-Plus, the performance gap becomes even more pronounced: StateLM achieves up to 52% accuracy, whereas standard LLM counterparts struggle around 5%. Ultimately, our approach shifts LLMs from passive predictors to state-aware agents where reasoning becomes a stateful and manageable process.

*Zewei Yu,Lirong Gao,Yuke Zhu,Bo Zheng,Sheng Guo,Haobo Wang,Junbo Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARLCP is a reinforcement learning framework that reduces excessive reflections in reasoning models by adaptively penalizing unnecessary reasoning steps while maintaining accuracy, achieving significant length reductions (53.1% for 1.5B model) with accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models often generate over-long chains-of-thought with excessive reflections (repetitive self-questioning, circular reasoning), leading to high token consumption, computational overhead, and latency without improving accuracy, especially in smaller models.

Method: Adaptive Reflection and Length Coordinated Penalty (ARLCP) - a reinforcement learning framework with two key innovations: (1) reflection penalty that adaptively curtails unnecessary reflective steps while preserving essential reasoning, and (2) length penalty calibrated to estimated problem complexity.

Result: On five mathematical reasoning benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and 7B models: 1.5B model achieved 53.1% reduction in average response length with 5.8% accuracy improvement; 7B model achieved 35.0% length reduction with 2.7% accuracy gain.

Conclusion: ARLCP achieves superior efficiency-accuracy trade-off compared to existing approaches by dynamically balancing reasoning efficiency and solution accuracy through coordinated adaptive penalties, enabling more concise and effective reasoning paths.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks by employing test-time scaling. However, they often generate over-long chains-of-thought that, driven by substantial reflections such as repetitive self-questioning and circular reasoning, lead to high token consumption, substantial computational overhead, and increased latency without improving accuracy, particularly in smaller models. Our observation reveals that increasing problem complexity induces more excessive and unnecessary reflection, which in turn reduces accuracy and increases token overhead. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Reflection and Length Coordinated Penalty (ARLCP), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to dynamically balance reasoning efficiency and solution accuracy. ARLCP introduces two key innovations: (1) a reflection penalty that adaptively curtails unnecessary reflective steps while preserving essential reasoning, and (2) a length penalty calibrated to the estimated complexity of the problem. By coordinating these penalties, ARLCP encourages the model to generate more concise and effective reasoning paths. We evaluate our method on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B models. Experimental results show that ARLCP achieves a superior efficiency-accuracy trade-off compared to existing approaches. For the 1.5B model, it reduces the average response length by 53.1% while simultaneously improving accuracy by 5.8%. For the 7B model, it achieves a 35.0% reduction in length with a 2.7% accuracy gain. The code is released at https://github.com/ZeweiYu1/ARLCP .

*Jittarin Jetwiriyanon,Teo Susnjak,Surangika Ranathunga*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TSFMs with leakage-safe covariates and IOCI index perform comparably to classical methods for university enrollment forecasting without institution-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Universities face financial pressure and need accurate enrollment forecasts, but traditional methods struggle with short, unstable data series and structural breaks in higher education contexts.

Method: Benchmark multiple TSFM families in zero-shot setting using leakage-safe covariates, introduce Institutional Operating Conditions Index (IOCI) from documentary evidence, and Google Trends proxies with feature engineering, tested via expanding-window backtest with vintage alignment.

Result: Covariate-conditioned TSFMs perform on par with classical benchmarks without institution-specific training, with performance varying by cohort and model.

Conclusion: TSFMs with carefully constructed covariates can provide reliable enrollment forecasting in data-sparse institutional settings, offering a viable alternative to classical methods.

Abstract: Many universities face increasing financial pressure and rely on accurate forecasts of commencing enrolments. However, enrolment forecasting in higher education is often data-sparse; annual series are short and affected by reporting changes and regime shifts. Popular classical approaches can be unreliable, as parameter estimation and model selection are unstable with short samples, and structural breaks degrade extrapolation. Recently, TSFMs have provided zero-shot priors, delivering strong gains in annual, data-sparse institutional forecasting under leakage-disciplined covariate construction. We benchmark multiple TSFM families in a zero-shot setting and test a compact, leakage-safe covariate set and introduce the Institutional Operating Conditions Index (IOCI), a transferable 0-100 regime covariate derived from time-stamped documentary evidence available at each forecast origin, alongside Google Trends demand proxies with stabilising feature engineering. Using an expanding-window backtest with strict vintage alignment, covariate-conditioned TSFMs perform on par with classical benchmarks without institution-specific training, with performance differences varying by cohort and model.

### [139] [HLA: Hadamard Linear Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12128)
*Hanno Ackermann,Hong Cai,Mohsen Ghafoorian,Amirhossein Habibian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HLA (Hadamard Linear Attention) improves linear attention by applying nonlinearity after computing pairwise similarities, using higher-degree rational functions to better approximate softmax attention, with efficient computation and no tensor reshaping needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard quadratic attention in transformers is computationally expensive, especially for applications with large token counts like video generation. Existing linear attention methods apply nonlinearity separately to queries/keys before similarity computation, resulting in low-degree approximations of softmax that may be suboptimal.

Method: Proposes Hadamard Linear Attention (HLA) that applies nonlinearity after computing pairwise token similarities (like standard softmax attention), using higher-degree rational functions to approximate softmax. Derives efficient computational scheme similar to standard linear attention without requiring tensor reshaping operations.

Result: HLA provides better approximation of softmax attention through higher-degree rational functions while maintaining computational efficiency. Successfully applied to large diffusion transformer models for video generation, demonstrating effectiveness with very large token counts.

Conclusion: HLA offers an improved linear attention mechanism that better approximates standard softmax attention while maintaining computational efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale applications like video generation transformers.

Abstract: The attention mechanism is an important reason for the success of transformers. It relies on computing pairwise relations between tokens. To reduce the high computational cost of standard quadratic attention, linear attention has been proposed as an efficient approximation. It employs kernel functions that are applied independently to the inputs before the pairwise similarities are calculated. That allows for an efficient computational procedure which, however, amounts to a low-degree rational function approximating softmax.
  We propose Hadamard Linear Attention (HLA). Unlike previous works on linear attention, the nonlinearity in HLA is not applied separately to queries and keys, but, analogously to standard softmax attention, after the pairwise similarities have been computed. It will be shown that the proposed nonlinearity amounts to a higher-degree rational function to approximate softmax. An efficient computational scheme for the proposed method is derived that is similar to that of standard linear attention. In contrast to other approaches, no time-consuming tensor reshaping is necessary to apply the proposed algorithm. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by applying it to a large diffusion transformer model for video generation, an application that involves very large amounts of tokens.

*Roberto Balestri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Commercial AI image generators show strong demographic biases: both Gemini and GPT exhibit >96% "default white" bias, but diverge on gender - Gemini favors female-presenting subjects while GPT favors male-presenting subjects with lighter skin tones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the assumption that neutral prompts yield demographically neutral outputs in commercial AI image generators, and to quantify gender and skin-tone bias in widely deployed models.

Method: Generated 3,200 photorealistic images using four semantically neutral prompts across two models (Gemini Flash 2.5 Image and GPT Image 1.5). Used a rigorous pipeline combining hybrid color normalization, facial landmark masking, and perceptually uniform skin tone quantification using Monk (MST), PERLA, and Fitzpatrick scales.

Result: Neutral prompts produced highly polarized defaults: both models showed strong "default white" bias (>96% of outputs). However, they diverged sharply on gender - Gemini favored female-presenting subjects, while GPT favored male-presenting subjects with lighter skin tones.

Conclusion: Neutral prompts function as diagnostic probes rather than neutral instructions, revealing underlying biases in AI image generation. The study provides a robust framework for auditing algorithmic visual culture and challenges the sociolinguistic assumption that unmarked language results in inclusive representation.

Abstract: This study quantifies gender and skin-tone bias in two widely deployed commercial image generators - Gemini Flash 2.5 Image (NanoBanana) and GPT Image 1.5 - to test the assumption that neutral prompts yield demographically neutral outputs. We generated 3,200 photorealistic images using four semantically neutral prompts. The analysis employed a rigorous pipeline combining hybrid color normalization, facial landmark masking, and perceptually uniform skin tone quantification using the Monk (MST), PERLA, and Fitzpatrick scales. Neutral prompts produced highly polarized defaults. Both models exhibited a strong "default white" bias (>96% of outputs). However, they diverged sharply on gender: Gemini favored female-presenting subjects, while GPT favored male-presenting subjects with lighter skin tones. This research provides a large-scale, comparative audit of state-of-the-art models using an illumination-aware colorimetric methodology, distinguishing aesthetic rendering from underlying pigmentation in synthetic imagery. The study demonstrates that neutral prompts function as diagnostic probes rather than neutral instructions. It offers a robust framework for auditing algorithmic visual culture and challenges the sociolinguistic assumption that unmarked language results in inclusive representation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Value Alignment Tax (VAT) - a framework measuring how alignment interventions cause unintended changes across interconnected values, not just target improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing value alignment work treats values statically, ignoring how interventions (prompting, fine-tuning, preference optimization) reshape the entire value system beyond just target values.

Method: Introduced VAT framework to measure propagation of alignment-induced changes across interconnected values. Used controlled scenario-action dataset grounded in Schwartz value theory with paired pre-post normative judgments across models, values, and alignment strategies.

Result: Alignment produces uneven, structured co-movement among values. These systemic effects are invisible under conventional target-only evaluation, revealing process-level alignment risks.

Conclusion: VAT offers new insights into dynamics of value alignment in LLMs, highlighting systemic risks that conventional evaluation misses, showing alignment interventions reshape broader value systems in structured ways.

Abstract: Existing work on value alignment typically characterizes value relations statically, ignoring how interventions - such as prompting, fine-tuning, or preference optimization - reshape the broader value system. We introduce the Value Alignment Tax (VAT), a framework that measures how alignment-induced changes propagate across interconnected values relative to achieved on-target gain. VAT captures the dynamics of value expression under alignment pressure. Using a controlled scenario-action dataset grounded in Schwartz value theory, we collect paired pre-post normative judgments and analyze alignment effects across models, values, and alignment strategies. Our results show that alignment often produces uneven, structured co-movement among values. These effects are invisible under conventional target-only evaluation, revealing systemic, process-level alignment risks and offering new insights into the dynamics of value alignment in LLMs.

TL;DR: STAR framework combines statistical expectations with agentic reasoning to predict model performance from limited observations, outperforming existing methods under extreme sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Comprehensive large model evaluation is prohibitively expensive, and existing methods struggle with pattern shifts, data sparsity, and lack of explanation while pure LLM methods remain unreliable.

Method: STAR bridges data-driven statistical expectations with knowledge-driven agentic reasoning using specialized retrievers for external knowledge, embeds semantic features into Constrained Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (CPMF) for statistical expectations with uncertainty, and uses a reasoning module guided by Expectation Violation Theory (EVT) to refine predictions through intra-family analysis, cross-model comparison, and credibility-aware aggregation.

Result: STAR consistently outperforms all baselines on both score-based and rank-based metrics, delivering a 14.46% gain in total score over the strongest statistical method under extreme sparsity with only 1-2 observed scores per test model.

Conclusion: STAR effectively addresses the challenges of predicting model performance from limited observations by combining statistical and knowledge-driven approaches, providing traceable explanations and superior performance under extreme sparsity conditions.

Abstract: As comprehensive large model evaluation becomes prohibitively expensive, predicting model performance from limited observations has become essential. However, existing statistical methods struggle with pattern shifts, data sparsity, and lack of explanation, while pure LLM methods remain unreliable. We propose STAR, a framework that bridges data-driven STatistical expectations with knowledge-driven Agentic Reasoning. STAR leverages specialized retrievers to gather external knowledge and embeds semantic features into Constrained Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (CPMF) to generate statistical expectations with uncertainty. A reasoning module guided by Expectation Violation Theory (EVT) then refines predictions through intra-family analysis, cross-model comparison, and credibility-aware aggregation, producing adjustments with traceable explanations. Extensive experiments show that STAR consistently outperforms all baselines on both score-based and rank-based metrics, delivering a 14.46% gain in total score over the strongest statistical method under extreme sparsity, with only 1--2 observed scores per test model.

TL;DR: A novel lossless compression method using Reinforcement Learning with T5 architecture that compresses data into token sequences rather than dense vectors, achieving higher compression ratios while preserving semantic integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional compression techniques struggle with complex data formats, and deep learning approaches often use dense vector representations that obscure token structure. There's a need for compression methods that better preserve data format while improving efficiency.

Method: Uses Reinforcement Learning applied to a T5 language model architecture to compress data into token sequences rather than traditional vector representations. Employs off-policy RL algorithm to optimize sequence length, minimize redundancy, and enhance compression efficiency.

Result: Achieves significant improvements in compression ratios compared to conventional methods, preserves token-based structure, and maintains semantic integrity without requiring explicit content understanding.

Conclusion: The RL-based approach with T5 architecture provides an efficient, adaptive compression system that leverages language model latent information, paving the way for robust practical compression solutions across various applications.

Abstract: Efficient lossless compression is essential for minimizing storage costs and transmission overhead while preserving data integrity. Traditional compression techniques, such as dictionary-based and statistical methods, often struggle to optimally exploit the structure and redundancy in complex data formats. Recent advancements in deep learning have opened new avenues for compression; however, many existing approaches depend on dense vector representations that obscure the underlying token structure. To address these limitations, we propose a novel lossless compression method that leverages Reinforcement Learning applied to a T5 language model architecture. This approach enables the compression of data into sequences of tokens rather than traditional vector representations. Unlike auto-encoders, which typically encode information into continuous latent spaces, our method preserves the token-based structure, aligning more closely with the original data format. This preservation allows for higher compression ratios while maintaining semantic integrity. By training the model using an off-policy Reinforcement Learning algorithm, we optimize sequence length to minimize redundancy and enhance compression efficiency. Our method introduces an efficient and adaptive data compression system built upon advanced Reinforcement Learning techniques, functioning independently of external grammatical or world knowledge. This approach shows significant improvements in compression ratios compared to conventional methods. By leveraging the latent information within language models, our system effectively compresses data without requiring explicit content understanding, paving the way for more robust and practical compression solutions across various applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show social proficiency but lack a coherent Theory of Mind - they succeed on simple ToM tasks but fail logically equivalent ones and show inconsistent mental state reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether LLMs possess a genuine Theory of Mind (ToM) - not just surface-level social task performance - by testing if they have coherent causal models of mental states and behavior.

Method: Developed a cognitively-grounded evaluation framework that probes whether LLMs have domain-general, consistent models of how mental states cause behavior, testing them on logically equivalent tasks and checking consistency between action predictions and mental state inferences.

Result: LLMs succeed at approximating human judgments in simple ToM paradigms but fail at logically equivalent tasks and exhibit low consistency between their action predictions and corresponding mental state inferences.

Conclusion: LLMs' social proficiency is not the result of a domain-general or consistent Theory of Mind; they lack the coherent causal mental models that characterize genuine ToM.

Abstract: Do Large Language Models (LLMs) possess a Theory of Mind (ToM)? Research into this question has focused on evaluating LLMs against benchmarks and found success across a range of social tasks. However, these evaluations do not test for the actual representations posited by ToM: namely, a causal model of mental states and behavior. Here, we use a cognitively-grounded definition of ToM to develop and test a new evaluation framework. Specifically, our approach probes whether LLMs have a coherent, domain-general, and consistent model of how mental states cause behavior -- regardless of whether that model matches a human-like ToM. We find that even though LLMs succeed in approximating human judgments in a simple ToM paradigm, they fail at a logically equivalent task and exhibit low consistency between their action predictions and corresponding mental state inferences. As such, these findings suggest that the social proficiency exhibited by LLMs is not the result of an domain-general or consistent ToM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show strong reasoning but remain fragile in scientific tasks due to unreliable solution evaluation and limited verification strategy diversity.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Use small annotated data to establish correctness anchors for Verifier; 2) Geometric reward mechanism considering consensus, reliability, and diversity drives large-scale self-iteration on unlabeled data.

Result: Experiments on general scientific benchmarks show enhanced complex reasoning capabilities, strong scalability, and more robust, diverse evaluation systems.

Conclusion: Sci-CoE enables effective self-evolution of LLMs as solver and verifier in scientific reasoning, addressing fragility through structured co-evolving with geometric rewards.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional reasoning capabilities, and co-evolving paradigms have shown promising results in domains such as code and math. However, in scientific reasoning tasks, these models remain fragile due to unreliable solution evaluation and limited diversity in verification strategies. In this work, we propose Sci-CoE, a two-stage scientific co-evolving framework that enables models to self-evolve as both solver and verifier through a transition from sparse supervision to unsupervised learning. In the first stage, the model uses a small set of annotated data to establish fundamental correctness judgment anchors for the Verifier. In the second stage, we introduce a geometric reward mechanism that jointly considers consensus, reliability, and diversity, driving large-scale self-iteration on unlabeled data. Experiments on several general scientific benchmarks demonstrate that Sci-CoE enhances complex reasoning capabilities and exhibits strong scalability, facilitating the construction of more robust and diverse evaluation systems.

TL;DR: Extends Quantified Boolean Bayesian Networks (QBBN) with negation and natural language parsing, creating a complete logical inference system that integrates LLMs for preprocessing and grammar for structured parsing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses two key gaps in previous QBBN work: lack of negation/backward reasoning capabilities and absence of natural language parsing. Aims to create a complete logical inference system that bridges formal semantics with modern LLM capabilities.

Method: Extends QBBN with NEG factors for contrapositive reasoning, develops typed logical language with role-labeled predicates and modal quantifiers, creates typed slot grammar for deterministic sentence compilation, and integrates LLMs for preprocessing and disambiguation.

Result: QBBN handles 44/44 test cases spanning 22 reasoning patterns; grammar achieves 33/33 correct parses with zero ambiguity; LLMs achieve 95% PP attachment accuracy but only 12.4% UAS for direct structured parsing, confirming grammar necessity.

Conclusion: Successfully reconciles formal semantics with Sutton's "bitter lesson" by using LLMs to eliminate annotation bottlenecks while QBBN serves as verifier, creating a hybrid architecture where LLMs preprocess, grammar parses, LLMs rerank, and QBBN infers.

Abstract: In previous work (Coppola, 2024) we introduced the Quantified Boolean Bayesian Network (QBBN), a logical graphical model that implements the forward fragment of natural deduction (Prawitz, 1965) as a probabilistic factor graph. That work left two gaps: no negation/backward reasoning, and no parser for natural language.
  This paper addresses both gaps across inference, semantics, and syntax. For inference, we extend the QBBN with NEG factors enforcing P(x) + P(neg x) = 1, enabling contrapositive reasoning (modus tollens) via backward lambda messages, completing Prawitz's simple elimination rules. The engine handles 44/44 test cases spanning 22 reasoning patterns. For semantics, we present a typed logical language with role-labeled predicates, modal quantifiers, and three tiers of expressiveness following Prawitz: first-order quantification, propositions as arguments, and predicate quantification via lambda abstraction. For syntax, we present a typed slot grammar that deterministically compiles sentences to logical form (33/33 correct, zero ambiguity). LLMs handle disambiguation (95% PP attachment accuracy) but cannot produce structured parses directly (12.4% UAS), confirming grammars are necessary. The architecture: LLM preprocesses, grammar parses, LLM reranks, QBBN infers.
  We argue this reconciles formal semantics with Sutton's "bitter lesson" (2019): LLMs eliminate the annotation bottleneck that killed formal NLP, serving as annotator while the QBBN serves as verifier. Code: https://github.com/gregorycoppola/world

TL;DR: IOA framework applies educational principles (Bloom's Mastery Learning, Vygotsky's ZPD) to LLM knowledge distillation via a three-stage pipeline that systematically identifies knowledge gaps, organizes progressive curricula, and adapts representations to student capacity, achieving near-teacher performance with much smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM distillation methods lack pedagogical awareness, treating knowledge transfer as a one-off data synthesis task rather than a systematic learning process inspired by educational principles.

Method: Three-stage IOA pipeline: Knowledge Identifier (finds student deficiencies), Organizer (creates progressive curricula using Bloom's Mastery Learning and Vygotsky's ZPD), and Adapter (adapts representations to student cognitive capacity).

Result: Student models retain 94.7% of teacher performance on DollyEval with <1/10th parameters, plus 19.2% improvement on MATH and 22.3% on HumanEval vs SOTA baselines.

Conclusion: Pedagogically-inspired distillation framework significantly outperforms traditional methods, especially on complex reasoning tasks, demonstrating the value of educational principles in AI knowledge transfer.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation from Large Language Models (LLMs) to smaller models has emerged as a critical technique for deploying efficient AI systems. However, current methods for distillation via synthetic data lack pedagogical awareness, treating knowledge transfer as a one-off data synthesis and training task rather than a systematic learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel pedagogically-inspired framework for LLM knowledge distillation that draws from fundamental educational principles. Our approach introduces a three-stage pipeline -- Knowledge Identifier, Organizer, and Adapter (IOA) -- that systematically identifies knowledge deficiencies in student models, organizes knowledge delivery through progressive curricula, and adapts representations to match the cognitive capacity of student models. We integrate Bloom's Mastery Learning Principles and Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development to create a dynamic distillation process where student models approach teacher model's performance on prerequisite knowledge before advancing, and new knowledge is introduced with controlled, gradual difficulty increments. Extensive experiments using LLaMA-3.1/3.2 and Qwen2.5 as student models demonstrate that IOA achieves significant improvements over baseline distillation methods, with student models retaining 94.7% of teacher performance on DollyEval while using less than 1/10th of the parameters. Our framework particularly excels in complex reasoning tasks, showing 19.2% improvement on MATH and 22.3% on HumanEval compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language segmentation models like SAM3 use large general-purpose text encoders that are over-provisioned for segmentation prompts, which are typically short, structured, and semantically constrained, leading to computational and memory inefficiency.

Method: Analyzed 404,796 real segmentation prompts across benchmarks, revealing text encoding redundancy. Proposed SAM3-LiteText framework that replaces SAM3's text encoder with a compact MobileCLIP student optimized via knowledge distillation.

Result: SAM3-LiteText reduces text encoder parameters by up to 88%, substantially reducing static memory footprint while maintaining segmentation performance comparable to original SAM3 on image and video segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: The analysis reveals severe redundancy in text prompting for vision-language segmentation, and the proposed lightweight text encoding framework effectively addresses over-provisioning while preserving model performance.

Abstract: Vision-language segmentation models such as SAM3 enable flexible, prompt-driven visual grounding, but inherit large, general-purpose text encoders originally designed for open-ended language understanding. In practice, segmentation prompts are short, structured, and semantically constrained, leading to substantial over-provisioning in text encoder capacity and persistent computational and memory overhead. In this paper, we perform a large-scale anatomical analysis of text prompting in vision-language segmentation, covering 404,796 real prompts across multiple benchmarks. Our analysis reveals severe redundancy: most context windows are underutilized, vocabulary usage is highly sparse, and text embeddings lie on low-dimensional manifold despite high-dimensional representations. Motivated by these findings, we propose SAM3-LiteText, a lightweight text encoding framework that replaces the original SAM3 text encoder with a compact MobileCLIP student that is optimized by knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments on image and video segmentation benchmarks show that SAM3-LiteText reduces text encoder parameters by up to 88%, substantially reducing static memory footprint, while maintaining segmentation performance comparable to the original model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite low word error rates on benchmarks, speech recognition systems fail on real-world short, high-stakes utterances like street names, causing systematic errors that disproportionately affect non-English speakers.

Method: Evaluated 15 models from major providers on linguistically diverse U.S. speakers' street name recordings. Introduced synthetic data generation using open-source TTS models to create diverse pronunciations, then fine-tuned with <1,000 synthetic samples.

Result: Average transcription error rate of 44% on street names. Routing distance errors twice as large for non-English primary speakers. Fine-tuning with synthetic data improved street name transcription accuracy by nearly 60% for non-English speakers.

Conclusion: There's a critical gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability in speech systems. Synthetic data generation provides a simple, scalable solution to reduce high-stakes transcription errors, especially for linguistically diverse populations.

Abstract: Despite speech recognition systems achieving low word error rates on standard benchmarks, they often fail on short, high-stakes utterances in real-world deployments. Here, we study this failure mode in a high-stakes task: the transcription of U.S. street names as spoken by U.S. participants. We evaluate 15 models from OpenAI, Deepgram, Google, and Microsoft on recordings from linguistically diverse U.S. speakers and find an average transcription error rate of 44%. We quantify the downstream impact of failed transcriptions by geographic locations and show that mis-transcriptions systematically cause errors for all speakers, but that routing distance errors are twice as large for non-English primary speakers compared to English primary speakers. To mitigate this harm, we introduce a synthetic data generation approach that produces diverse pronunciations of named entities using open-source text-to-speech models. Fine-tuning with less than 1,000 synthetic samples improves street name transcription accuracy by nearly 60% (relative to base models) for non-English primary speakers. Our results highlight a critical gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability in speech systems and demonstrate a simple, scalable path to reducing high-stakes transcription errors.

*Jianke Yang,Ohm Venkatachalam,Mohammad Kianezhad,Sharvaree Vadgama,Rose Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KeplerAgent is an LLM-based framework that mimics scientific reasoning by first inferring physical properties, then using them to guide symbolic regression for equation discovery, outperforming direct LLM guessing and traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based equation discovery systems directly guess equations from data without modeling the multi-step scientific reasoning process that scientists use (first inferring physical properties like symmetries, then using them as priors).

Method: KeplerAgent coordinates physics-based tools to extract intermediate structure, then uses these results to configure symbolic regression engines (PySINDy, PySR) including their function libraries and structural constraints.

Result: Across physical equation benchmarks, KeplerAgent achieves substantially higher symbolic accuracy and greater robustness to noisy data than both LLM and traditional baselines.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling the scientific reasoning process (inferring physical properties first, then using them as priors) leads to better symbolic equation discovery compared to direct equation guessing approaches.

Abstract: Explaining observed phenomena through symbolic, interpretable formulas is a fundamental goal of science. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for symbolic equation discovery, owing to their broad domain knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities. However, most existing LLM-based systems try to guess equations directly from data, without modeling the multi-step reasoning process that scientists often follow: first inferring physical properties such as symmetries, then using these as priors to restrict the space of candidate equations. We introduce KeplerAgent, an agentic framework that explicitly follows this scientific reasoning process. The agent coordinates physics-based tools to extract intermediate structure and uses these results to configure symbolic regression engines such as PySINDy and PySR, including their function libraries and structural constraints. Across a suite of physical equation benchmarks, KeplerAgent achieves substantially higher symbolic accuracy and greater robustness to noisy data than both LLM and traditional baselines.

*Zhen Zhang,Kaiqiang Song,Xun Wang,Yebowen Hu,Weixiang Yan,Chenyang Zhao,Henry Peng Zou,Haoyun Deng,Sathish Reddy Indurthi,Shujian Liu,Simin Ma,Xiaoyang Wang,Xin Eric Wang,Song Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CM2 is an RL framework for AI agents that replaces verifiable rewards with checklist-based rewards, enabling scalable training for multi-turn tool use without heavy environment engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world AI agent tasks lack verifiable rewards and emphasize open-ended behaviors, while RL for multi-turn tool use is underexplored, and building executable tool environments is costly and limits scale.

Method: Decomposes each turn's behavior into fine-grained binary criteria with explicit evidence grounding, using sparse reward assignment but dense evaluation criteria. Training occurs in scalable LLM-simulated tool environments.

Result: CM2 consistently improves over supervised fine-tuning: +8 points on tau^-Bench, +10 points on BFCL-V4, +12 points on ToolSandbox. Results match or outperform similarly sized open-source baselines including the judging model.

Conclusion: CM2 provides a scalable recipe for optimizing multi-turn, multi-step tool-using agents without relying on verifiable rewards, enabling effective RL training for real-world agent tasks.

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly used to solve real-world tasks by reasoning over multi-turn user interactions and invoking external tools. However, applying reinforcement learning to such settings remains difficult: realistic objectives often lack verifiable rewards and instead emphasize open-ended behaviors; moreover, RL for multi-turn, multi-step agentic tool use is still underexplored; and building and maintaining executable tool environments is costly, limiting scale and coverage. We propose CM2, an RL framework that replaces verifiable outcome rewards with checklist rewards. CM2 decomposes each turn's intended behavior into fine-grained binary criteria with explicit evidence grounding and structured metadata, turning open-ended judging into more stable classification-style decisions. To balance stability and informativeness, our method adopts a strategy of sparse reward assignment but dense evaluation criteria. Training is performed in a scalable LLM-simulated tool environment, avoiding heavy engineering for large tool sets. Experiments show that CM2 consistently improves over supervised fine-tuning. Starting from an 8B Base model and training on an 8k-example RL dataset, CM2 improves over the SFT counterpart by 8 points on tau^-Bench, by 10 points on BFCL-V4, and by 12 points on ToolSandbox. The results match or even outperform similarly sized open-source baselines, including the judging model. CM2 thus provides a scalable recipe for optimizing multi-turn, multi-step tool-using agents without relying on verifiable rewards.

### [152] [Agentic Test-Time Scaling for WebAgents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12276)
*Nicholas Lee,Lutfi Eren Erdogan,Chris Joseph John,Surya Krishnapillai,Michael W. Mahoney,Kurt Keutzer,Amir Gholami*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CATTS is a confidence-aware test-time scaling method that dynamically allocates compute for multi-step agents based on vote-derived uncertainty, improving performance while reducing token usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-time scaling improves neural network performance, but its behavior on multi-step agentic tasks is poorly understood. Uniform compute scaling shows diminishing returns in long-horizon environments, and per-step errors can compound over time.

Method: CATTS uses uncertainty statistics (entropy and top-1/top-2 margin) derived from the agent's own vote distribution to dynamically allocate compute only when decisions are contentious. It avoids uniform scaling by identifying genuinely uncertain steps.

Result: CATTS improves performance on WebArena-Lite and GoBrowse by up to 9.1% over React while using up to 2.3x fewer tokens than uniform scaling. It outperforms naive voting and LLM-based arbitration approaches.

Conclusion: Confidence-aware dynamic compute allocation based on vote-derived uncertainty provides both efficiency gains and interpretable decision rules for multi-step agents, addressing the limitations of uniform test-time scaling.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has become a standard way to improve performance and boost reliability of neural network models. However, its behavior on agentic, multi-step tasks remains less well-understood: small per-step errors can compound over long horizons; and we find that naive policies that uniformly increase sampling show diminishing returns. In this work, we present CATTS, a simple technique for dynamically allocating compute for multi-step agents. We first conduct an empirical study of inference-time scaling for web agents. We find that uniformly increasing per-step compute quickly saturates in long-horizon environments. We then investigate stronger aggregation strategies, including an LLM-based Arbiter that can outperform naive voting, but that can overrule high-consensus decisions. We show that uncertainty statistics derived from the agent's own vote distribution (entropy and top-1/top-2 margin) correlate with downstream success and provide a practical signal for dynamic compute allocation. Based on these findings, we introduce Confidence-Aware Test-Time Scaling (CATTS), which uses vote-derived uncertainty to allocate compute only when decisions are genuinely contentious. CATTS improves performance on WebArena-Lite and GoBrowse by up to 9.1% over React while using up to 2.3x fewer tokens than uniform scaling, providing both efficiency gains and an interpretable decision rule.

### [153] [Mitigating Error Accumulation in Continuous Navigation via Memory-Augmented Kalman Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11183)
*Yin Tang,Jiawei Ma,Jinrui Zhang,Alex Jinpeng Wang,Deyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NeuroKalman: A Bayesian framework for UAV vision-language navigation that corrects state drift by combining motion prediction with historical observation retrieval, outperforming baselines with minimal fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLN models for UAVs suffer from accumulated position errors (state drift) due to dead-reckoning stepwise prediction, causing misalignment between internal belief and objective coordinates that compromises trajectory accuracy.

Method: Formulates sequential prediction as recursive Bayesian state estimation with two processes: Prior Prediction (based on motion dynamics) and Likelihood Correction (from historical observation). Associates Kernel Density Estimation of measurement likelihood with attention-based retrieval to rectify latent representation using historical anchors without gradient updates.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on TravelUAV benchmark show the method clearly outperforms strong baselines and regulates drift accumulation, achieving superior performance with only 10% of training data fine-tuning.

Conclusion: NeuroKalman effectively addresses state drift in UAV navigation by combining Bayesian estimation with neural mechanisms, enabling more accurate continuous navigation in complex environments with minimal training requirements.

Abstract: Continuous navigation in complex environments is critical for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). However, the existing Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) models follow the dead-reckoning, which iteratively updates its position for the next waypoint prediction, and subsequently construct the complete trajectory. Then, such stepwise manner will inevitably lead to accumulated errors of position over time, resulting in misalignment between internal belief and objective coordinates, which is known as "state drift" and ultimately compromises the full trajectory prediction. Drawing inspiration from classical control theory, we propose to correct for errors by formulating such sequential prediction as a recursive Bayesian state estimation problem. In this paper, we design NeuroKalman, a novel framework that decouples navigation into two complementary processes: a Prior Prediction, based on motion dynamics and a Likelihood Correction, from historical observation. We first mathematically associate Kernel Density Estimation of the measurement likelihood with the attention-based retrieval mechanism, which then allows the system to rectify the latent representation using retrieved historical anchors without gradient updates. Comprehensive experiments on TravelUAV benchmark demonstrate that, with only 10% of the training data fine-tuning, our method clearly outperforms strong baselines and regulates drift accumulation.

### [154] [H-WM: Robotic Task and Motion Planning Guided by Hierarchical World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11291)
*Wenyuan Chen,Jinbang Huang,Oscar Pang,Zhiyuan Li,Xiao Hu,Lingfeng Zhang,Zhanguang Zhang,Mark Coates,Tongtong Cao,Xingyue Quan,Yingxue Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: H-WM is a hierarchical world model that jointly predicts logical and visual state transitions, combining symbolic reasoning robustness with perceptual grounding for long-horizon robotic planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing world models focus on video generation or language prediction, which are hard to ground in robot actions and suffer from compounding errors. Traditional symbolic planning lacks visual perception integration, preventing synchronized symbolic and perceptual state prediction.

Method: Proposes Hierarchical World Model (H-WM) with bilevel framework: high-level logical world model for symbolic reasoning and low-level visual world model for perceptual grounding. Uses robotic dataset aligning motion with symbolic states, actions, and visual observations.

Result: Experiments across vision-language-action control policies demonstrate effectiveness and generality. The hierarchical outputs provide stable intermediate guidance for long-horizon tasks, mitigating error accumulation.

Conclusion: H-WM successfully integrates robot-executable symbolic reasoning with visual perception, enabling robust execution across extended task sequences by combining logical and visual state prediction in a unified framework.

Abstract: World models are becoming central to robotic planning and control, as they enable prediction of future state transitions. Existing approaches often emphasize video generation or natural language prediction, which are difficult to directly ground in robot actions and suffer from compounding errors over long horizons. Traditional task and motion planning relies on symbolic logic world models, such as planning domains, that are robot-executable and robust for long-horizon reasoning. However, these methods typically operate independently of visual perception, preventing synchronized symbolic and perceptual state prediction. We propose a Hierarchical World Model (H-WM) that jointly predicts logical and visual state transitions within a unified bilevel framework. H-WM combines a high-level logical world model with a low-level visual world model, integrating the robot-executable, long-horizon robustness of symbolic reasoning with perceptual grounding from visual observations. The hierarchical outputs provide stable and consistent intermediate guidance for long-horizon tasks, mitigating error accumulation and enabling robust execution across extended task sequences. To train H-WM, we introduce a robotic dataset that aligns robot motion with symbolic states, actions, and visual observations. Experiments across vision-language-action (VLA) control policies demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the approach.

### [155] [ExtremControl: Low-Latency Humanoid Teleoperation with Direct Extremity Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11321)
*Ziyan Xiong,Lixing Fang,Junyun Huang,Kashu Yamazaki,Hao Zhang,Chuang Gan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ExtremControl is a low-latency whole-body control framework for humanoid teleoperation that uses SE(3) poses of extremities, Cartesian-space mapping, and velocity feedforward to achieve 50ms latency, enabling responsive tasks like ping-pong balancing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing humanoid teleoperation systems suffer from substantial latency due to heavy pre-processing for motion retargeting and position-only PD control, which limits responsiveness and prevents tasks requiring rapid feedback and fast reactions.

Method: ExtremControl operates directly on SE(3) poses of selected rigid links (primarily extremities), uses Cartesian-space mapping to convert human motion to humanoid targets, and incorporates velocity feedforward control at low level for responsiveness.

Result: Achieves end-to-end latency as low as 50ms (substantially surpassing prior 200ms limit), enabling highly responsive behaviors like ping-pong ball balancing, juggling, and real-time return in both simulation and real-world environments.

Conclusion: ExtremControl provides a low-latency teleoperation framework that enables reactive and dynamic humanoid demonstrations, overcoming previous latency limitations and supporting tasks requiring rapid feedback and fast reactions.

Abstract: Building a low-latency humanoid teleoperation system is essential for collecting diverse reactive and dynamic demonstrations. However, existing approaches rely on heavily pre-processed human-to-humanoid motion retargeting and position-only PD control, resulting in substantial latency that severely limits responsiveness and prevents tasks requiring rapid feedback and fast reactions. To address this problem, we propose ExtremControl, a low latency whole-body control framework that: (1) operates directly on SE(3) poses of selected rigid links, primarily humanoid extremities, to avoid full-body retargeting; (2) utilizes a Cartesian-space mapping to directly convert human motion to humanoid link targets; and (3) incorporates velocity feedforward control at low level to support highly responsive behavior under rapidly changing control interfaces. We further provide a unified theoretical formulation of ExtremControl and systematically validate its effectiveness through experiments in both simulation and real-world environments. Building on ExtremControl, we implement a low-latency humanoid teleoperation system that supports both optical motion capture and VR-based motion tracking, achieving end-to-end latency as low as 50ms and enabling highly responsive behaviors such as ping-pong ball balancing, juggling, and real-time return, thereby substantially surpassing the 200ms latency limit observed in prior work.

TL;DR: MolmoSpaces is an open ecosystem with 230k+ diverse indoor environments and 130k annotated objects for large-scale robot policy benchmarking, supporting multiple simulators and showing strong sim-to-real correlation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world robot deployment requires robustness to countless variations in scenes, objects, and tasks that are underrepresented in existing benchmarks. Physical evaluation alone cannot provide the scale and diversity needed to measure this level of generalization.

Method: Created MolmoSpaces ecosystem with over 230k diverse indoor environments (handcrafted and procedurally generated), 130k richly annotated object assets (48k manipulable objects with 42M stable grasps), simulator-agnostic support for MuJoCo, Isaac, and ManiSkill, and MolmoSpaces-Bench benchmark suite of 8 tasks.

Result: MolmoSpaces-Bench exhibits strong sim-to-real correlation (R = 0.96, ρ = 0.98), confirms newer zero-shot policies outperform earlier versions, and identifies key sensitivities to prompt phrasing, initial joint positions, and camera occlusion.

Conclusion: MolmoSpaces provides a foundation for scalable data generation, policy training, and benchmark creation for robot learning research, enabling evaluation of generalization across the long tail of real-world variations.

Abstract: Deploying robots at scale demands robustness to the long tail of everyday situations. The countless variations in scene layout, object geometry, and task specifications that characterize real environments are vast and underrepresented in existing robot benchmarks. Measuring this level of generalization requires infrastructure at a scale and diversity that physical evaluation alone cannot provide. We introduce MolmoSpaces, a fully open ecosystem to support large-scale benchmarking of robot policies. MolmoSpaces consists of over 230k diverse indoor environments, ranging from handcrafted household scenes to procedurally generated multiroom houses, populated with 130k richly annotated object assets, including 48k manipulable objects with 42M stable grasps. Crucially, these environments are simulator-agnostic, supporting popular options such as MuJoCo, Isaac, and ManiSkill. The ecosystem supports the full spectrum of embodied tasks: static and mobile manipulation, navigation, and multiroom long-horizon tasks requiring coordinated perception, planning, and interaction across entire indoor environments. We also design MolmoSpaces-Bench, a benchmark suite of 8 tasks in which robots interact with our diverse scenes and richly annotated objects. Our experiments show MolmoSpaces-Bench exhibits strong sim-to-real correlation (R = 0.96, \r{ho} = 0.98), confirm newer and stronger zero-shot policies outperform earlier versions in our benchmarks, and identify key sensitivities to prompt phrasing, initial joint positions, and camera occlusion. Through MolmoSpaces and its open-source assets and tooling, we provide a foundation for scalable data generation, policy training, and benchmark creation for robot learning research.

*Mrinal Verghese,Christopher G. Atkeson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Learning robot behaviors from human videos by modeling human preferences as a reward function based on predicted vs. observed object motion, then optimizing policies using modified SAC with minimal robot demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work on learning from human videos has limitations: they measure long-term value based on temporal distance to terminal states, make restrictive assumptions, and struggle with embodiment/environment transfer. There's a need for better methods that can learn directly from human videos and transfer effectively to robots.

Method: 1) Model human preferences by learning to predict motion of tracked points between subsequent images; 2) Define reward as agreement between predicted and observed object motion in robot behavior; 3) Use modified Soft Actor Critic (SAC) initialized with only 10 on-robot demonstrations to estimate value function; 4) Optimize policy to maximize this value function directly on the robot.

Result: Policies learned with this reward model match or outperform prior work across multiple tasks in both simulation and on real robots. The approach is capable of learning directly on a real robot.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully bridges the embodiment gap by learning human preferences from videos and transferring them to robots through a motion-based reward function, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal on-robot demonstrations.

Abstract: We present an approach to robot learning from egocentric human videos by modeling human preferences in a reward function and optimizing robot behavior to maximize this reward. Prior work on reward learning from human videos attempts to measure the long-term value of a visual state as the temporal distance between it and the terminal state in a demonstration video. These approaches make assumptions that limit performance when learning from video. They must also transfer the learned value function across the embodiment and environment gap. Our method models human preferences by learning to predict the motion of tracked points between subsequent images and defines a reward function as the agreement between predicted and observed object motion in a robot's behavior at each step. We then use a modified Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm initialized with 10 on-robot demonstrations to estimate a value function from this reward and optimize a policy that maximizes this value function, all on the robot. Our approach is capable of learning on a real robot, and we show that policies learned with our reward model match or outperform prior work across multiple tasks in both simulation and on the real robot.

TL;DR: EasyMimic enables low-cost robots to learn manipulation policies from human video demonstrations using 3D hand trajectory extraction, action alignment, hand visual augmentation, and co-training with minimal robot data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High cost of collecting large-scale real-world robot data hinders imitation learning, especially for affordable home robots that need to be user-friendly and cost-effective.

Method: Extract 3D hand trajectories from RGB videos, map to robot gripper control space, use hand visual augmentation to bridge human-robot domain gap, and co-train with small robot dataset for rapid adaptation.

Result: Achieves high performance on low-cost LeRobot platform across various manipulation tasks, significantly reducing reliance on expensive robot data collection.

Conclusion: Provides practical solution for bringing intelligent robots into homes by enabling low-cost robots to learn from human demonstrations with minimal robot-specific data.

Abstract: Robot imitation learning is often hindered by the high cost of collecting large-scale, real-world data. This challenge is especially significant for low-cost robots designed for home use, as they must be both user-friendly and affordable. To address this, we propose the EasyMimic framework, a low-cost and replicable solution that enables robots to quickly learn manipulation policies from human video demonstrations captured with standard RGB cameras. Our method first extracts 3D hand trajectories from the videos. An action alignment module then maps these trajectories to the gripper control space of a low-cost robot. To bridge the human-to-robot domain gap, we introduce a simple and user-friendly hand visual augmentation strategy. We then use a co-training method, fine-tuning a model on both the processed human data and a small amount of robot data, enabling rapid adaptation to new tasks. Experiments on the low-cost LeRobot platform demonstrate that EasyMimic achieves high performance across various manipulation tasks. It significantly reduces the reliance on expensive robot data collection, offering a practical path for bringing intelligent robots into homes.

*Raihan Islam Arnob,Max Merlin,Abhishek Paudel,Benned Hedegaard,George Konidaris,Gregory Stein*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Planning framework that integrates object search policies (LIOS actions) into task planning to handle unknown object locations while maintaining compatibility with existing solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional task planning assumes full environment knowledge, while recent object search approaches operate standalone and can't be easily integrated into full task planners that need to determine what objects are necessary and when to search for them.

Method: Develops LIOS (Learning-Informed Object Search) actions - each a policy for finding and retrieving a single object. High-level planning treats these as deterministic actions, using model-based calculations of expected cost to generate plans that interleave search and execution.

Result: Outperforms both non-learned and learned baselines in simulated ProcTHOR homes and real-world tasks including retrieval and meal preparation, while maintaining soundness and completeness.

Conclusion: The framework effectively reasons about uncertainty while maintaining compatibility with existing full-knowledge solvers, enabling learning-informed task planning despite unknown object locations.

Abstract: Task planning for mobile robots often assumes full environment knowledge and so popular approaches, like planning via the PDDL, cannot plan when the locations of task-critical objects are unknown. Recent learning-driven object search approaches are effective, but operate as standalone tools and so are not straightforwardly incorporated into full task planners, which must additionally determine both what objects are necessary and when in the plan they should be sought out. To address this limitation, we develop a planning framework centered around novel model-based LIOS actions: each a policy that aims to find and retrieve a single object. High-level planning treats LIOS actions as deterministic and so -- informed by model-based calculations of the expected cost of each -- generates plans that interleave search and execution for effective, sound, and complete learning-informed task planning despite uncertainty. Our work effectively reasons about uncertainty while maintaining compatibility with existing full-knowledge solvers. In simulated ProcTHOR homes and in the real world, our approach outperforms non-learned and learned baselines on tasks including retrieval and meal prep.

*Yichun Xiao,Runwei Guan,Fangqiang Ding*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HyperDet is a detector-agnostic framework that refines sparse 4D radar point clouds to work with standard LiDAR detectors, using multi-frame aggregation, cross-sensor validation, and diffusion-based densification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D radar is weather-robust and cost-effective but produces sparse, noisy point clouds that underperform compared to LiDAR-based 3D detection systems. Radar-only detection trails LiDAR despite radar's advantages.

Method: 1) Aggregates multiple surround-view radar frames for better coverage; 2) Geometry-aware cross-sensor consensus validation with self-consistency checks; 3) Foreground-focused diffusion module with mixed radar-LiDAR supervision, distilled into a consistency model for single-step inference.

Result: On MAN TruckScenes, HyperDet consistently improves detection over raw radar inputs with VoxelNeXt and CenterPoint detectors, partially narrowing the performance gap between radar and LiDAR systems.

Conclusion: Input-level refinement enables radar to better leverage existing LiDAR-oriented detectors without architectural modifications, making radar-only 3D detection more viable.

Abstract: 4D mmWave radar provides weather-robust, velocity-aware measurements and is more cost-effective than LiDAR. However, radar-only 3D detection still trails LiDAR-based systems because radar point clouds are sparse, irregular, and often corrupted by multipath noise, yielding weak and unstable geometry. We present HyperDet, a detector-agnostic radar-only 3D detection framework that constructs a task-aware hyper 4D radar point cloud for standard LiDAR-oriented detectors. HyperDet aggregates returns from multiple surround-view 4D radars over consecutive frames to improve coverage and density, then applies geometry-aware cross-sensor consensus validation with a lightweight self-consistency check outside overlap regions to suppress inconsistent returns. It further integrates a foreground-focused diffusion module with training-time mixed radar-LiDAR supervision to densify object structures while lifting radar attributes (e.g., Doppler, RCS); the model is distilled into a consistency model for single-step inference. On MAN TruckScenes, HyperDet consistently improves over raw radar inputs with VoxelNeXt and CenterPoint, partially narrowing the radar-LiDAR gap. These results show that input-level refinement enables radar to better leverage LiDAR-oriented detectors without architectural modifications.

TL;DR: ReaDy-Go is a real-to-sim pipeline that generates photorealistic dynamic navigation datasets by combining static 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes with dynamic human avatars, enabling training of robust navigation policies for real-world dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual navigation models struggle in real-world dynamic environments due to sim-to-real gaps and difficulty training policies for specific deployment environments. Existing real-to-sim approaches assume static scenes or unrealistic dynamic obstacles, despite the importance of safe navigation in dynamic settings.

Method: Three-component pipeline: (1) Dynamic GS simulator integrating scene GS with human animation module to insert animatable human avatars and synthesize plausible motions from 2D trajectories, (2) Navigation dataset generation using the simulator with robot expert planner and human planner for dynamic GS representations, (3) Policy learning using generated datasets.

Result: Outperforms baselines across target environments in both simulation and real-world experiments, showing improved navigation performance after sim-to-real transfer and in presence of moving obstacles. Zero-shot sim-to-real deployment in unseen environment demonstrates generalization potential.

Conclusion: ReaDy-Go successfully addresses limitations of existing navigation approaches by generating photorealistic dynamic scenarios for target environments, enabling training of policies robust to both sim-to-real gaps and moving obstacles, with demonstrated effectiveness in real-world deployment.

Abstract: Visual navigation models often struggle in real-world dynamic environments due to limited robustness to the sim-to-real gap and the difficulty of training policies tailored to target deployment environments (e.g., households, restaurants, and factories). Although real-to-sim navigation simulation using 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) can mitigate this gap, prior works have assumed only static scenes or unrealistic dynamic obstacles, despite the importance of safe navigation in dynamic environments. To address these issues, we propose ReaDy-Go, a novel real-to-sim simulation pipeline that synthesizes photorealistic dynamic scenarios for target environments. ReaDy-Go generates photorealistic navigation datasets for dynamic environments by combining a reconstructed static GS scene with dynamic human GS obstacles, and trains policies robust to both the sim-to-real gap and moving obstacles. The pipeline consists of three components: (1) a dynamic GS simulator that integrates scene GS with a human animation module, enabling the insertion of animatable human GS avatars and the synthesis of plausible human motions from 2D trajectories, (2) navigation dataset generation for dynamic environments that leverages the simulator, a robot expert planner designed for dynamic GS representations, and a human planner, and (3) policy learning using the generated datasets. ReaDy-Go outperforms baselines across target environments in both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating improved navigation performance even after sim-to-real transfer and in the presence of moving obstacles. Moreover, zero-shot sim-to-real deployment in an unseen environment indicates its generalization potential. Project page: https://syeon-yoo.github.io/ready-go-site/.

Motivation: Embodied navigation has been fragmented by task-specific architectures, creating a need for a unified foundation model that can handle multiple navigation tasks with a single architecture.

Method: Uses hierarchical "Brain-Action" architecture with LLM-based Cognitive Brain for semantic reasoning and Flow Matching-based Action Expert for continuous trajectory generation. Trained on 16.9M expert trajectories and 5.0M reasoning samples across 7,802 high-fidelity 3D scenes via the ABot-N0 Data Engine.

Conclusion: ABot-N0 successfully demonstrates "Grand Unification" of embodied navigation tasks, showing that a single foundation model can outperform specialized architectures across multiple benchmarks while enabling complex real-world navigation.

Abstract: Embodied navigation has long been fragmented by task-specific architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visuo-tactile approaches focus on simple feature alignment and direct concatenation, struggling with occluded scenarios by neglecting modality complementarity and underutilizing alignment, limiting real-world deployment potential.

Method: ViTaS framework incorporates Soft Fusion Contrastive Learning (advanced contrastive learning) and CVAE modules to effectively utilize both alignment and complementarity within visuo-tactile representations.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness in 12 simulated and 3 real-world environments, significantly outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: ViTaS provides a simple yet effective framework for visuo-tactile robotic manipulation that better handles occluded scenarios through improved modality fusion.

Abstract: Tactile information plays a crucial role in human manipulation tasks and has recently garnered increasing attention in robotic manipulation. However, existing approaches mostly focus on the alignment of visual and tactile features and the integration mechanism tends to be direct concatenation. Consequently, they struggle to effectively cope with occluded scenarios due to neglecting the inherent complementary nature of both modalities and the alignment may not be exploited enough, limiting the potential of their real-world deployment. In this paper, we present ViTaS, a simple yet effective framework that incorporates both visual and tactile information to guide the behavior of an agent. We introduce Soft Fusion Contrastive Learning, an advanced version of conventional contrastive learning method and a CVAE module to utilize the alignment and complementarity within visuo-tactile representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in 12 simulated and 3 real-world environments, and our experiments show that ViTaS significantly outperforms existing baselines.

*Faezeh Vahedi,Morteza Memari,Ramtin Tabatabaei,Alireza Taheri*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper develops neural network models (LSTM and Transformer) to predict human gaze behavior in social situations, including responses to non-human stimuli, and deploys the system on a NAO robot with high user satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social robots need to adapt their gaze behavior to human activities and respond to all cues (human and non-human) for effective communication, but current research lacks investigation of gaze responses to non-human stimuli.

Method: Collected gaze data from 41 participants using VR glasses in simulated scenarios (3D animation and 360° real-world video), preprocessed data, and trained LSTM and Transformer neural networks to predict gaze patterns.

Result: LSTM achieved 67.6% (animation) and 72% (real-world) accuracy; Transformer achieved 70.4% (animation) and 71.6% (real-world) accuracy. System deployed on NAO robot and evaluated by 275 participants with high satisfaction.

Conclusion: The work advances social robotics by enabling robots to dynamically mimic human gaze behavior in complex social contexts, outperforming existing approaches while uniquely considering non-human stimuli.

Abstract: Nonverbal behaviors, particularly gaze direction, play a crucial role in enhancing effective communication in social interactions. As social robots increasingly participate in these interactions, they must adapt their gaze based on human activities and remain receptive to all cues, whether human-generated or not, to ensure seamless and effective communication. This study aims to increase the similarity between robot and human gaze behavior across various social situations, including both human and non-human stimuli (e.g., conversations, pointing, door openings, and object drops). A key innovation in this study, is the investigation of gaze responses to non-human stimuli, a critical yet underexplored area in prior research. These scenarios, were simulated in the Unity software as a 3D animation and a 360-degree real-world video. Data on gaze directions from 41 participants were collected via virtual reality (VR) glasses. Preprocessed data, trained two neural networks-LSTM and Transformer-to build predictive models based on individuals' gaze patterns. In the animated scenario, the LSTM and Transformer models achieved prediction accuracies of 67.6% and 70.4%, respectively; In the real-world scenario, the LSTM and Transformer models achieved accuracies of 72% and 71.6%, respectively. Despite the gaze pattern differences among individuals, our models outperform existing approaches in accuracy while uniquely considering non-human stimuli, offering a significant advantage over previous literature. Furthermore, deployed on the NAO robot, the system was evaluated by 275 participants via a comprehensive questionnaire, with results demonstrating high satisfaction during interactions. This work advances social robotics by enabling robots to dynamically mimic human gaze behavior in complex social contexts.

Conclusion: AC-MASAC effectively addresses key challenges in heterogeneous UAV swarm path planning through attention mechanisms and curriculum learning, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Cooperative path planning for heterogeneous UAV swarms poses significant challenges for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), particularly in handling asymmetric inter-agent dependencies and addressing the risks of sparse rewards and catastrophic forgetting during training. To address these issues, this paper proposes an attentive curriculum learning framework (AC-MASAC). The framework introduces a role-aware heterogeneous attention mechanism to explicitly model asymmetric dependencies. Moreover, a structured curriculum strategy is designed, integrating hierarchical knowledge transfer and stage-proportional experience replay to address the issues of sparse rewards and catastrophic forgetting. The proposed framework is validated on a custom multi-agent simulation platform, and the results show that our method has significant advantages over other advanced methods in terms of Success Rate, Formation Keeping Rate, and Success-weighted Mission Time.

TL;DR: HAIC is a unified framework for humanoid robots to robustly interact with diverse underactuated objects using only proprioceptive sensing, without external state estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human-object interaction methods focus on fully actuated objects rigidly coupled to robots, ignoring underactuated objects with independent dynamics and non-holonomic constraints that introduce control challenges from coupling forces and occlusions.

Method: HAIC uses a dynamics predictor that estimates high-order object states (velocity, acceleration) solely from proprioceptive history, projects predictions onto static geometric priors to form a spatially grounded dynamic occupancy map, and employs asymmetric fine-tuning where a world model continuously adapts to the student policy's exploration.

Result: Experiments on a humanoid robot show HAIC achieves high success rates in agile tasks (skateboarding, cart pushing/pulling under various loads) by proactively compensating for inertial perturbations, and masters multi-object long-horizon tasks like carrying a box across varied terrain.

Conclusion: HAIC provides a unified framework for robust humanoid interaction with diverse object dynamics without external state estimation, enabling successful completion of complex tasks involving underactuated objects and dynamic environments.

Abstract: Humanoid robots show promise for complex whole-body tasks in unstructured environments. Although Human-Object Interaction (HOI) has advanced, most methods focus on fully actuated objects rigidly coupled to the robot, ignoring underactuated objects with independent dynamics and non-holonomic constraints. These introduce control challenges from coupling forces and occlusions. We present HAIC, a unified framework for robust interaction across diverse object dynamics without external state estimation. Our key contribution is a dynamics predictor that estimates high-order object states (velocity, acceleration) solely from proprioceptive history. These predictions are projected onto static geometric priors to form a spatially grounded dynamic occupancy map, enabling the policy to infer collision boundaries and contact affordances in blind spots. We use asymmetric fine-tuning, where a world model continuously adapts to the student policy's exploration, ensuring robust state estimation under distribution shifts. Experiments on a humanoid robot show HAIC achieves high success rates in agile tasks (skateboarding, cart pushing/pulling under various loads) by proactively compensating for inertial perturbations, and also masters multi-object long-horizon tasks like carrying a box across varied terrain by predicting the dynamics of multiple objects.

TL;DR: LAMP introduces a neural language field-based navigation framework that learns continuous language-driven maps for efficient fine-grained path planning, outperforming explicit methods in memory efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot navigation methods that explicitly store language vectors in grid/node-based maps struggle with scalability in large environments due to excessive memory requirements and limited resolution for fine-grained planning.

Method: LAMP encodes language features as an implicit neural field combined with a sparse graph, enabling coarse path planning followed by gradient-based optimization in the learned field for pose refinement near goals. It uses Bayesian modeling for embedding uncertainty and graph sampling for scalability.

Result: Experimental results in NVIDIA Isaac Sim and real multi-floor buildings show LAMP outperforms existing explicit methods in both memory efficiency and fine-grained goal-reaching accuracy.

Conclusion: LAMP demonstrates that implicit neural language fields combined with sparse graphs provide an effective solution for scalable, memory-efficient zero-shot navigation with precise path generation capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have made zero-shot navigation feasible, enabling robots to follow natural language instructions without requiring labeling. However, existing methods that explicitly store language vectors in grid or node-based maps struggle to scale to large environments due to excessive memory requirements and limited resolution for fine-grained planning. We introduce LAMP (Language Map), a novel neural language field-based navigation framework that learns a continuous, language-driven map and directly leverages it for fine-grained path generation. Unlike prior approaches, our method encodes language features as an implicit neural field rather than storing them explicitly at every location. By combining this implicit representation with a sparse graph, LAMP supports efficient coarse path planning and then performs gradient-based optimization in the learned field to refine poses near the goal. This coarse-to-fine pipeline, language-driven, gradient-guided optimization is the first application of an implicit language map for precise path generation. This refinement is particularly effective at selecting goal regions not directly observed by leveraging semantic similarities in the learned feature space. To further enhance robustness, we adopt a Bayesian framework that models embedding uncertainty via the von Mises-Fisher distribution, thereby improving generalization to unobserved regions. To scale to large environments, LAMP employs a graph sampling strategy that prioritizes spatial coverage and embedding confidence, retaining only the most informative nodes and substantially reducing computational overhead. Our experimental results, both in NVIDIA Isaac Sim and on a real multi-floor building, demonstrate that LAMP outperforms existing explicit methods in both memory efficiency and fine-grained goal-reaching accuracy.

TL;DR: Proposes bounding-box instructions and data scaling laws for improving diffusion policy generalization in semantic manipulation tasks, achieving 85% success rates across seen and unseen objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based policies have limited generalization in semantic manipulation due to inadequate text instructions for directing attention to target objects in complex environments.

Method: Uses bounding-box instructions to specify target objects, develops Label-UMI handheld segmentation device with automated annotation pipeline, and proposes semantic-motion-decoupled framework integrating object detection with bounding-box guided diffusion policy.

Result: Validated effectiveness through extensive real-world experiments, revealed power-law relationship between generalization performance and number of bounding-box objects, achieved 85% success rates across four tasks on both seen and unseen objects.

Conclusion: Bounding-box instructions and data scaling laws significantly improve diffusion policy generalization in semantic manipulation, with effective data collection strategies enabling high success rates across diverse objects.

Abstract: Diffusion-based policies show limited generalization in semantic manipulation, posing a key obstacle to the deployment of real-world robots. This limitation arises because relying solely on text instructions is inadequate to direct the policy's attention toward the target object in complex and dynamic environments. To solve this problem, we propose leveraging bounding-box instruction to directly specify target object, and further investigate whether data scaling laws exist in semantic manipulation tasks. Specifically, we design a handheld segmentation device with an automated annotation pipeline, Label-UMI, which enables the efficient collection of demonstration data with semantic labels. We further propose a semantic-motion-decoupled framework that integrates object detection and bounding-box guided diffusion policy to improve generalization and adaptability in semantic manipulation. Throughout extensive real-world experiments on large-scale datasets, we validate the effectiveness of the approach, and reveal a power-law relationship between generalization performance and the number of bounding-box objects. Finally, we summarize an effective data collection strategy for semantic manipulation, which can achieve 85\% success rates across four tasks on both seen and unseen objects. All datasets and code will be released to the community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing humanoid robot controllers struggle with adapting to diverse motion distributions, require task-specific training, and suffer from performance degradation when facing new motions, especially in high-dynamic scenarios requiring robust balance.

Method: FAST introduces two key components: 1) Parseval-Guided Residual Policy Adaptation - learns lightweight delta action policies with orthogonality and KL constraints for efficient adaptation while preventing catastrophic forgetting, and 2) Center-of-Mass-Aware Control - incorporates CoM-related observations and objectives to enhance balance during challenging motion tracking.

Result: Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world deployment show that FAST consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in robustness, adaptation efficiency, and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: FAST provides an effective framework for general humanoid whole-body control that enables fast adaptation to out-of-distribution motions while maintaining stable motion tracking and robust balance.

Abstract: Learning a general whole-body controller for humanoid robots remains challenging due to the diversity of motion distributions, the difficulty of fast adaptation, and the need for robust balance in high-dynamic scenarios. Existing approaches often require task-specific training or suffer from performance degradation when adapting to new motions. In this paper, we present FAST, a general humanoid whole-body control framework that enables Fast Adaptation and Stable Motion Tracking. FAST introduces Parseval-Guided Residual Policy Adaptation, which learns a lightweight delta action policy under orthogonality and KL constraints, enabling efficient adaptation to out-of-distribution motions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To further improve physical robustness, we propose Center-of-Mass-Aware Control, which incorporates CoM-related observations and objectives to enhance balance when tracking challenging reference motions. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world deployment demonstrate that FAST consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in robustness, adaptation efficiency, and generalization.

*Yu Deng,Yufeng Jin,Xiaogang Jia,Jiahong Xue,Gerhard Neumann,Georgia Chalvatzaki*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Robot-DIFT distills geometric priors from diffusion models into deterministic vision backbones for better robot manipulation, addressing the mismatch between semantic-invariant vision encoders and geometric-sensitive control needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision backbones for robot manipulation have a structural mismatch: they optimize for semantic invariance (good for classification) but manipulation requires geometric sensitivity to detect millimeter-level pose changes. Diffusion models inherently encode geometric dependencies, but their stochastic nature makes them unsuitable for real-time control.

Method: Propose Robot-DIFT framework using Manifold Distillation to decouple geometric information from inference. Distill a frozen diffusion teacher model into a deterministic Spatial-Semantic Feature Pyramid Network (S2-FPN), retaining rich geometric priors while ensuring temporal stability and real-time execution.

Result: Pretrained on DROID dataset, Robot-DIFT demonstrates superior geometric consistency and control performance compared to leading discriminative baselines, showing that how a model learns to see affects how well it can learn to act.

Conclusion: The key bottleneck in generalizable robot manipulation is not just data scale or policy capacity, but the structural mismatch between vision backbones and physical control requirements. Robot-DIFT successfully bridges this gap by distilling geometric priors from diffusion models into stable, real-time vision encoders.

Abstract: We hypothesize that a key bottleneck in generalizable robot manipulation is not solely data scale or policy capacity, but a structural mismatch between current visual backbones and the physical requirements of closed-loop control. While state-of-the-art vision encoders (including those used in VLAs) optimize for semantic invariance to stabilize classification, manipulation typically demands geometric sensitivity the ability to map millimeter-level pose shifts to predictable feature changes. Their discriminative objective creates a "blind spot" for fine-grained control, whereas generative diffusion models inherently encode geometric dependencies within their latent manifolds, encouraging the preservation of dense multi-scale spatial structure. However, directly deploying stochastic diffusion features for control is hindered by stochastic instability, inference latency, and representation drift during fine-tuning. To bridge this gap, we propose Robot-DIFT, a framework that decouples the source of geometric information from the process of inference via Manifold Distillation. By distilling a frozen diffusion teacher into a deterministic Spatial-Semantic Feature Pyramid Network (S2-FPN), we retain the rich geometric priors of the generative model while ensuring temporal stability, real-time execution, and robustness against drift. Pretrained on the large-scale DROID dataset, Robot-DIFT demonstrates superior geometric consistency and control performance compared to leading discriminative baselines, supporting the view that how a model learns to see dictates how well it can learn to act.

TL;DR: AGPS replaces human supervisors with a multimodal agent to automate RL training for robot manipulation, improving sample efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Human-in-the-Loop RL methods for robot manipulation face scalability issues due to 1:1 supervision ratio, operator fatigue, and inconsistent human proficiency, limiting real-world deployment.

Method: AGPS uses a multimodal agent as a semantic world model to provide intrinsic value priors, guiding exploration through corrective waypoints and spatial constraints via executable tools, replacing human supervisors.

Result: AGPS outperforms Human-in-the-Loop methods in sample efficiency on precision insertion and deformable object manipulation tasks, demonstrating automated supervision pipeline.

Conclusion: AGPS enables labor-free and scalable robot learning by automating the supervision pipeline with multimodal agents, overcoming human supervision limitations in RL training.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a powerful paradigm for autonomous robots to master generalist manipulation skills through trial-and-error. However, its real-world application is stifled by severe sample inefficiency. Recent Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) methods accelerate training by using human corrections, yet this approach faces a scalability barrier. Reliance on human supervisors imposes a 1:1 supervision ratio that limits fleet expansion, suffers from operator fatigue over extended sessions, and introduces high variance due to inconsistent human proficiency. We present Agent-guided Policy Search (AGPS), a framework that automates the training pipeline by replacing human supervisors with a multimodal agent. Our key insight is that the agent can be viewed as a semantic world model, injecting intrinsic value priors to structure physical exploration. By using executable tools, the agent provides precise guidance via corrective waypoints and spatial constraints for exploration pruning. We validate our approach on two tasks, ranging from precision insertion to deformable object manipulation. Results demonstrate that AGPS outperforms HIL methods in sample efficiency. This automates the supervision pipeline, unlocking the path to labor-free and scalable robot learning. Project website: https://agps-rl.github.io/agps.

Conclusion: The framework enables effective decentralized multi-robot maritime monitoring with robust perception and coordination under communication constraints.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial-surface robot teams are promising for maritime monitoring. Robust deployment requires reliable perception over reflective water and scalable coordination under limited communication. We present a decentralized multi-robot framework for detecting and tracking floating containers using multiple UAVs cooperating with an autonomous surface vessel. Each UAV performs YOLOv8 and stereo-disparity-based visual detection, then tracks targets with per-object EKFs using uncertainty-aware data association. Compact track summaries are exchanged and fused conservatively via covariance intersection, ensuring consistency under unknown correlations. An information-driven assignment module allocates targets and selects UAV hover viewpoints by trading expected uncertainty reduction against travel effort and safety separation. Simulation results in a maritime scenario demonstrate improved coverage, localization accuracy, and tracking consistency while maintaining modest communication requirements.

Conclusion: ACCBS effectively bridges the gap between theoretical optimality and practical robustness for large-scale robot deployment in automated warehouses and logistics.

Abstract: MAPF is a core coordination problem for large robot fleets in automated warehouses and logistics. Existing approaches are typically either open-loop planners, which generate fixed trajectories and struggle to handle disturbances, or closed-loop heuristics without reliable performance guarantees, limiting their use in safety-critical deployments. This paper presents ACCBS, a closed-loop algorithm built on a finite-horizon variant of CBS with a horizon-changing mechanism inspired by iterative deepening in MPC. ACCBS dynamically adjusts the planning horizon based on the available computational budget, and reuses a single constraint tree to enable seamless transitions between horizons. As a result, it produces high-quality feasible solutions quickly while being asymptotically optimal as the budget increases, exhibiting anytime behavior.

TL;DR: Vision-proprioception policies struggle during motion transitions due to proprioception dominating training; GAP algorithm modulates proprioception gradients to enable better vision-proprioception collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-proprioception policies are expected to enhance robotic manipulation, but show inconsistent generalization. The authors investigate why these policies fail during motion-transition phases where target localization is needed.

Method: Proposed Gradient Adjustment with Phase-guidance (GAP) algorithm that uses proprioception to estimate probability of motion-transition phases, then adaptively reduces proprioception gradient magnitude during policy learning to enable better vision learning.

Result: GAP demonstrates applicability across simulated and real-world environments, one-arm and dual-arm setups, and compatibility with both conventional and Vision-Language-Action models, producing robust and generalizable policies.

Conclusion: The work provides insights into developing effective vision-proprioception policies by addressing proprioception's dominance during training, enabling dynamic collaboration between modalities for better robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Proprioceptive information is critical for precise servo control by providing real-time robotic states. Its collaboration with vision is highly expected to enhance performances of the manipulation policy in complex tasks. However, recent studies have reported inconsistent observations on the generalization of vision-proprioception policies. In this work, we investigate this by conducting temporally controlled experiments. We found that during task sub-phases that robot's motion transitions, which require target localization, the vision modality of the vision-proprioception policy plays a limited role. Further analysis reveals that the policy naturally gravitates toward concise proprioceptive signals that offer faster loss reduction when training, thereby dominating the optimization and suppressing the learning of the visual modality during motion-transition phases. To alleviate this, we propose the Gradient Adjustment with Phase-guidance (GAP) algorithm that adaptively modulates the optimization of proprioception, enabling dynamic collaboration within the vision-proprioception policy. Specifically, we leverage proprioception to capture robotic states and estimate the probability of each timestep in the trajectory belonging to motion-transition phases. During policy learning, we apply fine-grained adjustment that reduces the magnitude of proprioception's gradient based on estimated probabilities, leading to robust and generalizable vision-proprioception policies. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate GAP is applicable in both simulated and real-world environments, across one-arm and dual-arm setups, and compatible with both conventional and Vision-Language-Action models. We believe this work can offer valuable insights into the development of vision-proprioception policies in robotic manipulation.

Result: Provides theoretical guarantees on coverage and robustness under distributional drift, with empirical demonstrations on 4D car and 12D quadcopter showing improved safety and robustness compared to baselines, especially outside data distribution.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables robust out-of-distribution planning with safety guarantees by combining conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification with system level synthesis for robust control synthesis.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for robust out-of-distribution planning and control using conformal prediction (CP) and system level synthesis (SLS), addressing the challenge of ensuring safety and robustness when using learned dynamics models beyond the training data distribution. We first derive high-confidence model error bounds using weighted CP with a learned, state-control-dependent covariance model. These bounds are integrated into an SLS-based robust nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) formulation, which performs constraint tightening over the prediction horizon via volume-optimized forward reachable sets. We provide theoretical guarantees on coverage and robustness under distributional drift, and analyze the impact of data density and trajectory tube size on prediction coverage. Empirically, we demonstrate our method on nonlinear systems of increasing complexity, including a 4D car and a {12D} quadcopter, improving safety and robustness compared to fixed-bound and non-robust baselines, especially outside of the data distribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world policy rollouts are expensive to collect, and existing world models lack the physical fidelity needed for policy improvement, especially for contact-rich manipulation tasks.

Method: Proposes an iterative improvement algorithm that uses real-world rollout data to enhance world model fidelity, then uses the improved world model to generate synthetic data for VLA model training.

Result: Achieves 39.2% absolute success rate improvement over base policy and 11.6% improvement from training with generated synthetic rollouts on real robot tasks.

Conclusion: Iterative refinement of world models with real data enables effective synthetic data generation for VLA model improvement, significantly boosting performance on real-world manipulation tasks.

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to improve the performance and reliability of vision-language-action (VLA) models through iterative online interaction. Since collecting policy rollouts in the real world is expensive, we investigate whether a learned simulator-specifically, an action-conditioned video generation model-can be used to generate additional rollout data. Unfortunately, existing world models lack the physical fidelity necessary for policy improvement: they are predominantly trained on demonstration datasets that lack coverage of many different physical interactions (particularly failure cases) and struggle to accurately model small yet critical physical details in contact-rich object manipulation. We propose a simple iterative improvement algorithm that uses real-world roll-out data to improve the fidelity of the world model, which can then, in turn, be used to generate supplemental synthetic data for improving the VLA model. In our experiments on a real robot, we use this approach to improve the performance of a state-of-the-art VLA model on multiple downstream tasks. We achieve a 39.2% absolute success rate improvement over the base policy and 11.6% improvement from training with the generated synthetic rollouts.

Method: AGT-World formalizes task space as a structured affordance graph for hierarchical decomposition of complex goals into atomic primitives, and introduces a Self-Evolution mechanism with hybrid feedback combining Vision-Language Model reasoning and geometric verification for autonomous policy refinement.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method significantly outperforms in success rates and generalization, achieving a self-improving cycle of proposal, execution, and correction for scalable robot learning.

Conclusion: AGT-World provides a unified framework for autonomous construction of interactive simulated environments and robot policies, enabling scalable robot learning through structured task decomposition and self-evolution with hybrid feedback.

Abstract: Training robotic policies directly in the real world is expensive and unscalable. Although generative simulation enables large-scale data synthesis, current approaches often fail to generate logically coherent long-horizon tasks and struggle with dynamic physical uncertainties due to open-loop execution. To address these challenges, we propose Affordance-Graphed Task Worlds (AGT-World), a unified framework that autonomously constructs interactive simulated environments and corresponding robot task policies based on real-world observations. Unlike methods relying on random proposals or static replication, AGT-World formalizes the task space as a structured graph, enabling the precise, hierarchical decomposition of complex goals into theoretically grounded atomic primitives. Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Evolution mechanism with hybrid feedback to autonomously refine policies, combining Vision-Language Model reasoning and geometric verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms in success rates and generalization, achieving a self-improving cycle of proposal, execution, and correction for scalable robot learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent robotic exploration in communication-limited environments faces challenges with reliable coordination and efficient communication between heterogeneous robot teams.

Method: Adaptive-RF Transmission (ART) dynamically modulates transmission location based on signal strength and data payload size, with an extension called ART-SST that enforces signal strength thresholds for high-fidelity data delivery.

Conclusion: Adaptive, payload-aware communication significantly improves coverage efficiency and mission speed in complex, communication-constrained environments, offering promise for planetary exploration and search-and-rescue missions.

Abstract: Reliable coordination and efficient communication are critical challenges for multi-agent robotic exploration of environments where communication is limited. This work introduces Adaptive-RF Transmission (ART), a novel communication-aware planning algorithm that dynamically modulates transmission location based on signal strength and data payload size, enabling heterogeneous robot teams to share information efficiently without unnecessary backtracking. We further explore an extension to this approach called ART-SST, which enforces signal strength thresholds for high-fidelity data delivery. Through over 480 simulations across three cave-inspired environments, ART consistently outperforms existing strategies, including full rendezvous and minimum-signal heuristic approaches, achieving up to a 58% reduction in distance traveled and up to 52% faster exploration times compared to baseline methods. These results demonstrate that adaptive, payload-aware communication significantly improves coverage efficiency and mission speed in complex, communication-constrained environments, offering a promising foundation for future planetary exploration and search-and-rescue missions.

*David Russell,Zisong Xu,Maximo A. Roa,Mehmet Dogar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Contact-aware bin-packing approach that uses purposeful interactions with existing items to create space for new placements in partially-filled containers


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Warehouse automation needs to handle real-world scenarios where containers are partially filled with suboptimal arrangements, requiring more than just collision-free strategies for empty containers

Method: Contact-based multi-object trajectory optimizer within model predictive controller, integrated with physics-aware perception system for occlusion handling, and physically-feasible placement suggestion method

Result: Enables successful placement of new items in partially-filled containers by exploiting purposeful interactions with existing objects to create space

Conclusion: Proposed contact-aware approach addresses practical warehouse bin-packing challenges by allowing manipulation of existing items rather than requiring empty containers or collision avoidance only

Abstract: The automation of warehouse operations is crucial for improving productivity and reducing human exposure to hazardous environments. One operation frequently performed in warehouses is bin-packing where items need to be placed into containers, either for delivery to a customer, or for temporary storage in the warehouse. Whilst prior bin-packing works have largely been focused on packing items into empty containers and have adopted collision-free strategies, it is often the case that containers will already be partially filled with items, often in suboptimal arrangements due to transportation about a warehouse. This paper presents a contact-aware packing approach that exploits purposeful interactions with previously placed objects to create free space and enable successful placement of new items. This is achieved by using a contact-based multi-object trajectory optimizer within a model predictive controller, integrated with a physics-aware perception system that estimates object poses even during inevitable occlusions, and a method that suggests physically-feasible locations to place the object inside the container.

TL;DR: Multi-Graph Search (MGS) is a search-based motion planning algorithm that generalizes classical search to multiple graphs, enabling efficient high-dimensional planning with predictable motions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing high-dimensional motion planning algorithms often produce unpredictable motions or require excessive computational resources, limiting real-time deployment for robotic systems like manipulators and mobile manipulators.

Method: MGS maintains and incrementally expands multiple implicit graphs over the state space, focusing exploration on high-potential regions while allowing disconnected subgraphs to merge through feasible transitions during search.

Result: The algorithm is proven complete and bounded-suboptimal, and empirical demonstrations show effectiveness on manipulation and mobile manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: MGS provides an efficient motion planning solution for high-dimensional robotic systems that balances computational efficiency with motion predictability.

Abstract: Efficient motion planning for high-dimensional robotic systems, such as manipulators and mobile manipulators, is critical for real-time operation and reliable deployment. Although advances in planning algorithms have enhanced scalability to high-dimensional state spaces, these improvements often come at the cost of generating unpredictable, inconsistent motions or requiring excessive computational resources and memory. In this work, we introduce Multi-Graph Search (MGS), a search-based motion planning algorithm that generalizes classical unidirectional and bidirectional search to a multi-graph setting. MGS maintains and incrementally expands multiple implicit graphs over the state space, focusing exploration on high-potential regions while allowing initially disconnected subgraphs to be merged through feasible transitions as the search progresses. We prove that MGS is complete and bounded-suboptimal, and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of manipulation and mobile manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 3DGSNav is a zero-shot object navigation framework that uses 3D Gaussian Splatting as persistent memory for VLMs to enhance spatial reasoning, achieving robust performance across benchmarks and real-world robot experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot object navigation methods rely on scene abstractions (semantic maps or textual representations) that constrain high-level decision making by low-level perception accuracy, limiting spatial reasoning capabilities.

Method: Incrementally constructs 3DGS representation of environment through active perception, enables trajectory-guided free-viewpoint rendering of frontier-aware first-person views, uses structured visual prompts with Chain-of-Thought prompting, and implements real-time object detection with VLM-driven active viewpoint switching for target re-verification.

Result: Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks and real-world experiments on a quadruped robot demonstrate robust and competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: 3DGSNav effectively enhances spatial reasoning for zero-shot object navigation by leveraging 3DGS as persistent memory for VLMs, overcoming limitations of traditional scene abstraction methods and enabling more reliable navigation performance.

Abstract: Object navigation is a core capability of embodied intelligence, enabling an agent to locate target objects in unknown environments. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have facilitated zero-shot object navigation (ZSON). However, existing methods often rely on scene abstractions that convert environments into semantic maps or textual representations, causing high-level decision making to be constrained by the accuracy of low-level perception. In this work, we present 3DGSNav, a novel ZSON framework that embeds 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as persistent memory for VLMs to enhance spatial reasoning. Through active perception, 3DGSNav incrementally constructs a 3DGS representation of the environment, enabling trajectory-guided free-viewpoint rendering of frontier-aware first-person views. Moreover, we design structured visual prompts and integrate them with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to further improve VLM reasoning. During navigation, a real-time object detector filters potential targets, while VLM-driven active viewpoint switching performs target re-verification, ensuring efficient and reliable recognition. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks and real-world experiments on a quadruped robot demonstrate that our method achieves robust and competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches.The Project Page:https://aczheng-cai.github.io/3dgsnav.github.io/

*Oliver Gross,Florine Hartwig,Martin Rumpf,Peter Schröder*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Geometric model for optimal shape-change locomotion using sub-Riemannian geodesics to compute energy-efficient motions for slender bodies like snakes and spermatozoa.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a comprehensive geometric framework that captures both environmental drag dissipation and internal metabolic/actuator energy costs for shape-changing locomotors, enabling analysis of overall locomotion efficiency beyond existing models.

Method: Formulate Lagrangian least-dissipation principles as boundary value problems solved by sub-Riemannian geodesics, with continuous model and consistent discretization for numerical computation of optimal deformation gaits under various boundary conditions.

Result: The model produces optimal deformation gaits that qualitatively match observed biological motions (snakes, spermatozoa) and known optimality results (Purcell's swimmers), while enabling new insights into locomotion mechanisms of generalized systems.

Conclusion: The geometric sub-Riemannian framework provides a flexible and comprehensive approach to modeling optimal shape-change locomotion, capturing both external and internal energy dissipation, with applications to biological and robotic systems.

Abstract: We propose a geometric model for optimal shape-change-induced motions of slender locomotors, e.g., snakes slithering on sand. In these scenarios, the motion of a body in world coordinates is completely determined by the sequence of shapes it assumes. Specifically, we formulate Lagrangian least-dissipation principles as boundary value problems whose solutions are given by sub-Riemannian geodesics. Notably, our geometric model accounts not only for the energy dissipated by the body's displacement through the environment, but also for the energy dissipated by the animal's metabolism or a robot's actuators to induce shape changes such as bending and stretching, thus capturing overall locomotion efficiency. Our continuous model, together with a consistent time and space discretization, enables numerical computation of sub-Riemannian geodesics for three different types of boundary conditions, i.e., fixing initial and target body, restricting to cyclic motion, or solely prescribing body displacement and orientation. The resulting optimal deformation gaits qualitatively match observed motion trajectories of organisms such as snakes and spermatozoa, as well as known optimality results for low-dimensional systems such as Purcell's swimmers. Moreover, being geometrically less rigid than previous frameworks, our model enables new insights into locomotion mechanisms of, e.g., generalized Purcell's swimmers. The code is publicly available.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LDA-1B is a 1B-parameter robot foundation model that scales by jointly learning dynamics, policy, and visual forecasting from heterogeneous embodied data, outperforming prior methods on various robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robot foundation models rely heavily on behavior cloning which discards valuable dynamics knowledge in heterogeneous embodied data. Existing Unified World Model approaches struggle to scale to foundation-level due to coarse data usage and fragmented datasets.

Method: LDA-1B jointly learns dynamics, policy, and visual forecasting by assigning distinct roles to data of varying quality. It uses prediction in a structured DINO latent space to avoid redundant pixel-space modeling, and employs a multi-modal diffusion transformer to handle asynchronous vision and action streams for stable training at 1B-parameter scale. The model is trained on EI-30k, a standardized 30k-hour embodied interaction dataset.

Result: LDA-1B outperforms prior methods (e.g., π₀.₅) by up to 21% on contact-rich tasks, 48% on dexterous tasks, and 23% on long-horizon tasks. It enables data-efficient fine-tuning, gaining 10% performance by leveraging 30% low-quality trajectories that are typically harmful and discarded.

Conclusion: LDA-1B demonstrates that scalable robot foundation models can be built through universal embodied data ingestion with careful architectural design, enabling effective learning from heterogeneous data and outperforming prior approaches across diverse robotic tasks.

Abstract: Recent robot foundation models largely rely on large-scale behavior cloning, which imitates expert actions but discards transferable dynamics knowledge embedded in heterogeneous embodied data. While the Unified World Model (UWM) formulation has the potential to leverage such diverse data, existing instantiations struggle to scale to foundation-level due to coarse data usage and fragmented datasets. We introduce LDA-1B, a robot foundation model that scales through universal embodied data ingestion by jointly learning dynamics, policy, and visual forecasting, assigning distinct roles to data of varying quality. To support this regime at scale, we assemble and standardize EI-30k, an embodied interaction dataset comprising over 30k hours of human and robot trajectories in a unified format. Scalable dynamics learning over such heterogeneous data is enabled by prediction in a structured DINO latent space, which avoids redundant pixel-space appearance modeling. Complementing this representation, LDA-1B employs a multi-modal diffusion transformer to handle asynchronous vision and action streams, enabling stable training at the 1B-parameter scale. Experiments in simulation and the real world show LDA-1B outperforms prior methods (e.g., $π_{0.5}$) by up to 21\%, 48\%, and 23\% on contact-rich, dexterous, and long-horizon tasks, respectively. Notably, LDA-1B enables data-efficient fine-tuning, gaining 10\% by leveraging 30\% low-quality trajectories typically harmful and discarded.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AHAT is a household task planner that uses LLMs to convert instructions and scene graphs into PDDL subgoals, then performs symbolic reasoning for optimal long-horizon planning, with TGPO reinforcement learning for better intention decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based task planners struggle with scalability as performance degrades with larger environments, longer plans, ambiguous instructions, and complex constraints. There's a need for robust planning in household environments with brief human instructions requiring complex execution.

Method: AHAT trains an LLM to map task instructions and textual scene graphs into grounded PDDL subgoals, then uses explicit symbolic reasoning to generate optimal plans. Introduces TGPO (reinforcement learning algorithm) that integrates external correction of reasoning traces into GRPO to improve complex intention decomposition.

Result: AHAT achieves significant performance gains over state-of-the-art prompting, planning, and learning methods, especially in human-style household tasks with brief instructions requiring complex execution plans.

Conclusion: AHAT provides an effective solution for scalable, long-horizon task planning in large household environments by combining LLMs with symbolic reasoning and reinforcement learning for handling ambiguous instructions.

Abstract: Open world language conditioned task planning is crucial for robots operating in large-scale household environments. While many recent works attempt to address this problem using Large Language Models (LLMs) via prompting or training, a key challenge remains scalability. Performance often degrades rapidly with increasing environment size, plan length, instruction ambiguity, and constraint complexity. In this work, we propose Any House Any Task (AHAT), a household task planner optimized for long-horizon planning in large environments given ambiguous human instructions. At its core, AHAT utilizes an LLM trained to map task instructions and textual scene graphs into grounded subgoals defined in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). These subgoals are subsequently solved to generate feasible and optimal long-horizon plans through explicit symbolic reasoning. To enhance the model's ability to decompose complex and ambiguous intentions, we introduce TGPO, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that integrates external correction of intermediate reasoning traces into Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments demonstrate that AHAT achieves significant performance gains over state-of-the-art prompting, planning, and learning methods, particularly in human-style household tasks characterized by brief instructions but requiring complex execution plans.

TL;DR: CoVer introduces test-time verification with contrastive verification and hierarchical inference to reduce intention-action gap in VLA models, achieving significant performance gains through boot-time compute and scaling laws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often misalign generated actions with natural language instructions, creating an "intention-action gap" that hinders general-purpose robot capabilities.

Method: Proposes CoVer - contrastive verifier for VLA alignment, uses test-time scaling laws with joint scaling of rephrased instructions and generated actions, introduces boot-time compute and hierarchical verification inference pipeline.

Result: 22% gains in-distribution and 13% out-of-distribution on SIMPLER benchmark, 45% improvement in real-world experiments, 14% gains in task progress and 9% in success rate on PolaRiS benchmark.

Conclusion: Test-time verification with CoVer effectively reduces intention-action gap in VLA models, demonstrating that verification scales better than policy pre-training and enables more reliable embodied instruction following.

Abstract: The long-standing vision of general-purpose robots hinges on their ability to understand and act upon natural language instructions. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made remarkable progress toward this goal, yet their generated actions can still misalign with the given instructions. In this paper, we investigate test-time verification as a means to shrink the "intention-action gap.'' We first characterize the test-time scaling law for embodied instruction following and demonstrate that jointly scaling the number of rephrased instructions and generated actions greatly increases test-time sample diversity, often recovering correct actions more efficiently than scaling each dimension independently. To capitalize on these scaling laws, we present CoVer, a contrastive verifier for vision-language-action alignment, and show that our architecture scales gracefully with additional computational resources and data. We then introduce "boot-time compute" and a hierarchical verification inference pipeline for VLAs. At deployment, our framework precomputes a diverse set of rephrased instructions from a Vision-Language-Model (VLM), repeatedly generates action candidates for each instruction, and then uses a verifier to select the optimal high-level prompt and low-level action chunks. Compared to scaling policy pre-training on the same data, our verification approach yields 22% gains in-distribution and 13% out-of-distribution on the SIMPLER benchmark, with a further 45% improvement in real-world experiments. On the PolaRiS benchmark, CoVer achieves 14% gains in task progress and 9% in success rate.
