*Usman Muhammad,Jorma Laaksonen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes SSUF module and Spatial-Spectral Gradient Loss for hyperspectral image super-resolution, improving spatial detail restoration while preserving spectral fidelity with reduced model complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral SISR is challenging due to difficulty in restoring fine spatial details while preserving spectral fidelity across wavelengths, limiting conventional deep learning models.

Method: Introduces Spectral-Spatial Unmixing Fusion (SSUF) module that combines spectral unmixing with spectral-spatial feature extraction, integrated into ResNet-based CNN. Also proposes custom Spatial-Spectral Gradient Loss combining MSE with spatial and spectral gradient components.

Result: Experiments on three public remote sensing hyperspectral datasets demonstrate competitive performance while reducing model complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid deep learning model with SSUF and custom loss function effectively enhances both spatial resolution and spectral integrity in hyperspectral image super-resolution.

Abstract: Hyperspectral single image super-resolution (SISR) is a challenging task due
to the difficulty of restoring fine spatial details while preserving spectral
fidelity across a wide range of wavelengths, which limits the performance of
conventional deep learning models. To address this challenge, we introduce
Spectral-Spatial Unmixing Fusion (SSUF), a novel module that can be seamlessly
integrated into standard 2D convolutional architectures to enhance both spatial
resolution and spectral integrity. The SSUF combines spectral unmixing with
spectral--spatial feature extraction and guides a ResNet-based convolutional
neural network for improved reconstruction. In addition, we propose a custom
Spatial-Spectral Gradient Loss function that integrates mean squared error with
spatial and spectral gradient components, encouraging accurate reconstruction
of both spatial and spectral features. Experiments on three public remote
sensing hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid deep
learning model achieves competitive performance while reducing model
complexity.

### [2] [Review of Hallucination Understanding in Large Language and Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00034)
*Zhengyi Ho,Siyuan Liang,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a unified framework to characterize hallucinations in large language and vision models, linking them to specific mechanisms in the model lifecycle and revealing that hallucinations stem from predictable data patterns and biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in AI models can propagate misinformation and cause financial/operational harm. Current understanding is fragmented, leading to solutions that address surface symptoms rather than underlying causes.

Method: Developed a unified multi-level framework for characterizing image and text hallucinations across applications, using a task-modality interleaved approach to link hallucinations to specific model lifecycle mechanisms.

Result: Investigations revealed that hallucinations often stem from predictable patterns in data distributions and inherited biases, rather than random errors.

Conclusion: The survey provides a foundation for developing more robust and effective solutions to hallucinations in real-world generative AI systems by promoting deeper understanding of underlying causes.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language and vision models in real-world
applications has made urgent the need to address hallucinations -- instances
where models produce incorrect or nonsensical outputs. These errors can
propagate misinformation during deployment, leading to both financial and
operational harm. Although much research has been devoted to mitigating
hallucinations, our understanding of it is still incomplete and fragmented.
Without a coherent understanding of hallucinations, proposed solutions risk
mitigating surface symptoms rather than underlying causes, limiting their
effectiveness and generalizability in deployment. To tackle this gap, we first
present a unified, multi-level framework for characterizing both image and text
hallucinations across diverse applications, aiming to reduce conceptual
fragmentation. We then link these hallucinations to specific mechanisms within
a model's lifecycle, using a task-modality interleaved approach to promote a
more integrated understanding. Our investigations reveal that hallucinations
often stem from predictable patterns in data distributions and inherited
biases. By deepening our understanding, this survey provides a foundation for
developing more robust and effective solutions to hallucinations in real-world
generative AI systems.

### [3] [On Robustness of Vision-Language-Action Model against Multi-Modal Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00037)
*Jianing Guo,Zhenhong Wu,Chang Tu,Yiyao Ma,Xiangqi Kong,Zhiqian Liu,Jiaming Ji,Shuning Zhang,Yuanpei Chen,Kai Chen,Xianglong Liu,Qi Dou,Yaodong Yang,Huijie Zhao,Weifeng Lv,Simin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes RobustVLA, a method to enhance multi-modal robustness in Vision-Language-Action models against real-world perturbations across actions, instructions, environments, and observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models focus only on visual robustness but overlook broader multi-modal perturbations that occur in real-world deployments, making them vulnerable to various types of input and output disturbances.

Method: RobustVLA uses offline robust optimization against worst-case action noise for output robustness, and enforces consistent actions across input variations for input robustness. It formulates robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem using upper confidence bound to identify harmful noise.

Result: RobustVLA achieves 12.6% gain on pi0 backbone and 10.4% on OpenVLA backbone across 17 perturbations, with 50.6x faster inference than existing methods, and 65.6% gain on real-world FR5 robot with limited demonstrations.

Conclusion: The proposed RobustVLA framework effectively addresses multi-modal robustness in VLAs, significantly outperforming existing methods across various perturbation types and demonstrating practical effectiveness on real robots.

Abstract: In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world
perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual
disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in
actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate
the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four
modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing
visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0
demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build
multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA
inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust
optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow
matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing,
and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions
across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple
perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and
apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most
harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers
absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the
OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference
than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations.
Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited
demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four
modalities.

### [4] [Uncovering Intrinsic Capabilities: A Paradigm for Data Curation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00040)
*Junjie Li,Ziao Wang,Jianghong Ma,Xiaofeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADC is a framework that curates instruction tuning data by analyzing intrinsic capabilities through gradient-based learning trajectories and influence estimation, achieving better performance with only 5% of data than full-data training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instruction tuning methods treat models as black boxes and often cause regressions when reducing dataset size, overlooking the latent capabilities that govern learning.

Method: CADC discovers intrinsic capabilities unsupervised from gradient-based learning trajectories, attributes training data to capabilities via influence estimation, and creates capability-aware curricula through balanced selection and staged sequencing.

Result: With only 5% of the original data, CADC surpasses full-data training on multimodal benchmarks.

Conclusion: Intrinsic capabilities are fundamental building blocks of model learning, and CADC establishes a principle paradigm for instruction data curation.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong benchmark performance, but
controlling their behavior through instruction tuning remains difficult.
Reducing the budget of instruction tuning dataset often causes regressions, as
heuristic strategies treat models as black boxes and overlook the latent
capabilities that govern learning. We introduce Capability-Attributed Data
Curation (CADC), a framework that shifts curation from task-specific heuristics
to intrinsic capability analysis. CADC discovers intrinsic capabilities in an
unsupervised manner from gradient-based learning trajectories, attributes
training data to these capabilities via influence estimation, and curates
capability-aware curricula through balanced selection and staged sequencing.
This transforms black-box instruction tuning into a controllable,
capability-driven process. With as little as 5% of the original data, CADC
surpasses full-data training on multimodal benchmarks. These results validate
intrinsic capabilities as the fundamental building blocks of model learning and
establish CADC as a principle paradigm for instruction data curation.

### [5] [Culture In a Frame: C$^3$B as a Comic-Based Benchmark for Multimodal Culturally Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00041)
*Yuchen Song,Andong Chen,Wenxin Zhu,Kehai Chen,Xuefeng Bai,Muyun Yang,Tiejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C³B is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating cultural awareness in MLLMs, featuring over 2000 images and 18000 QA pairs across three progressively difficult tasks, revealing significant performance gaps between models and humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cultural awareness benchmarks lack progressed difficulty in task design, are deficient in cross-lingual tasks, and use real-world images that typically contain only one culture, making them relatively easy for MLLMs.

Method: Proposed C³B benchmark with three tasks of increasing difficulty: basic visual recognition, cultural conflict understanding, and cultural content generation, using comics-based images to present multiple cultures simultaneously.

Result: Evaluation of 11 open-source MLLMs showed significant performance gaps compared to human performance, demonstrating that C³B poses substantial challenges for current models.

Conclusion: The benchmark encourages future research to advance cultural awareness capabilities in MLLMs, addressing current limitations in multicultural, multitask, and multilingual evaluation.

Abstract: Cultural awareness capabilities has emerged as a critical capability for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, current benchmarks lack
progressed difficulty in their task design and are deficient in cross-lingual
tasks. Moreover, current benchmarks often use real-world images. Each
real-world image typically contains one culture, making these benchmarks
relatively easy for MLLMs. Based on this, we propose C$^3$B ($\textbf{C}$omics
$\textbf{C}$ross-$\textbf{C}$ultural $\textbf{B}$enchmark), a novel
multicultural, multitask and multilingual cultural awareness capabilities
benchmark. C$^3$B comprises over 2000 images and over 18000 QA pairs,
constructed on three tasks with progressed difficulties, from basic visual
recognition to higher-level cultural conflict understanding, and finally to
cultural content generation. We conducted evaluations on 11 open-source MLLMs,
revealing a significant performance gap between MLLMs and human performance.
The gap demonstrates that C$^3$B poses substantial challenges for current
MLLMs, encouraging future research to advance the cultural awareness
capabilities of MLLMs.

### [6] [Beyond the Prompt: Gender Bias in Text-to-Image Models, with a Case Study on Hospital Professions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00045)
*Franck Vandewiele,Remi Synave,Samuel Delepoulle,Remi Cozot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Analysis of gender bias in 6 text-to-image models shows systematic occupational stereotypes (nurses as women, surgeons as men) with model-specific variations and prompt wording significantly influencing gender representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how text-to-image models embed and amplify social biases, particularly gender stereotypes in professional contexts, across different state-of-the-art open-weight models.

Method: Generated 100 images for each combination of 5 hospital professions and 5 portrait qualifiers using 6 TTI models, then analyzed gender representation patterns.

Result: All models showed systematic biases: nurses exclusively depicted as women, surgeons predominantly as men. Model-specific variations found - some enforce rigid male dominance, others skew female. Prompt qualifiers significantly affect outcomes (corporate reinforces male, beautiful favors female).

Conclusion: Gender bias in TTI models is systematic and model-specific, with prompt wording playing critical role. Need for bias-aware design, balanced defaults, and user guidance to prevent reinforcement of occupational stereotypes.

Abstract: Text-to-image (TTI) models are increasingly used in professional,
educational, and creative contexts, yet their outputs often embed and amplify
social biases. This paper investigates gender representation in six
state-of-the-art open-weight models: HunyuanImage 2.1, HiDream-I1-dev,
Qwen-Image, FLUX.1-dev, Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large, and Stable-Diffusion-XL.
Using carefully designed prompts, we generated 100 images for each combination
of five hospital-related professions (cardiologist, hospital director, nurse,
paramedic, surgeon) and five portrait qualifiers ("", corporate, neutral,
aesthetic, beautiful).
  Our analysis reveals systematic occupational stereotypes: all models produced
nurses exclusively as women and surgeons predominantly as men. However,
differences emerge across models: Qwen-Image and SDXL enforce rigid male
dominance, HiDream-I1-dev shows mixed outcomes, and FLUX.1-dev skews female in
most roles. HunyuanImage 2.1 and Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large also reproduce
gender stereotypes but with varying degrees of sensitivity to prompt
formulation. Portrait qualifiers further modulate gender balance, with terms
like corporate reinforcing male depictions and beautiful favoring female ones.
Sensitivity varies widely: Qwen-Image remains nearly unaffected, while
FLUX.1-dev, SDXL, and SD3.5 show strong prompt dependence.
  These findings demonstrate that gender bias in TTI models is both systematic
and model-specific. Beyond documenting disparities, we argue that prompt
wording plays a critical role in shaping demographic outcomes. The results
underscore the need for bias-aware design, balanced defaults, and user guidance
to prevent the reinforcement of occupational stereotypes in generative AI.

### [7] [Reinforcement Learning-Based Prompt Template Stealing for Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00046)
*Xiaotian Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RLStealer is a reinforcement learning framework that can steal text-to-image prompts from just a few example images, exposing security risks in the prompt trading market.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose the security vulnerability in prompt trading markets where curated prompts that generate trademark styles can be stolen, creating commercial and security risks.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning to treat template stealing as a sequential decision making problem, employing multiple similarity-based feedback signals as reward functions to explore the prompt space efficiently.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing attack cost to under 13% of existing baselines, and can generalize across different image styles to steal unseen prompt templates.

Conclusion: Highlights an urgent security threat in prompt trading and lays groundwork for developing protective standards in the MLLMs marketplace.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have transformed text-to-image
workflows, allowing designers to create novel visual concepts with
unprecedented speed. This progress has given rise to a thriving prompt trading
market, where curated prompts that induce trademark styles are bought and sold.
Although commercially attractive, prompt trading also introduces a largely
unexamined security risk: the prompts themselves can be stolen.
  In this paper, we expose this vulnerability and present RLStealer, a
reinforcement learning based prompt inversion framework that recovers its
template from only a small set of example images. RLStealer treats template
stealing as a sequential decision making problem and employs multiple
similarity based feedback signals as reward functions to effectively explore
the prompt space. Comprehensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks
demonstrate that RLStealer gets state-of-the-art performance while reducing the
total attack cost to under 13% of that required by existing baselines. Our
further analysis confirms that RLStealer can effectively generalize across
different image styles to efficiently steal unseen prompt templates. Our study
highlights an urgent security threat inherent in prompt trading and lays the
groundwork for developing protective standards in the emerging MLLMs
marketplace.

### [8] [Explanation-Driven Counterfactual Testing for Faithfulness in Vision-Language Model Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00047)
*Sihao Ding,Santosh Vasa,Aditi Ramadwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EDCT is an automated method to test if vision-language models' explanations actually match what drives their predictions, by generating counterfactual image edits and checking if explanations remain consistent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models often produce convincing but unfaithful explanations that don't reflect the true causal factors behind predictions, creating technical and governance risks.

Method: EDCT automatically: gets model's answer and explanation, parses explanation into testable concepts, generates counterfactual image edits via inpainting, and computes consistency scores using LLM analysis.

Result: Across 120 OK-VQA examples and multiple VLMs, EDCT revealed significant faithfulness gaps and provided audit artifacts showing when cited concepts fail causal tests.

Conclusion: EDCT provides automated verification of explanation faithfulness in VLMs, helping identify when explanations don't match actual causal factors and creating regulator-aligned audit tools.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often produce fluent Natural Language
Explanations (NLEs) that sound convincing but may not reflect the causal
factors driving predictions. This mismatch of plausibility and faithfulness
poses technical and governance risks. We introduce Explanation-Driven
Counterfactual Testing (EDCT), a fully automated verification procedure for a
target VLM that treats the model's own explanation as a falsifiable hypothesis.
Given an image-question pair, EDCT: (1) obtains the model's answer and NLE, (2)
parses the NLE into testable visual concepts, (3) generates targeted
counterfactual edits via generative inpainting, and (4) computes a
Counterfactual Consistency Score (CCS) using LLM-assisted analysis of changes
in both answers and explanations. Across 120 curated OK-VQA examples and
multiple VLMs, EDCT uncovers substantial faithfulness gaps and provides
regulator-aligned audit artifacts indicating when cited concepts fail causal
tests.

### [9] [HiDe: Rethinking The Zoom-IN method in High Resolution MLLMs via Hierarchical Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00054)
*Xianjie Liu,Yiman Hu,Yixiong Zou,Liang Wu,Jian Xu,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiDe is a training-free framework that addresses MLLMs' poor performance on high-resolution images by decoupling key information from background interference through token-wise attention and layout-preserving techniques, achieving state-of-the-art results with reduced memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with high-resolution images not due to object size limitations but because of complex background interference, which existing "zoom in" strategies fail to address effectively.

Method: Hierarchical Decoupling Framework (HiDe) uses Token-wise Attention Decoupling to identify key information tokens and Layout-Preserving Decoupling to reconstruct compact representations that preserve spatial layouts while eliminating background interference.

Result: HiDe sets new SOTA on V*Bench, HRBench4K, and HRBench8K, boosting Qwen2.5-VL 7B and InternVL3 8B to 92.1% and 91.6% on V*Bench respectively, while using 75% less memory than previous training-free approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed HiDe framework effectively addresses background interference in high-resolution image understanding for MLLMs through a training-free hierarchical decoupling approach, achieving superior performance with significantly reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in
visual understanding tasks. However, their performance on high-resolution
images remains suboptimal. While existing approaches often attribute this
limitation to perceptual constraints and argue that MLLMs struggle to recognize
small objects, leading them to use "zoom in" strategies for better detail, our
analysis reveals a different cause: the main issue is not object size, but
rather caused by complex background interference. We systematically analyze
this "zoom in" operation through a series of decoupling experiments and propose
the Hierarchical Decoupling Framework (HiDe), a training-free framework that
uses Token-wise Attention Decoupling (TAD) to decouple the question tokens and
identify the key information tokens, then leverages their attention weights to
achieve precise alignment with the target visual regions. Subsequently, it
employs Layout-Preserving Decoupling (LPD) to decouple these regions from the
background and reconstructs a compact representation that preserves essential
spatial layouts while eliminating background interference. HiDe sets a new SOTA
on V*Bench, HRBench4K, and HRBench8K, boosting Qwen2.5-VL 7B and InternVL3 8B
to SOTA (92.1% and 91.6% on V*Bench), even surpassing RL methods. After
optimization, HiDe uses 75% less memory than the previous training-free
approach. Code is provided in https://github.com/Tennine2077/HiDe.

### [10] [FSDENet: A Frequency and Spatial Domains based Detail Enhancement Network for Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00059)
*Jiahao Fu,Yinfeng Yu,Liejun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSDENet is a dual-domain network that combines spatial processing with frequency-domain analysis using FFT and Haar wavelet transforms to enhance remote sensing image segmentation, particularly in boundary regions and grayscale transition zones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address semantic edge ambiguities caused by grayscale variations (shadows, low-contrast regions) in remote sensing image segmentation and fully leverage spatial information.

Method: Uses spatial processing for multi-scale features, integrates global and frequency-domain information via FFT in global mappings, and employs Haar wavelet transform to decompose features into high/low-frequency components for boundary refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four datasets: LoveDA, Vaihingen, Potsdam, and iSAID.

Conclusion: The dual-domain synergy between spatial granularity and frequency-domain edge sensitivity significantly improves segmentation accuracy in challenging regions like boundaries and grayscale transitions.

Abstract: To fully leverage spatial information for remote sensing image segmentation
and address semantic edge ambiguities caused by grayscale variations (e.g.,
shadows and low-contrast regions), we propose the Frequency and Spatial Domains
based Detail Enhancement Network (FSDENet). Our framework employs spatial
processing methods to extract rich multi-scale spatial features and
fine-grained semantic details. By effectively integrating global and
frequency-domain information through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in global
mappings, the model's capability to discern global representations under
grayscale variations is significantly strengthened. Additionally, we utilize
Haar wavelet transform to decompose features into high- and low-frequency
components, leveraging their distinct sensitivity to edge information to refine
boundary segmentation. The model achieves dual-domain synergy by integrating
spatial granularity with frequency-domain edge sensitivity, substantially
improving segmentation accuracy in boundary regions and grayscale transition
zones. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that FSDENet achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four widely adopted datasets: LoveDA,
Vaihingen, Potsdam, and iSAID.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Max-V1 is a novel one-stage end-to-end autonomous driving framework that formulates trajectory planning as next waypoint prediction using Vision-Language Models, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 30% improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reconceptualize autonomous driving as a generalized language task and develop a single-pass generation paradigm that aligns with the inherent sequentiality of driving, enabling end-to-end trajectory prediction directly from camera input.

Method: Uses Vision-Language Models (VLM) for one-stage end-to-end trajectory prediction, formulating planning as next waypoint prediction with a principled supervision strategy derived from statistical modeling and imitation learning from large-scale expert demonstrations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes dataset with over 30% improvement compared to prior baselines, and demonstrates superior generalization on cross-domain datasets with notable cross-vehicle robustness and adaptability.

Conclusion: The framework introduces a model enabling fundamental driving behaviors and lays the foundation for developing more capable self-driving agents, showing strong empirical performance and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: In this work, we reconceptualize autonomous driving as a generalized language
and formulate the trajectory planning task as next waypoint prediction. We
introduce Max-V1, a novel framework for one-stage end-to-end autonomous
driving. Our framework presents a single-pass generation paradigm that aligns
with the inherent sequentiality of driving. This approach leverages the
generative capacity of the VLM (Vision-Language Model) to enable end-to-end
trajectory prediction directly from front-view camera input. The efficacy of
this method is underpinned by a principled supervision strategy derived from
statistical modeling. This provides a well-defined learning objective, which
makes the framework highly amenable to master complex driving policies through
imitation learning from large-scale expert demonstrations. Empirically, our
method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset,
delivers an overall improvement of over 30% compared to prior baselines.
Furthermore, it exhibits superior generalization performance on cross-domain
datasets acquired from diverse vehicles, demonstrating notable potential for
cross-vehicle robustness and adaptability. Due to these empirical strengths,
this work introduces a model enabling fundamental driving behaviors, laying the
foundation for the development of more capable self-driving agents. Code will
be available upon publication.

### [12] [Efficient CNN Compression via Multi-method Low Rank Factorization and Feature Map Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00062)
*M. Kokhazadeh,G. Keramidas,V. Kelefouras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An end-to-end DSE framework for CNN compression using low-rank factorization with novel rank selection, one-shot fine-tuning, and multi-method integration that achieves high compression with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in LRF compression including optimal rank selection, large design space, long fine-tuning times, and limited compatibility across different layer types and decomposition methods.

Method: Uses feature map similarity for rank selection, one-shot fine-tuning, integrates 3 LRF techniques for Conv layers and 3 for FC layers applied selectively per-layer, and combines multiple LRF methods within single models.

Result: Achieves substantial compression with minimal accuracy loss, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques on 14 CNN models across 8 datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses LRF challenges and demonstrates that combining multiple LRF methods yields better compression than uniform single-method approaches.

Abstract: Low-Rank Factorization (LRF) is a widely adopted technique for compressing
deep neural networks (DNNs). However, it faces several challenges, including
optimal rank selection, a vast design space, long fine-tuning times, and
limited compatibility with different layer types and decomposition methods.
This paper presents an end-to-end Design Space Exploration (DSE) methodology
and framework for compressing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that
addresses all these issues. We introduce a novel rank selection strategy based
on feature map similarity, which captures non-linear interactions between layer
outputs more effectively than traditional weight-based approaches. Unlike prior
works, our method uses a one-shot fine-tuning process, significantly reducing
the overall fine-tuning time. The proposed framework is fully compatible with
all types of convolutional (Conv) and fully connected (FC) layers. To further
improve compression, the framework integrates three different LRF techniques
for Conv layers and three for FC layers, applying them selectively on a
per-layer basis. We demonstrate that combining multiple LRF methods within a
single model yields better compression results than using a single method
uniformly across all layers. Finally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation and
comparison of the six LRF techniques, offering practical insights into their
effectiveness across different scenarios. The proposed work is integrated into
TensorFlow 2.x, ensuring compatibility with widely used deep learning
workflows. Experimental results on 14 CNN models across eight datasets
demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves substantial compression with
minimal accuracy loss, outperforming several state-of-the-art techniques.

corresponding human audits. The results indicate that the proposed solution
contributes significantly to continuous improvement in automotive manufacturing
environments, speeding up the audit process by 50% of the traditional time and
maintaining the consistency of the assessments, with a 99.8% reduction in

*Jiancong Xie,Wenjin Wang,Zhuomeng Zhang,Zihan Liu,Qi Liu,Ke Feng,Zixun Sun,Yuedong Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OIG-Bench is a benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models' understanding of One-Image Guides - visual formats combining text, imagery and symbols designed for human comprehension. The benchmark uses a semi-automated multi-agent annotation pipeline and evaluates 29 MLLMs, finding Qwen2.5-VL-72B performs best with 77% accuracy but all models struggle with semantic understanding and logical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of MLLMs' capacity for human-like understanding in One-Image Guides is insufficiently explored, despite their importance as visual formats specifically designed for human perception and structured information presentation.

Method: Developed OIG-Bench benchmark with a semi-automated annotation pipeline where multiple intelligent agents collaborate to generate preliminary image descriptions, assisting humans in constructing image-text pairs. Evaluated 29 state-of-the-art MLLMs across diverse domains.

Result: Qwen2.5-VL-72B performed best among evaluated models with 77% overall accuracy. All models exhibited notable weaknesses in semantic understanding and logical reasoning. The multi-agent annotation system outperformed all MLLMs in image captioning.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs still struggle to accurately interpret complex visual-text relationships in One-Image Guides. The proposed multi-agent annotation system shows potential as both a high-quality image description generator and valuable tool for future dataset construction.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities. However, evaluating their capacity for human-like
understanding in One-Image Guides remains insufficiently explored. One-Image
Guides are a visual format combining text, imagery, and symbols to present
reorganized and structured information for easier comprehension, which are
specifically designed for human viewing and inherently embody the
characteristics of human perception and understanding. Here, we present
OIG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark focused on One-Image Guide understanding
across diverse domains. To reduce the cost of manual annotation, we developed a
semi-automated annotation pipeline in which multiple intelligent agents
collaborate to generate preliminary image descriptions, assisting humans in
constructing image-text pairs. With OIG-Bench, we have conducted a
comprehensive evaluation of 29 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both
proprietary and open-source models. The results show that Qwen2.5-VL-72B
performs the best among the evaluated models, with an overall accuracy of 77%.
Nevertheless, all models exhibit notable weaknesses in semantic understanding
and logical reasoning, indicating that current MLLMs still struggle to
accurately interpret complex visual-text relationships. In addition, we also
demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent annotation system outperforms all
MLLMs in image captioning, highlighting its potential as both a high-quality
image description generator and a valuable tool for future dataset
construction. Datasets are available at https://github.com/XiejcSYSU/OIG-Bench.

Motivation: To unlock geospatial reasoning capabilities in vision-language models without requiring costly human reasoning annotations, and to extend geospatial modeling from traditional domain pretraining/supervised finetuning to reasoning-first post-training.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Scaffolding stage uses supervised fine-tuning on synthetic chain-of-thought exemplars to instill geospatial thinking paradigm; 2) Elevating stage employs GRPO-based reinforcement learning on weakly-supervised cross-view pairing proxy to provide verifiable reward signals.

Conclusion: Geo-R1 successfully extends geospatial modeling to reasoning-first post-training and provides a scalable framework for developing geospatial reasoning in vision-language models without expensive human annotations.

Abstract: We introduce Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric post-training framework that unlocks
geospatial reasoning in vision-language models by combining thinking
scaffolding and elevating. In the scaffolding stage, Geo-R1 instills a
``geospatial thinking paradigm" via supervised fine-tuning on synthetic
chain-of-thought exemplars, enabling models to connect visual cues with
geographic priors without costly human reasoning annotations. In the elevating
stage, it uses GRPO-based reinforcement learning on a weakly-supervised
cross-view pairing proxy. This design supplies a verifiable and scalable reward
signal: teaching models to capture and reconcile features across modalities,
and harnessing reasoning for accurate prediction. Geo-R1 extends geospatial
modeling from domain pretraining / supervised finetuning to reasoning-first
post-training, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
geospatial reasoning benchmarks. Our model is available at

*Hanjiang Hu,Bowei Li,Ziwei Wang,Tianhao Wei,Casidhe Hutchison,Eric Sample,Changliu Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a neural network pruning method based on Unbiased and Smooth Neuron (USN) metric to improve robustness certification against semantic transformations like brightness and contrast perturbations, with enhanced pruning using Wasserstein distance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current certified training and robustness certification methods face challenges with over-parameterization in deep neural networks, which hinders tightness and scalability of robustness guarantees.

Method: 1) Analyze layer/neuron stability and variance against input perturbations to identify USN metric; 2) Prune neurons with low USN while retaining high-USN neurons; 3) Use Wasserstein distance loss to concentrate pruned neurons across layers.

Result: Extensive experiments on robust keypoint detection with realistic brightness/contrast perturbations show superior robustness certification performance and efficiency compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The USN-based pruning approach effectively addresses over-parameterization issues in robustness certification while preserving model expressiveness and achieving better certification performance.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been widely adopted in many vision and robotics
applications with visual inputs. It is essential to verify its robustness
against semantic transformation perturbations, such as brightness and contrast.
However, current certified training and robustness certification methods face
the challenge of over-parameterization, which hinders the tightness and
scalability due to the over-complicated neural networks. To this end, we first
analyze stability and variance of layers and neurons against input
perturbation, showing that certifiable robustness can be indicated by a
fundamental Unbiased and Smooth Neuron metric (USN). Based on USN, we introduce
a novel neural network pruning method that removes neurons with low USN and
retains those with high USN, thereby preserving model expressiveness without
over-parameterization. To further enhance this pruning process, we propose a
new Wasserstein distance loss to ensure that pruned neurons are more
concentrated across layers. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments on the challenging robust keypoint detection task, which involves
realistic brightness and contrast perturbations, demonstrating that our method
achieves superior robustness certification performance and efficiency compared
to baselines.

*Abu Hasnat Mohammad Rubaiyat,Jordan Vincent,Colin Olson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel hyperspectral anomaly detection method using transport-based mathematical modeling with signed cumulative distribution transform (SCDT) and unsupervised subspace modeling to detect anomalous pixels as deviations from learned background models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral anomaly detection faces challenges from complex real-world environments and limited prior knowledge of target signatures, requiring improved techniques to identify anomalous spectral signatures relative to background.

Method: Proposes a transport-based model viewing hyperspectral pixels as observations of a template pattern undergoing unknown deformations, representing them in SCDT domain, then using unsupervised subspace modeling to construct background models and detect anomalies as deviations.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations across five distinct datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The transport-based mathematical model with SCDT representation and unsupervised subspace modeling provides an effective framework for hyperspectral anomaly detection that outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD), a crucial approach for many civilian
and military applications, seeks to identify pixels with spectral signatures
that are anomalous relative to a preponderance of background signatures.
Significant effort has been made to improve HAD techniques, but challenges
arise due to complex real-world environments and, by definition, limited prior
knowledge of potential signatures of interest. This paper introduces a novel
HAD method by proposing a transport-based mathematical model to describe the
pixels comprising a given hyperspectral image. In this approach, hyperspectral
pixels are viewed as observations of a template pattern undergoing unknown
deformations that enables their representation in the signed cumulative
distribution transform (SCDT) domain. An unsupervised subspace modeling
technique is then used to construct a model of abundant background signals in
this domain, whereupon anomalous signals are detected as deviations from the
learned model. Comprehensive evaluations across five distinct datasets
illustrate the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: MOLM is a watermarking framework that uses key-dependent LoRA adapters to embed imperceptible watermarks in generative models, achieving robust detection against various attacks while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about detecting and attributing synthetically generated images, overcoming limitations of existing watermarking methods that are fragile to distortions, susceptible to removal, and expensive to update.

Method: Formulates watermark encoding as key-dependent perturbation of generative model parameters using Mixture of LoRA Markers (MOLM) - binary keys activate lightweight LoRA adapters in residual and attention blocks without requiring key-specific retraining.

Result: Experiments on Stable Diffusion and FLUX show MOLM preserves image quality while achieving robust key recovery against distortions, compression, regeneration, averaging attacks, and black-box adversarial attacks on the extractor.

Conclusion: MOLM provides an effective watermarking solution with desired properties of imperceptibility, fidelity, verifiability, and robustness for generative models.

Abstract: Generative models can generate photorealistic images at scale. This raises
urgent concerns about the ability to detect synthetically generated images and
attribute these images to specific sources. While watermarking has emerged as a
possible solution, existing methods remain fragile to realistic distortions,
susceptible to adaptive removal, and expensive to update when the underlying
watermarking key changes. We propose a general watermarking framework that
formulates the encoding problem as key-dependent perturbation of the parameters
of a generative model. Within this framework, we introduce Mixture of LoRA
Markers (MOLM), a routing-based instantiation in which binary keys activate
lightweight LoRA adapters inside residual and attention blocks. This design
avoids key-specific re-training and achieves the desired properties such as
imperceptibility, fidelity, verifiability, and robustness. Experiments on
Stable Diffusion and FLUX show that MOLM preserves image quality while
achieving robust key recovery against distortions, compression and
regeneration, averaging attacks, and black-box adversarial attacks on the
extractor.

*Anay Majee,Amitesh Gangrade,Rishabh Iyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CROWD is a combinatorial framework for Open-World Object Detection that addresses semantic confusion and catastrophic forgetting through interwoven discovery and learning components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OWOD approaches suffer from semantic confusion between known/unknown classes and catastrophic forgetting, leading to reduced unknown recall and degraded known-class accuracy.

Method: CROWD-Discover mines unknown instances using Submodular Conditional Gain functions to select representative examples dissimilar from known objects. CROWD-Learn uses combinatorial objectives to disentangle known/unknown representations while maintaining discriminative coherence among known classes.

Result: CROWD achieves improvements of 2.83% and 2.05% in known-class accuracy on M-OWODB and S-OWODB benchmarks, and nearly 2.4x unknown recall compared to leading baselines.

Conclusion: The combinatorial framework effectively mitigates confusion and forgetting in open-world object detection through strategic instance mining and joint representation learning.

Abstract: Open-World Object Detection (OWOD) enriches traditional object detectors by
enabling continual discovery and integration of unknown objects via human
guidance. However, existing OWOD approaches frequently suffer from semantic
confusion between known and unknown classes, alongside catastrophic forgetting,
leading to diminished unknown recall and degraded known-class accuracy. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Combinatorial Open-World Detection
(CROWD), a unified framework reformulating unknown object discovery and
adaptation as an interwoven combinatorial (set-based) data-discovery
(CROWD-Discover) and representation learning (CROWD-Learn) task. CROWD-Discover
strategically mines unknown instances by maximizing Submodular Conditional Gain
(SCG) functions, selecting representative examples distinctly dissimilar from
known objects. Subsequently, CROWD-Learn employs novel combinatorial objectives
that jointly disentangle known and unknown representations while maintaining
discriminative coherence among known classes, thus mitigating confusion and
forgetting. Extensive evaluations on OWOD benchmarks illustrate that CROWD
achieves improvements of 2.83% and 2.05% in known-class accuracy on M-OWODB and
S-OWODB, respectively, and nearly 2.4x unknown recall compared to leading
baselines.

TL;DR: Proposes ExpDWT-VAE, a novel VAE variant that enhances latent diffusion models for satellite imagery by integrating spatial and frequency-domain features using Discrete Wavelet Transform.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LDMs are effective for remote sensing, existing research rarely focuses on improving the intrinsic latent space representation. The paper aims to enhance VAE's latent space specifically for satellite imagery.

Method: ExpDWT-VAE uses dual branches: one processes spatial domain with convolutions, while another extracts frequency features via 2D Haar wavelet decomposition, convolution, and inverse DWT reconstruction. The merged representation is refined through convolutional and diagonal Gaussian mapping.

Result: Experimental validation on TerraFly satellite imagery dataset shows improved performance across multiple metrics, demonstrating enhanced latent space representation.

Conclusion: The proposed ExpDWT-VAE effectively enhances latent space representation for satellite imagery by integrating spatial and frequency information, providing better foundations for latent diffusion models in remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), a subclass of diffusion models, mitigate the
computational complexity of pixel-space diffusion by operating within a
compressed latent space constructed by Variational Autoencoders (VAEs),
demonstrating significant advantages in Remote Sensing (RS) applications.
Though numerous studies enhancing LDMs have been conducted, investigations
explicitly targeting improvements within the intrinsic latent space remain
scarce. This paper proposes an innovative perspective, utilizing the Discrete
Wavelet Transform (DWT) to enhance the VAE's latent space representation,
designed for satellite imagery. The proposed method, ExpDWT-VAE, introduces
dual branches: one processes spatial domain input through convolutional
operations, while the other extracts and processes frequency-domain features
via 2D Haar wavelet decomposition, convolutional operation, and inverse DWT
reconstruction. These branches merge to create an integrated spatial-frequency
representation, further refined through convolutional and diagonal Gaussian
mapping into a robust latent representation. We utilize a new satellite imagery
dataset housed by the TerraFly mapping system to validate our method.
Experimental results across several performance metrics highlight the efficacy
of the proposed method at enhancing latent space representation.

TL;DR: EgoTraj-Bench is the first real-world benchmark for ego-centric trajectory prediction that accounts for perceptual artifacts like occlusions and tracking drift. BiFlow model uses dual-stream flow matching to denoise observations and forecast motion, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 10-15% reduction in error metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing trajectory prediction methods assume idealized observation histories and fail to account for real-world perceptual artifacts in first-person vision (occlusions, ID switches, tracking drift), limiting model robustness in practical deployment.

Method: Proposed BiFlow - a dual-stream flow matching model that concurrently denoises historical observations and forecasts future motion using shared latent representation. Introduced EgoAnchor mechanism that conditions prediction decoder on distilled historical features via feature modulation.

Result: BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing minADE and minFDE by 10-15% on average and demonstrating superior robustness compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The EgoTraj-Bench benchmark and BiFlow model provide a critical foundation for developing trajectory forecasting systems resilient to real-world ego-centric perception challenges, bridging the gap between training assumptions and deployment reality.

Abstract: Reliable trajectory prediction from an ego-centric perspective is crucial for
robotic navigation in human-centric environments. However, existing methods
typically assume idealized observation histories, failing to account for the
perceptual artifacts inherent in first-person vision, such as occlusions, ID
switches, and tracking drift. This discrepancy between training assumptions and
deployment reality severely limits model robustness. To bridge this gap, we
introduce EgoTraj-Bench, the first real-world benchmark that grounds noisy,
first-person visual histories in clean, bird's-eye-view future trajectories,
enabling robust learning under realistic perceptual constraints. Building on
this benchmark, we propose BiFlow, a dual-stream flow matching model that
concurrently denoises historical observations and forecasts future motion by
leveraging a shared latent representation. To better model agent intent, BiFlow
incorporates our EgoAnchor mechanism, which conditions the prediction decoder
on distilled historical features via feature modulation. Extensive experiments
show that BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing minADE and
minFDE by 10-15% on average and demonstrating superior robustness. We
anticipate that our benchmark and model will provide a critical foundation for
developing trajectory forecasting systems truly resilient to the challenges of
real-world, ego-centric perception.

TL;DR: Comparative analysis shows that supervised CNNs are strong baselines for chest X-ray diagnosis, but zero-shot VLMs like BiomedCLIP can match or surpass them when properly calibrated via threshold optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of zero-shot medical Vision-Language Models compared to supervised CNNs for chest radiograph interpretation, particularly for pneumonia and tuberculosis detection.

Method: Comparative analysis between supervised lightweight CNN and zero-shot BiomedCLIP VLM on PneumoniaMNIST (pneumonia) and Shenzhen TB dataset (tuberculosis), with decision threshold calibration applied to the VLM.

Result: With threshold calibration, BiomedCLIP achieved F1-score of 0.8841 (pneumonia) vs CNN's 0.8803, and 0.7684 (tuberculosis) vs CNN's 0.7834, showing significant improvement from uncalibrated performance.

Conclusion: Proper calibration is essential for unlocking the full diagnostic potential of zero-shot VLMs, enabling them to compete with or outperform task-specific supervised models in medical imaging.

Abstract: The accurate interpretation of chest radiographs using automated methods is a
critical task in medical imaging. This paper presents a comparative analysis
between a supervised lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a
state-of-the-art, zero-shot medical Vision-Language Model (VLM), BiomedCLIP,
across two distinct diagnostic tasks: pneumonia detection on the PneumoniaMNIST
benchmark and tuberculosis detection on the Shenzhen TB dataset. Our
experiments show that supervised CNNs serve as highly competitive baselines in
both cases. While the default zero-shot performance of the VLM is lower, we
demonstrate that its potential can be unlocked via a simple yet crucial remedy:
decision threshold calibration. By optimizing the classification threshold on a
validation set, the performance of BiomedCLIP is significantly boosted across
both datasets. For pneumonia detection, calibration enables the zero-shot VLM
to achieve a superior F1-score of 0.8841, surpassing the supervised CNN's
0.8803. For tuberculosis detection, calibration dramatically improves the
F1-score from 0.4812 to 0.7684, bringing it close to the supervised baseline's
0.7834. This work highlights a key insight: proper calibration is essential for
leveraging the full diagnostic power of zero-shot VLMs, enabling them to match

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI agents struggle with long-horizon tasks due to memory limitations - they either truncate history or use simple textual summaries, risking loss of critical visual information needed for future decisions.

Method: PAL-UI combines dual-level summarization (capturing observation-level cues and action-level outcomes) with a dedicated retrieval tool that allows agents to recall specific historical screenshots during planning. Models are trained on 8.6K mobile GUI navigation samples based on Qwen2.5-VL.

Result: PAL-UI significantly outperforms baseline models and prior methods in mobile GUI navigation tasks, even in data-efficient settings. It also shows strong cross-domain generalization, achieving notable improvements in web navigation without additional training.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the potential of active memory retrieval for enhancing long-horizon planning capabilities of vision-based GUI agents, providing a more robust solution for complex interaction tasks.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) promise human-like interaction with software applications, yet

agents to adaptively retrieve past observations when required. PAL-UI combines
a dual-level summarization agent, capturing both observation-level cues and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generic segmentation tools lack specificity for clinically critical tasks like meningioma RT planning, where precise delineation is crucial for treatment efficacy and healthy tissue preservation.

Method: Developed Interactive-MEN-RT with multiple clinically relevant interaction methods including point annotations, bounding boxes, lasso tools, and scribbles for clinician-assisted 3D meningioma segmentation.

Result: Achieved Dice similarity coefficients of 77.6% and Intersection over Union scores of 64.8% on 500 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans from BraTS 2025 Meningioma RT Segmentation Challenge.

Conclusion: Clinically tailored segmentation solutions are essential for critical applications like meningioma RT planning, and interactive AI approaches significantly improve segmentation accuracy over generic methods.

Abstract: Precise delineation of meningiomas is crucial for effective radiotherapy (RT)
planning, directly influencing treatment efficacy and preservation of adjacent
healthy tissues. While automated deep learning approaches have demonstrated
considerable potential, achieving consistently accurate clinical segmentation
remains challenging due to tumor heterogeneity. Interactive Medical Image
Segmentation (IMIS) addresses this challenge by integrating advanced AI
techniques with clinical input. However, generic segmentation tools, despite
widespread applicability, often lack the specificity required for clinically
critical and disease-specific tasks like meningioma RT planning. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce Interactive-MEN-RT, a dedicated IMIS tool
specifically developed for clinician-assisted 3D meningioma segmentation in RT
workflows. The system incorporates multiple clinically relevant interaction
methods, including point annotations, bounding boxes, lasso tools, and
scribbles, enhancing usability and clinical precision. In our evaluation
involving 500 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans from the BraTS 2025
Meningioma RT Segmentation Challenge, Interactive-MEN-RT demonstrated
substantial improvement compared to other segmentation methods, achieving Dice
similarity coefficients of up to 77.6\% and Intersection over Union scores of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation models struggle with subject-consistent generation due to difficulty parsing prompts with complex spatial relationships, temporal logic, and multi-subject interactions.

Method: Proposes BindWeave with MLLM-DiT framework where pretrained multimodal large language model performs cross-modal reasoning to ground entities and disentangle roles/attributes/interactions, producing subject-aware hidden states that condition diffusion transformer.

Result: Experiments on OpenS2V benchmark show superior performance across subject consistency, naturalness, and text relevance, outperforming existing open-source and commercial models.

Conclusion: BindWeave effectively addresses subject-consistent video generation challenges for complex multi-subject scenes through cross-modal reasoning and subject-aware conditioning.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer has shown remarkable abilities in generating
high-fidelity videos, delivering visually coherent frames and rich details over
extended durations. However, existing video generation models still fall short
in subject-consistent video generation due to an inherent difficulty in parsing
prompts that specify complex spatial relationships, temporal logic, and
interactions among multiple subjects. To address this issue, we propose
BindWeave, a unified framework that handles a broad range of subject-to-video
scenarios from single-subject cases to complex multi-subject scenes with
heterogeneous entities. To bind complex prompt semantics to concrete visual
subjects, we introduce an MLLM-DiT framework in which a pretrained multimodal
large language model performs deep cross-modal reasoning to ground entities and
disentangle roles, attributes, and interactions, yielding subject-aware hidden
states that condition the diffusion transformer for high-fidelity
subject-consistent video generation. Experiments on the OpenS2V benchmark
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across subject
consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in generated videos, outperforming
existing open-source and commercial models.

*Wang Zhang,Huaqiu Li,Xiaowan Hu,Tao Jiang,Zikang Chen,Haoqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCNet addresses limitations in self-supervised denoising by controlling spectral learning, using frequency band selection, Lipschitz-constrained optimization, and a spectral separation module to preserve high-frequency details while reducing noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised denoising methods suffer from poor preservation of high-frequency structural details and tend to learn high-frequency noise from mapped noisy images during training.

Method: Proposes SCNet with three components: frequency band selection strategy for training acceleration, Lipschitz-constrained parameter optimization to limit high-frequency noise learning, and SSR module for noise-detail separation via frequency domain processing and low-rank reconstruction.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate SCNet's effectiveness in improving denoising performance while better preserving image details.

Conclusion: SCNet successfully addresses spectral bias issues in self-supervised denoising by controlling frequency learning and separating noise from structural details, achieving superior performance on both synthetic and real datasets.

Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising methods for paired noisy images typically
involve mapping one noisy image through the network to the other noisy image.
However, after measuring the spectral bias of such methods using our proposed
Image Pair Frequency-Band Similarity, it suffers from two practical
limitations. Firstly, the high-frequency structural details in images are not
preserved well enough. Secondly, during the process of fitting high
frequencies, the network learns high-frequency noise from the mapped noisy
images. To address these challenges, we introduce a Spectral Controlling
network (SCNet) to optimize self-supervised denoising of paired noisy images.
First, we propose a selection strategy to choose frequency band components for
noisy images, to accelerate the convergence speed of training. Next, we present
a parameter optimization method that restricts the learning ability of
convolutional kernels to high-frequency noise using the Lipschitz constant,
without changing the network structure. Finally, we introduce the Spectral
Separation and low-rank Reconstruction module (SSR module), which separates
noise and high-frequency details through frequency domain separation and
low-rank space reconstruction, to retain the high-frequency structural details
of images. Experiments performed on synthetic and real-world datasets verify
the effectiveness of SCNet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language object detectors (VLODs) like YOLO-World and Grounding DINO perform well in zero-shot recognition but degrade under domain shift, requiring adaptation methods to maintain performance across different domains.

Method: Uses two key techniques: 1) IoU-weighted entropy objective that focuses adaptation on spatially coherent proposal clusters to reduce confirmation bias, and 2) Image-conditioned prompt selection that ranks prompts by image-level compatibility and fuses the most informative prompts with detector logits.

Result: Benchmarked across diverse distribution shifts including stylized domains, driving scenes, low-light conditions, and common corruptions, showing consistent improvements over zero-shot and TTA baselines on both YOLO-World and Grounding DINO.

Conclusion: VLOD-TTA effectively adapts vision-language object detectors to domain shifts through proposal clustering and prompt selection, demonstrating robust performance across various challenging conditions.

Abstract: Vision-language object detectors (VLODs) such as YOLO-World and Grounding
DINO achieve impressive zero-shot recognition by aligning region proposals with
text representations. However, their performance often degrades under domain
shift. We introduce VLOD-TTA, a test-time adaptation (TTA) framework for VLODs
that leverages dense proposal overlap and image-conditioned prompt scores.
First, an IoU-weighted entropy objective is proposed that concentrates
adaptation on spatially coherent proposal clusters and reduces confirmation
bias from isolated boxes. Second, image-conditioned prompt selection is
introduced, which ranks prompts by image-level compatibility and fuses the most
informative prompts with the detector logits. Our benchmarking across diverse
distribution shifts -- including stylized domains, driving scenes, low-light
conditions, and common corruptions -- shows the effectiveness of our method on
two state-of-the-art VLODs, YOLO-World and Grounding DINO, with consistent

Method: Developed a benchmark with 1.4M generated instances and curated test sets covering digit scale, move complexity, solution multiplicity, and operator variation. Evaluated 14 vision-language models in both text-guided and purely visual settings.

Result: Current models show substantial limitations: closed-source models only succeed on simple cases, open-source models fail in visual regime, while humans achieve over 90% accuracy.

Conclusion: MathSticks establishes a rigorous benchmark for advancing compositional reasoning across vision and symbols, highlighting the need for improved models that can handle visual symbolic reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We introduce \textsc{MathSticks}, a benchmark for Visual Symbolic
Compositional Reasoning (VSCR), which unifies visual perception, symbolic
manipulation, and arithmetic consistency. Each task presents an incorrect
matchstick equation that must be corrected by moving one or two sticks under
strict conservation rules. The benchmark includes both text-guided and purely
visual settings, systematically covering digit scale, move complexity, solution
multiplicity, and operator variation, with 1.4M generated instances and a
curated test set. Evaluations of 14 vision--language models reveal substantial
limitations: closed-source models succeed only on simple cases, open-source
models fail in the visual regime, while humans exceed 90\% accuracy. These
findings establish \textsc{MathSticks} as a rigorous testbed for advancing
compositional reasoning across vision and symbols. Our code and dataset are

### [29] [Normal-Abnormal Guided Generalist Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00495)
*Yuexin Wang,Xiaolei Wang,Yizheng Gong,Jimin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NAGL is a generalist anomaly detection framework that uses both normal and abnormal samples as references, outperforming previous methods that only used normal samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous GAD methods only used normal samples as references, ignoring valuable information from anomalous samples that are often available in real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposed Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning (NAGL) with two components: Residual Mining (RM) extracts abnormal patterns from normal-abnormal reference residuals, and Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL) adaptively learns anomaly features through residual mapping.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show the method significantly outperforms existing GAD approaches.

Conclusion: This is the first work to adopt a mixture of normal and abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection, enabling more accurate and efficient cross-domain anomaly detection.

Abstract: Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to train a unified model on an
original domain that can detect anomalies in new target domains. Previous GAD
methods primarily use only normal samples as references, overlooking the
valuable information contained in anomalous samples that are often available in
real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a more practical
approach: normal-abnormal-guided generalist anomaly detection, which leverages
both normal and anomalous samples as references to guide anomaly detection
across diverse domains. We introduce the Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning
(NAGL) framework, consisting of two key components: Residual Mining (RM) and
Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL). RM extracts abnormal patterns from
normal-abnormal reference residuals to establish transferable anomaly
representations, while AFL adaptively learns anomaly features in query images
through residual mapping to identify instance-aware anomalies. Our approach
effectively utilizes both normal and anomalous references for more accurate and
efficient cross-domain anomaly detection. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing GAD
approaches. This work represents the first to adopt a mixture of normal and
abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection. The code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/JasonKyng/NAGL.

*Kaiqi Zhang,Mingguan Yang,Dali Chang,Chun Chen,Yuxiang Zhang,Kexun He,Jing Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAF is a feature extraction technique that fuses relative image features with absolute numerical values to improve iterative method selection for sparse linear systems, achieving 5.86%-11.50% faster solution times than conventional image-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image-based selection approaches for sparse linear systems can encode distinct matrices into identical image representations, leading to suboptimal method selection due to feature ambiguity.

Method: RAF (Relative-Absolute Fusion) simultaneously extracts and fuses image representations as relative features with corresponding numerical values as absolute features to create comprehensive matrix representations.

Result: RAF achieved solution time reductions of 0.08s-0.29s for sparse linear systems, which is 5.86%-11.50% faster than conventional image-based selection approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance on SuiteSparse and BMCMat datasets.

Conclusion: RAF prevents feature ambiguity across distinct matrices, improves selection accuracy, and unlocks the potential of image-based selection approaches for sparse linear systems.

Abstract: Iterative method selection is crucial for solving sparse linear systems
because these methods inherently lack robustness. Though image-based selection
approaches have shown promise, their feature extraction techniques might encode
distinct matrices into identical image representations, leading to the same
selection and suboptimal method. In this paper, we introduce RAF
(Relative-Absolute Fusion), an efficient feature extraction technique to
enhance image-based selection approaches. By simultaneously extracting and
fusing image representations as relative features with corresponding numerical
values as absolute features, RAF achieves comprehensive matrix representations
that prevent feature ambiguity across distinct matrices, thus improving
selection accuracy and unlocking the potential of image-based selection
approaches. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of RAF on SuiteSparse and
our developed BMCMat (Balanced Multi-Classification Matrix dataset),
demonstrating solution time reductions of 0.08s-0.29s for sparse linear
systems, which is 5.86%-11.50% faster than conventional image-based selection
approaches and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. BMCMat is

### [31] [Affordance-Guided Diffusion Prior for 3D Hand Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00506)
*Naru Suzuki,Takehiko Ohkawa,Tatsuro Banno,Jihyun Lee,Ryosuke Furuta,Yoichi Sato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A generative prior method that uses affordance-aware textual descriptions to refine 3D hand poses in heavily occluded scenarios, leveraging diffusion models and vision-language models for improved accuracy and functional coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reconstructing 3D hand poses when large portions are heavily occluded by leveraging contextual knowledge like affordances, where object shape and function suggest typical grasping patterns.

Method: Uses a diffusion-based generative model that learns plausible hand pose distributions conditioned on affordance descriptions inferred from a large vision-language model (VLM), enabling refinement of occluded regions.

Result: Extensive experiments on HOGraspNet dataset show significant improvement in hand pose estimation over recent regression methods and diffusion-based refinement without contextual reasoning.

Conclusion: Affordance-guided refinement using textual descriptions and generative models effectively improves hand pose estimation in severely occluded scenarios by incorporating functional context.

Abstract: How can we reconstruct 3D hand poses when large portions of the hand are
heavily occluded by itself or by objects? Humans often resolve such ambiguities
by leveraging contextual knowledge -- such as affordances, where an object's
shape and function suggest how the object is typically grasped. Inspired by
this observation, we propose a generative prior for hand pose refinement guided
by affordance-aware textual descriptions of hand-object interactions (HOI). Our
method employs a diffusion-based generative model that learns the distribution
of plausible hand poses conditioned on affordance descriptions, which are
inferred from a large vision-language model (VLM). This enables the refinement
of occluded regions into more accurate and functionally coherent hand poses.
Extensive experiments on HOGraspNet, a 3D hand-affordance dataset with severe
occlusions, demonstrate that our affordance-guided refinement significantly
improves hand pose estimation over both recent regression methods and
diffusion-based refinement lacking contextual reasoning.

*Zichen Wen,Shaobo Wang,Yufa Zhou,Junyuan Zhang,Qintong Zhang,Yifeng Gao,Zhaorun Chen,Bin Wang,Weijia Li,Conghui He,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EPIC is a progressive learning framework that improves multi-modal large model efficiency through token compression while reducing training difficulty via consistency distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual tokens consume substantial computational resources in MLLMs, and existing compression methods overlook the increased learning difficulty caused by feature space perturbations from token compression.

Method: Decompose feature space perturbations along token-wise and layer-wise dimensions, then apply token consistency distillation and layer consistency distillation using guidance from a teacher model in a progressive learning trajectory.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior effectiveness, robustness, and generalization capabilities of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: EPIC successfully addresses the efficiency problem in MLLMs while mitigating training difficulties through progressive consistency distillation.

Abstract: Visual tokens consume substantial computational resources in multi-modal
large models (MLLMs), significantly compromising their efficiency. Recent works
have attempted to improve efficiency by compressing visual tokens during
training, either through modifications to model components or by introducing
additional parameters. However, they often overlook the increased learning
difficulty caused by such compression, as the model's parameter space struggles
to quickly adapt to the substantial perturbations in the feature space induced
by token compression. In this work, we propose to develop Efficient MLLMs via
Progressive Consistency Distillation (EPIC), a progressive learning framework.
Specifically, by decomposing the feature space perturbations introduced by
token compression along the token-wise and layer-wise dimensions, we introduce
token consistency distillation and layer consistency distillation,
respectively, aiming to reduce the training difficulty by leveraging guidance
from a teacher model and following a progressive learning trajectory. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness, robustness, and
generalization capabilities of our proposed framework.

*Darya Taratynova,Ahmed Aly,Numan Saeed,Mohammad Yaqub*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CardioBench is a standardized benchmark for evaluating foundation models in echocardiography, unifying 8 public datasets across 9 tasks with consistent evaluation protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of standardized evaluation for echocardiography foundation models, which face unique challenges like noisy data, frame redundancy, and limited public datasets, making current private evaluations incomparable.

Method: Created CardioBench by unifying 8 publicly available datasets into standardized evaluation suite covering 4 regression and 5 classification tasks. Evaluated cardiac-specific, biomedical, and general-purpose foundation models under consistent zero-shot, probing, and alignment protocols.

Result: Found complementary strengths: temporal modeling critical for functional regression, retrieval robust under distribution shift, domain-specific text encoders capture physiological meaning. General-purpose encoders transfer well but struggle with fine-grained distinctions like view classification and subtle pathology.

Conclusion: CardioBench establishes reproducible reference point and provides actionable insights to guide future echocardiography foundation model design, with released preprocessing, splits, and evaluation pipelines.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are reshaping medical imaging, yet their application
in echocardiography remains limited. While several echocardiography-specific
FMs have recently been introduced, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate
them. Echocardiography poses unique challenges, including noisy acquisitions,
high frame redundancy, and limited public datasets. Most existing solutions
evaluate on private data, restricting comparability. To address this, we
introduce CardioBench, a comprehensive benchmark for echocardiography FMs.
CardioBench unifies eight publicly available datasets into a standardized suite
spanning four regression and five classification tasks, covering functional,
structural, diagnostic, and view recognition endpoints. We evaluate several
leading FM, including cardiac-specific, biomedical, and general-purpose
encoders, under consistent zero-shot, probing, and alignment protocols. Our
results highlight complementary strengths across model families: temporal
modeling is critical for functional regression, retrieval provides robustness
under distribution shift, and domain-specific text encoders capture
physiologically meaningful axes. General-purpose encoders transfer strongly and
often close the gap with probing, but struggle with fine-grained distinctions
like view classification and subtle pathology recognition. By releasing
preprocessing, splits, and public evaluation pipelines, CardioBench establishes
a reproducible reference point and offers actionable insights to guide the
design of future echocardiography foundation models.

### [34] [Cascaded Diffusion Framework for Probabilistic Coarse-to-Fine Hand Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00527)
*Taeyun Woo,Jinah Park,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a coarse-to-fine cascaded diffusion framework for 3D hand pose reconstruction that combines probabilistic modeling with cascaded refinement to address pose ambiguities and uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with pose ambiguities from self-occlusions and complex articulations. Deterministic models can't capture uncertainties, while probabilistic methods lack refinement stages and often produce inaccurate reconstructions.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Joint diffusion model samples diverse 3D joint hypotheses, 2) Mesh Latent Diffusion Model reconstructs 3D hand mesh conditioned on joint samples. Trained with diverse joint hypotheses in learned latent space to capture distribution-aware relationships.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on FreiHAND and HO3Dv2 datasets while effectively modeling pose distributions and enhancing reconstruction accuracy.

Conclusion: The cascaded diffusion framework successfully combines probabilistic modeling with sequential refinement, overcoming limitations of both deterministic and single-stage probabilistic approaches for 3D hand pose reconstruction.

Abstract: Deterministic models for 3D hand pose reconstruction, whether single-staged
or cascaded, struggle with pose ambiguities caused by self-occlusions and
complex hand articulations. Existing cascaded approaches refine predictions in
a coarse-to-fine manner but remain deterministic and cannot capture pose
uncertainties. Recent probabilistic methods model pose distributions yet are
restricted to single-stage estimation, which often fails to produce accurate 3D
reconstructions without refinement. To address these limitations, we propose a
coarse-to-fine cascaded diffusion framework that combines probabilistic
modeling with cascaded refinement. The first stage is a joint diffusion model
that samples diverse 3D joint hypotheses, and the second stage is a Mesh Latent
Diffusion Model (Mesh LDM) that reconstructs a 3D hand mesh conditioned on a
joint sample. By training Mesh LDM with diverse joint hypotheses in a learned
latent space, our framework learns distribution-aware joint-mesh relationships
and robust hand priors. Furthermore, the cascaded design mitigates the
difficulty of directly mapping 2D images to dense 3D poses, enhancing accuracy
through sequential refinement. Experiments on FreiHAND and HO3Dv2 demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while effectively
modeling pose distributions.

*Aoduo Li,Peikai Lin,Jiancheng Li,Zhen Zhang,Shiting Wu,Zexiao Liang,Zhifa Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Forestpest-YOLO is an enhanced object detection framework based on YOLOv8 that improves detection of small, occluded agricultural pests in forestry remote sensing imagery through lossless downsampling, cross-stage feature fusion, and improved loss function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting agricultural pests in complex forestry environments is challenging due to small target size, heavy occlusion, visual similarity to cluttered backgrounds, and extreme data imbalance, causing conventional object detection models to fail.

Method: Built on YOLOv8 with three key innovations: 1) SPD-Conv for lossless downsampling to preserve small target details, 2) CSPOK cross-stage feature fusion block for enhanced multi-scale representation and background noise suppression, 3) VarifocalLoss to focus on high-quality and hard-to-classify samples.

Result: Extensive experiments on the ForestPest dataset show Forestpest-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance with marked improvements in detecting small, occluded pests, significantly outperforming established baseline models.

Conclusion: The proposed Forestpest-YOLO framework effectively addresses the challenges of pest detection in forestry remote sensing through synergistic architectural improvements and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Detecting agricultural pests in complex forestry environments using remote
sensing imagery is fundamental for ecological preservation, yet it is severely
hampered by practical challenges. Targets are often minuscule, heavily
occluded, and visually similar to the cluttered background, causing
conventional object detection models to falter due to the loss of fine-grained
features and an inability to handle extreme data imbalance. To overcome these
obstacles, this paper introduces Forestpest-YOLO, a detection framework
meticulously optimized for the nuances of forestry remote sensing. Building
upon the YOLOv8 architecture, our framework introduces a synergistic trio of
innovations. We first integrate a lossless downsampling module, SPD-Conv, to
ensure that critical high-resolution details of small targets are preserved
throughout the network. This is complemented by a novel cross-stage feature
fusion block, CSPOK, which dynamically enhances multi-scale feature
representation while suppressing background noise. Finally, we employ
VarifocalLoss to refine the training objective, compelling the model to focus
on high-quality and hard-to-classify samples. Extensive experiments on our
challenging, self-constructed ForestPest dataset demonstrate that
Forestpest-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing marked
improvements in detecting small, occluded pests and significantly outperforming
established baseline models.

*Henrik Pichler,Janis Keuper,Matthew Copping*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision foundation models like MaskDINO can achieve near-parity with extensively trained traditional models (YoloV9) for mold colony detection on Petri dishes using only 150 images, and remain reliable with as few as 25 images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that exhaustive annotation is not necessary for new vision tasks, challenging the conventional approach of manual annotation of large datasets for microbiology automation.

Method: Compiled a dataset of 5000 Petri dish images with bounding boxes, simulating traditional data collection and few-shot scenarios. Benchmarked three vision foundation models against traditional baselines on task-specific metrics.

Result: MaskDINO achieved near-parity with extensively trained YoloV9 when fine-tuned on only 150 images, and maintained competitive performance with just 25 images (reliable on ~70% of samples).

Conclusion: Data-efficient foundation models can match traditional approaches with only a fraction of required data, enabling faster development of automated microbiological systems with superior upper-bound performance.

Abstract: The process of quantifying mold colonies on Petri dish samples is of critical
importance for the assessment of indoor air quality, as high colony counts can
indicate potential health risks and deficiencies in ventilation systems.
Conventionally the automation of such a labor-intensive process, as well as
other tasks in microbiology, relies on the manual annotation of large datasets
and the subsequent extensive training of models like YoloV9. To demonstrate
that exhaustive annotation is not a prerequisite anymore when tackling a new
vision task, we compile a representative dataset of 5000 Petri dish images
annotated with bounding boxes, simulating both a traditional data collection
approach as well as few-shot and low-shot scenarios with well curated subsets
with instance level masks. We benchmark three vision foundation models against
traditional baselines on task specific metrics, reflecting realistic real-world
requirements. Notably, MaskDINO attains near-parity with an extensively trained
YoloV9 model while finetuned only on 150 images, retaining competitive
performance with as few as 25 images, still being reliable on $\approx$ 70% of
the samples. Our results show that data-efficient foundation models can match
traditional approaches with only a fraction of the required data, enabling
earlier development and faster iterative improvement of automated
microbiological systems with a superior upper-bound performance than
traditional models would achieve.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes adaptive shared experts (ASE) within a LoRA-based MoE framework to improve multi-task learning by enabling better STL-to-MTL transition, expert specialization, and knowledge sharing through router-computed gating weights and fine-grained expert design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MoE-MTL methods rely on single-task pretrained backbones and suffer from redundant adaptation and inefficient knowledge sharing during the transition from single-task to multi-task learning (STL to MTL).

Method: Adaptive shared experts (ASE) within a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) based MoE, where shared experts are assigned router-computed gating weights jointly normalized with sparse experts, and fine-grained experts by increasing the number of LoRA experts while proportionally reducing their rank.

Result: Extensive experiments on the PASCAL-Context benchmark demonstrate that ASE consistently improves performance across diverse configurations and validates the effectiveness of fine-grained designs for MTL.

Conclusion: The proposed ASE framework effectively addresses limitations in existing MoE-MTL methods by facilitating better STL-to-MTL transition, enhancing expert specialization and cooperation, and enabling more effective knowledge sharing under comparable parameter budgets.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful framework for multi-task
learning (MTL). However, existing MoE-MTL methods often rely on single-task
pretrained backbones and suffer from redundant adaptation and inefficient
knowledge sharing during the transition from single-task to multi-task learning
(STL to MTL). To address these limitations, we propose adaptive shared experts
(ASE) within a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) based MoE, where shared experts are
assigned router-computed gating weights jointly normalized with sparse experts.
This design facilitates STL to MTL transition, enhances expert specialization,
and cooperation. Furthermore, we incorporate fine-grained experts by increasing
the number of LoRA experts while proportionally reducing their rank, enabling
more effective knowledge sharing under a comparable parameter budget. Extensive
experiments on the PASCAL-Context benchmark, under unified training settings,
demonstrate that ASE consistently improves performance across diverse

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArbInterp is a novel video frame interpolation framework that enables flexible interpolation at any timestamp and any length, overcoming limitations of fixed-frame methods through timestamp-aware position encoding and appearance-motion decoupled conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative video frame interpolation methods are constrained to synthesize a fixed number of intermediate frames, lacking flexibility to adjust generated frame rates or total sequence duration.

Method: Proposes Timestamp-aware Rotary Position Embedding (TaRoPE) for interpolation at any timestamp, and decomposes long-sequence generation into segment-wise synthesis with appearance-motion decoupled conditioning for consistency and coherence.

Result: Outperforms prior methods across all scenarios (2x to 32x interpolation) with higher fidelity and more seamless spatiotemporal continuity.

Conclusion: ArbInterp provides a flexible and efficient solution for arbitrary-length video frame interpolation with superior performance compared to existing fixed-frame methods.

Abstract: Video frame interpolation (VFI), which generates intermediate frames from
given start and end frames, has become a fundamental function in video
generation applications. However, existing generative VFI methods are
constrained to synthesize a fixed number of intermediate frames, lacking the
flexibility to adjust generated frame rates or total sequence duration. In this
work, we present ArbInterp, a novel generative VFI framework that enables
efficient interpolation at any timestamp and of any length. Specifically, to
support interpolation at any timestamp, we propose the Timestamp-aware Rotary
Position Embedding (TaRoPE), which modulates positions in temporal RoPE to
align generated frames with target normalized timestamps. This design enables
fine-grained control over frame timestamps, addressing the inflexibility of
fixed-position paradigms in prior work. For any-length interpolation, we
decompose long-sequence generation into segment-wise frame synthesis. We
further design a novel appearance-motion decoupled conditioning strategy: it
leverages prior segment endpoints to enforce appearance consistency and
temporal semantics to maintain motion coherence, ensuring seamless
spatiotemporal transitions across segments. Experimentally, we build
comprehensive benchmarks for multi-scale frame interpolation (2x to 32x) to
assess generalizability across arbitrary interpolation factors. Results show
that ArbInterp outperforms prior methods across all scenarios with higher
fidelity and more seamless spatiotemporal continuity. Project website:

TL;DR: KeySG introduces a hierarchical 3D scene graph framework with multi-modal keyframe-based representation that enables efficient reasoning and planning for robots in complex environments using VLMs and hierarchical RAG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D scene graph approaches are limited by predefined relationships and scalability issues that exceed LLM context windows, making them impractical for large environments and complex reasoning tasks.

Method: KeySG represents 3D scenes as hierarchical graphs (floors, rooms, objects, functional elements) augmented with multi-modal information from keyframes selected for optimal coverage. It uses VLM for scene information extraction and hierarchical RAG pipeline for context retrieval.

Result: KeySG outperforms prior approaches across four benchmarks including 3D object segmentation and complex query retrieval, demonstrating superior semantic richness and efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses scalability and semantic limitations of existing 3D scene graph methods, enabling more general task-agnostic reasoning and planning in complex human-centered environments.

Abstract: In recent years, 3D scene graphs have emerged as a powerful world
representation, offering both geometric accuracy and semantic richness.
Combining 3D scene graphs with large language models enables robots to reason,
plan, and navigate in complex human-centered environments. However, current
approaches for constructing 3D scene graphs are semantically limited to a
predefined set of relationships, and their serialization in large environments
can easily exceed an LLM's context window. We introduce KeySG, a framework that
represents 3D scenes as a hierarchical graph consisting of floors, rooms,
objects, and functional elements, where nodes are augmented with multi-modal
information extracted from keyframes selected to optimize geometric and visual
coverage. The keyframes allow us to efficiently leverage VLM to extract scene
information, alleviating the need to explicitly model relationship edges
between objects, enabling more general, task-agnostic reasoning and planning.
Our approach can process complex and ambiguous queries while mitigating the
scalability issues associated with large scene graphs by utilizing a
hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to extract relevant
context from the graph. Evaluated across four distinct benchmarks -- including
3D object segmentation and complex query retrieval -- KeySG outperforms prior
approaches on most metrics, demonstrating its superior semantic richness and
efficiency.

TL;DR: MDS-NeRF is a novel neural radiance field approach for 3D style transfer that uses multi-level feature adaptation and dynamic style injection to better preserve content structure while achieving artistic stylization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NeRF-based style transfer methods integrate style statistics into the original NeRF pipeline, leading to suboptimal results in both content preservation and artistic stylization.

Method: Proposes multi-level feature adaptor to generate multi-level feature grid representation, dynamic style injection module to extract and integrate style features, and multi-level cascade decoder for final stylized view generation. Also supports omni-view style transfer with 3D style references.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate outstanding performance for 3D style transfer, preserving multi-scale spatial structures while effectively transferring stylistic characteristics.

Conclusion: MDS-NeRF successfully reengineers the NeRF pipeline specifically for stylization, achieving superior results in both content preservation and artistic stylization through its multi-level dynamic approach.

Abstract: As the application of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) in various 3D vision
tasks continues to expand, numerous NeRF-based style transfer techniques have
been developed. However, existing methods typically integrate style statistics
into the original NeRF pipeline, often leading to suboptimal results in both
content preservation and artistic stylization. In this paper, we present
multi-level dynamic style transfer for NeRFs (MDS-NeRF), a novel approach that
reengineers the NeRF pipeline specifically for stylization and incorporates an
innovative dynamic style injection module. Particularly, we propose a
multi-level feature adaptor that helps generate a multi-level feature grid
representation from the content radiance field, effectively capturing the
multi-scale spatial structure of the scene. In addition, we present a dynamic
style injection module that learns to extract relevant style features and
adaptively integrates them into the content patterns. The stylized multi-level
features are then transformed into the final stylized view through our proposed
multi-level cascade decoder. Furthermore, we extend our 3D style transfer
method to support omni-view style transfer using 3D style references. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MDS-NeRF achieves outstanding performance for 3D
style transfer, preserving multi-scale spatial structures while effectively
transferring stylistic characteristics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used in autonomous vehicle stacks, but hallucination limits their reliability in safety-critical pipelines, necessitating more robust fusion methods.

Method: The method learns per-model, per-label, context-conditioned reliabilities from labeled history and converts model reports into agreement-guardrailed log-likelihood ratios combined with contextual priors and Shapley-based team credit updates.

Result: The proposed method achieves 23% reduction in Hamming distance, 55% improvement in Macro-F1, and 47% improvement in Micro-F1 compared to the best single model.

Conclusion: VLM fusion serves as a calibrated, interpretable, and robust decision-support component for autonomous vehicle pipelines, effectively addressing hallucination issues while preserving unique correct signals and adapting to drift.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used in
autonomous-vehicle (AV) stacks, but hallucination limits their reliability in
safety-critical pipelines. We present Shapley-credited Context-Aware
Dawid-Skene with Agreement, a game-theoretic fusion method for multi-label
understanding of ego-view dashcam video. It learns per-model, per-label,
context-conditioned reliabilities from labelled history and, at inference,
converts each model's report into an agreement-guardrailed log-likelihood ratio
that is combined with a contextual prior and a public reputation state updated
via Shapley-based team credit. The result is calibrated, thresholdable
posteriors that (i) amplify agreement among reliable models, (ii) preserve
uniquely correct single-model signals, and (iii) adapt to drift. To specialise
general VLMs, we curate 1,000 real-world dashcam clips with structured
annotations (scene description, manoeuvre recommendation, rationale) via an
automatic pipeline that fuses HDD ground truth, vehicle kinematics, and YOLOv11
+ BoT-SORT tracking, guided by a three-step chain-of-thought prompt; three
heterogeneous VLMs are then fine-tuned with LoRA. We evaluate with Hamming
distance, Micro-Macro-F1, and average per-video latency. Empirically, the
proposed method achieves a 23% reduction in Hamming distance, 55% improvement
in Macro-F1, and 47% improvement in Micro-F1 when comparing with the best
single model, supporting VLM fusion as a calibrated, interpretable, and robust
decision-support component for AV pipelines.

Method: Integrates LVLMs with semantic pattern matching and iterative self-questioning refinement using optimized domain-specific prompting and recursive verification.

Result: Achieves 98% accuracy in defect detection, 85%-98% annotation accuracy across four defect categories in balanced settings, and 80%-92% accuracy on imbalanced datasets.

Conclusion: ADPT provides a scalable, cost-effective solution for high-fidelity dataset construction that supports downstream tasks like transfer learning and domain adaptation in structural damage assessment.

Abstract: Automated structural defect annotation is essential for ensuring
infrastructure safety while minimizing the high costs and inefficiencies of
manual labeling. A novel agentic annotation framework, Agent-based Defect
Pattern Tagger (ADPT), is introduced that integrates Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs) with a semantic pattern matching module and an iterative
self-questioning refinement mechanism. By leveraging optimized domain-specific
prompting and a recursive verification process, ADPT transforms raw visual data
into high-quality, semantically labeled defect datasets without any manual
supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that ADPT achieves up to 98%
accuracy in distinguishing defective from non-defective images, and 85%-98%
annotation accuracy across four defect categories under class-balanced
settings, with 80%-92% accuracy on class-imbalanced datasets. The framework
offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for high-fidelity dataset
construction, providing strong support for downstream tasks such as transfer
learning and domain adaptation in structural damage assessment.

*Yunbo Xu,Xuesong Zhang,Jia Li,Zhenzhen Hu,Richang Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COFA is a vision-language navigation strategy that uses foreground-background feature augmentation to improve navigational generalization by leveraging semantic cues from foreground and spatial connectivity from background.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLN approaches underutilize the distinct roles of foreground (semantic cues) and background (spatial connectivity) in visual observations, limiting navigational generalization.

Method: Proposes COFA with semantically-enhanced landmark identification to disentangle foreground/background features, followed by consensus-driven online augmentation that consolidates two-stage voting on feature preferences based on instructions and locations.

Result: Experiments on REVERIE and R2R benchmarks show improved generalization of baseline models and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Online foreground-background feature augmentation effectively enhances VLN agent generalization by leveraging complementary visual information from different scene regions.

Abstract: Following language instructions, vision-language navigation (VLN) agents are
tasked with navigating unseen environments. While augmenting multifaceted
visual representations has propelled advancements in VLN, the significance of
foreground and background in visual observations remains underexplored.
Intuitively, foreground regions provide semantic cues, whereas the background
encompasses spatial connectivity information. Inspired on this insight, we
propose a Consensus-driven Online Feature Augmentation strategy (COFA) with
alternative foreground and background features to facilitate the navigable
generalization. Specifically, we first leverage semantically-enhanced landmark
identification to disentangle foreground and background as candidate augmented
features. Subsequently, a consensus-driven online augmentation strategy
encourages the agent to consolidate two-stage voting results on feature
preferences according to diverse instructions and navigational locations.
Experiments on REVERIE and R2R demonstrate that our online
foreground-background augmentation boosts the generalization of baseline and
attains state-of-the-art performance.

*Klara Janouskova,Cristian Gavrus,Jiri Matas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RCOR is a novel approach that achieves both robustness and context-awareness in visual recognition by treating localization as integral to recognition, decoupling object-centric and context-aware modeling, and using robust non-parametric fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard supervised learning often leads to over-reliance on background context (shortcut learning), limiting model robustness. Existing approaches suppress background at the cost of losing valuable context information.

Method: RCOR treats localization as integral to recognition to decouple object-centric and context-aware modeling, followed by robust non-parametric fusion. It enables localization before recognition even in complex scenes.

Result: RCOR improves performance of both supervised models and VLMs on datasets with in-domain and out-of-domain backgrounds, even without fine-tuning. It works effectively on complex scenes like ImageNet-1k.

Conclusion: RCOR is the first approach that jointly achieves robustness and context-awareness without compromising either, demonstrating that localization before recognition is now feasible even in complex visual scenes.

Abstract: In visual recognition, both the object of interest (referred to as
foreground, FG, for simplicity) and its surrounding context (background, BG)
play an important role. However, standard supervised learning often leads to
unintended over-reliance on the BG, known as shortcut learning of spurious
correlations, limiting model robustness in real-world deployment settings. In
the literature, the problem is mainly addressed by suppressing the BG,
sacrificing context information for improved generalization.
  We propose RCOR -- Robust Context-Aware Object Recognition -- the first
approach that jointly achieves robustness and context-awareness without
compromising either. RCOR treats localization as an integral part of
recognition to decouple object-centric and context-aware modelling, followed by
a robust, non-parametric fusion. It improves the performance of both supervised
models and VLM on datasets with both in-domain and out-of-domain BG, even
without fine-tuning. The results confirm that localization before recognition
is now possible even in complex scenes as in ImageNet-1k.

*Mengfei Xia,Nan Xue,Jiapeng Zhu,Yujun Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using an unconditional discriminator (UCD) in GAN training to improve Nash equilibrium and prevent mode collapse by forcing the discriminator to extract more comprehensive features without condition injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAN training often fails to converge properly and suffers from mode collapse due to redundant shortcuts when condition information is input to the discriminator, which prevents meaningful knowledge extraction.

Method: Employ an unconditional discriminator (UCD) where the discriminator is enforced to extract comprehensive and robust features without condition injection, promoting better Nash equilibrium and knowledge supervision for the generator.

Result: Achieved 1.47 FID on ImageNet-64 dataset, surpassing StyleGAN-XL and state-of-the-art one-step diffusion models with significant performance improvements and high efficiency.

Conclusion: UCD provides theoretical compatibility with vanilla GAN theory and can be implemented as a plug-in solution, offering substantial improvements in GAN training convergence and performance.

Abstract: Adversarial training turns out to be the key to one-step generation,
especially for Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and diffusion model
distillation. Yet in practice, GAN training hardly converges properly and
struggles in mode collapse. In this work, we quantitatively analyze the extent
of Nash equilibrium in GAN training, and conclude that redundant shortcuts by
inputting condition in $D$ disables meaningful knowledge extraction. We thereby
propose to employ an unconditional discriminator (UCD), in which $D$ is
enforced to extract more comprehensive and robust features with no condition
injection. In this way, $D$ is able to leverage better knowledge to supervise
$G$, which promotes Nash equilibrium in GAN literature. Theoretical guarantee
on compatibility with vanilla GAN theory indicates that UCD can be implemented
in a plug-in manner. Extensive experiments confirm the significant performance
improvements with high efficiency. For instance, we achieved \textbf{1.47 FID}
on the ImageNet-64 dataset, surpassing StyleGAN-XL and several state-of-the-art
one-step diffusion models. The code will be made publicly available.

*Yannick Hauri,Luca A. Lanzendörfer,Till Aczel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces virtual fashion photo-shoot, a new task that transforms standardized garment images into editorial fashion imagery with dynamic poses, diverse locations, and visual narratives, using a novel dataset of garment-lookbook pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fashion image generation focuses on narrow tasks like virtual try-on in clean studio environments, missing the richness of editorial fashion with its dynamic poses, diverse locations, and visual storytelling elements.

Method: Created a large-scale dataset of garment-lookbook pairs using an automated retrieval pipeline that combines visual-language reasoning with object-level localization to align garments across e-commerce and fashion media domains. The dataset includes three quality levels: high (10,000 pairs), medium (50,000 pairs), and low (300,000 pairs).

Result: Developed the first large-scale dataset specifically designed for virtual fashion photo-shoot tasks, enabling models to move beyond catalog-style generation toward more creative and atmospheric fashion imagery.

Conclusion: The proposed virtual fashion photo-shoot task and accompanying dataset provide a foundation for generating fashion imagery that captures the creativity, atmosphere, and storytelling elements characteristic of editorial fashion photography.

Abstract: Fashion image generation has so far focused on narrow tasks such as virtual
try-on, where garments appear in clean studio environments. In contrast,
editorial fashion presents garments through dynamic poses, diverse locations,
and carefully crafted visual narratives. We introduce the task of virtual
fashion photo-shoot, which seeks to capture this richness by transforming
standardized garment images into contextually grounded editorial imagery. To
enable this new direction, we construct the first large-scale dataset of
garment-lookbook pairs, bridging the gap between e-commerce and fashion media.
Because such pairs are not readily available, we design an automated retrieval
pipeline that aligns garments across domains, combining visual-language
reasoning with object-level localization. We construct a dataset with three
garment-lookbook pair accuracy levels: high quality (10,000 pairs), medium
quality (50,000 pairs), and low quality (300,000 pairs). This dataset offers a
foundation for models that move beyond catalog-style generation and toward
fashion imagery that reflects creativity, atmosphere, and storytelling.

*Jiayao Jiang,Siran Peng,Bin Liu,Qi Chu,Nenghai Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes LAKAN, a landmark-assisted adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for deepfake detection that uses facial landmarks to guide attention to critical regions with forgery artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNN and Transformer methods need improvement in modeling complex non-linear forgery artifacts in deepfakes.

Method: Uses KAN with learnable splines instead of fixed activations, enhanced with LAKAN module that leverages facial landmarks as structural priors to generate instance-specific parameters and guide attention to artifact-rich facial regions.

Result: Achieves superior performance on multiple public datasets compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The combination of geometric priors (facial landmarks) with KAN's adaptive learning creates an effective deepfake detection approach that focuses on the most informative facial regions.

Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake generation techniques necessitates robust
face forgery detection algorithms. While methods based on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformers are effective, there is still room for
improvement in modeling the highly complex and non-linear nature of forgery
artifacts. To address this issue, we propose a novel detection method based on
the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). By replacing fixed activation functions
with learnable splines, our KAN-based approach is better suited to this
challenge. Furthermore, to guide the network's focus towards critical facial
areas, we introduce a Landmark-assisted Adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Network
(LAKAN) module. This module uses facial landmarks as a structural prior to
dynamically generate the internal parameters of the KAN, creating an
instance-specific signal that steers a general-purpose image encoder towards
the most informative facial regions with artifacts. This core innovation
creates a powerful combination between geometric priors and the network's
learning process. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that
our proposed method achieves superior performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReFlux is a novel concept attack method designed to test the robustness of concept erasure techniques in next-generation rectified flow transformers like Flux, using reverse-attention optimization and velocity guidance to reactivate suppressed concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept erasure methods and attack evaluations are tailored for Stable Diffusion and show limited effectiveness when transferred to newer rectified flow transformers like Flux, creating a need for specialized attack methods to assess erasure robustness in these advanced frameworks.

Method: The approach uses a reverse-attention optimization strategy to reactivate suppressed signals while stabilizing attention, reinforced by a velocity-guided dynamic that enhances concept reactivation by steering flow matching, and a consistency-preserving objective to maintain global layout and unrelated content.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReFlux is effective and efficient in attacking concept erasure in rectified flow transformers, establishing a reliable benchmark for evaluating erasure robustness.

Conclusion: ReFlux successfully addresses the gap in concept attack methods for rectified flow transformers and provides the first specialized tool for assessing concept erasure robustness in these next-generation T2I frameworks.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled
impressive generative capabilities, but they also raise significant safety
concerns due to the potential to produce harmful or undesirable content. While
concept erasure has been explored as a mitigation strategy, most existing
approaches and corresponding attack evaluations are tailored to Stable
Diffusion (SD) and exhibit limited effectiveness when transferred to
next-generation rectified flow transformers such as Flux. In this work, we
present ReFlux, the first concept attack method specifically designed to assess
the robustness of concept erasure in the latest rectified flow-based T2I
framework. Our approach is motivated by the observation that existing concept
erasure techniques, when applied to Flux, fundamentally rely on a phenomenon
known as attention localization. Building on this insight, we propose a simple
yet effective attack strategy that specifically targets this property. At its
core, a reverse-attention optimization strategy is introduced to effectively
reactivate suppressed signals while stabilizing attention. This is further
reinforced by a velocity-guided dynamic that enhances the robustness of concept
reactivation by steering the flow matching process, and a
consistency-preserving objective that maintains the global layout and preserves
unrelated content. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed attack method, establishing a
reliable benchmark for evaluating the robustness of concept erasure strategies
in rectified flow transformers.

Motivation: Multi-sensor fusion is needed for robust autonomous vehicle perception, combining camera semantic information with radar distance measurements cost-effectively. Current map segmentation faces challenges in accuracy and real-time performance.

Method: Proposes a real-time BEV map segmentation architecture using camera-radar fusion, featuring an advanced loss set and lightweight head to improve perception while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: The approach successfully balances high accuracy, per-class balancing, and real-time performance, setting new benchmarks for efficient map segmentation in autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles is becoming more common to offer a
more robust alternative for several perception tasks. This need arises from the
unique contribution of each sensor in collecting data: camera-radar fusion
offers a cost-effective solution by combining rich semantic information from
cameras with accurate distance measurements from radar, without incurring
excessive financial costs or overwhelming data processing requirements. Map
segmentation is a critical task for enabling effective vehicle behaviour in its
environment, yet it continues to face significant challenges in achieving high
accuracy and meeting real-time performance requirements. Therefore, this work
presents a novel and efficient map segmentation architecture, using cameras and
radars, in the \acrfull{bev} space. Our model introduces a real-time map
segmentation architecture considering aspects such as high accuracy, per-class
balancing, and inference time. To accomplish this, we use an advanced loss set
together with a new lightweight head to improve the perception results. Our
results show that, with these modifications, our approach achieves results
comparable to large models, reaching 53.5 mIoU, while also setting a new
benchmark for inference time, improving it by 260\% over the strongest baseline
models.

TL;DR: Proposes SpecMCD, a weakly supervised cloud detection method combining spectral features and multi-scale scene-level deep networks to generate accurate pixel-level cloud masks from optical satellite images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clouds degrade optical satellite image quality, limiting applications. Current deep learning methods struggle with thin clouds and low-quality training samples, needing improved accuracy.

Method: Uses progressive training with multi-scale scene-level dataset, combines multi-scale probability maps with cloud thickness maps, and applies adaptive thresholds with distance-weighted optimization.

Result: Tested on WDCD and GF1MS-WHU datasets (60 GF1-MS images), SpecMCD achieved over 7.82% F1-score improvement compared to other weakly supervised methods like WDCD and WSFNet.

Conclusion: SpecMCD demonstrates superior performance for cloud detection under various cloud coverage conditions, showing strong potential for practical applications.

Abstract: Clouds significantly affect the quality of optical satellite images, which
seriously limits their precise application. Recently, deep learning has been
widely applied to cloud detection and has achieved satisfactory results.
However, the lack of distinctive features in thin clouds and the low quality of
training samples limit the cloud detection accuracy of deep learning methods,
leaving space for further improvements. In this paper, we propose a weakly
supervised cloud detection method that combines spectral features and
multi-scale scene-level deep network (SpecMCD) to obtain highly accurate
pixel-level cloud masks. The method first utilizes a progressive training
framework with a multi-scale scene-level dataset to train the multi-scale
scene-level cloud detection network. Pixel-level cloud probability maps are
then obtained by combining the multi-scale probability maps and cloud thickness
map based on the characteristics of clouds in dense cloud coverage and large
cloud-area coverage images. Finally, adaptive thresholds are generated based on
the differentiated regions of the scene-level cloud masks at different scales
and combined with distance-weighted optimization to obtain binary cloud masks.
Two datasets, WDCD and GF1MS-WHU, comprising a total of 60 Gaofen-1
multispectral (GF1-MS) images, were used to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed method. Compared to the other weakly supervised cloud detection
methods such as WDCD and WSFNet, the F1-score of the proposed SpecMCD method
shows an improvement of over 7.82%, highlighting the superiority and potential
of the SpecMCD method for cloud detection under different cloud coverage
conditions.

*Beomsu Kim,Byunghee Cha,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Align Your Tangent (AYT), a method that uses manifold feature distance (MFD) loss to accelerate Consistency Models training by aligning update directions toward the data manifold, enabling faster training with smaller batch sizes while maintaining sample quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Consistency Models (CMs) enable fast one or two-step diffusion sampling but require prolonged training with large batch sizes to achieve competitive sample quality. The authors discovered that CM training dynamics near convergence exhibit oscillatory tangents that move parallel to the data manifold rather than toward it.

Method: The authors propose a manifold feature distance (MFD) loss function that provides manifold-aligned tangents pointing toward the data manifold. This AYT method mitigates oscillatory training dynamics by aligning update directions with the data manifold structure.

Result: AYT accelerates CM training by orders of magnitude and even outperforms the LPIPS metric. The method enables training with extremely small batch sizes without compromising sample quality, addressing the key limitations of traditional CM training.

Conclusion: The AYT method with MFD loss successfully addresses oscillatory training dynamics in Consistency Models, enabling significantly faster training with smaller batch sizes while maintaining or improving sample quality compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: With diffusion and flow matching models achieving state-of-the-art generating
performance, the interest of the community now turned to reducing the inference
time without sacrificing sample quality. Consistency Models (CMs), which are
trained to be consistent on diffusion or probability flow ordinary differential
equation (PF-ODE) trajectories, enable one or two-step flow or diffusion
sampling. However, CMs typically require prolonged training with large batch
sizes to obtain competitive sample quality. In this paper, we examine the
training dynamics of CMs near convergence and discover that CM tangents -- CM
output update directions -- are quite oscillatory, in the sense that they move
parallel to the data manifold, not towards the manifold. To mitigate
oscillatory tangents, we propose a new loss function, called the manifold
feature distance (MFD), which provides manifold-aligned tangents that point
toward the data manifold. Consequently, our method -- dubbed Align Your Tangent
(AYT) -- can accelerate CM training by orders of magnitude and even out-perform
the learned perceptual image patch similarity metric (LPIPS). Furthermore, we
find that our loss enables training with extremely small batch sizes without
compromising sample quality. Code: https://github.com/1202kbs/AYT

*Huaying Li,Liansheng Wang,Yinran Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes U2-rPCA, an unsupervised unfolded robust PCA method for ultrasound clutter filtering that preserves interpretability and doesn't require ground truth labels, achieving 2-10 dB CNR improvement in power Doppler imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing clutter filtering methods (SVD, rPCA) have limitations in feature modeling and tissue-blood flow separation. Supervised deep learning methods face interpretability issues and lack of ground truth labels for training.

Method: Unfolds iteratively reweighted least squares rPCA with intrinsic low-rank and sparse regularization, adds sparse-enhancement unit to capture micro-flow signals, and trains adaptively on part of image sequence for subsequent frames.

Result: Outperformed SVD-based method, rPCA baseline, and another deep learning filter on in-silico and in-vivo datasets, improving contrast-to-noise ratio by 2-10 dB in power Doppler images.

Conclusion: U2-rPCA successfully addresses interpretability and ground truth challenges in ultrasound clutter filtering while achieving superior performance in microvascular imaging.

Abstract: High-sensitivity clutter filtering is a fundamental step in ultrasound
microvascular imaging. Singular value decomposition (SVD) and robust principal
component analysis (rPCA) are the main clutter filtering strategies. However,
both strategies are limited in feature modeling and tissue-blood flow
separation for high-quality microvascular imaging. Recently, deep
learning-based clutter filtering has shown potential in more thoroughly
separating tissue and blood flow signals. However, the existing supervised
filters face the challenges of interpretability and lack of in-vitro and
in-vivo ground truths. While the interpretability issue can be addressed by
algorithm deep unfolding, the training ground truth remains unsolved. To this
end, this paper proposes an unsupervised unfolded rPCA (U2-rPCA) method that
preserves mathematical interpretability and is insusceptible to learning
labels. Specifically, U2-rPCA is unfolded from an iteratively reweighted least
squares (IRLS) rPCA baseline with intrinsic low-rank and sparse regularization.
A sparse-enhancement unit is added to the network to strengthen its capability
to capture the sparse micro-flow signals. U2-rPCA is like an adaptive filter
that is trained with part of the image sequence and then used for the following
frames. Experimental validations on a in-silico dataset and public in-vivo
datasets demonstrated the outperformance of U2-rPCA when compared with the
SVD-based method, the rPCA baseline, and another deep learning-based filter.
Particularly, the proposed method improved the contrastto-noise ratio (CNR) of
the power Doppler image by 2 dB to 10 dB when compared with other methods.
Furthermore, the effectiveness of the building modules of U2-rPCA was validated
through ablation studies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for brain vessel segmentation that uses image-to-image translation and disentanglement techniques to handle multiple imaging modalities and domains without requiring domain-specific models or data harmonization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain vessel morphology is complex and current segmentation models are limited to single imaging modalities, but comprehensive cerebrovascular understanding requires multi-modal analysis across different acquisition procedures.

Method: Employ disentanglement techniques to independently manipulate image properties, focusing on vessel appearance adaptation while preserving spatial information (shapes and locations) crucial for segmentation. Uses image-to-image translation to bridge domain gaps.

Result: Effectively bridges large domain gaps across medical centers, image modalities, and vessel types. Framework demonstrates robustness and versatility in cerebrovascular segmentation across multiple scenarios.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation methodologies show strong potential for accurate cerebrovascular image segmentation in diverse scenarios, enabling multi-modal analysis without domain-specific model design.

Abstract: The intricate morphology of brain vessels poses significant challenges for
automatic segmentation models, which usually focus on a single imaging
modality. However, accurately treating brain-related conditions requires a
comprehensive understanding of the cerebrovascular tree, regardless of the
specific acquisition procedure. Our framework effectively segments brain
arteries and veins in various datasets through image-to-image translation while
avoiding domain-specific model design and data harmonization between the source
and the target domain. This is accomplished by employing disentanglement
techniques to independently manipulate different image properties, allowing
them to move from one domain to another in a label-preserving manner.
Specifically, we focus on manipulating vessel appearances during adaptation
while preserving spatial information, such as shapes and locations, which are
crucial for correct segmentation. Our evaluation effectively bridges large and
varied domain gaps across medical centers, image modalities, and vessel types.
Additionally, we conduct ablation studies on the optimal number of required
annotations and other architectural choices. The results highlight our
framework's robustness and versatility, demonstrating the potential of domain
adaptation methodologies to perform cerebrovascular image segmentation in
multiple scenarios accurately. Our code is available at

Motivation: Current generative AI approaches overlook geometric structure and treat image manifolds as uniform distributions, failing to properly capture the inherent low-dimensional nature of images embedded in high-dimensional spaces.

Method: Developed a geometric framework with kernel-based probabilistic methods that unifies geometric and probabilistic perspectives, interpreting diffusion models as projection mechanisms onto image manifolds, resulting in the Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM).

Result: The Latent MPPM (LMPPM) outperforms Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) across various datasets, achieving superior performance in both image restoration and generation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed geometric-probabilistic framework successfully unifies geometric structure with probabilistic methods, providing better theoretical understanding of diffusion models and leading to improved performance in generative tasks.

Abstract: The foundational premise of generative AI for images is the assumption that
images are inherently low-dimensional objects embedded within a
high-dimensional space. Additionally, it is often implicitly assumed that
thematic image datasets form smooth or piecewise smooth manifolds. Common
approaches overlook the geometric structure and focus solely on probabilistic
methods, approximating the probability distribution through universal
approximation techniques such as the kernel method. In some generative models,
the low dimensional nature of the data manifest itself by the introduction of a
lower dimensional latent space. Yet, the probability distribution in the latent
or the manifold coordinate space is considered uninteresting and is predefined
or considered uniform. This study unifies the geometric and probabilistic
perspectives by providing a geometric framework and a kernel-based
probabilistic method simultaneously. The resulting framework demystifies
diffusion models by interpreting them as a projection mechanism onto the
manifold of ``good images''. This interpretation leads to the construction of a
new deterministic model, the Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM),
which operates in both the representation (pixel) space and the latent space.
We demonstrate that the Latent MPPM (LMPPM) outperforms the Latent Diffusion
Model (LDM) across various datasets, achieving superior results in terms of
image restoration and generation.

### [57] [Beyond one-hot encoding? Journey into compact encoding for large multi-class segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00667)
*Aaron Kujawa,Thomas Booth,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores binary encoding methods to reduce computational complexity in medical image segmentation with many classes, but finds they underperform compared to standard one-hot encoding despite efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational and memory challenges of medical image segmentation with large numbers of classes, where standard one-hot encoding scales linearly with class count.

Method: Proposed binary encoding approaches including vanilla binary encoding, error-correcting output codes (ECOCs), class weighting, hard/soft decoding, class-to-codeword assignment, and label embedding trees to reduce complexity to logarithmic scaling.

Result: Binary encoding methods achieved significantly lower performance (DSC 39.3-73.8) compared to one-hot encoding (DSC 82.4) in whole brain parcellation with 108 classes, despite computational efficiency gains.

Conclusion: While binary encodings offer computational advantages, they currently fail to match state-of-the-art segmentation quality, highlighting the need for future research on compact encoding strategies for large multi-class segmentation.

Abstract: This work presents novel methods to reduce computational and memory
requirements for medical image segmentation with a large number of classes. We
curiously observe challenges in maintaining state-of-the-art segmentation
performance with all of the explored options. Standard learning-based methods
typically employ one-hot encoding of class labels. The computational complexity
and memory requirements thus increase linearly with the number of classes. We
propose a family of binary encoding approaches instead of one-hot encoding to
reduce the computational complexity and memory requirements to logarithmic in
the number of classes. In addition to vanilla binary encoding, we investigate
the effects of error-correcting output codes (ECOCs), class weighting,
hard/soft decoding, class-to-codeword assignment, and label embedding trees. We
apply the methods to the use case of whole brain parcellation with 108 classes
based on 3D MRI images. While binary encodings have proven efficient in
so-called extreme classification problems in computer vision, we faced
challenges in reaching state-of-the-art segmentation quality with binary
encodings. Compared to one-hot encoding (Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) =
82.4 (2.8)), we report reduced segmentation performance with the binary
segmentation approaches, achieving DSCs in the range from 39.3 to 73.8.
Informative negative results all too often go unpublished. We hope that this
work inspires future research of compact encoding strategies for large
multi-class segmentation tasks.

### [58] [Adaptive Event Stream Slicing for Open-Vocabulary Event-Based Object Detection via Vision-Language Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00681)
*Jinchang Zhang,Zijun Li,Jiakai Lin,Guoyu Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an event-image knowledge distillation framework using CLIP to enable open-vocabulary object detection on event data, overcoming modality gaps through spatial attention-based distillation and a hybrid SNN-CNN architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras offer advantages for object detection but lack texture/color information, making open-vocabulary detection challenging. Current methods are limited to predefined categories and cannot generalize to novel objects. Direct CLIP transfer fails due to modality gap between images and event streams.

Method: Uses image frames as teacher model inputs to guide event-based student model via spatial attention-based knowledge distillation. Implements hybrid SNN-CNN framework where SNN adaptively determines optimal event segmentation moments to preserve temporal information, and CNNs process extracted features for detection.

Result: The framework enables the student network to learn meaningful visual features from raw event inputs while inheriting CLIP's broad visual knowledge, overcoming the modality gap between images and event data.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully bridges the modality gap for open-vocabulary object detection on event data through knowledge distillation and adaptive temporal feature extraction, enabling generalization to novel objects without direct CLIP training on event streams.

Abstract: Event cameras offer advantages in object detection tasks due to high-speed
response, low latency, and robustness to motion blur. However, event cameras
lack texture and color information, making open-vocabulary detection
particularly challenging. Current event-based detection methods are typically
trained on predefined categories, limiting their ability to generalize to novel
objects, where encountering previously unseen objects is common.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary object detection in
RGB images. However, the modality gap between images and event streams makes it
ineffective to directly transfer CLIP to event data, as CLIP was not designed
for event streams. To bridge this gap, we propose an event-image knowledge
distillation framework that leverages CLIP's semantic understanding to achieve
open-vocabulary object detection on event data. Instead of training CLIP
directly on event streams, we use image frames as inputs to a teacher model,
guiding the event-based student model to learn CLIP's rich visual
representations. Through spatial attention-based distillation, the student
network learns meaningful visual features directly from raw event inputs while
inheriting CLIP's broad visual knowledge. Furthermore, to prevent information
loss due to event data segmentation, we design a hybrid spiking neural network
(SNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. Unlike fixed-group
event segmentation methods, which often discard crucial temporal information,
our SNN adaptively determines the optimal event segmentation moments, ensuring
that key temporal features are extracted. The extracted event features are then
processed by CNNs for object detection.

*Steffen Meinert,Philipp Schlinge,Nils Strodthoff,Martin Atzmueller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes ProtoMask, a novel model architecture that uses image segmentation foundation models to improve the truthfulness of prototype-based XAI methods by restricting saliency map computation to predefined semantic image patches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prototype-based XAI methods rely on post-hoc saliency techniques that have reliability and quality issues. The authors aim to improve the mapping between embedding and input space for more truthful explanations.

Method: ProtoMask uses image segmentation foundation models to generate segmentation masks, crops images using bounding boxes from each mask, and processes each mask as individual input to restrict saliency computation to semantic patches.

Result: Experiments on three fine-grained classification datasets show competitive performance compared to other models, with unique explainability features demonstrated through comprehensive metrics.

Conclusion: ProtoMask provides improved explainability truthfulness by leveraging segmentation models to constrain saliency visualization to meaningful semantic regions, offering a promising approach for more reliable XAI.

Abstract: XAI gained considerable importance in recent years. Methods based on
prototypical case-based reasoning have shown a promising improvement in
explainability. However, these methods typically rely on additional post-hoc
saliency techniques to explain the semantics of learned prototypes. Multiple
critiques have been raised about the reliability and quality of such
techniques. For this reason, we study the use of prominent image segmentation
foundation models to improve the truthfulness of the mapping between embedding
and input space. We aim to restrict the computation area of the saliency map to
a predefined semantic image patch to reduce the uncertainty of such
visualizations. To perceive the information of an entire image, we use the
bounding box from each generated segmentation mask to crop the image. Each mask
results in an individual input in our novel model architecture named ProtoMask.
We conduct experiments on three popular fine-grained classification datasets
with a wide set of metrics, providing a detailed overview on explainability
characteristics. The comparison with other popular models demonstrates
competitive performance and unique explainability features of our model.

*Jiakai Lin,Jinchang Zhang,Guoyu Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoE-SGT enhances Concept Bottleneck Models by incorporating structured concept relationships through graph transformers and a Mixture of Experts module, achieving higher accuracy on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of traditional CBMs which are single-modal and ignore structured concept relationships, particularly important for interpretability in high-stakes domains.

Method: Constructs answer-concept and answer-question graphs for multimodal inputs, integrates Graph Transformer to capture multi-level dependencies, and replaces feed-forward layers with Mixture of Experts module for dynamic expert selection.

Result: Achieves higher accuracy than other concept bottleneck networks on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: MoE-SGT successfully overcomes limitations of traditional CBMs by modeling structured concept relationships and utilizing dynamic expert selection, enhancing adaptability to complex concept reasoning.

Abstract: With growing demand for interpretability in deep learning, especially in high
stakes domains, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) address this by inserting
human understandable concepts into the prediction pipeline, but they are
generally single modal and ignore structured concept relationships. To overcome
these limitations, we present MoE-SGT, a reasoning driven framework that
augments CBMs with a structure injecting Graph Transformer and a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) module. We construct answer-concept and answer-question graphs
for multimodal inputs to explicitly model the structured relationships among
concepts. Subsequently, we integrate Graph Transformer to capture multi level
dependencies, addressing the limitations of traditional Concept Bottleneck
Models in modeling concept interactions. However, it still encounters
bottlenecks in adapting to complex concept patterns. Therefore, we replace the
feed forward layers with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) module, enabling the model
to have greater capacity in learning diverse concept relationships while
dynamically allocating reasoning tasks to different sub experts, thereby
significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to complex concept reasoning.
MoE-SGT achieves higher accuracy than other concept bottleneck networks on
multiple datasets by modeling structured relationships among concepts and
utilizing a dynamic expert selection mechanism.

### [61] [Training-free Uncertainty Guidance for Complex Visual Tasks with MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00705)
*Sanghwan Kim,Rui Xiao,Stephan Alaniz,Yongqin Xian,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free framework that uses MLLMs' intrinsic uncertainty as guidance to enhance fine-grained perception in visual tasks, achieving competitive performance without task-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with fine-grained perception like identifying small objects or key moments in videos, and existing methods require complicated task-specific fine-tuning that limits generalizability.

Method: Proposes using MLLMs' output entropy as a proactive guidance signal - entropy decreases with relevant visual information. Introduces a unified mechanism that scores candidate visual inputs by response uncertainty, enabling autonomous focus on salient data.

Result: Applied to Visual Search, Long Video Understanding, and Temporal Grounding tasks, achieving performance competitive with specialized fine-tuned methods using off-the-shelf MLLMs.

Conclusion: Harnessing intrinsic uncertainty is a powerful, general strategy for enhancing fine-grained multimodal performance without requiring training or task-specific modifications.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often struggle with fine-grained
perception, such as identifying small objects in high-resolution images or
finding key moments in long videos. Existing works typically rely on
complicated, task-specific fine-tuning, which limits their generalizability and
increases model complexity. In this work, we propose an effective,
training-free framework that uses an MLLM's intrinsic uncertainty as a
proactive guidance signal. Our core insight is that a model's output entropy
decreases when presented with relevant visual information. We introduce a
unified mechanism that scores candidate visual inputs by response uncertainty,
enabling the model to autonomously focus on the most salient data. We apply
this simple principle to three complex visual tasks: Visual Search, Long Video
Understanding, and Temporal Grounding, allowing off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve
performance competitive with specialized, fine-tuned methods. Our work
validates that harnessing intrinsic uncertainty is a powerful, general strategy
for enhancing fine-grained multimodal performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning pipeline for fast, robust motion correction in stress perfusion CMR that replaces slow traditional registration methods with efficient one-shot estimation, improving temporal alignment and reducing processing time 15-fold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional registration-based motion correction methods for quantitative stress perfusion CMR are slow and sensitive to acquisition variability, limiting robustness and scalability of clinical adoption.

Method: Unsupervised deep learning pipeline using one-shot estimation instead of iterative registration, with three-step motion correction and robust principal component analysis to reduce contrast effects. Trained on multivendor data from 201 patients.

Result: Significantly improved temporal smoothness (p<0.001), comparable myocardial alignment (Dice 0.92 vs 0.91 baseline), reduced motion in perfusion maps, and 15-fold processing time reduction.

Conclusion: The deep learning pipeline enables fast, robust motion correction for stress perfusion CMR, improving accuracy across images and potentially facilitating broader clinical adoption of quantitative perfusion imaging.

Abstract: Background: Quantitative stress perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance
(CMR) is a powerful tool for assessing myocardial ischemia. Motion correction
is essential for accurate pixel-wise mapping but traditional registration-based
methods are slow and sensitive to acquisition variability, limiting robustness
and scalability.
  Methods: We developed an unsupervised deep learning-based motion correction
pipeline that replaces iterative registration with efficient one-shot
estimation. The method corrects motion in three steps and uses robust principal
component analysis to reduce contrast-related effects. It aligns the perfusion
series and auxiliary images (arterial input function and proton
density-weighted series). Models were trained and validated on multivendor data
from 201 patients, with 38 held out for testing. Performance was assessed via
temporal alignment and quantitative perfusion values, compared to a previously
published registration-based method.
  Results: The deep learning approach significantly improved temporal
smoothness of time-intensity curves (p<0.001). Myocardial alignment (Dice =
0.92 (0.04) and 0.91 (0.05)) was comparable to the baseline and superior to
before registration (Dice = 0.80 (0.09), p<0.001). Perfusion maps showed
reduced motion, with lower standard deviation in the myocardium (0.52 (0.39)
ml/min/g) compared to baseline (0.55 (0.44) ml/min/g). Processing time was
reduced 15-fold.
  Conclusion: This deep learning pipeline enables fast, robust motion
correction for stress perfusion CMR, improving accuracy across dynamic and
auxiliary images. Trained on multivendor data, it generalizes across sequences
and may facilitate broader clinical adoption of quantitative perfusion imaging.

*Annemarie Hoffsommer,Helen Schneider,Svetlana Pavlitska,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that emotion prediction using only 12 EEG channels achieves 91.57% accuracy, which is comparable to state-of-the-art results using 32 channels (96.9%), enabling effective low-cost EEG devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate emotion prediction using low-cost EEG devices with reduced channel counts, addressing the complexity and resource-intensity of full EEG measurements while maintaining prediction quality.

Method: Used Continuous Wavelet Transformation to convert EEG data from DEAP dataset into scaleograms, then trained a vision transformer (ViT) model for emotion classification using only 12 channels.

Result: Achieved 91.57% accuracy in predicting 4 emotion quadrants (high/low arousal and valence) with only 12 EEG channels, compared to 96.9% accuracy with 32 channels.

Conclusion: Significant reduction of EEG input channels (from 32 to 12) can yield high emotion prediction accuracy, making low-cost EEG devices viable for practical emotion recognition applications.

Abstract: Accurately predicting emotions from brain signals has the potential to
achieve goals such as improving mental health, human-computer interaction, and
affective computing. Emotion prediction through neural signals offers a
promising alternative to traditional methods, such as self-assessment and
facial expression analysis, which can be subjective or ambiguous. Measurements
of the brain activity via electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a more direct and
unbiased data source. However, conducting a full EEG is a complex,
resource-intensive process, leading to the rise of low-cost EEG devices with
simplified measurement capabilities. This work examines how subsets of EEG
channels from the DEAP dataset can be used for sufficiently accurate emotion
prediction with low-cost EEG devices, rather than fully equipped
EEG-measurements. Using Continuous Wavelet Transformation to convert EEG data
into scaleograms, we trained a vision transformer (ViT) model for emotion
classification. The model achieved over 91,57% accuracy in predicting 4
quadrants (high/low per arousal and valence) with only 12 measuring points
(also referred to as channels). Our work shows clearly, that a significant
reduction of input channels yields high results compared to state-of-the-art
results of 96,9% with 32 channels. Training scripts to reproduce our code can

*Hongeun Kim,Bryan Sangwoo Kim,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a framework for Extreme Blind Image Restoration (EBIR) that decomposes the restoration process into two steps: first mapping extremely low-quality images to an intermediate less-degraded manifold, then using existing BIR models for final restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Blind Image Restoration methods fail with extreme degradations due to the massive domain gap between extremely low-quality and high-quality images, leading to artifacts and detail loss.

Method: Learn a projector to map ELQ images to intermediate LQ manifold, then use frozen off-the-shelf BIR models for final restoration. Uses information theory perspective with Information Bottleneck objective to stabilize training.

Result: Framework enables effective restoration under severe degradation regimes, supports plug-and-play enhancement of existing models without finetuning, and allows inference-time prompt refinement.

Conclusion: The proposed decomposition approach effectively addresses EBIR challenges by bridging the domain gap through intermediate representations, providing a theoretically-grounded solution for extreme image restoration scenarios.

Abstract: Blind Image Restoration (BIR) methods have achieved remarkable success but
falter when faced with Extreme Blind Image Restoration (EBIR), where inputs
suffer from severe, compounded degradations beyond their training scope.
Directly learning a mapping from extremely low-quality (ELQ) to high-quality
(HQ) images is challenging due to the massive domain gap, often leading to
unnatural artifacts and loss of detail. To address this, we propose a novel
framework that decomposes the intractable ELQ-to-HQ restoration process. We
first learn a projector that maps an ELQ image onto an intermediate,
less-degraded LQ manifold. This intermediate image is then restored to HQ using
a frozen, off-the-shelf BIR model. Our approach is grounded in information
theory; we provide a novel perspective of image restoration as an Information
Bottleneck problem and derive a theoretically-driven objective to train our
projector. This loss function effectively stabilizes training by balancing a
low-quality reconstruction term with a high-quality prior-matching term. Our
framework enables Look Forward Once (LFO) for inference-time prompt refinement,
and supports plug-and-play strengthening of existing image restoration models
without need for finetuning. Extensive experiments under severe degradation
regimes provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of our work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure quality in ceramic manufacturing through non-destructive testing while maintaining component integrity, and to automate defect detection processes for more efficient quality control.

Method: Developed a neural network based on U-Net architecture trained on OCT images with manually segmented annotations, evaluated multiple experimental configurations, and applied post-processing techniques for quantitative and qualitative evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed DL-based system enables efficient, reliable, and automated quality control in ceramic manufacturing through accurate defect detection using OCT imaging.

Abstract: Non-destructive testing (NDT) is essential in ceramic manufacturing to ensure
the quality of components without compromising their integrity. In this
context, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables high-resolution internal
imaging, revealing defects such as pores, delaminations, or inclusions. This
paper presents an automatic defect detection system based on Deep Learning
(DL), trained on OCT images with manually segmented annotations. A neural
network based on the U-Net architecture is developed, evaluating multiple
experimental configurations to enhance its performance. Post-processing
techniques enable both quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the
predictions. The system shows an accurate behavior of 0.979 Dice Score,
outperforming comparable studies. The inference time of 18.98 seconds per
volume supports its viability for detecting inclusions, enabling more
efficient, reliable, and automated quality control.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MULTI-TAP is a plug-and-play architecture for evaluating image-text alignment that addresses limitations of existing methods by achieving human judgment alignment, long-sequence processing, inference efficiency, and multi-objective scoring capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image-text alignment evaluation lacks comprehensive benchmarks and existing predictors fail to simultaneously achieve key properties: human judgment alignment, long-sequence processing, inference efficiency, and multi-objective scoring applicability, especially in real-world scenarios with multiple valid descriptions.

Method: Proposed MULTI-TAP architecture uses a reward head on top of large vision-language models (LVLMs) with a lightweight ridge regression layer on frozen hidden states to produce both overall and fine-grained multi-objective scores.

Result: MULTI-TAP achieves significantly higher performance than existing metrics and performs on par with GPT-4o-based G-VEval despite smaller model size (7-8B). It outperforms VisionREWARD in both performance and efficiency on multi-objective benchmarks and the new EYE4ALL dataset.

Conclusion: MULTI-TAP provides a robust solution for multi-objective image-text alignment evaluation, and the new EYE4ALL dataset (including EYE4ALLPref and EYE4ALLMulti) serves as a foundation for developing more accessible AI systems, particularly for blind and low-vision users.

Abstract: Evaluating image-text alignment while reflecting human preferences across
multiple aspects is a significant issue for the development of reliable
vision-language applications. It becomes especially crucial in real-world
scenarios where multiple valid descriptions exist depending on contexts or user
needs. However, research progress is hindered by the lack of comprehensive
benchmarks and existing evaluation predictors lacking at least one of these key
properties: (1) Alignment with human judgments, (2) Long-sequence processing,
(3) Inference efficiency, and (4) Applicability to multi-objective scoring. To
address these challenges, we propose a plug-and-play architecture to build a
robust predictor, MULTI-TAP (Multi-Objective Task-Aware Predictor), capable of
both multi and single-objective scoring. MULTI-TAP can produce a single overall
score, utilizing a reward head built on top of a large vision-language model
(LVLMs). We show that MULTI-TAP is robust in terms of application to different
LVLM architectures, achieving significantly higher performance than existing
metrics and even on par with the GPT-4o-based predictor, G-VEval, with a
smaller size (7-8B). By training a lightweight ridge regression layer on the
frozen hidden states of a pre-trained LVLM, MULTI-TAP can produce fine-grained
scores for multiple human-interpretable objectives. MULTI-TAP performs better
than VisionREWARD, a high-performing multi-objective reward model, in both
performance and efficiency on multi-objective benchmarks and our newly released
text-image-to-text dataset, EYE4ALL. Our new dataset, consisting of
chosen/rejected human preferences (EYE4ALLPref) and human-annotated
fine-grained scores across seven dimensions (EYE4ALLMulti), can serve as a
foundation for developing more accessible AI systems by capturing the
underlying preferences of users, including blind and low-vision (BLV)
individuals.

*Joana C. Costa,Tiago Roxo,Hugo Proença,Pedro R. M. Inácio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ZQBA is a zero-query black-box adversarial attack that uses feature maps from one DNN to fool other models, achieving effective transferability across datasets without requiring multiple queries or training surrogate models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current black-box attacks require multiple queries or training diffusion models, limiting real-world applicability. The goal is to develop a more practical attack that doesn't need extensive queries or model training.

Method: Extracts feature maps from a Deep Neural Network and adds them to clean images to create adversarial samples that impair target model classification, enabling transferability across models and datasets.

Result: ZQBA successfully transfers adversarial samples across different models and datasets (CIFAR, Tiny ImageNet), outperforming state-of-the-art black-box attacks with single query while maintaining imperceptible perturbations.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates vulnerabilities in DNNs for real-world applications and provides an effective zero-query attack that maintains imperceptibility while achieving high transferability across models and datasets.

Abstract: Current black-box adversarial attacks either require multiple queries or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples that can impair the target
model performance. However, these methods require training a surrogate loss or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples, which limits their
applicability in real-world settings. Thus, we propose a Zero Query Black-box
Adversarial (ZQBA) attack that exploits the representations of Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) to fool other networks. Instead of requiring thousands of
queries to produce deceiving adversarial samples, we use the feature maps
obtained from a DNN and add them to clean images to impair the classification
of a target model. The results suggest that ZQBA can transfer the adversarial
samples to different models and across various datasets, namely CIFAR and Tiny
ImageNet. The experiments also show that ZQBA is more effective than
state-of-the-art black-box attacks with a single query, while maintaining the
imperceptibility of perturbations, evaluated both quantitatively (SSIM) and
qualitatively, emphasizing the vulnerabilities of employing DNNs in real-world
contexts. All the source code is available at

*Haifei Zhang,Patrick Barry,Eduardo Brandao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an uncertainty-aware interpretable classifier for Concept Bottleneck Models that uses binary class-level concept prototypes for classification, uncertainty measurement, and interpretable rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBMs sacrifice predictive performance compared to end-to-end CNNs and lack proper uncertainty propagation from concept predictions to final labels.

Method: Learns binary class-level concept prototypes and uses distances between predicted concept vectors and prototypes as classification scores and uncertainty measures.

Result: Enhances interpretability and robustness by enabling conformal prediction for uncertain/outlier inputs based on deviation from learned prototypes.

Conclusion: The framework provides both interpretable classification rules and uncertainty-aware predictions in CBMs.

Abstract: In the context of image classification, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
first embed images into a set of human-understandable concepts, followed by an
intrinsically interpretable classifier that predicts labels based on these
intermediate representations. While CBMs offer a semantically meaningful and
interpretable classification pipeline, they often sacrifice predictive
performance compared to end-to-end convolutional neural networks. Moreover, the
propagation of uncertainty from concept predictions to final label decisions
remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware and
interpretable classifier for the second stage of CBMs. Our method learns a set
of binary class-level concept prototypes and uses the distances between
predicted concept vectors and each class prototype as both a classification
score and a measure of uncertainty. These prototypes also serve as
interpretable classification rules, indicating which concepts should be present
in an image to justify a specific class prediction. The proposed framework
enhances both interpretability and robustness by enabling conformal prediction
for uncertain or outlier inputs based on their deviation from the learned
binary class-level concept prototypes.

### [69] [MetaLogic: Robustness Evaluation of Text-to-Image Models via Logically Equivalent Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00796)
*Yifan Shen,Yangyang Shu,Hye-young Paik,Yulei Sui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaLogic is a novel evaluation framework that detects semantic inconsistencies in text-to-image models by comparing image pairs generated from semantically equivalent but grammatically different prompts, revealing significant robustness failures in state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with maintaining semantic consistency when prompts undergo minor linguistic variations, exposing limitations in logical reasoning and generalization capabilities despite improvements in visual quality.

Method: MetaLogic uses metamorphic testing to generate image pairs from prompts that are semantically identical but differ grammatically, then directly compares these image pairs to identify inconsistencies without requiring ground truth images.

Result: Evaluation across multiple state-of-the-art T2I models revealed consistent robustness failures, with Flux.dev and DALLE-3 showing 59% and 71% misalignment rates respectively. The framework effectively uncovers fine-grained logical inconsistencies overlooked by existing metrics.

Conclusion: MetaLogic provides a scalable, ground-truth-free approach for evaluating semantic alignment in text-to-image models, offering valuable insights for model debugging and refinement by categorizing alignment errors and surfacing counterexamples.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, especially diffusion-based
architectures, have significantly improved the visual quality of generated
images. However, these models continue to struggle with a critical limitation:
maintaining semantic consistency when input prompts undergo minor linguistic
variations. Despite being logically equivalent, such prompt pairs often yield
misaligned or semantically inconsistent images, exposing a lack of robustness
in reasoning and generalisation. To address this, we propose MetaLogic, a novel
evaluation framework that detects T2I misalignment without relying on ground
truth images. MetaLogic leverages metamorphic testing, generating image pairs
from prompts that differ grammatically but are semantically identical. By
directly comparing these image pairs, the framework identifies inconsistencies
that signal failures in preserving the intended meaning, effectively diagnosing
robustness issues in the model's logic understanding. Unlike existing
evaluation methods that compare a generated image to a single prompt, MetaLogic
evaluates semantic equivalence between paired images, offering a scalable,
ground-truth-free approach to identifying alignment failures. It categorises
these alignment errors (e.g., entity omission, duplication, positional
misalignment) and surfaces counterexamples that can be used for model debugging
and refinement. We evaluate MetaLogic across multiple state-of-the-art T2I
models and reveal consistent robustness failures across a range of logical
constructs. We find that even the SOTA text-to-image models like Flux.dev and
DALLE-3 demonstrate a 59 percent and 71 percent misalignment rate,
respectively. Our results show that MetaLogic is not only efficient and
scalable, but also effective in uncovering fine-grained logical inconsistencies
that are overlooked by existing evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building facades are an untapped solar energy resource in dense urban areas, but assessing their PV potential is challenging due to complex geometries and semantic components.

Method: Four-stage pipeline: geometric rectification, zero-shot semantic segmentation, LLM-guided spatial reasoning, and energy simulation using computer vision and AI techniques.

Result: Validated on 80 buildings across 4 countries with mean area estimation errors of 6.2% ± 2.8% compared to expert annotations, requiring ~100 seconds per building.

Conclusion: The method provides reliable energy yield predictions suitable for regional potential studies, urban energy planning, and BIPV deployment, with substantial efficiency gains over manual methods.

Abstract: Building facades represent a significant untapped resource for solar energy
generation in dense urban environments, yet assessing their photovoltaic (PV)
potential remains challenging due to complex geometries and semantic com
ponents. This study introduces SF-SPA (Semantic Facade Solar-PV Assessment), an
automated framework that transforms street-view photographs into quantitative
PV deployment assessments. The approach combines com puter vision and
artificial intelligence techniques to address three key challenges: perspective
distortion correction, semantic understanding of facade elements, and spatial
reasoning for PV layout optimization. Our four-stage pipeline processes images
through geometric rectification, zero-shot semantic segmentation, Large
Language Model (LLM) guided spatial reasoning, and energy simulation.
Validation across 80 buildings in four countries demonstrates ro bust
performance with mean area estimation errors of 6.2% &#177; 2.8% compared to
expert annotations. The auto mated assessment requires approximately 100
seconds per building, a substantial gain in efficiency over manual methods.
Simulated energy yield predictions confirm the method's reliability and
applicability for regional poten tial studies, urban energy planning, and
building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) deployment. Code is available at:

Motivation: Current video generation models produce physically inconsistent motion that violates real-world dynamics, creating unrealistic videos.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Vision Language Model predicts coarse-grained motion trajectories consistent with physics, 2) Attention-based mechanisms use trajectories to guide fine-grained motion refinement in video generation.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on UCF-101 and MSR-VTT datasets, achieving FVD scores of 545 on UCF-101 and 539 on MSR-VTT.

Conclusion: TrajVLM-Gen successfully addresses physical inconsistency in video generation by incorporating physics-aware trajectory prediction and refinement, demonstrating improved performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Current video generation models produce physically inconsistent motion that
violates real-world dynamics. We propose TrajVLM-Gen, a two-stage framework for
physics-aware image-to-video generation. First, we employ a Vision Language
Model to predict coarse-grained motion trajectories that maintain consistency
with real-world physics. Second, these trajectories guide video generation
through attention-based mechanisms for fine-grained motion refinement. We build
a trajectory prediction dataset based on video tracking data with realistic
motion patterns. Experiments on UCF-101 and MSR-VTT demonstrate that
TrajVLM-Gen outperforms existing methods, achieving competitive FVD scores of

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADQA is a QA benchmark for evaluating audio descriptions (ADs) on coherent video segments, addressing subjectivity in AD writing and showing current methods lag behind human-authored ADs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AD generation works focus on short trimmed clips and compare against single ground-truth references, but AD writing is inherently subjective. Working with trimmed clips is inadequate for proper evaluation.

Method: Proposed ADQA benchmark evaluates ADs on few-minute long coherent video segments with visual appreciation (VA) questions about visual facts and narrative understanding (NU) questions based on plot.

Result: Quantified subjectivity in AD writing through analysis of two independent AD tracks. Showed current AD generation methods lag far behind human-authored ADs.

Conclusion: Working with coherent video segments is essential for proper AD evaluation. Introduced public leaderboard for benchmarking and provided recommendations for future work.

Abstract: Audio descriptions (ADs) narrate important visual details in movies, enabling
Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users to understand narratives and appreciate visual
details. Existing works in automatic AD generation mostly focus on few-second
trimmed clips, and evaluate them by comparing against a single ground-truth
reference AD. However, writing ADs is inherently subjective. Through alignment
and analysis of two independent AD tracks for the same movies, we quantify the
subjectivity in when and whether to describe, and what and how to highlight.
Thus, we show that working with trimmed clips is inadequate. We propose ADQA, a
QA benchmark that evaluates ADs at the level of few-minute long, coherent video
segments, testing whether they would help BLV users understand the story and
appreciate visual details. ADQA features visual appreciation (VA) questions
about visual facts and narrative understanding (NU) questions based on the
plot. Through ADQA, we show that current AD generation methods lag far behind
human-authored ADs. We conclude with several recommendations for future work
and introduce a public leaderboard for benchmarking.

TL;DR: PhraseStereo is the first dataset for phrase-region segmentation in stereo image pairs, created by extending PhraseCut with GenStereo-generated right-view images to enable stereo phrase grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current phrase grounding methods are limited to single-view images, missing the rich geometric cues available in stereo vision that could improve multimodal semantic segmentation.

Method: Extends the PhraseCut dataset by using GenStereo to generate accurate right-view images from existing single-view data, creating stereo image pairs with aligned segmentation masks and phrase annotations.

Result: Created PhraseStereo dataset that enables phrase grounding in stereo domain, introducing new challenges and opportunities for leveraging depth cues in multimodal learning.

Conclusion: PhraseStereo establishes foundation for research at intersection of language, vision and 3D perception, enabling development of models that jointly reason over semantics and geometry.

Abstract: Understanding how natural language phrases correspond to specific regions in
images is a key challenge in multimodal semantic segmentation. Recent advances
in phrase grounding are largely limited to single-view images, neglecting the
rich geometric cues available in stereo vision. For this, we introduce
PhraseStereo, the first novel dataset that brings phrase-region segmentation to
stereo image pairs. PhraseStereo builds upon the PhraseCut dataset by
leveraging GenStereo to generate accurate right-view images from existing
single-view data, enabling the extension of phrase grounding into the stereo
domain. This new setting introduces unique challenges and opportunities for
multimodal learning, particularly in leveraging depth cues for more precise and
context-aware grounding. By providing stereo image pairs with aligned
segmentation masks and phrase annotations, PhraseStereo lays the foundation for
future research at the intersection of language, vision, and 3D perception,
encouraging the development of models that can reason jointly over semantics
and geometry. The PhraseStereo dataset will be released online upon acceptance
of this work.

### [74] [NSARM: Next-Scale Autoregressive Modeling for Robust Real-World Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00820)
*Xiangtao Kong,Rongyuan Wu,Shuaizheng Liu,Lingchen Sun,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NSARM introduces a robust Real-ISR framework using next-scale autoregressive modeling that achieves superior visual quality and faster inference than existing methods while being more robust to input image quality variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Real-ISR methods using diffusion models face trade-offs between quality and efficiency - diffusion from noise is slow but realistic, while direct generation from input images is fast but lower quality. Current approaches also suffer from over-enhanced artifacts and poor robustness to varying input degradations.

Method: NSARM uses a two-stage training approach: first training a transformation network to map low-quality images to preliminary scales, followed by end-to-end full-model fine-tuning. It builds on visual autoregressive models with bitwise next-scale prediction strategy.

Result: Extensive evaluations show NSARM achieves superior visual results over existing Real-ISR methods while maintaining fast inference speed. It demonstrates much higher robustness to input image quality and stronger generalization performance.

Conclusion: NSARM provides a robust Real-ISR solution that combines the benefits of autoregressive modeling with comprehensive fine-tuning, achieving both high-quality results and efficiency without compromising generative capability.

Abstract: Most recent real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods employ
pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models to synthesize the high-quality
image either from random Gaussian noise, which yields realistic results but is
slow due to iterative denoising, or directly from the input low-quality image,
which is efficient but at the price of lower output quality. These approaches
train ControlNet or LoRA modules while keeping the pre-trained model fixed,
which often introduces over-enhanced artifacts and hallucinations, suffering
from the robustness to inputs of varying degradations. Recent visual
autoregressive (AR) models, such as pre-trained Infinity, can provide strong
T2I generation capabilities while offering superior efficiency by using the
bitwise next-scale prediction strategy. Building upon next-scale prediction, we
introduce a robust Real-ISR framework, namely Next-Scale Autoregressive
Modeling (NSARM). Specifically, we train NSARM in two stages: a transformation
network is first trained to map the input low-quality image to preliminary
scales, followed by an end-to-end full-model fine-tuning. Such a comprehensive
fine-tuning enhances the robustness of NSARM in Real-ISR tasks without
compromising its generative capability. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate that as a pure AR model, NSARM achieves superior visual
results over existing Real-ISR methods while maintaining a fast inference
speed. Most importantly, it demonstrates much higher robustness to the quality
of input images, showing stronger generalization performance. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes two hierarchical contrastive learning methods (G-HMLC and A-HMLC) that model inter-class relationships and imbalanced distributions across hierarchy levels, achieving state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR100 and ModelNet40 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional classification approaches neglect inherent inter-class relationships at different hierarchy levels, missing important supervisory signals that could improve classification performance.

Method: Two novel hierarchical contrastive learning methods: G-HMLC using Gaussian Mixture Model and A-HMLC using attention mechanism to capture hierarchy-specific features and model inter-class relationships across hierarchy levels.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR100 and ModelNet40 datasets, outperforming existing hierarchical contrastive learning methods by 2 percentage points in accuracy in linear evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical contrastive learning approach effectively models hierarchical relationships and imbalanced distributions, showing strong potential for computer vision applications and beyond.

Abstract: Hierarchical classification is a crucial task in many applications, where
objects are organized into multiple levels of categories. However, conventional
classification approaches often neglect inherent inter-class relationships at
different hierarchy levels, thus missing important supervisory signals. Thus,
we propose two novel hierarchical contrastive learning (HMLC) methods. The
first, leverages a Gaussian Mixture Model (G-HMLC) and the second uses an
attention mechanism to capture hierarchy-specific features (A-HMLC), imitating
human processing. Our approach explicitly models inter-class relationships and
imbalanced class distribution at higher hierarchy levels, enabling fine-grained
clustering across all hierarchy levels. On the competitive CIFAR100 and
ModelNet40 datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in linear
evaluation, outperforming existing hierarchical contrastive learning methods by
2 percentage points in terms of accuracy. The effectiveness of our approach is
backed by both quantitative and qualitative results, highlighting its potential
for applications in computer vision and beyond.

*Kevin Zhang,Kuangzhi Ge,Xiaowei Chi,Renrui Zhang,Shaojun Shi,Zhen Dong,Sirui Han,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces World-Language Models (WorldLMs) that use video diffusion models as generative encoders for vision-language tasks, showing enhanced spatial reasoning and multi-frame capabilities from single images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether generative world models trained on video data can replace conventional vision encoders for multimodal understanding, leveraging their motion-consistency priors.

Method: Repurposed a video diffusion model as a generative encoder by performing a single denoising step and using the resulting latents as visual embeddings, creating the Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA) variant.

Result: WorldLMs capture distinct visual embeddings useful for downstream understanding, significantly enhancing spatial reasoning and enabling single-image models to perform multi-frame reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on visual reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Generative encoders from world models show promise for vision-language models, inheriting motion-consistency benefits from video pre-training and paving the way for new generalist vision learners.

Abstract: Trained on internet-scale video data, generative world models are
increasingly recognized as powerful world simulators that can generate
consistent and plausible dynamics over structure, motion, and physics. This
raises a natural question: with the advent of strong video foundational models,
might they supplant conventional vision encoder paradigms for general-purpose
multimodal understanding? While recent studies have begun to explore the
potential of world models on common vision tasks, these explorations typically
lack a systematic investigation of generic, multimodal tasks. In this work, we
strive to investigate the capabilities when world model priors are transferred
into Vision-Language Models: we re-purpose a video diffusion model as a
generative encoder to perform a single denoising step and treat the resulting
latents as a set of visual embedding. We empirically investigate this class of
models, which we refer to as World-Language Models (WorldLMs), and we find that
generative encoders can capture latents useful for downstream understanding
that show distinctions from conventional encoders. Naming our best-performing
variant Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA), we further discover that this method
significantly enhances spatial reasoning abilities and enables single-image
models to perform multi-frame reasoning. Through the curation of a suite of
visual reasoning tasks, we find DyVA to surpass both open-source and
proprietary baselines, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance. We
attribute these gains to WorldLM's inherited motion-consistency internalization
from video pre-training. Finally, we systematically explore extensive model
designs to highlight promising directions for future work. We hope our study
can pave the way for a new family of VLMs that leverage priors from world
models and are on a promising path towards generalist vision learners.

*Hyun-kyu Ko,Youbin Kim,Jihyeon Park,Dongheok Park,Gyeongjin Kang,Wonjun Cho,Hyung Yi,Eunbyung Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes GSMamba, a hybrid architecture combining Mamba-based selective scanning for temporal propagation with shifted window self-attention for spatial context aggregation in video super-resolution, addressing limitations of both recurrent models and Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VSR methods using recurrent architectures suffer from vanishing gradients, lack of parallelism, and slow inference. Transformers have quadratic complexity and limited scalability for long sequences. While Mamba offers linear-time complexity for temporal modeling, it struggles with fine-grained spatial dependencies due to its causal nature.

Method: Proposes a hybrid architecture with shifted window self-attention for spatial context aggregation and Mamba-based selective scanning for efficient temporal propagation. Introduces Gather-Scatter Mamba (GSM) mechanism that warps features toward a center anchor frame before Mamba propagation and scatters them back afterward to reduce occlusion artifacts.

Result: The method effectively addresses occlusion artifacts and ensures redistribution of aggregated information across all frames while maintaining linear-time complexity for temporal modeling.

Conclusion: The proposed GSMamba architecture successfully combines the strengths of attention mechanisms for spatial modeling and Mamba's efficient temporal propagation, providing an effective solution for video super-resolution that overcomes limitations of both recurrent models and Transformers.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs)-most notably RNNs-have historically played a
central role in sequential modeling. Although attention mechanisms such as
Transformers have since dominated due to their ability to model global context,
their quadratic complexity and limited scalability make them less suited for
long sequences. Video super-resolution (VSR) methods have traditionally relied
on recurrent architectures to propagate features across frames. However, such
approaches suffer from well-known issues including vanishing gradients, lack of
parallelism, and slow inference speed. Recent advances in selective SSMs like
Mamba offer a compelling alternative: by enabling input-dependent state
transitions with linear-time complexity, Mamba mitigates these issues while
maintaining strong long-range modeling capabilities. Despite this potential,
Mamba alone struggles to capture fine-grained spatial dependencies due to its
causal nature and lack of explicit context aggregation. To address this, we
propose a hybrid architecture that combines shifted window self-attention for
spatial context aggregation with Mamba-based selective scanning for efficient
temporal propagation. Furthermore, we introduce Gather-Scatter Mamba (GSM), an
alignment-aware mechanism that warps features toward a center anchor frame
within the temporal window before Mamba propagation and scatters them back
afterward, effectively reducing occlusion artifacts and ensuring effective
redistribution of aggregated information across all frames. The official
implementation is provided at: https://github.com/Ko-Lani/GSMamba.

*Roshan Kenia,Anfei Li,Rishabh Srivastava,Kaveri A. Thakoor*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI-CNet3D is a novel hybrid deep learning model that integrates cross-attention mechanisms into 3D CNNs for glaucoma diagnosis from OCT volumes, achieving superior performance while being computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional practice of condensing 3D OCT volumes into 2D reports loses key structural details needed for accurate glaucoma diagnosis, requiring better methods to preserve 3D information.

Method: Proposed AI-CNet3D model divides OCT volumes along two axes, applies cross-attention to capture asymmetries between hemiretinal regions, integrates ONH and macula information, and uses CARE visualizations with multi-task fine-tuning aligned with Grad-CAMs.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art attention and convolutional models across all key metrics on two large datasets, while reducing parameter count by 100-fold compared to other attention mechanisms.

Conclusion: The proposed anatomically-informed cross-attention network effectively captures critical 3D structural features for glaucoma classification while maintaining computational efficiency and enhanced interpretability.

Abstract: Glaucoma is a progressive eye disease that leads to optic nerve damage,
causing irreversible vision loss if left untreated. Optical coherence
tomography (OCT) has become a crucial tool for glaucoma diagnosis, offering
high-resolution 3D scans of the retina and optic nerve. However, the
conventional practice of condensing information from 3D OCT volumes into 2D
reports often results in the loss of key structural details. To address this,
we propose a novel hybrid deep learning model that integrates cross-attention
mechanisms into a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), enabling the
extraction of critical features from the superior and inferior hemiretinas, as
well as from the optic nerve head (ONH) and macula, within OCT volumes. We
introduce Channel Attention REpresentations (CAREs) to visualize
cross-attention outputs and leverage them for consistency-based multi-task
fine-tuning, aligning them with Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Maps
(Grad-CAMs) from the CNN's final convolutional layer to enhance performance,
interpretability, and anatomical coherence. We have named this model AI-CNet3D
(AI-`See'-Net3D) to reflect its design as an Anatomically-Informed
Cross-attention Network operating on 3D data. By dividing the volume along two
axes and applying cross-attention, our model enhances glaucoma classification
by capturing asymmetries between the hemiretinal regions while integrating
information from the optic nerve head and macula. We validate our approach on
two large datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art attention and
convolutional models across all key metrics. Finally, our model is
computationally efficient, reducing the parameter count by one-hundred--fold
compared to other attention mechanisms while maintaining high diagnostic
performance and comparable GFLOPS.

TL;DR: This study examines how ML practitioners select source datasets for medical imaging transfer learning, finding choices are task-dependent and influenced by community practices, dataset properties, and similarity perceptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current source dataset selection in medical imaging transfer learning relies on researcher intuition rather than systematic principles, which can impact algorithm generalizability and patient outcomes.

Method: Conducted a task-based survey with machine learning practitioners to understand source dataset selection decisions from a human-centered HCI perspective.

Result: Practitioners' choices are task-dependent and influenced by community practices, dataset properties, computational embeddings, and perceived visual/semantic similarity. However, similarity ratings and expected performance are not always aligned.

Conclusion: The findings challenge the traditional 'more similar is better' view and highlight the need for clearer definitions and HCI tools to make selection heuristics explicit and usable for more systematic source selection.

Abstract: Transfer learning is crucial for medical imaging, yet the selection of source
datasets - which can impact the generalizability of algorithms, and thus
patient outcomes - often relies on researchers' intuition rather than
systematic principles. This study investigates these decisions through a
task-based survey with machine learning practitioners. Unlike prior work that
benchmarks models and experimental setups, we take a human-centered HCI
perspective on how practitioners select source datasets. Our findings indicate
that choices are task-dependent and influenced by community practices, dataset
properties, and computational (data embedding), or perceived visual or semantic
similarity. However, similarity ratings and expected performance are not always
aligned, challenging a traditional "more similar is better" view. Participants
often used ambiguous terminology, which suggests a need for clearer definitions
and HCI tools to make them explicit and usable. By clarifying these heuristics,
this work provides practical insights for more systematic source selection in
transfer learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAL-Net is an automated deep learning pipeline that localizes 50 anatomical landmarks on 3D facial scans using a patch-based pointwise CNN with attention mechanisms, achieving clinical-grade accuracy comparable to human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation of anatomical landmarks on 3D facial scans is time-consuming and expertise-dependent, limiting clinical applicability of existing deep learning methods that focus on pseudo-landmarks or require complex input representations.

Method: Combines coarse alignment, region-of-interest filtering, initial landmark approximation, and a patch-based pointwise CNN enhanced by attention mechanisms for 3D facial landmark localization.

Result: Achieved mean localization error of 3.686 mm on 214 annotated scans, preserving anatomical distances with 2.822 mm error (comparable to intra-observer variability). Generalizes well to FaceScape dataset with 0.41 mm point-wise and 0.38 mm distance-wise errors.

Conclusion: PAL-Net provides a lightweight, scalable solution for high-throughput 3D anthropometric analysis with favorable accuracy-computation trade-off, potentially reducing reliance on manual annotation in clinical workflows.

Abstract: Manual annotation of anatomical landmarks on 3D facial scans is a
time-consuming and expertise-dependent task, yet it remains critical for
clinical assessments, morphometric analysis, and craniofacial research. While
several deep learning methods have been proposed for facial landmark
localization, most focus on pseudo-landmarks or require complex input
representations, limiting their clinical applicability. This study presents a
fully automated deep learning pipeline (PAL-Net) for localizing 50 anatomical
landmarks on stereo-photogrammetry facial models. The method combines coarse
alignment, region-of-interest filtering, and an initial approximation of
landmarks with a patch-based pointwise CNN enhanced by attention mechanisms.
Trained and evaluated on 214 annotated scans from healthy adults, PAL-Net
achieved a mean localization error of 3.686 mm and preserves relevant
anatomical distances with a 2.822 mm average error, comparable to
intra-observer variability. To assess generalization, the model was further
evaluated on 700 subjects from the FaceScape dataset, achieving a point-wise
error of 0.41\,mm and a distance-wise error of 0.38\,mm. Compared to existing
methods, PAL-Net offers a favorable trade-off between accuracy and
computational cost. While performance degrades in regions with poor mesh
quality (e.g., ears, hairline), the method demonstrates consistent accuracy
across most anatomical regions. PAL-Net generalizes effectively across datasets
and facial regions, outperforming existing methods in both point-wise and
structural evaluations. It provides a lightweight, scalable solution for
high-throughput 3D anthropometric analysis, with potential to support clinical
workflows and reduce reliance on manual annotation. Source code can be found at

TL;DR: Proposes a self-supervised learning method for inverse problems using equivariant networks and splitting losses, achieving state-of-the-art performance with incomplete measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enables learning-based reconstruction when ground-truth training data is unavailable or expensive to obtain, particularly for single incomplete observation models.

Method: Combines self-supervised splitting losses with equivariant reconstruction networks to create unbiased supervised loss estimates.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on image inpainting, accelerated MRI, and compressive sensing with highly rank-deficient forward models.

Conclusion: The proposed self-supervised approach with equivariant networks effectively solves inverse problems without requiring ground-truth training data.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning for inverse problems allows to train a
reconstruction network from noise and/or incomplete data alone. These methods
have the potential of enabling learning-based solutions when obtaining
ground-truth references for training is expensive or even impossible. In this
paper, we propose a new self-supervised learning strategy devised for the
challenging setting where measurements are observed via a single incomplete
observation model. We introduce a new definition of equivariance in the context
of reconstruction networks, and show that the combination of self-supervised
splitting losses and equivariant reconstruction networks results in unbiased
estimates of the supervised loss. Through a series of experiments on image
inpainting, accelerated magnetic resonance imaging, and compressive sensing, we
demonstrate that the proposed loss achieves state-of-the-art performance in
settings with highly rank-deficient forward models.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Cross-Resolution ReID methods rely on super-resolution or joint learning, increasing complexity and facing performance bottlenecks. Need for lightweight and effective approach to handle resolution differences in surveillance scenarios.

Method: Discovered semantic directions indicating resolution differences in ReID feature space, validated with statistical analysis. Proposed VPFA framework that models resolution-specific feature discrepancy through vector panning feature alignment.

Result: Significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baseline models on multiple CR-ReID benchmarks while achieving higher efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed VPFA framework based on semantic direction modeling provides an effective and superior solution for Cross-Resolution ReID, demonstrating the value of the new discovery about resolution-specific feature discrepancies.

Abstract: In surveillance scenarios, varying camera distances cause significant
differences among pedestrian image resolutions, making it hard to match
low-resolution (LR) images with high-resolution (HR) counterparts, limiting the
performance of Re-Identification (ReID) tasks. Most existing Cross-Resolution
ReID (CR-ReID) methods rely on super-resolution (SR) or joint learning for
feature compensation, which increases training and inference complexity and has
reached a performance bottleneck in recent studies. Inspired by semantic
directions in the word embedding space, we empirically discover that semantic
directions implying resolution differences also emerge in the feature space of
ReID, and we substantiate this finding from a statistical perspective using
Canonical Correlation Analysis and Pearson Correlation Analysis. Based on this
interesting finding, we propose a lightweight and effective Vector Panning
Feature Alignment (VPFA) framework, which conducts CR-ReID from a novel
perspective of modeling the resolution-specific feature discrepancy. Extensive
experimental results on multiple CR-ReID benchmarks show that our method
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baseline models while
obtaining higher efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of
our model based on the new finding in this paper.

Motivation: Existing VSR approaches face inefficiency and poor scalability when processing long video sequences due to heavy multi-step denoising costs and temporal decomposition artifacts.

Method: Adapts pre-trained DiT into a causal structure with rolling KV-cache and joint visual guidance, then distills the diffusion process into a single step using patch-wise pixel supervision and cross-chunk distribution matching.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art quality with enhanced semantic consistency, delivers up to 58x speed-up over existing methods like MGLD-VSR, and introduces a new benchmark for long-form video evaluation.

Conclusion: InfVSR pushes the frontier of long-form VSR by enabling efficient streaming inference while fully leveraging pre-trained video diffusion priors for unbounded-length videos.

Abstract: Real-world videos often extend over thousands of frames. Existing video
super-resolution (VSR) approaches, however, face two persistent challenges when
processing long sequences: (1) inefficiency due to the heavy cost of multi-step
denoising for full-length sequences; and (2) poor scalability hindered by
temporal decomposition that causes artifacts and discontinuities. To break
these limits, we propose InfVSR, which novelly reformulates VSR as an
autoregressive-one-step-diffusion paradigm. This enables streaming inference
while fully leveraging pre-trained video diffusion priors. First, we adapt the
pre-trained DiT into a causal structure, maintaining both local and global
coherence via rolling KV-cache and joint visual guidance. Second, we distill
the diffusion process into a single step efficiently, with patch-wise pixel
supervision and cross-chunk distribution matching. Together, these designs
enable efficient and scalable VSR for unbounded-length videos. To fill the gap
in long-form video evaluation, we build a new benchmark tailored for extended
sequences and further introduce semantic-level metrics to comprehensively
assess temporal consistency. Our method pushes the frontier of long-form VSR,
achieves state-of-the-art quality with enhanced semantic consistency, and
delivers up to 58x speed-up over existing methods such as MGLD-VSR. Code will

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JEPA-T is a unified multimodal framework that uses joint-embedding predictive Transformers to encode images and text into discrete tokens, incorporating cross-attention and text embedding injection for improved text-image fusion in text-to-image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current token-centric T2I architectures struggle with effectively fusing text with visual tokens, despite being trained with self-supervision. There's a need for better multimodal fusion while maintaining backbone generality.

Method: Encodes images and captions into discrete visual/textual tokens processed by joint-embedding predictive Transformer. Uses cross-attention after feature predictor for conditional denoising, injects raw text embeddings before flow matching loss, and performs iterative denoising of visual tokens conditioned on text during inference.

Result: Achieves strong data efficiency and open-vocabulary generalization on ImageNet-1K, consistently outperforming non-fusion and late-fusion baselines.

Conclusion: Late architectural fusion combined with objective-level alignment provides an effective balance between conditioning strength and backbone generality in token-based T2I generation.

Abstract: Modern Text-to-Image (T2I) generation increasingly relies on token-centric
architectures that are trained with self-supervision, yet effectively fusing
text with visual tokens remains a challenge. We propose \textbf{JEPA-T}, a
unified multimodal framework that encodes images and captions into discrete
visual and textual tokens, processed by a joint-embedding predictive
Transformer. To enhance fusion, we incorporate cross-attention after the
feature predictor for conditional denoising while maintaining a task-agnostic
backbone. Additionally, raw texts embeddings are injected prior to the flow
matching loss to improve alignment during training. During inference, the same
network performs both class-conditional and free-text image generation by
iteratively denoising visual tokens conditioned on text. Evaluations on
ImageNet-1K demonstrate that JEPA-T achieves strong data efficiency,
open-vocabulary generalization, and consistently outperforms non-fusion and
late-fusion baselines. Our approach shows that late architectural fusion
combined with objective-level alignment offers an effective balance between
conditioning strength and backbone generality in token-based T2I.The code is

*Axel Barroso-Laguna,Tommaso Cavallari,Victor Adrian Prisacariu,Eric Brachmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastForward is a novel method that enables real-time image localization by creating map representations and relocalizing query images in a single feed-forward pass, achieving competitive accuracy with minimal preparation time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art image localization approaches require hours of mapping time even with known camera poses, making them impractical for real-time applications. The paper aims to achieve competitive accuracy much faster.

Method: FastForward represents multiple mapping images as a collection of features anchored in 3D space. It uses these mapping features to predict image-to-scene correspondences for query images, enabling camera pose estimation in a single feed-forward pass.

Result: FastForward achieves state-of-the-art accuracy when coupled with image retrieval, with minimal map preparation time. It also demonstrates robust generalization to unseen domains, including challenging large-scale outdoor environments.

Conclusion: FastForward provides a practical solution for real-time image localization by significantly reducing mapping time while maintaining competitive accuracy, making it suitable for various applications including challenging outdoor scenarios.

Abstract: Visually localizing an image, i.e., estimating its camera pose, requires
building a scene representation that serves as a visual map. The representation
we choose has direct consequences towards the practicability of our system.
Even when starting from mapping images with known camera poses,
state-of-the-art approaches still require hours of mapping time in the worst
case, and several minutes in the best. This work raises the question whether we
can achieve competitive accuracy much faster. We introduce FastForward, a
method that creates a map representation and relocalizes a query image
on-the-fly in a single feed-forward pass. At the core, we represent multiple
mapping images as a collection of features anchored in 3D space. FastForward
utilizes these mapping features to predict image-to-scene correspondences for
the query image, enabling the estimation of its camera pose. We couple
FastForward with image retrieval and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy when
compared to other approaches with minimal map preparation time. Furthermore,
FastForward demonstrates robust generalization to unseen domains, including
challenging large-scale outdoor environments.

TL;DR: A plug-and-play refinement module that enhances spatial correspondence in autoregressive vision-language models by jointly refining all generated tokens using global context, improving generation quality and semantic consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models struggle with spatial nature of visual signals conflicting with sequential dependencies of next-token prediction, leading to suboptimal vision-language modeling results.

Method: Proposes a post-pretraining refinement module that operates on all generated tokens simultaneously, leveraging global context and relationships across tokens to enhance spatial correspondence modeling.

Result: The method improves generation quality and mitigates error accumulation in sequential generation, producing more semantically consistent results.

Conclusion: The plug-and-play refinement module effectively enhances autoregressive vision-language modeling by better handling spatial relationships while maintaining the sequential prediction framework.

Abstract: Autoregressive models excel in sequential modeling and have proven to be
effective for vision-language data. However, the spatial nature of visual
signals conflicts with the sequential dependencies of next-token prediction,
leading to suboptimal results. This work proposes a plug-and-play refinement
module to enhance the complex spatial correspondence modeling within the
generated visual sequence. This module operates as a post-pretraining step to
jointly refine all generated tokens of autoregressive model, enhancing
vision-language modeling under a shared sequential prediction framework. By
leveraging global context and relationship across the tokens, our method
mitigates the error accumulation issue within the sequential generation.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the generation
quality, enhancing the model's ability to produce semantically consistent
results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SoftCFG is an uncertainty-guided inference method that addresses guidance diminishing and over-guidance issues in autoregressive image generation models by distributing adaptive perturbations across all tokens with certainty-weighted guidance and Step Normalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) in autoregressive models faces guidance diminishing (conditional-unconditional gap vanishes during decoding) and over-guidance (strong conditions distort visual coherence) problems.

Method: Proposes SoftCFG with uncertainty-guided adaptive perturbations across all tokens using certainty-weighted guidance, and Step Normalization to bound cumulative perturbations for stable long-sequence generation.

Result: Significantly improves image quality over standard CFG and achieves state-of-the-art FID on ImageNet 256 among autoregressive models.

Conclusion: SoftCFG is an effective training-free, model-agnostic method that seamlessly integrates with existing AR pipelines to address CFG limitations in autoregressive image generation.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have emerged as powerful tools for image
generation by modeling images as sequences of discrete tokens. While
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has been adopted to improve conditional
generation, its application in AR models faces two key issues: guidance
diminishing, where the conditional-unconditional gap quickly vanishes as
decoding progresses, and over-guidance, where strong conditions distort visual
coherence. To address these challenges, we propose SoftCFG, an
uncertainty-guided inference method that distributes adaptive perturbations
across all tokens in the sequence. The key idea behind SoftCFG is to let each
generated token contribute certainty-weighted guidance, ensuring that the
signal persists across steps while resolving conflicts between text guidance
and visual context. To further stabilize long-sequence generation, we introduce
Step Normalization, which bounds cumulative perturbations of SoftCFG. Our
method is training-free, model-agnostic, and seamlessly integrates with
existing AR pipelines. Experiments show that SoftCFG significantly improves
image quality over standard CFG and achieves state-of-the-art FID on ImageNet
256 among autoregressive models.

*Qiming Zhao,Xingjian Li,Xiaoyu Cao,Xiaolong Wu,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TextCAM enhances traditional Class Activation Mapping (CAM) by integrating natural language descriptions, combining spatial localization with semantic insights from vision-language models to explain what visual attributes drive deep vision model predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CAM methods highlight spatial regions but provide little semantic insight into what specific attributes underlie model activations, limiting interpretability and trustworthiness in high-stakes applications.

Method: TextCAM combines CAM's spatial localization with CLIP embeddings and linear discriminant analysis to derive channel-level semantic representations, then aggregates them with CAM weights to produce textual descriptions of salient visual evidence.

Result: Experiments on ImageNet, CLEVR, and CUB show that TextCAM produces faithful and interpretable rationales that improve human understanding, detect spurious correlations, and preserve model fidelity.

Conclusion: TextCAM successfully bridges the gap between spatial activation maps and semantic understanding, providing more comprehensive explanations that specify both where models attend and what visual attributes support their decisions.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
but remain difficult to interpret, limiting their trustworthiness in
high-stakes applications. This paper focuses on deep vision models, for which a
dominant line of explainability methods are Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and
its variants working by highlighting spatial regions that drive predictions. We
figure out that CAM provides little semantic insight into what attributes
underlie these activations. To address this limitation, we propose TextCAM, a
novel explanation framework that enriches CAM with natural languages. TextCAM
combines the precise spatial localization of CAM with the semantic alignment of
vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, we derive channel-level semantic
representations using CLIP embeddings and linear discriminant analysis, and
aggregate them with CAM weights to produce textual descriptions of salient
visual evidence. This yields explanations that jointly specify where the model
attends and what visual attributes likely support its decision. We further
extend TextCAM to generate feature channels into semantically coherent groups,
enabling more fine-grained visual-textual explanations. Experiments on
ImageNet, CLEVR, and CUB demonstrate that TextCAM produces faithful and
interpretable rationales that improve human understanding, detect spurious
correlations, and preserve model fidelity.

*Ashim Dahal,Ankit Ghimire,Saydul Akbar Murad,Nick Rahimi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: POVQA introduces a data-efficient pipeline that compresses video into temporally pooled images and fine-tunes LVLMs with lightweight supervision, achieving significant improvements in video question answering performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VQA methods with large context windows only handle 50 seconds of video without significant information loss, creating a need for more efficient video representation and processing methods.

Method: Compress each second of video into single temporally pooled images using motion blur and weighted averaging variants, then fine-tune QWEN-2.5-VL 7B with supervised two-turn targets including reasoning and final answer using SFT and DPO on ReasonVQA dataset.

Result: Dramatic performance improvements: F1 score from 0.212 to 0.543, BLEU-4 from 0.031 to 0.291, ROUGE-L from 0.196 to 0.528. Gains persist across different pooling schemes and show strong robustness in temporal evidence summarization.

Conclusion: POVQA's data-efficient approach with temporal pooling and lightweight supervision significantly enhances VQA performance while maintaining robustness across different pooling methods and showing promising zero-shot transfer capabilities.

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VQA) with Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) has
gained significant traction in research ever since the Flamingo was introduced
by Deepmind. Recent advancements in large context/long video question answering
have allowed VQA tasks to have context window of 1500+ frames. However, this
only leads to 50 seconds of video footage without losing any significant
information. We introduce POVQA, a data-efficient pipeline that compresses each
second of video into a single temporally pooled image (via motion blur and
weighted averaging variants) and then align LVLMs with lightweight supervision.
Concretely, we build 1 fps input sources using Blend Blur with Last Frame,
Weighted Average, Exponential and Ramp pooling and fine-tune QWEN-2.5-VL 7B
with supervised two turn target including reasoning and final answer. We apply
Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on our
novel dataset ReasonVQA consisting of 12 movies with 239 human annotated
question-answer with reasoning prompts. On our ReasonVQA dataset, this method
dramatically improves performance over pooled baselines: F1 score improves from
0.212 to 0.543, BLEU-4 from 0.031 to 0.291, and ROUGE-L from 0.196 to 0.528.
Rationale quality also significantly increases. Cross-evaluation of SFT + DPO
on various pooling functions show that the gains persist regardless of the
pooling scheme used at train or test time, indicating strong robustness on
summarization of temporal evidence. Similar observations were made on zero-shot
in TVQA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImageDoctor is a multi-aspect evaluation framework for text-to-image models that assesses image quality across four dimensions and provides pixel-level flaw indicators, outperforming scalar-based reward models by 10%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image model evaluation approaches use single scalar scores, which limit comprehensive and interpretable feedback on image quality.

Method: Built on a vision-language model with a 'look-think-predict' paradigm: localize flaws, generate reasoning, then provide quantitative scores across plausibility, semantic alignment, aesthetics, and overall quality. Uses supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: Strong alignment with human preference across multiple datasets and 10% improvement over scalar-based reward models when used for preference tuning.

Conclusion: ImageDoctor provides comprehensive, interpretable evaluation and effective dense rewards for text-to-image model preference alignment.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models has increased the need
for reliable human preference modeling, a demand further amplified by recent
progress in reinforcement learning for preference alignment. However, existing
approaches typically quantify the quality of a generated image using a single
scalar, limiting their ability to provide comprehensive and interpretable
feedback on image quality. To address this, we introduce ImageDoctor, a unified
multi-aspect T2I model evaluation framework that assesses image quality across
four complementary dimensions: plausibility, semantic alignment, aesthetics,
and overall quality. ImageDoctor also provides pixel-level flaw indicators in
the form of heatmaps, which highlight misaligned or implausible regions, and
can be used as a dense reward for T2I model preference alignment. Inspired by
the diagnostic process, we improve the detail sensitivity and reasoning
capability of ImageDoctor by introducing a "look-think-predict" paradigm, where
the model first localizes potential flaws, then generates reasoning, and
finally concludes the evaluation with quantitative scores. Built on top of a
vision-language model and trained through a combination of supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, ImageDoctor demonstrates strong
alignment with human preference across multiple datasets, establishing its
effectiveness as an evaluation metric. Furthermore, when used as a reward model
for preference tuning, ImageDoctor significantly improves generation quality --
achieving an improvement of 10% over scalar-based reward models.

*Weihua Zhang,Chengze Jiang,Jie Gui,Lu Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces adversarial training to hyperspectral classification and proposes AT-RA, a novel method that enhances robustness by preserving spectral semantics through data augmentation and spatial smoothness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral classification models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and existing defense methods have limited scalability and effectiveness against strong attacks.

Method: Proposed AT-RA adversarial training method that uses data augmentation to increase spectral diversity and ensures spatial smoothness to preserve spectral semantic information.

Result: AT-RA improves adversarial robustness by 21.34% against AutoAttack and 18.78% against PGD-50, while also increasing benign accuracy by 2.68%.

Conclusion: Adversarial training is effective for hyperspectral domains but requires special consideration for spectral semantics, and AT-RA successfully addresses these challenges to enhance both robustness and accuracy.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that hyperspectral classification models based
on deep learning are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose
significant security risks. Although several approaches have attempted to
enhance adversarial robustness by modifying network architectures, these
methods often rely on customized designs that limit scalability and fail to
defend effectively against strong attacks. To address these challenges, we
introduce adversarial training to the hyperspectral domain, which is widely
regarded as one of the most effective defenses against adversarial attacks.
Through extensive empirical analyses, we demonstrate that while adversarial
training does enhance robustness across various models and datasets,
hyperspectral data introduces unique challenges not seen in RGB images.
Specifically, we find that adversarial noise and the non-smooth nature of
adversarial examples can distort or eliminate important spectral semantic
information. To mitigate this issue, we employ data augmentation techniques and
propose a novel hyperspectral adversarial training method, termed AT-RA. By
increasing the diversity of spectral information and ensuring spatial
smoothness, AT-RA preserves and corrects spectral semantics in hyperspectral
images. Experimental results show that AT-RA improves adversarial robustness by
21.34% against AutoAttack and 18.78% against PGD-50 while boosting benign
accuracy by 2.68%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First secure, high-quality reversible face anonymization method using diffusion models with secret key mechanism for authorized reversal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy risks in face images by creating anonymization that balances security, image quality, and reversibility for authorized authentication.

Method: Combine secret key with latent face representations in diffusion model, constrain generation with facial mask to preserve identity-irrelevant features, use deterministic forward/backward diffusion.

Result: Produces high-quality anonymized faces less visually similar to originals, enables original face recovery only with correct secret key.

Conclusion: Proposed method successfully achieves secure, high-quality reversible face anonymization with improved privacy protection compared to previous approaches.

Abstract: Face images processed by computer vision algorithms contain sensitive
personal information that malicious actors can capture without consent. These
privacy and security risks highlight the need for effective face anonymization
methods. Current methods struggle to propose a good trade-off between a secure
scheme with high-quality image generation and reversibility for later person
authentication. Diffusion-based approaches produce high-quality anonymized
images but lack the secret key mechanism to ensure that only authorized parties
can reverse the process. In this paper, we introduce, to our knowledge, the
first secure, high-quality reversible anonymization method based on a diffusion
model. We propose to combine the secret key with the latent faces
representation of the diffusion model. To preserve identity-irrelevant
features, generation is constrained by a facial mask, maintaining high-quality
images. By using a deterministic forward and backward diffusion process, our
approach enforces that the original face can be recovered with the correct
secret key. We also show that the proposed method produces anonymized faces
that are less visually similar to the original faces, compared to other
previous work.

TL;DR: ADD is a new discrete diffusion framework that operates directly in one-hot space using float-encoded class data, avoiding continuous latent spaces or masking. It uses timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss to bridge discriminative and generative learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of pseudo-discrete diffusion methods that rely on continuous latent spaces or masking, and to create a more authentic discrete diffusion approach that preserves core diffusion characteristics.

Method: Directly uses float-encoded one-hot class data as diffusion input, introduces timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss between model outputs and original one-hot labels, creating synergy between discriminative and generative learning.

Result: Achieves superior performance on classification tasks compared to baseline, and exhibits excellent text generation capabilities on image captioning. Extensive ablations validate measurable gains from each component.

Conclusion: ADD fundamentally redefines discrete diffusion by preserving core characteristics in one-hot space, successfully bridging discriminative and generative learning while achieving strong performance on both classification and generation tasks.

Abstract: We propose an Authentic Discrete Diffusion (ADD) framework that fundamentally
redefines prior pseudo-discrete approaches by preserving core diffusion
characteristics directly in the one-hot space through a suite of coordinated
mechanisms. Unlike conventional "pseudo" discrete diffusion (PDD) methods, ADD
reformulates the diffusion input by directly using float-encoded one-hot class
data, without relying on diffusing in the continuous latent spaces or masking
policies. At its core, a timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss is introduced
between the diffusion model's outputs and the original one-hot labels. This
synergistic design establishes a bridge between discriminative and generative
learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ADD not only achieves superior
performance on classification tasks compared to the baseline, but also exhibits
excellent text generation capabilities on Image captioning. Extensive ablations
validate the measurable gains of each component.

Method: The framework uses three agents: Planner structures lecture content into coherent flows and prepares visual assets; Coder converts instructions into executable Python code with scope-guided auto-fix; Critic uses vision-language models with visual anchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity.

Result: Code2Video achieves 40% improvement over direct code generation and produces videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials. The framework was evaluated using the MMMC benchmark across multiple dimensions including aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and the novel TeachQuiz metric.

Conclusion: Code2Video demonstrates potential as a scalable, interpretable, and controllable approach for educational video generation, effectively addressing the limitations of pixel-space video synthesis models in professional educational contexts.

Abstract: While recent generative models advance pixel-space video synthesis, they
remain limited in producing professional educational videos, which demand
disciplinary knowledge, precise visual structures, and coherent transitions,
limiting their applicability in educational scenarios. Intuitively, such
requirements are better addressed through the manipulation of a renderable
environment, which can be explicitly controlled via logical commands (e.g.,
code). In this work, we propose Code2Video, a code-centric agent framework for
generating educational videos via executable Python code. The framework
comprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture
content into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual
assets; (ii) Coder, which converts structured instructions into executable
Python codes while incorporating scope-guided auto-fix to enhance efficiency;
and (iii) Critic, which leverages vision-language models (VLM) with visual
anchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity. To support
systematic evaluation, we build MMMC, a benchmark of professionally produced,
discipline-specific educational videos. We evaluate MMMC across diverse
dimensions, including VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and
particularly, TeachQuiz, a novel end-to-end metric that quantifies how well a
VLM, after unlearning, can recover knowledge by watching the generated videos.
Our results demonstrate the potential of Code2Video as a scalable,
interpretable, and controllable approach, achieving 40% improvement over direct

TL;DR: EvoWorld is a world model that combines panoramic video generation with evolving 3D memory to enable spatially consistent long-horizon exploration, using explicit 3D reconstruction as spatial guidance for video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by human ability to mentally explore and replay 3D environments, the paper aims to create a system that can generate spatially consistent long-horizon video exploration from single panoramic inputs.

Method: Given a panoramic image, EvoWorld: 1) generates future video frames with fine-grained view control, 2) evolves 3D reconstruction using a feedforward plug-and-play transformer, and 3) synthesizes futures by conditioning on geometric reprojections from the evolving 3D memory.

Result: The method significantly improves visual fidelity and maintains spatial scene coherence compared to existing approaches, as demonstrated through comprehensive benchmarks across synthetic outdoor, Habitat indoor, and real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: EvoWorld represents a significant advance toward long-horizon spatially consistent world modeling by exploiting evolving 3D reconstruction as explicit spatial guidance for video generation.

Abstract: Humans possess a remarkable ability to mentally explore and replay 3D
environments they have previously experienced. Inspired by this mental process,
we present EvoWorld: a world model that bridges panoramic video generation with
evolving 3D memory to enable spatially consistent long-horizon exploration.
Given a single panoramic image as input, EvoWorld first generates future video
frames by leveraging a video generator with fine-grained view control, then
evolves the scene's 3D reconstruction using a feedforward plug-and-play
transformer, and finally synthesizes futures by conditioning on geometric
reprojections from this evolving explicit 3D memory. Unlike prior
state-of-the-arts that synthesize videos only, our key insight lies in
exploiting this evolving 3D reconstruction as explicit spatial guidance for the
video generation process, projecting the reconstructed geometry onto target
viewpoints to provide rich spatial cues that significantly enhance both visual
realism and geometric consistency. To evaluate long-range exploration
capabilities, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark spanning synthetic
outdoor environments, Habitat indoor scenes, and challenging real-world
scenarios, with particular emphasis on loop-closure detection and spatial
coherence over extended trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our evolving 3D memory substantially improves visual fidelity and maintains
spatial scene coherence compared to existing approaches, representing a
significant advance toward long-horizon spatially consistent world modeling.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of insufficient prompt-side multimodal conditioning and mask boundary entanglement in videos with multiple subjects, enabling robust video editing without retraining.

Method: Uses prompt-guided multimodal alignment and prior-based mask retargeting modules to generate multimodal information and mask sequences, then feeds them into pretrained mask-driven video generation models.

Result: Extensive experiments on MSVBench show IMAGEdit consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods and demonstrates strong generalization capability.

Conclusion: IMAGEdit significantly expands video editing applicability by handling any number of subjects, is compatible with various mask-driven models, and improves overall performance without requiring training.

Abstract: In this paper, we present IMAGEdit, a training-free framework for any number
of video subject editing that manipulates the appearances of multiple
designated subjects while preserving non-target regions, without finetuning or
retraining. We achieve this by providing robust multimodal conditioning and
precise mask sequences through a prompt-guided multimodal alignment module and
a prior-based mask retargeting module. We first leverage large models'
understanding and generation capabilities to produce multimodal information and
mask motion sequences for multiple subjects across various types. Then, the
obtained prior mask sequences are fed into a pretrained mask-driven video
generation model to synthesize the edited video. With strong generalization
capability, IMAGEdit remedies insufficient prompt-side multimodal conditioning
and overcomes mask boundary entanglement in videos with any number of subjects,
thereby significantly expanding the applicability of video editing. More
importantly, IMAGEdit is compatible with any mask-driven video generation
model, significantly improving overall performance. Extensive experiments on
our newly constructed multi-subject benchmark MSVBench verify that IMAGEdit
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Code, models, and datasets are
publicly available at https://github.com/XWH-A/IMAGEdit.

*Xinyi Liu,Mohammadreza Fani Sani,Zewei Zhou,Julius Wirbel,Bahram Zarrin,Roberto Galeazzi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboPilot is a dual-thinking closed-loop framework for robotic manipulation that uses primitive actions and Chain-of-Thought reasoning to handle complex tasks in dynamic environments, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 25.9% in task success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous robotics approaches use open-loop paradigms with limited reasoning and no feedback, leading to poor robustness to environmental changes and severe error accumulation when executing complex or long-horizon tasks.

Method: RoboPilot leverages primitive actions for structured task planning and flexible action generation, introduces feedback for replanning from dynamic changes and execution errors, uses Chain-of-Thought reasoning for enhanced high-level planning, and dynamically switches between fast and slow thinking to balance efficiency and accuracy.

Result: RoboPilot outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 25.9% in task success rate, and real-world deployment on an industrial robot demonstrates its robustness in real-world settings. The system was evaluated using RoboPilot-Bench, a benchmark spanning 21 tasks across 10 categories.

Conclusion: The RoboPilot framework successfully addresses the limitations of current open-loop approaches by providing adaptive reasoning and closed-loop feedback for complex robotic manipulation tasks in dynamic environments, showing significant improvements in task success rates and real-world robustness.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in autonomous robotics, executing complex or
long-horizon tasks remains a fundamental challenge. Most current approaches
follow an open-loop paradigm with limited reasoning and no feedback, resulting
in poor robustness to environmental changes and severe error accumulation. We
present RoboPilot, a dual-thinking closed-loop framework for robotic
manipulation that supports adaptive reasoning for complex tasks in real-world
dynamic environments. RoboPilot leverages primitive actions for structured task
planning and flexible action generation, while introducing feedback to enable
replanning from dynamic changes and execution errors. Chain-of-Thought
reasoning further enhances high-level task planning and guides low-level action
generation. The system dynamically switches between fast and slow thinking to
balance efficiency and accuracy. To systematically evaluate the robustness of
RoboPilot in diverse robot manipulation scenarios, we introduce
RoboPilot-Bench, a benchmark spanning 21 tasks across 10 categories, including
infeasible-task recognition and failure recovery. Experiments show that
RoboPilot outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 25.9\% in task success
rate, and the real-world deployment on an industrial robot further demonstrates
its robustness in real-world settings.

### [99] [A Systematic Study of Large Language Models for Task and Motion Planning With PDDLStream](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00182)
*Jorge Mendez-Mendez*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LLMs integrated with TAMP systems show lower success rates and higher planning times than engineered planners, with geometric details increasing errors and faster non-reasoning LLM variants outperforming reasoning variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the extent of LLMs' planning capabilities for robotics tasks and explore integration of LLMs' semantic knowledge with formal reasoning of TAMP systems.

Method: Developed 16 algorithms using Gemini 2.5 Flash to substitute key TAMP components, conducting zero-shot experiments across 4,950 problems in three domains.

Result: Gemini-based planners exhibited lower success rates and higher planning times than engineered counterparts. Geometric details increased task-planning errors compared to pure PDDL descriptions, and faster non-reasoning LLM variants outperformed slower reasoning variants.

Conclusion: Current LLM integration with TAMP shows limitations, with non-reasoning variants performing better as the TAMP system can guide LLM corrections, suggesting careful design choices are needed for effective LLM-TAMP integration.

Abstract: Using large language models (LLMs) to solve complex robotics problems
requires understanding their planning capabilities. Yet while we know that LLMs
can plan on some problems, the extent to which these planning capabilities
cover the space of robotics tasks is unclear. One promising direction is to
integrate the semantic knowledge of LLMs with the formal reasoning of task and
motion planning (TAMP). However, the myriad of choices for how to integrate
LLMs within TAMP complicates the design of such systems. We develop 16
algorithms that use Gemini 2.5 Flash to substitute key TAMP components. Our
zero-shot experiments across 4,950 problems and three domains reveal that the
Gemini-based planners exhibit lower success rates and higher planning times
than their engineered counterparts. We show that providing geometric details
increases the number of task-planning errors compared to pure PDDL
descriptions, and that (faster) non-reasoning LLM variants outperform (slower)
reasoning variants in most cases, since the TAMP system can direct the LLM to
correct its mistakes.

### [100] [A Novel Robust Control Method Combining DNN-Based NMPC Approximation and PI Control: Application to Exoskeleton Squat Movements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00188)
*Alireza Aliyari,Gholamreza Vossoughi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hybrid controller combining NMPC-DNN with PI control is proposed to improve robustness in exoskeleton robots, achieving significantly lower tracking errors and reduced computational cost compared to traditional NMPC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NMPC is computationally expensive for robotic systems, and NMPC-DNN approximations lack robustness against disturbances or unseen conditions, leading to large tracking errors.

Method: Combines NMPC-DNN output with a PI controller (Hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI), trained on over 5.3 million samples using a human-robot dynamic model with three active joints (ankle, knee, hip).

Result: Under unseen conditions, Hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI shows significantly lower tracking errors than NMPC-DNN alone. Human joint torques reduced by 30.9% (ankle), 41.8% (knee), and 29.7% (hip). Computational cost reduced by 99.93% compared to NMPC.

Conclusion: The hybrid controller successfully addresses robustness issues of NMPC-DNN while maintaining computational efficiency, making it suitable for complex robotic systems like exoskeletons.

Abstract: Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is a precise controller, but its
heavy computational load often prevents application in robotic systems. Some
studies have attempted to approximate NMPC using deep neural networks
(NMPC-DNN). However, in the presence of unexpected disturbances or when
operating conditions differ from training data, this approach lacks robustness,
leading to large tracking errors. To address this issue, for the first time,
the NMPC-DNN output is combined with a PI controller (Hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI). The
proposed controller is validated by applying it to an exoskeleton robot during
squat movement, which has a complex dynamic model and has received limited
attention regarding robust nonlinear control design. A human-robot dynamic
model with three active joints (ankle, knee, hip) is developed, and more than
5.3 million training samples are used to train the DNN. The results show that,
under unseen conditions for the DNN, the tracking error in Hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI
is significantly lower compared to NMPC-DNN. Moreover, human joint torques are
greatly reduced with the use of the exoskeleton, with RMS values for the
studied case reduced by 30.9%, 41.8%, and 29.7% at the ankle, knee, and hip,
respectively. In addition, the computational cost of Hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI is
99.93% lower than that of NMPC.

### [101] [TGPO: Temporal Grounded Policy Optimization for Signal Temporal Logic Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00225)
*Yue Meng,Fei Chen,Chuchu Fan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TGPO is a hierarchical RL framework that decomposes Signal Temporal Logic tasks into timed subgoals and uses time-conditioned policies with dense rewards to solve complex long-horizon robotics tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL struggles with STL tasks due to their non-Markovian nature and sparse rewards. Existing approaches are limited to specific STL fragments or use sparse terminal rewards.

Method: TGPO decomposes STL into timed subgoals and invariant constraints. It has a high-level component that proposes time allocations and a low-level time-conditioned policy that learns with dense stage-wise rewards. Uses Metropolis-Hastings sampling for temporal search guided by learned critic.

Result: TGPO achieves 31.6% average improvement in task success rate compared to best baselines across five environments (navigation, manipulation, drone, quadrupedal locomotion), especially excelling in high-dimensional and long-horizon cases.

Conclusion: TGPO provides an effective hierarchical framework for solving general STL tasks by decomposing them into timed subgoals and using time-conditioned policies with dense rewards, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Learning control policies for complex, long-horizon tasks is a central
challenge in robotics and autonomous systems. Signal Temporal Logic (STL)
offers a powerful and expressive language for specifying such tasks, but its
non-Markovian nature and inherent sparse reward make it difficult to be solved
via standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. Prior RL approaches focus
only on limited STL fragments or use STL robustness scores as sparse terminal
rewards. In this paper, we propose TGPO, Temporal Grounded Policy Optimization,
to solve general STL tasks. TGPO decomposes STL into timed subgoals and
invariant constraints and provides a hierarchical framework to tackle the
problem. The high-level component of TGPO proposes concrete time allocations
for these subgoals, and the low-level time-conditioned policy learns to achieve
the sequenced subgoals using a dense, stage-wise reward signal. During
inference, we sample various time allocations and select the most promising
assignment for the policy network to rollout the solution trajectory. To foster
efficient policy learning for complex STL with multiple subgoals, we leverage
the learned critic to guide the high-level temporal search via
Metropolis-Hastings sampling, focusing exploration on temporally feasible
solutions. We conduct experiments on five environments, ranging from
low-dimensional navigation to manipulation, drone, and quadrupedal locomotion.
Under a wide range of STL tasks, TGPO significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines (especially for high-dimensional and long-horizon
cases), with an average of 31.6% improvement in task success rate compared to
the best baseline. The code will be available at

### [102] [BC-MPPI: A Probabilistic Constraint Layer for Safe Model-Predictive Path-Integral Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00272)
*Odichimnma Ezeji,Michael Ziegltrum,Giulio Turrisi,Tommaso Belvedere,Valerio Modugno*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: BC-MPPI is a safety layer for Model Predictive Path Integral control that uses probabilistic surrogates to ensure constraint satisfaction without requiring hand-tuned penalties or explicit sample rejection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MPPI control lacks hard guarantees on constraint satisfaction, which limits its applicability in safety-critical robotic tasks where collision avoidance and limit compliance are essential.

Method: Attaches probabilistic surrogates to state and input constraints that return feasibility probabilities for candidate trajectories, automatically down-weighting unsafe rollouts and pushing sampling toward safe regions.

Result: Successfully deployed on quadrotor in MuJoCo with static and moving obstacles, preserving safety margins while satisfying prescribed violation probabilities across various rollout counts.

Conclusion: BC-MPPI provides a lightweight, verifiable safety framework that integrates naturally with certification pipelines for autonomous systems, using stand-alone surrogate models that can be version-controlled.

Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control has recently emerged as a fast,
gradient-free alternative to model-predictive control in highly non-linear
robotic tasks, yet it offers no hard guarantees on constraint satisfaction. We
introduce Bayesian-Constraints MPPI (BC-MPPI), a lightweight safety layer that
attaches a probabilistic surrogate to every state and input constraint. At each
re-planning step the surrogate returns the probability that a candidate
trajectory is feasible; this joint probability scales the weight given to a
candidate, automatically down-weighting rollouts likely to collide or exceed
limits and pushing the sampling distribution toward the safe subset; no
hand-tuned penalty costs or explicit sample rejection required. We train the
surrogate from 1000 offline simulations and deploy the controller on a
quadrotor in MuJoCo with both static and moving obstacles. Across K in
[100,1500] rollouts BC-MPPI preserves safety margins while satisfying the
prescribed probability of violation. Because the surrogate is a stand-alone,
version-controlled artefact and the runtime safety score is a single scalar,
the approach integrates naturally with verification-and-validation pipelines
for certifiable autonomous systems.

*Sarmad Mehrdad,Maxime Sabbah,Vincent Bonnet,Ludovic Righetti*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MO-IRL efficiently models human arm movements with time-varying cost weights using minimal demonstrations, achieving better accuracy than static approaches and generalizing well across subjects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model human arm-reaching movements with dynamic cost functions that vary over time, addressing limitations of classical IRL approaches that require many demonstrations and assume static cost weights.

Method: Used MO-IRL with a planar two-link biomechanical model and motion-capture data, segmenting trajectories into phases and learning phase-specific combinations of seven candidate cost functions through iterative refinement.

Result: Achieved average joint-angle RMSE of 6.4-5.6 deg vs 10.4 deg for static weights, with cross-validation showing ~8 deg RMSE and successful inter-subject validation on unseen data.

Conclusion: MO-IRL can efficiently uncover dynamic, subject-independent cost structures in human motor control, with learned weights emphasizing joint acceleration minimization during movement transitions, supporting applications in humanoid robotics.

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Minimal Observation Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (MO-IRL) to model and predict human arm-reaching
movements with time-varying cost weights. Using a planar two-link biomechanical
model and high-resolution motion-capture data from subjects performing a
pointing task, we segment each trajectory into multiple phases and learn
phase-specific combinations of seven candidate cost functions. MO-IRL
iteratively refines cost weights by scaling observed and generated trajectories
in the maximum entropy IRL formulation, greatly reducing the number of required
demonstrations and convergence time compared to classical IRL approaches.
Training on ten trials per posture yields average joint-angle Root Mean Squared
Errors (RMSE) of 6.4 deg and 5.6 deg for six- and eight-segment weight
divisions, respectively, versus 10.4 deg using a single static weight.
Cross-validation on remaining trials and, for the first time, inter-subject
validation on an unseen subject's 20 trials, demonstrates comparable predictive
accuracy, around 8 deg RMSE, indicating robust generalization. Learned weights
emphasize joint acceleration minimization during movement onset and
termination, aligning with smoothness principles observed in biological motion.
These results suggest that MO-IRL can efficiently uncover dynamic,
subject-independent cost structures underlying human motor control, with
potential applications for humanoid robots.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DiSA-IQL, an offline RL method for soft snake robot control, addresses distribution shift by penalizing unreliable state-action pairs, outperforming baselines in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft snake robots have complex nonlinear dynamics that make control challenging. Existing controllers rely on simplified assumptions, while online DRL is impractical due to costly real-world interactions. Offline RL offers safety but suffers from distribution shift issues.

Method: Proposed DiSA-IQL (Distribution-Shift-Aware Implicit Q-Learning), an extension of IQL that incorporates robustness modulation by penalizing unreliable state-action pairs to mitigate distribution shift.

Result: DiSA-IQL consistently outperforms baseline models (BC, CQL, vanilla IQL) in goal-reaching tasks, achieving higher success rates, smoother trajectories, and improved robustness in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution evaluations.

Conclusion: DiSA-IQL effectively addresses distribution shift in offline RL for soft robot control, demonstrating superior performance and robustness compared to existing methods, with open-sourced code to support reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: Soft snake robots offer remarkable flexibility and adaptability in complex
environments, yet their control remains challenging due to highly nonlinear
dynamics. Existing model-based and bio-inspired controllers rely on simplified
assumptions that limit performance. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has
recently emerged as a promising alternative, but online training is often
impractical because of costly and potentially damaging real-world interactions.
Offline RL provides a safer option by leveraging pre-collected datasets, but it
suffers from distribution shift, which degrades generalization to unseen
scenarios. To overcome this challenge, we propose DiSA-IQL
(Distribution-Shift-Aware Implicit Q-Learning), an extension of IQL that
incorporates robustness modulation by penalizing unreliable state-action pairs
to mitigate distribution shift. We evaluate DiSA-IQL on goal-reaching tasks
across two settings: in-distribution and out-of-distribution evaluation.
Simulation results show that DiSA-IQL consistently outperforms baseline models,
including Behavior Cloning (BC), Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), and vanilla
IQL, achieving higher success rates, smoother trajectories, and improved
robustness. The codes are open-sourced to support reproducibility and to
facilitate further research in offline RL for soft robot control.

*Shounak Sural,Charles Kekeh,Wenliang Liu,Federico Pecora,Mouhacine Benosman*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PINCoDE uses neural Controlled Differential Equations with physics constraints for long-horizon multi-robot trajectory forecasting, achieving sub-0.5m error over 1-minute horizons and scaling from 10 to 100 robots without additional parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon motion forecasting for multiple autonomous robots is challenging due to non-linear interactions, compounding errors, and continuous-time dynamics. Learned dynamics can benefit applications like travel time prediction and planning.

Method: Developed PINCoDE (Physics-Informed Neural Controlled Differential Equations) that combines physics-informed constraints with neural CDEs to model multi-robot dynamics in continuous time, conditioned on future goals.

Result: Achieved average ADE below 0.5m for 1-minute horizon, scaled from 10 to 100 robots without additional parameters, and reduced forecasted pose error by 2.7X over 4-minute horizons compared to analytical models using progressive training.

Conclusion: PINCoDE effectively combines physics guidance with neural CDEs for accurate long-horizon multi-robot trajectory forecasting, demonstrating superior performance and scalability compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Long-horizon motion forecasting for multiple autonomous robots is challenging
due to non-linear agent interactions, compounding prediction errors, and
continuous-time evolution of dynamics. Learned dynamics of such a system can be
useful in various applications such as travel time prediction,
prediction-guided planning and generative simulation. In this work, we aim to
develop an efficient trajectory forecasting model conditioned on multi-agent
goals. Motivated by the recent success of physics-guided deep learning for
partially known dynamical systems, we develop a model based on neural
Controlled Differential Equations (CDEs) for long-horizon motion forecasting.
Unlike discrete-time methods such as RNNs and transformers, neural CDEs operate
in continuous time, allowing us to combine physics-informed constraints and
biases to jointly model multi-robot dynamics. Our approach, named PINCoDE
(Physics-Informed Neural Controlled Differential Equations), learns
differential equation parameters that can be used to predict the trajectories
of a multi-agent system starting from an initial condition. PINCoDE is
conditioned on future goals and enforces physics constraints for robot motion
over extended periods of time. We adopt a strategy that scales our model from
10 robots to 100 robots without the need for additional model parameters, while
producing predictions with an average ADE below 0.5 m for a 1-minute horizon.
Furthermore, progressive training with curriculum learning for our PINCoDE
model results in a 2.7X reduction of forecasted pose error over 4 minute
horizons compared to analytical models.

TL;DR: VLA-RFT is a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that uses a data-driven world model as a controllable simulator to enhance VLA models' robustness and generalization with minimal fine-tuning steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models suffer from compounding errors and poor robustness due to heavy reliance on imitation learning, while traditional RL approaches are costly or face sim-to-real gaps.

Method: Leverages a data-driven world model trained from real interaction data to predict future visual observations conditioned on actions, enabling policy rollouts with dense trajectory-level rewards from goal-achieving references.

Result: Achieves superior performance over supervised baselines with fewer than 400 fine-tuning steps, demonstrates greater efficiency than simulator-based RL, and maintains strong robustness under perturbed conditions.

Conclusion: World-model-based RFT serves as a practical post-training paradigm to enhance VLA models' generalization and robustness.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable embodied decision-making but rely
heavily on imitation learning, leading to compounding errors and poor
robustness under distribution shift. Reinforcement learning (RL) can mitigate
these issues yet typically demands costly real-world interactions or suffers
from sim-to-real gaps. We introduce VLA-RFT, a reinforcement fine-tuning
framework that leverages a data-driven world model as a controllable simulator.
Trained from real interaction data, the simulator predicts future visual
observations conditioned on actions, allowing policy rollouts with dense,
trajectory-level rewards derived from goal-achieving references. This design
delivers an efficient and action-aligned learning signal, drastically lowering
sample requirements. With fewer than 400 fine-tuning steps, VLA-RFT surpasses
strong supervised baselines and achieves greater efficiency than
simulator-based RL. Moreover, it exhibits strong robustness under perturbed
conditions, sustaining stable task execution. Our results establish
world-model-based RFT as a practical post-training paradigm to enhance the
generalization and robustness of VLA models. For more details, please refer to

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NeuRO is a learning-to-optimize framework that integrates perception networks with robust optimization to address data scarcity in visual navigation, enabling uncertainty-aware policies that generalize well to unseen environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual navigation faces data scarcity issues where policies overfit and fail to generalize out-of-distribution. Existing neural approaches increase architectural complexity but become counterproductive with limited data.

Method: NeuRO transforms noisy visual predictions into convex uncertainty sets using Partially Input Convex Neural Networks (PICNNs) with conformal calibration, and reformulates planning under partial observability as a robust optimization problem.

Result: Extensive experiments on unordered and sequential multi-object navigation tasks show that NeuRO achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in generalization to unseen environments.

Conclusion: NeuRO presents a significant advancement for developing robust, generalizable autonomous agents by tightly coupling perception with robust optimization.

Abstract: Visual navigation is a fundamental problem in embodied AI, yet practical
deployments demand long-horizon planning capabilities to address
multi-objective tasks. A major bottleneck is data scarcity: policies learned
from limited data often overfit and fail to generalize OOD. Existing neural
network-based agents typically increase architectural complexity that
paradoxically become counterproductive in the small-sample regime. This paper
introduce NeuRO, a integrated learning-to-optimize framework that tightly
couples perception networks with downstream task-level robust optimization.
Specifically, NeuRO addresses core difficulties in this integration: (i) it
transforms noisy visual predictions under data scarcity into convex uncertainty
sets using Partially Input Convex Neural Networks (PICNNs) with conformal
calibration, which directly parameterize the optimization constraints; and (ii)
it reformulates planning under partial observability as a robust optimization
problem, enabling uncertainty-aware policies that transfer across environments.
Extensive experiments on both unordered and sequential multi-object navigation
tasks demonstrate that NeuRO establishes SoTA performance, particularly in
generalization to unseen environments. Our work thus presents a significant
advancement for developing robust, generalizable autonomous agents.

TL;DR: Proposes an offline-to-online RL algorithm for robot social navigation using Return-to-Go prediction in a causal Transformer to address distribution shifts and improve navigation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of offline RL in robot social navigation, including uncertainties in pedestrian behavior and distribution shifts between offline training and online deployment.

Method: Integrates RTG prediction into causal Transformer with spatiotemporal fusion model for real-time RTG estimation, plus hybrid offline-online experience sampling for stable policy updates.

Result: Achieves higher success rate and lower collision rate than state-of-the-art baselines in simulated social navigation environments.

Conclusion: The algorithm enhances navigation policy robustness and adaptability, paving the way for more reliable robotic navigation systems in real-world applications.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising framework for
addressing robot social navigation challenges. However, inherent uncertainties
in pedestrian behavior and limited environmental interaction during training
often lead to suboptimal exploration and distributional shifts between offline
training and online deployment. To overcome these limitations, this paper
proposes a novel offline-to-online fine-tuning RL algorithm for robot social
navigation by integrating Return-to-Go (RTG) prediction into a causal
Transformer architecture. Our algorithm features a spatiotem-poral fusion model
designed to precisely estimate RTG values in real-time by jointly encoding
temporal pedestrian motion patterns and spatial crowd dynamics. This RTG
prediction framework mitigates distribution shift by aligning offline policy
training with online environmental interactions. Furthermore, a hybrid
offline-online experience sampling mechanism is built to stabilize policy
updates during fine-tuning, ensuring balanced integration of pre-trained
knowledge and real-time adaptation. Extensive experiments in simulated social
navigation environments demonstrate that our method achieves a higher success
rate and lower collision rate compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These
results underscore the efficacy of our algorithm in enhancing navigation policy
robustness and adaptability. This work paves the way for more reliable and
adaptive robotic navigation systems in real-world applications.

*Han Zhou,Jinjin Cao,Liyuan Ma,Xueji Fang,Guo-jun Qi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Traj2Action bridges the human-robot embodiment gap using 3D endpoint trajectories as intermediate representations, enabling scalable skill transfer from human videos to robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robot manipulation learning relies on costly teleoperated demonstrations, while human videos offer a scalable alternative but face challenges due to morphological differences between human and robot embodiments.

Method: The framework uses 3D operational endpoint trajectories as unified intermediate representations, first generating coarse trajectories as high-level motion plans using both human and robot data, then synthesizing precise robot-specific actions through a co-denoising framework.

Result: Real-world experiments on a Franka robot show 27% and 22.25% performance improvements over baseline on short- and long-horizon tasks, with significant gains as human data scales in robot policy learning.

Conclusion: Traj2Action effectively bridges the embodiment gap between humans and robots, enabling scalable manipulation skill transfer from human videos to real-world robotic systems.

Abstract: Learning diverse manipulation skills for real-world robots is severely
bottlenecked by the reliance on costly and hard-to-scale teleoperated
demonstrations. While human videos offer a scalable alternative, effectively
transferring manipulation knowledge is fundamentally hindered by the
significant morphological gap between human and robotic embodiments. To address
this challenge and facilitate skill transfer from human to robot, we introduce
Traj2Action,a novel framework that bridges this embodiment gap by using the 3D
trajectory of the operational endpoint as a unified intermediate
representation, and then transfers the manipulation knowledge embedded in this
trajectory to the robot's actions. Our policy first learns to generate a coarse
trajectory, which forms an high-level motion plan by leveraging both human and
robot data. This plan then conditions the synthesis of precise, robot-specific
actions (e.g., orientation and gripper state) within a co-denoising framework.
Extensive real-world experiments on a Franka robot demonstrate that Traj2Action
boosts the performance by up to 27% and 22.25% over $\pi_0$ baseline on short-
and long-horizon real-world tasks, and achieves significant gains as human data
scales in robot policy learning. Our project website, featuring code and video
demonstrations, is available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A two-stage outlier detection method for GNSS-RTK/INS/odometer fusion that uses Doppler measurements and IMU/odometer constraints to identify and reject pseudo-range outliers in complex urban environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable GNSS positioning in complex environments is challenging due to NLOS propagation, multipath effects, and signal blockages that introduce large outliers into pseudo-range measurements, degrading RTK positioning performance.

Method: Two-stage outlier detection: 1) GNSS-only detection using Doppler measurements as stable reference, 2) Refined detection using pre-integrated IMU and odometer constraints to generate predicted double-difference pseudo-range measurements.

Result: Significant reduction in pseudo-range outlier impact with 42.3% improvement in positioning accuracy, reducing RMSE from 0.52m to 0.30m in deep urban canyon tests.

Conclusion: The proposed two-stage detection framework achieves improved robustness against gross pseudo-range errors and degraded satellite measuring quality, leading to enhanced positioning accuracy and consistency in challenging environments.

Abstract: Reliable GNSS positioning in complex environments remains a critical
challenge due to non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation, multipath effects, and
frequent signal blockages. These effects can easily introduce large outliers
into the raw pseudo-range measurements, which significantly degrade the
performance of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) real-time kinematic
(RTK) positioning and limit the effectiveness of tightly coupled GNSS-based
integrated navigation system. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage
outlier detection method and apply the method in a tightly coupled GNSS-RTK,
inertial navigation system (INS), and odometer integration based on factor
graph optimization (FGO). In the first stage, Doppler measurements are employed
to detect pseudo-range outliers in a GNSS-only manner, since Doppler is less
sensitive to multipath and NLOS effects compared with pseudo-range, making it a
more stable reference for detecting sudden inconsistencies. In the second
stage, pre-integrated inertial measurement units (IMU) and odometer constraints
are used to generate predicted double-difference pseudo-range measurements,
which enable a more refined identification and rejection of remaining outliers.
By combining these two complementary stages, the system achieves improved
robustness against both gross pseudo-range errors and degraded satellite
measuring quality. The experimental results demonstrate that the two-stage
detection framework significantly reduces the impact of pseudo-range outliers,
and leads to improved positioning accuracy and consistency compared with
representative baseline approaches. In the deep urban canyon test, the outlier
mitigation method has limits the RMSE of GNSS-RTK/INS/odometer fusion from 0.52
m to 0.30 m, with 42.3% improvement.

*Yen-Ling Tai,Yi-Ru Yang,Kuan-Ting Yu,Yu-Wei Chao,Yi-Ting Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GRITS is a spillage-aware guided diffusion policy for robotic food scooping that uses a spillage predictor to minimize food spillage while maintaining task success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robot learning algorithms struggle with diverse and dynamic food states during scooping tasks, leading to spillage and reduced reliability.

Method: Uses guided diffusion policy with a spillage predictor trained on simulated food spillage scenarios. The predictor estimates spillage probability and guides diffusion sampling toward safer trajectories.

Result: Achieved 82% task success rate and 4% spillage rate on real-world robotic platform, reducing spillage by over 40% compared to baselines without guidance.

Conclusion: GRITS effectively minimizes food spillage while maintaining high task success rates, demonstrating the value of spillage-aware guidance in robotic food manipulation.

Abstract: Robotic food scooping is a critical manipulation skill for food preparation
and service robots. However, existing robot learning algorithms, especially
learn-from-demonstration methods, still struggle to handle diverse and dynamic
food states, which often results in spillage and reduced reliability. In this
work, we introduce GRITS: A Spillage-Aware Guided Diffusion Policy for Robot
Food Scooping Tasks. This framework leverages guided diffusion policy to
minimize food spillage during scooping and to ensure reliable transfer of food
items from the initial to the target location. Specifically, we design a
spillage predictor that estimates the probability of spillage given current
observation and action rollout. The predictor is trained on a simulated dataset
with food spillage scenarios, constructed from four primitive shapes (spheres,
cubes, cones, and cylinders) with varied physical properties such as mass,
friction, and particle size. At inference time, the predictor serves as a
differentiable guidance signal, steering the diffusion sampling process toward
safer trajectories while preserving task success. We validate GRITS on a
real-world robotic food scooping platform. GRITS is trained on six food
categories and evaluated on ten unseen categories with different shapes and
quantities. GRITS achieves an 82% task success rate and a 4% spillage rate,
reducing spillage by over 40% compared to baselines without guidance, thereby
demonstrating its effectiveness.

*Pietro Mazzaglia,Cansu Sancaktar,Markus Peschl,Daniel Dijkman*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HyT enables VLAs to benefit from CoT training while allowing direct action prediction during inference, improving performance without increasing inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CoT improves performance but increases inference time, which is problematic for real-time robotic applications requiring long action sequences.

Method: Hybrid Training (HyT) framework that trains VLAs on both thoughts and actions, enabling conditional prediction of diverse outputs during inference.

Result: HyT achieves performance gains similar to CoT methods while allowing faster inference by skipping thought generation when needed.

Conclusion: HyT provides the benefits of CoT training without the inference-time overhead, making it suitable for real-world robotic applications.

Abstract: Using Large Language Models to produce intermediate thoughts, a.k.a.
Chain-of-thought (CoT), before providing an answer has been a successful recipe
for solving complex language tasks. In robotics, similar embodied CoT
strategies, generating thoughts before actions, have also been shown to lead to
improved performance when using Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs). As these
techniques increase the length of the model's generated outputs to include the
thoughts, the inference time is negatively affected. Delaying an agent's
actions in real-world executions, as in robotic manipulation settings, strongly
affects the usability of a method, as tasks require long sequences of actions.
However, is the generation of long chains-of-thought a strong prerequisite for
achieving performance improvements? In this work, we explore the idea of Hybrid
Training (HyT), a framework that enables VLAs to learn from thoughts and
benefit from the associated performance gains, while enabling the possibility
to leave out CoT generation during inference. Furthermore, by learning to
conditionally predict a diverse set of outputs, HyT supports flexibility at
inference time, enabling the model to either predict actions directly, generate
thoughts or follow instructions. We evaluate the proposed method in a series of
simulated benchmarks and real-world experiments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A method to assess automated driving model competence by modeling driving data as knowledge graphs and analyzing sub-scene coverage in training datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure reliable machine learning in automated driving by recognizing situations that vehicles haven't been sufficiently trained on, improving operational risk assessment and explainability.

Method: Model driving data as knowledge graphs with entities and relationships, query for specific sub-scene configurations, and estimate vehicle competence based on coverage and complexity of sub-scenes in training data.

Result: Applied to NuPlan dataset, successfully modeled driving scenes with knowledge graphs and analyzed coverage of specific driving scenarios.

Conclusion: This approach enables monitoring of ML model competence in automated driving, which is crucial for trustworthy AI deployment and safety assurance.

Abstract: Automated driving functions increasingly rely on machine learning for tasks
like perception and trajectory planning, requiring large, relevant datasets.
The performance of these algorithms depends on how closely the training data
matches the task. To ensure reliable functioning, it is crucial to know what is
included in the dataset to assess the trained model's operational risk. We aim
to enhance the safe use of machine learning in automated driving by developing
a method to recognize situations that an automated vehicle has not been
sufficiently trained on. This method also improves explainability by describing
the dataset at a human-understandable level. We propose modeling driving data
as knowledge graphs, representing driving scenes with entities and their
relationships. These graphs are queried for specific sub-scene configurations
to check their occurrence in the dataset. We estimate a vehicle's competence in
a driving scene by considering the coverage and complexity of sub-scene
configurations in the training set. Higher complexity scenes require greater
coverage for high competence. We apply this method to the NuPlan dataset,
modeling it with knowledge graphs and analyzing the coverage of specific
driving scenes. This approach helps monitor the competence of machine learning
models trained on the dataset, which is essential for trustworthy AI to be
deployed in automated driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for efficient observer design and accurate sensor fusion in state estimation for general nonlinear systems with multiple sensors.

Method: Trajectory Based Optimization Design (TBOD) uses parametrized observer dynamics and pre-recorded measurement trajectories to tune observer parameters through numerical optimization, building on classic observer theory and Moving Horizon Estimators.

Result: TBOD was tested on a terrestrial rover localization problem combining IMU and Ultra Wide Band ranging sensors, matching Extended Kalman Filter's position estimation accuracy while significantly improving orientation estimation.

Conclusion: TBOD provides a lightweight, general-purpose sensor fusion methodology with efficient handling of general sensors and straightforward tuning procedure.

Abstract: Efficient observer design and accurate sensor fusion are key in state
estimation. This work proposes an optimization-based methodology, termed
Trajectory Based Optimization Design (TBOD), allowing the user to easily design
observers for general nonlinear systems and multi-sensor setups. Starting from
parametrized observer dynamics, the proposed method considers a finite set of
pre-recorded measurement trajectories from the nominal plant and exploits them
to tune the observer parameters through numerical optimization. This research
hinges on the classic observer's theory and Moving Horizon Estimators
methodology. Optimization is exploited to ease the observer's design, providing
the user with a lightweight, general-purpose sensor fusion methodology. TBOD's
main characteristics are the capability to handle general sensors efficiently
and in a modular way and, most importantly, its straightforward tuning
procedure. The TBOD's performance is tested on a terrestrial rover localization
problem, combining IMU and ranging sensors provided by Ultra Wide Band
antennas, and validated through a motion-capture system. Comparison with an
Extended Kalman Filter is also provided, matching its position estimation
accuracy and significantly improving in the orientation.

TL;DR: EV-Pose is a drone-oriented Visual Positioning Service that uses event cameras for accurate 6-DoF pose tracking, achieving 1.34° rotation accuracy and 6.9mm translation accuracy with 10.08ms latency, enabling precise drone landings in urban environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Visual Positioning Service (VPS) systems have limitations in accuracy and efficiency when deployed on drones for landing in urban environments where GPS is unreliable due to signal issues.

Method: EV-Pose introduces a spatio-temporal feature-instructed pose estimation module with temporal distance field for 3D point map matching, and a motion-aware hierarchical fusion and optimization scheme that utilizes drone motion in both early event filtering and later pose optimization stages.

Result: EV-Pose achieves rotation accuracy of 1.34° and translation accuracy of 6.9mm with tracking latency of 10.08ms, outperforming baselines by >50%.

Conclusion: EV-Pose enables accurate, high-frequency 6-DoF pose tracking for drone landing, addressing the limitations of current VPS systems in urban environments.

Abstract: After years of growth, drone-based delivery is transforming logistics. At its
core, real-time 6-DoF drone pose tracking enables precise flight control and
accurate drone landing. With the widespread availability of urban 3D maps, the
Visual Positioning Service (VPS), a mobile pose estimation system, has been
adapted to enhance drone pose tracking during the landing phase, as
conventional systems like GPS are unreliable in urban environments due to
signal attenuation and multi-path propagation. However, deploying the current
VPS on drones faces limitations in both estimation accuracy and efficiency. In
this work, we redesign drone-oriented VPS with the event camera and introduce
EV-Pose to enable accurate, high-frequency 6-DoF pose tracking for accurate
drone landing. EV-Pose introduces a spatio-temporal feature-instructed pose
estimation module that extracts a temporal distance field to enable 3D point
map matching for pose estimation; and a motion-aware hierarchical fusion and
optimization scheme to enhance the above estimation in accuracy and efficiency,
by utilizing drone motion in the \textit{early stage} of event filtering and
the \textit{later stage} of pose optimization. Evaluation shows that EV-Pose
achieves a rotation accuracy of 1.34$\degree$ and a translation accuracy of
6.9$mm$ with a tracking latency of 10.08$ms$, outperforming baselines by
$>$50\%, \tmcrevise{thus enabling accurate drone landings.} Demo:

*Myungkyu Koo,Daewon Choi,Taeyoung Kim,Kyungmin Lee,Changyeon Kim,Youngyo Seo,Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HAMLET is a framework that adapts Vision-Language-Action models to use historical context through moment tokens and a lightweight memory module, significantly improving performance on history-dependent tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic manipulation tasks are inherently history-dependent, but most VLAs ignore past context and rely only on current observations, limiting their performance on tasks requiring historical understanding.

Method: Introduces moment tokens that compactly encode perceptual information at each timestep, initialized with time-contrastive learning. Uses a lightweight memory module to integrate moment tokens across past timesteps into memory features for action prediction.

Result: Achieves 76.4% success rate on history-dependent real-world tasks (47.2% improvement over baseline), improves RoboCasa Kitchen performance from 64.1% to 66.4%, and LIBERO from 95.6% to 97.7%.

Conclusion: HAMLET effectively transforms state-of-the-art VLAs into history-aware policies, demonstrating significant improvements on long-horizon tasks requiring historical context across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Inherently, robotic manipulation tasks are history-dependent: leveraging past
context could be beneficial. However, most existing Vision-Language-Action
models (VLAs) have been designed without considering this aspect, i.e., they
rely solely on the current observation, ignoring preceding context. In this
paper, we propose HAMLET, a scalable framework to adapt VLAs to attend to the
historical context during action prediction. Specifically, we introduce moment
tokens that compactly encode perceptual information at each timestep. Their
representations are initialized with time-contrastive learning, allowing them
to better capture temporally distinctive aspects. Next, we employ a lightweight
memory module that integrates the moment tokens across past timesteps into
memory features, which are then leveraged for action prediction. Through
empirical evaluation, we show that HAMLET successfully transforms a
state-of-the-art VLA into a history-aware policy, especially demonstrating
significant improvements on long-horizon tasks that require historical context.
In particular, on top of GR00T N1.5, HAMLET achieves an average success rate of
76.4% on history-dependent real-world tasks, surpassing the baseline
performance by 47.2%. Furthermore, HAMLET pushes prior art performance from
64.1% to 66.4% on RoboCasa Kitchen (100-demo setup) and from 95.6% to 97.7% on
LIBERO, highlighting its effectiveness even under generic robot-manipulation
benchmarks.

TL;DR: Proposes Cross-State Transition Attention Transformer with State Transition Attention mechanism to improve robotic manipulation policies by modeling temporal state evolution patterns and enabling better adaptation to execution variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard supervised learning from demonstrations struggles when policies encounter execution variations not covered in training. Existing attention mechanisms process past states without explicitly modeling temporal structure like failure and recovery patterns.

Method: Uses State Transition Attention mechanism to modulate standard attention weights based on learned state evolution patterns, combined with temporal masking during training where visual information is randomly removed from recent timesteps to encourage temporal reasoning.

Result: Outperforms standard cross-attention and temporal modeling approaches (TCN, LSTM) across all tasks, achieving more than 2x improvement over cross-attention on precision-critical tasks in simulation.

Conclusion: The proposed Cross-State Transition Attention Transformer with structured attention and temporal masking enables policies to better adapt behavior based on execution history and improves robustness to execution variations.

Abstract: Learning robotic manipulation policies through supervised learning from
demonstrations remains challenging when policies encounter execution variations
not explicitly covered during training. While incorporating historical context
through attention mechanisms can improve robustness, standard approaches
process all past states in a sequence without explicitly modeling the temporal
structure that demonstrations may include, such as failure and recovery
patterns. We propose a Cross-State Transition Attention Transformer that
employs a novel State Transition Attention (STA) mechanism to modulate standard
attention weights based on learned state evolution patterns, enabling policies
to better adapt their behavior based on execution history. Our approach
combines this structured attention with temporal masking during training, where
visual information is randomly removed from recent timesteps to encourage
temporal reasoning from historical context. Evaluation in simulation shows that
STA consistently outperforms standard cross-attention and temporal modeling
approaches like TCN and LSTM networks across all tasks, achieving more than 2x
improvement over cross-attention on precision-critical tasks.

TL;DR: Proposes a hybrid Imitation Learning-Visual Servoing framework for robotic fabric flattening that can align random wrinkled fabric states to arbitrary wrinkle-free target states with zero-shot capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in robotic fabric manipulation including fabric deformability, infinite degrees of freedom, and occlusions from wrinkles and manipulator components during garment production tasks like sewing, cutting, and ironing.

Method: Uses a hybrid IL-VS framework with template-based mesh representation: IL learns coarse alignment using explicit fabric models, while VS handles fine alignment. Introduces RTFF-MACT (Mesh Action Chunking Transformer) that conditions mesh information into Transformer-based policy.

Result: Validated on real dual-arm tele-operation system, achieving zero-shot alignment to different targets with high accuracy and strong generalization across various fabrics and scales.

Conclusion: The proposed RTFF policy successfully addresses fabric manipulation challenges through mesh-based representation and hybrid learning framework, demonstrating robust performance in real-world applications.

Abstract: Robotic fabric manipulation in garment production for sewing, cutting, and
ironing requires reliable flattening and alignment, yet remains challenging due
to fabric deformability, effectively infinite degrees of freedom, and frequent
occlusions from wrinkles, folds, and the manipulator's End-Effector (EE) and
arm. To address these issues, this paper proposes the first Random-to-Target
Fabric Flattening (RTFF) policy, which aligns a random wrinkled fabric state to
an arbitrary wrinkle-free target state. The proposed policy adopts a hybrid
Imitation Learning-Visual Servoing (IL-VS) framework, where IL learns with
explicit fabric models for coarse alignment of the wrinkled fabric toward a
wrinkle-free state near the target, and VS ensures fine alignment to the
target. Central to this framework is a template-based mesh that offers precise
target state representation, wrinkle-aware geometry prediction, and consistent
vertex correspondence across RTFF manipulation steps, enabling robust
manipulation and seamless IL-VS switching. Leveraging the power of mesh, a
novel IL solution for RTFF-Mesh Action Chunking Transformer (MACT)-is then
proposed by conditioning the mesh information into a Transformer-based policy.
The RTFF policy is validated on a real dual-arm tele-operation system, showing
zero-shot alignment to different targets, high accuracy, and strong
generalization across fabrics and scales. Project website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current industrial standards focus only on production phase and processes, not covering complete product life cycle or incorporating end-of-life impacts into engineering phase.

Method: Extends PPR modeling paradigm to include product structure as basis and incorporates repairing, remanufacturing, or upcycling within cyber-physical production systems, using digital shadows in Asset Administration Shells serialized in AutomationML.

Result: Developed PoPAN model that accompanies products throughout entire life cycle, demonstrated through electric vehicle battery disassembly use-case for remanufacturing into stationary battery applications.

Conclusion: The proposed modeling approach successfully integrates end-of-life considerations into product engineering, enabling better lifecycle management and supporting circular economy practices like remanufacturing.

Abstract: Current products, especially in the automotive sector, pose complex technical
systems having a multi-disciplinary mechatronic nature. Industrial standards
supporting system engineering and production typically (i) address the
production phase only, but do not cover the complete product life cycle, and
(ii) focus on production processes and resources rather than the products
themselves. The presented approach is motivated by incorporating impacts of
end-of-life phase of the product life cycle into the engineering phase. This
paper proposes a modelling approach coming up from the Product-Process-Resource
(PPR) modeling paradigm. It combines requirements on (i) respecting the product
structure as a basis for the model, and (ii) it incorporates repairing,
remanufacturing, or upcycling within cyber-physical production systems. The
proposed model called PoPAN should accompany the product during the entire life
cycle as a digital shadow encapsulated within the Asset Administration Shell of
a product. To facilitate the adoption of the proposed paradigm, the paper also
proposes serialization of the model in the AutomationML data format. The model
is demonstrated on a use-case for disassembling electric vehicle batteries to
support their remanufacturing for stationary battery applications.

Motivation: To address challenges in robot Visual-Inertial Navigation such as limited time and energy resources, requiring efficient feature selection methods.

Method: Four approximation algorithms: classic greedy method, low-rank greedy variant, randomized greedy sampler, and linearization-based selector using first-order Taylor expansion.

Result: Extensive experiments validate strong approximation guarantees and enable real-time deployment on standardized benchmarks and custom control-aware platform.

Conclusion: The proposed framework achieves efficient visual feature selection with rigorous performance bounds, making real-time Visual-Inertial Navigation feasible under resource constraints.

Abstract: This paper presents a task-oriented computational framework to enhance
Visual-Inertial Navigation (VIN) in robots, addressing challenges such as
limited time and energy resources. The framework strategically selects visual
features using a Mean Squared Error (MSE)-based, non-submodular objective
function and a simplified dynamic anticipation model. To address the
NP-hardness of this problem, we introduce four polynomial-time approximation
algorithms: a classic greedy method with constant-factor guarantees; a low-rank
greedy variant that significantly reduces computational complexity; a
randomized greedy sampler that balances efficiency and solution quality; and a
linearization-based selector based on a first-order Taylor expansion for
near-constant-time execution. We establish rigorous performance bounds by
leveraging submodularity ratios, curvature, and element-wise curvature
analyses. Extensive experiments on both standardized benchmarks and a custom
control-aware platform validate our theoretical results, demonstrating that
these methods achieve strong approximation guarantees while enabling real-time

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: General Policy Composition (GPC) is a training-free method that combines multiple pre-trained diffusion-based robotic control policies via convex composition of their distributional scores, achieving performance superior to any individual policy without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost of acquiring large-scale interaction datasets constrains the advancement of diffusion-based robotic control policies, creating a need for methods that enhance performance without requiring additional model training.

Method: GPC combines distributional scores from multiple pre-trained policies through convex composition and test-time search, allowing plug-and-play integration of heterogeneous policies (VA, VLA, diffusion, flow-matching) regardless of their visual input modalities.

Result: Experiments on Robomimic, PushT, and RoboTwin benchmarks plus real-world robotic evaluations show GPC consistently improves performance and adaptability across diverse tasks, with composed policies exceeding individual parent policy performance.

Conclusion: GPC provides a simple yet effective training-free method for improving robotic control performance by leveraging existing policies through theoretical foundation and empirical validation.

Abstract: Diffusion-based models for robotic control, including vision-language-action
(VLA) and vision-action (VA) policies, have demonstrated significant
capabilities. Yet their advancement is constrained by the high cost of
acquiring large-scale interaction datasets. This work introduces an alternative
paradigm for enhancing policy performance without additional model training.
Perhaps surprisingly, we demonstrate that the composed policies can exceed the
performance of either parent policy. Our contribution is threefold. First, we
establish a theoretical foundation showing that the convex composition of
distributional scores from multiple diffusion models can yield a superior
one-step functional objective compared to any individual score. A
Gr\"onwall-type bound is then used to show that this single-step improvement
propagates through entire generation trajectories, leading to systemic
performance gains. Second, motivated by these results, we propose General
Policy Composition (GPC), a training-free method that enhances performance by
combining the distributional scores of multiple pre-trained policies via a
convex combination and test-time search. GPC is versatile, allowing for the
plug-and-play composition of heterogeneous policies, including VA and VLA
models, as well as those based on diffusion or flow-matching, irrespective of
their input visual modalities. Third, we provide extensive empirical
validation. Experiments on Robomimic, PushT, and RoboTwin benchmarks, alongside
real-world robotic evaluations, confirm that GPC consistently improves
performance and adaptability across a diverse set of tasks. Further analysis of
alternative composition operators and weighting strategies offers insights into
the mechanisms underlying the success of GPC. These results establish GPC as a
simple yet effective method for improving control performance by leveraging
existing policies.

*Matthew Woodward*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A real-time trajectory generation method and controller for hopping robots that enables complex aerial trajectories while maintaining orientation control at touchdown.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hopping robots lack direct control over aerial trajectories and cannot transition to flight, which limits their efficiency benefits compared to purely flying systems.

Method: Developed a non-linear drag compensated trajectory generation methodology with a Lyapunov-based controller for real-time trajectory following from liftoff to touchdown.

Result: The system can create and follow complex aerial trajectories while maintaining strict orientation control at touchdown on both horizontal and vertical surfaces.

Conclusion: The computationally efficient approach provides broad applicability across all size scales of hopping robots while maintaining relevance to quadrotors in general.

Abstract: The advent of rotor-based hopping robots has created very capable hopping
platforms with high agility and efficiency, and similar controllability, as
compared to their purely flying quadrotor counterparts. Advances in robot
performance have increased the hopping height to greater than 4 meters and
opened up the possibility for more complex aerial trajectories (i.e.,
behaviors). However, currently hopping robots do not directly control their
aerial trajectory or transition to flight, eliminating the efficiency benefits
of a hopping system. Here we show a real-time, computationally efficiency,
non-linear drag compensated, trajectory generation methodology and accompanying
Lyapunov-based controller. The combined system can create and follow complex
aerial trajectories from liftoff to touchdown on horizontal and vertical
surfaces, while maintaining strick control over the orientation at touchdown.
The computational efficiency provides broad applicability across all size
scales of hopping robots while maintaining applicability to quadrotors in
general.

Result: ARS achieves up to 53% token reduction, 46.1% latency reduction, and 57.9% energy reduction across mathematical reasoning benchmarks while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Conclusion: ARS provides an effective training-free solution for improving computational efficiency in large reasoning models through adaptive reasoning suppression.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs or LRMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, but suffer from significant

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a complete void in consensus formation mechanisms for AI policy, and designing wise AI policy requires placing a premium on rigorous evidence and scientific consensus.

Method: Recommend initial pilots for NeurIPS by distilling lessons from the IPCC's leadership in building scientific consensus on climate policy.

Result: Identifies NeurIPS as the best option for catalyzing AI policy consensus due to its strengths and the lack of compelling alternatives.

Conclusion: NeurIPS should champion scientific consensus to create higher quality AI policy, as it already leads AI on many fronts and policy engagement is within its purview.

Abstract: Designing wise AI policy is a grand challenge for society. To design such
policy, policymakers should place a premium on rigorous evidence and scientific
consensus. While several mechanisms exist for evidence generation, and nascent
mechanisms tackle evidence synthesis, we identify a complete void on consensus
formation. In this position paper, we argue NeurIPS should actively catalyze
scientific consensus on AI policy. Beyond identifying the current deficit in
consensus formation mechanisms, we argue that NeurIPS is the best option due
its strengths and the paucity of compelling alternatives. To make progress, we
recommend initial pilots for NeurIPS by distilling lessons from the IPCC's
leadership to build scientific consensus on climate policy. We dispel
predictable counters that AI researchers disagree too much to achieve consensus
and that policy engagement is not the business of NeurIPS. NeurIPS leads AI on
many fronts, and it should champion scientific consensus to create higher
quality AI policy.

*Sagnik Basu,Shubham Prakash,Ashish Maruti Barge,Siddharth D Jaiswal,Abhisek Dash,Saptarshi Ghosh,Animesh Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper audits vision language models (VLMs) for bail decision prediction, finding poor performance and high-confidence wrong denials, then proposes interventions using RAG and fine-tuning to improve results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of VLMs, legal judgment systems can now use criminal images alongside text, but this poses risks of misuse and unintended consequences that need investigation.

Method: The authors conducted an audit of standalone VLMs for bail prediction, then designed interventions including legal precedents via RAG pipeline and innovative fine-tuning schemes.

Result: Standalone VLMs performed poorly across intersectional groups and wrongly denied bail to deserving individuals with high confidence. The proposed interventions substantially improved bail prediction performance.

Conclusion: This work provides a foundation for developing smarter interventions on VLMs before real-world deployment in legal judgment prediction systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively used for legal judgment
prediction tasks based on case reports and crime history. However, with a surge
in the availability of large vision language models (VLMs), legal judgment
prediction systems can now be made to leverage the images of the criminals in
addition to the textual case reports/crime history. Applications built in this
way could lead to inadvertent consequences and be used with malicious intent.
In this work, we run an audit to investigate the efficiency of standalone VLMs
in the bail decision prediction task. We observe that the performance is poor
across multiple intersectional groups and models \textit{wrongly deny bail to
deserving individuals with very high confidence}. We design different
intervention algorithms by first including legal precedents through a RAG
pipeline and then fine-tuning the VLMs using innovative schemes. We demonstrate
that these interventions substantially improve the performance of bail
prediction. Our work paves the way for the design of smarter interventions on
VLMs in the future, before they can be deployed for real-world legal judgment
prediction.

challenges due to the subtlety and dispersion of evidence across complex,
multi-year financial disclosures. In this work, we introduce a novel

Motivation: Traditional approaches of hand-coding recovery rules by safety engineers cannot anticipate the vast range of real-world contingencies and quickly become incomplete, requiring more adaptive decision-making for sudden events.

Method: Using embodied AI powered by large visual language models to provide commonsense reasoning for assessing context and generating appropriate actions in real time, demonstrated in a simulated urban benchmark in Unreal Engine.

Result: Drones successfully dynamically interpret their surroundings and decide on sudden maneuvers for safe landings, enabling adaptive recovery and decision-making pipelines that were previously infeasible to design by hand.

Conclusion: Embodied AI makes possible a new class of adaptive recovery and decision-making pipelines, advancing resilience and safety in autonomous aerial systems.

Abstract: Autonomous drones must often respond to sudden events, such as alarms,
faults, or unexpected changes in their environment, that require immediate and
adaptive decision-making. Traditional approaches rely on safety engineers
hand-coding large sets of recovery rules, but this strategy cannot anticipate
the vast range of real-world contingencies and quickly becomes incomplete.
Recent advances in embodied AI, powered by large visual language models,

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Thinkquel is a fine-tuned model that transforms natural language into reliable database queries using synthetic data and reinforcement learning to bridge token-level training with sequence-level execution validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language to SQL conversion faces challenges with schema linking, SQL dialect specificity, and misalignment between token-level training objectives and sequence-level execution validation signals.

Method: Combines TS-SQL synthetic data pipeline using dbt as portable intermediate representation with Token-Sequence GRPO reinforcement learning to align token-level training with sequence-level execution rewards.

Result: Thinkquel (32B) achieves 93.2% execution success and 61.8% exact-result match on TS-SQL test set, improving base model by 67.2% and 44.4% respectively. TS-GRPO improves training stability and convergence speed in Spider experiments.

Conclusion: Thinkquel demonstrates that combining synthetic data generation with span-aware reinforcement learning effectively bridges the gap between token-level training and sequence-level execution validation for robust natural language to SQL conversion.

Abstract: Transforming natural-language requests into reliable, production-ready data
transformations remains challenging: correctness depends on precise schema
linking and warehouse-specific SQL dialects, while the strongest supervision
available during training--execution success and result matching--are provided
only at the sequence level. At the same time, assembling large,
execution-validated corpora is costly, and token-level objectives misalign with
these global signals, yielding unstable optimization and limited portability.
We introduce Thinkquel, a fine-tuned model for producing robust, portable, and
execution-validated database queries. Methodologies in Thinkquel integrates a
novel synthetic data pipeline, TS-SQL, that leverages dbt as a portable
intermediate representation with a span-aware reinforcement learning objective,
and Token-Sequence GRPO (TS-GRPO), specifically designed to bridge the gap
between token-level training signals and sequence-level execution rewards when
finetuning LLMs. On the 500-example TS-SQL test set, Thinkquel (32B) reaches
93.2\% execution success and 61.8\% exact-result match with a two-stage SFT
curriculum, improving over the base model by 67.2\% (exec.) and 44.4\% (match).
In Spider (14B) experiments, TS-GRPO increases training stability and speeds
convergence of the execution-match reward relative to GRPO and GSPO.

TL;DR: Decoupled fine-tuning method splits tool-calling into tool selection and argument generation tasks, using separate LoRA adapters for each. The DualTune framework implements this approach, improving Qwen-2.5-7B model's tool calling accuracy by 46% and outperforming larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Local LLMs underperform frontier models in tool calling scenarios, struggling with tool selection from large sets and accurate argument generation for complex parameters. Need for privacy-preserving, cost-effective on-device solutions.

Method: Decoupled fine-tuning using LoRA adapters for tool selection and tool-specific argument generation with separate loss masking. DualTune framework decomposes tool-call generation and dynamically loads corresponding adapters with hierarchical orchestration to limit tool selection scope.

Result: Qwen-2.5-7B model trained with decoupled fine-tuning improves tool calling accuracy by 46% over base model. Outperforms similar-sized local reasoning, non-reasoning and fine-tuned models in all cases, and larger 2x models in most cases on MCP-Bench benchmark.

Conclusion: The decoupled fine-tuning approach and DualTune framework effectively address local LLM limitations in tool calling, enabling efficient on-device agent orchestration with significant performance improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as agentic orchestrators has
revolutionized task automation, but the need for privacy-preserving,
cost-effective solutions demands on-device inference capabilities. However,
local LLMs consistently underperform compared to frontier models in tool
calling scenarios, struggling with both tool selection from large tool sets and
accurate argument generation for complex parameter structures. We introduce a
methodology that disaggregates a tool-calling task into two distinct subtasks:
tool selection and argument generation. We propose "decoupled fine-tuning", a
novel post-training approach that employs LoRA fine-tuning to create dedicated
LoRA adapters for tool selection and tool-specific argument generation using
separate loss masking for each of the subtasks. Furthermore, we present
DualTune, an inference framework that leverages the LoRA adapters created using
decoupled fine-tuning to perform efficient agent orchestration with the help of
local models on end-user devices. DualTune decomposes the tool-call generation
step into tool selection and argument generation, and dynamically loads the
corresponding LoRA adapters to generate tool calls. Additionally, DualTune
implements hierarchical orchestration to restrict the number of tools required
for tool selection. Our experiments on the MCP-Bench benchmark demonstrate that
the Qwen-2.5-7B model trained using decoupled fine-tuning improves the tool
calling accuracy of the base model by 46%, and outperforms other local
reasoning, non-reasoning and fine-tuned models of similar size in all cases,
and models that are 2x larger, in most cases.

*Maisha Maliha,Dean Hougen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAGIC-MASK extends perturbation-based explainability to Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning through inter-agent collaboration, adaptive exploration, and mathematical grounding, outperforming baselines in fidelity and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing explainability methods like StateMask are limited by computational cost, exploration coverage, and lack of adaptation to multi-agent settings, hindering deployment in safety-critical and multi-agent environments.

Method: Integrates Proximal Policy Optimization, adaptive epsilon-greedy exploration, and lightweight inter-agent collaboration for saliency-guided masking and reward-based peer experience sharing, using trajectory perturbation, reward fidelity analysis, and KL divergence regularization.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in fidelity, learning efficiency, and policy robustness on single-agent and multi-agent benchmarks including highway driving and Google Research Football.

Conclusion: MAGIC-MASK successfully generalizes explainability from single-agent to multi-agent systems through unified mathematical formalism, providing interpretable and transferable explanations while enabling faster critical state discovery and more robust learning.

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making process of Deep Reinforcement Learning
agents remains a key challenge for deploying these systems in safety-critical
and multi-agent environments. While prior explainability methods like
StateMask, have advanced the identification of critical states, they remain
limited by computational cost, exploration coverage, and lack of adaptation to
multi-agent settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
mathematically grounded framework, MAGIC-MASK (Multi-Agent Guided Inter-agent
Collaboration with Mask-Based Explainability for Reinforcement Learning), that
extends perturbation-based explanation to Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.
Our method integrates Proximal Policy Optimization, adaptive epsilon-greedy
exploration, and lightweight inter-agent collaboration to share masked state
information and peer experience. This collaboration enables each agent to
perform saliency-guided masking and share reward-based insights with peers,
reducing the time required for critical state discovery, improving explanation
fidelity, and leading to faster and more robust learning. The core novelty of
our approach lies in generalizing explainability from single-agent to
multi-agent systems through a unified mathematical formalism built on
trajectory perturbation, reward fidelity analysis, and Kullback-Leibler
divergence regularization. This framework yields localized, interpretable
explanations grounded in probabilistic modeling and multi-agent Markov decision
processes. We validate our framework on both single-agent and multi-agent
benchmarks, including a multi-agent highway driving environment and Google
Research Football, demonstrating that MAGIC-MASK consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in fidelity, learning efficiency, and policy
robustness while offering interpretable and transferable explanations.

### [142] [ICL Optimized Fragility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00300)
*Serena Gomez Wannaz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ICL guides improve task-specific performance but create "optimized fragility" - they boost accuracy on general knowledge (91-99%) while degrading complex reasoning (10-43% on riddles vs 43% baseline), with no effect on complex math problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how ICL guides affect cross-domain cognitive abilities and reasoning across different knowledge domains, as their impact on reasoning flexibility remains unexplored despite known task-specific benefits.

Method: Used six GPT-OSS:20b model variants (baseline + five ICL configurations: simple, chain-of-thought, random, appended text, symbolic language) and tested them on 840 tests spanning general knowledge, logic riddles, and mathematical olympiad problems, with statistical analysis using ANOVA.

Result: Significant behavioral modifications (p<0.001) across ICL variants showing "optimized fragility" - ICL models achieved 91-99% accuracy on general knowledge but dropped to 10-43% on riddles (vs 43% baseline). No significant differences on olympiad problem (p=0.2173).

Conclusion: ICL guides create systematic trade-offs between efficiency and reasoning flexibility, with important implications for LLM deployment and AI safety due to the observed optimized fragility phenomenon.

Abstract: ICL guides are known to improve task-specific performance, but their impact
on cross-domain cognitive abilities remains unexplored. This study examines how
ICL guides affect reasoning across different knowledge domains using six
variants of the GPT-OSS:20b model: one baseline model and five ICL
configurations (simple, chain-of-thought, random, appended text, and symbolic
language). The models were subjected to 840 tests spanning general knowledge
questions, logic riddles, and a mathematical olympiad problem. Statistical
analysis (ANOVA) revealed significant behavioral modifications (p less than
0.001) across ICL variants, demonstrating a phenomenon termed "optimized
fragility." ICL models achieved 91%-99% accuracy on general knowledge tasks
while showing degraded performance on complex reasoning problems, with accuracy
dropping to 10-43% on riddles compared to 43% for the baseline model. Notably,
no significant differences emerged on the olympiad problem (p=0.2173),
suggesting that complex mathematical reasoning remains unaffected by ICL
optimization. These findings indicate that ICL guides create systematic
trade-offs between efficiency and reasoning flexibility, with important
implications for LLM deployment and AI safety.

*Thierry Blankenstein,Jialin Yu,Zixuan Li,Vassilis Plachouras,Sunando Sengupta,Philip Torr,Yarin Gal,Alasdair Paren,Adel Bibi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM agents show systematic bias in selecting tools from marketplaces, preferring certain providers or earlier-listed options, which creates unfairness in tool selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fairness concerns in LLM tool selection where systematic bias can degrade user experience and distort competition among tool providers.

Method: Created a benchmark with functionally equivalent tools, tested 7 models, conducted controlled experiments on tool features/metadata/pre-training exposure, and proposed a lightweight mitigation approach.

Result: Found that semantic alignment between queries and metadata is the strongest predictor of choice, perturbing descriptions significantly shifts selections, and repeated pre-training exposure amplifies bias.

Conclusion: Tool-selection bias is a key obstacle for fair deployment of tool-augmented LLMs, and the proposed mitigation (filtering + uniform sampling) reduces bias while preserving task coverage.

Abstract: Agents backed by large language models (LLMs) often rely on external tools
drawn from marketplaces where multiple providers offer functionally equivalent
options. This raises a critical point concerning fairness: if selection is
systematically biased, it can degrade user experience and distort competition
by privileging some providers over others. We introduce a benchmark of diverse
tool categories, each containing multiple functionally equivalent tools, to
evaluate tool-selection bias. Using this benchmark, we test seven models and
show that unfairness exists with models either fixating on a single provider or
disproportionately preferring earlier-listed tools in context. To investigate
the origins of this bias, we conduct controlled experiments examining tool
features, metadata (name, description, parameters), and pre-training exposure.
We find that: (1) semantic alignment between queries and metadata is the
strongest predictor of choice; (2) perturbing descriptions significantly shifts
selections; and (3) repeated pre-training exposure to a single endpoint
amplifies bias. Finally, we propose a lightweight mitigation that first filters
the candidate tools to a relevant subset and then samples uniformly, reducing
bias while preserving good task coverage. Our findings highlight tool-selection
bias as a key obstacle for the fair deployment of tool-augmented LLMs.

*Zeshi Dai,Zimo Peng,Zerui Cheng,Ryan Yihe Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAIA benchmark reveals AI models' critical failure in adversarial environments - frontier models achieve only 28% accuracy without tools and plateau at 67.4% with tools, showing systematic preference for unreliable sources over authoritative data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI benchmarks measure performance in controlled settings but fail to evaluate resilience in real-world adversarial environments where misinformation is weaponized and errors are irreversible, particularly in high-stakes domains like crypto markets.

Method: Used crypto markets as testbed (where $30B was lost to exploits in 2024), evaluated 17 models on 178 time-anchored tasks requiring truth/manipulation distinction, navigation of fragmented information, and irreversible financial decisions under adversarial pressure.

Result: Models show fundamental capability gap: 28% accuracy without tools, 67.4% with tools vs 80% human baseline. Systematic tool selection failure - prefer unreliable web search over authoritative data, falling for SEO-optimized misinformation. Pass@k metrics mask dangerous trial-and-error behavior.

Conclusion: Current models remain fundamentally unprepared for environments where intelligence must survive active opposition. Adversarial robustness is a necessary condition for trustworthy AI autonomy, with implications extending to cybersecurity, content moderation, and other domains with active adversaries.

Abstract: We present CAIA, a benchmark exposing a critical blind spot in AI evaluation:
the inability of state-of-the-art models to operate in adversarial, high-stakes
environments where misinformation is weaponized and errors are irreversible.
While existing benchmarks measure task completion in controlled settings,
real-world deployment demands resilience against active deception. Using crypto
markets as a testbed where $30 billion was lost to exploits in 2024, we
evaluate 17 models on 178 time-anchored tasks requiring agents to distinguish
truth from manipulation, navigate fragmented information landscapes, and make
irreversible financial decisions under adversarial pressure.
  Our results reveal a fundamental capability gap: without tools, even frontier
models achieve only 28% accuracy on tasks junior analysts routinely handle.
Tool augmentation improves performance but plateaus at 67.4% versus 80% human
baseline, despite unlimited access to professional resources. Most critically,
we uncover a systematic tool selection catastrophe: models preferentially
choose unreliable web search over authoritative data, falling for SEO-optimized
misinformation and social media manipulation. This behavior persists even when
correct answers are directly accessible through specialized tools, suggesting
foundational limitations rather than knowledge gaps. We also find that Pass@k
metrics mask dangerous trial-and-error behavior for autonomous deployment.
  The implications extend beyond crypto to any domain with active adversaries,
e.g. cybersecurity, content moderation, etc. We release CAIA with contamination
controls and continuous updates, establishing adversarial robustness as a
necessary condition for trustworthy AI autonomy. The benchmark reveals that
current models, despite impressive reasoning scores, remain fundamentally
unprepared for environments where intelligence must survive active opposition.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A critical review of Hierarchical Reasoning Models that introduces variants achieving significantly better performance on Sudoku-Extreme and Maze-Hard tasks, while raising new research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers excel at sequential tasks but struggle with logical reasoning, possibly due to unexplored creative uses like latent space and recurrent reasoning. Hierarchical Reasoning Models show promise but need deeper investigation.

Method: Performed critical review of Hierarchical Reasoning Models, examined key design choices, and presented intriguing variants that improve upon the original approach.

Result: Achieved significantly better performance on Sudoku-Extreme and Maze-Hard tasks than previously reported, while uncovering surprising observations.

Conclusion: The work raises intriguing directions for further research in recurrent reasoning models and demonstrates the potential for improved logical reasoning capabilities in transformers through creative architectural modifications.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable performance in natural language
processing and related domains, as they largely focus on sequential,
autoregressive next-token prediction tasks. Yet, they struggle in logical
reasoning, not necessarily because of a fundamental limitation of these models,
but possibly due to the lack of exploration of more creative uses, such as
latent space and recurrent reasoning. An emerging exploration in this direction
is the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (Wang et al., 2025), which introduces a
novel type of recurrent reasoning in the latent space of transformers,
achieving remarkable performance on a wide range of 2D reasoning tasks. Despite
the promising results, this line of models is still at an early stage and calls
for in-depth investigation. In this work, we perform a critical review on this
class of models, examine key design choices and present intriguing variants
that achieve significantly better performance on the Sudoku-Extreme and
Maze-Hard tasks than previously reported. Our results also raise surprising
observations and intriguing directions for further research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a semantic-driven AI agent communication framework with three techniques: semantic adaptation transmission, semantic lightweight transmission, and semantic self-evolution control to enable efficient and robust multi-agent collaboration in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With communication targets shifting from humans to AI agents, semantic communication offers a solution but faces practical deployment constraints due to dynamic environments and limited resources.

Method: Developed three enabling techniques: 1) semantic adaptation transmission using fine-tuning with real/generative samples, 2) semantic lightweight transmission using pruning, quantization, and perception-aware sampling, and 3) semantic self-evolution control using distributed hierarchical decision-making.

Result: Simulation results show faster convergence, stronger robustness, and significantly outperforms conventional decision-making schemes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates strong potential for AI agent communication networks by addressing dynamic environment challenges and resource constraints.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of intelligent services, communication targets are
shifting from humans to artificial intelligent (AI) agents, which require new
paradigms to enable real-time perception, decision-making, and collaboration.
Semantic communication, which conveys task-relevant meaning rather than raw
data, offers a promising solution. However, its practical deployment remains
constrained by dynamic environments and limited resources. To address these
issues, this article proposes a semantic-driven AI agent communication
framework and develops three enabling techniques. First, semantic adaptation
transmission applies fine-tuning with real or generative samples to efficiently
adapt models to varying environments. Second, semantic lightweight transmission
incorporates pruning, quantization, and perception-aware sampling to reduce
model complexity and alleviate computational burden on edge agents. Third,
semantic self-evolution control employs distributed hierarchical
decision-making to optimize multi-dimensional resources, enabling robust
multi-agent collaboration in dynamic environments. Simulation results show that
the proposed solutions achieve faster convergence and stronger robustness,
while the proposed distributed hierarchical optimization method significantly
outperforms conventional decision-making schemes, highlighting its potential
for AI agent communication networks.

TL;DR: The TRACE framework enables dynamic evolution of agent benchmarks by transforming existing tasks into more complex versions through agent exploration, with validatable execution trajectories ensuring reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent benchmarks are quickly becoming obsolete as new agents rapidly achieve ceiling performance, creating a need for more challenging and sustainable evaluation systems.

Method: Three-stage framework: (1) evolutionary proposal mining through preliminary exploration and divergent thinking, (2) problem formation and free exploration where agents explore problem candidates while recording trajectories, (3) multi-level validation to ensure tasks have validatable and reproducible trajectories.

Result: Experiments on GAIA benchmark show TRACE consistently enhances task complexity while improving reliability through validatable execution trajectories.

Conclusion: TRACE represents a paradigm shift from static, manually curated benchmarks to dynamic, self-evolving evaluation systems that provide sustainable and challenging testing grounds for agent development.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and agent system designs have
empowered agents with unprecedented levels of capability. However, existing
agent benchmarks are showing a trend of rapid ceiling-hitting by newly
developed agents, making it difficult to meet the demands for evaluating agent
abilities. To address this problem, we propose the Trajectory-based
Validated-by-Reproducing Agent-benchmark Complexity Evolution (TRACE)
framework. This framework takes an original task from an existing benchmark and
encourages agents to freely explore and evolve it into a new task with higher
difficulty while recording validatable agent trajectories. The framework
proceeds in three stages: (1) evolutionary proposal mining, which provides task
evolution proposals through preliminary exploration and divergent thinking; (2)
problem formation and free exploration, where proposals are conceptualized into
feasible problem candidates and the agents then explore them freely while
recording their execution trajectories; and (3) multi-level validation, which
ensures that the evolved tasks are accompanied by validatable and reproducible
trajectories. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate that the TRACE
framework consistently enhances task complexity while improving the reliability
of correctness through validatable execution trajectories. This work marks a
paradigm shift from static, manually curated benchmarks to dynamic,
self-evolving evaluation systems, providing a sustainable and challenging
runway for agent development.

TL;DR: Automated evaluation metrics can effectively assess AI systems' responses to patient health questions, closely matching expert ratings when using clinician-authored reference answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current gold standard of human expert review for evaluating AI health responses is labor-intensive and slow, limiting scalability. Automated metrics show promise but have variable alignment with human judgments.

Method: Conducted large systematic study across 100 patient cases with responses from 28 AI systems (2800 total), assessed along three dimensions: question answering, clinical note evidence usage, and general medical knowledge application. Used clinician-authored reference answers to anchor automated metrics.

Result: Automated rankings closely matched expert ratings across all three assessment dimensions, demonstrating reliable performance evaluation.

Conclusion: Carefully designed automated evaluation can scale comparative assessment of AI systems and support patient-clinician communication effectively.

Abstract: Automated approaches to answer patient-posed health questions are rising, but
selecting among systems requires reliable evaluation. The current gold standard
for evaluating the free-text artificial intelligence (AI) responses--human
expert review--is labor-intensive and slow, limiting scalability. Automated
metrics are promising yet variably aligned with human judgments and often
context-dependent. To address the feasibility of automating the evaluation of
AI responses to hospitalization-related questions posed by patients, we
conducted a large systematic study of evaluation approaches. Across 100 patient
cases, we collected responses from 28 AI systems (2800 total) and assessed them
along three dimensions: whether a system response (1) answers the question, (2)
appropriately uses clinical note evidence, and (3) uses general medical
knowledge. Using clinician-authored reference answers to anchor metrics,
automated rankings closely matched expert ratings. Our findings suggest that
carefully designed automated evaluation can scale comparative assessment of AI
systems and support patient-clinician communication.

### [149] [Expandable Decision-Making States for Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning in Soccer Tactical Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00480)
*Kenjiro Ide,Taiga Someya,Kohei Kawaguchi,Keisuke Fujii*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EDMS is a semantically enriched state representation for soccer analysis that augments raw player data with tactical variables and uses action masking to create interpretable agent models that outperform baselines in prediction accuracy and tactical insight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule-based soccer analysis is intuitive but limited, while modern ML models lack interpretability and explicit agent representations. There's a need for player-level agent models that are both tactically interpretable and robust across data sources.

Method: Proposed Expandable Decision-Making States (EDMS) - a state representation that enriches raw positions/velocities with relational tactical variables (space scoring, passing, scoring) and uses action masking to give on-ball/off-ball players distinct decision sets.

Result: EDMS with action masking consistently reduced action-prediction loss and temporal-difference error compared to baselines. It successfully highlighted high-risk, high-reward tactical patterns like fast counterattacks and defensive breakthroughs.

Conclusion: EDMS provides interpretable tactical analysis by mapping learned values and policies to human-understandable concepts, enables cross-dataset compatibility, and offers better performance than traditional approaches while maintaining tactical interpretability.

Abstract: Invasion team sports such as soccer produce a high-dimensional, strongly
coupled state space as many players continuously interact on a shared field,
challenging quantitative tactical analysis. Traditional rule-based analyses are
intuitive, while modern predictive machine learning models often perform
pattern-matching without explicit agent representations. The problem we address
is how to build player-level agent models from data, whose learned values and
policies are both tactically interpretable and robust across heterogeneous data
sources. Here, we propose Expandable Decision-Making States (EDMS), a
semantically enriched state representation that augments raw positions and
velocities with relational variables (e.g., scoring of space, pass, and score),
combined with an action-masking scheme that gives on-ball and off-ball agents
distinct decision sets. Compared to prior work, EDMS maps learned value
functions and action policies to human-interpretable tactical concepts (e.g.,
marking pressure, passing lanes, ball accessibility) instead of raw coordinate
features, and aligns agent choices with the rules of play. In the experiments,
EDMS with action masking consistently reduced both action-prediction loss and
temporal-difference (TD) error compared to the baseline. Qualitative case
studies and Q-value visualizations further indicate that EDMS highlights
high-risk, high-reward tactical patterns (e.g., fast counterattacks and
defensive breakthroughs). We also integrated our approach into an open-source
library and demonstrated compatibility with multiple commercial and open
datasets, enabling cross-provider evaluation and reproducible experiments.

TL;DR: Contrary to conventional wisdom, generative outcome reward models (GenORM) outperform process reward models (PRMs) across 14 diverse domains, challenging the assumption that fine-grained stepwise supervision is always better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the reliability of LLMs during test-time scaling by comparing different reward model variants across diverse domains, challenging the prevailing assumption that process reward models (PRMs) always outperform outcome reward models (ORMs).

Method: Conducted unified evaluation of four reward model variants (discriminative ORM/PRM and generative ORM/PRM) across 14 diverse domains, with theoretical analysis of error compounding in stepwise scoring and empirical validation.

Result: GenORM was the most robust model, yielding significant and consistent gains across all tested domains, while DisORM performed on par with DisPRM and GenPRM was not competitive. Stepwise scoring was found to inherit label noise and struggle with long reasoning trajectories.

Conclusion: The findings challenge the assumption that fine-grained supervision is always better and support generative outcome verification for multi-domain deployment, as step-wise aggregation compounds errors with reasoning length.

Abstract: The reliability of large language models (LLMs) during test-time scaling is
often assessed with \emph{external verifiers} or \emph{reward models} that
distinguish correct reasoning from flawed logic. Prior work generally assumes
that process reward models (PRMs), which score every intermediate reasoning
step, outperform outcome reward models (ORMs) that assess only the final
answer. This view is based mainly on evidence from narrow, math-adjacent
domains. We present the first unified evaluation of four reward model variants,
discriminative ORM and PRM (\DisORM, \DisPRM) and generative ORM and PRM
(\GenORM, \GenPRM), across 14 diverse domains. Contrary to conventional wisdom,
we find that (i) \DisORM performs on par with \DisPRM, (ii) \GenPRM is not
competitive, and (iii) overall, \GenORM is the most robust, yielding
significant and consistent gains across every tested domain. We attribute this
to PRM-style stepwise scoring, which inherits label noise from LLM
auto-labeling and has difficulty evaluating long reasoning trajectories,
including those involving self-correcting reasoning. Our theoretical analysis
shows that step-wise aggregation compounds errors as reasoning length grows,
and our empirical observations confirm this effect. These findings challenge
the prevailing assumption that fine-grained supervision is always better and
support generative outcome verification for multi-domain deployment. We
publicly release our code, datasets, and checkpoints at
\href{https://github.com/db-Lee/Multi-RM}{\underline{\small\texttt{https://github.com/db-Lee/Multi-RM}}}

*Wei-Yao Wang,Kazuya Tateishi,Qiyu Wu,Shusuke Takahashi,Yuki Mitsufuji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VIRTUE is a visual-interactive text-image universal embedder that extends segmentation models and vision-language models to enable region-specific embedding capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both universal and visual-interactive tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing embedding models lack visual-interactive capabilities to specify regions of interest from users, which limits their human-interactive applicability and prevents localized grounding of user intent. This also hinders learning entity-level information within images to complement global representations.

Method: VIRTUE integrates segmentation models that can process visual prompts (point, bounding box, mask) to pinpoint specific regions within images, enabling the embedder to handle complex and ambiguous scenarios more precisely. It extends capabilities of segmentation models and vision-language models to representation learning.

Result: VIRTUE achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements across 36 universal MMEB tasks (3.1%-8.5% improvement) and five visual-interactive SCaR tasks (15.2%-20.3% improvement). The SCaR benchmark comprises 1M samples for segmentation-and-scene caption retrieval.

Conclusion: Equipping embedding models with visual interactions unlocks new applications with localized grounding of user intent and enables learning entity-level information within images. VIRTUE successfully bridges the gap between generative models' interactive capabilities and embedding models' representation learning.

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning models have demonstrated successful
operation across complex tasks, and the integration of vision-language models
(VLMs) has further enabled embedding models with instruction-following
capabilities. However, existing embedding models lack visual-interactive
capabilities to specify regions of interest from users (e.g., point, bounding
box, mask), which have been explored in generative models to broaden their
human-interactive applicability. Equipping embedding models with visual
interactions not only would unlock new applications with localized grounding of
user intent, which remains unexplored, but also enable the models to learn
entity-level information within images to complement their global
representations for conventional embedding tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel Visual-InteRactive Text-Image Universal Embedder (VIRTUE) that extends
the capabilities of the segmentation model and the vision-language model to the
realm of representation learning. In VIRTUE, the segmentation model can process
visual prompts that pinpoint specific regions within an image, thereby enabling
the embedder to handle complex and ambiguous scenarios more precisely. To
evaluate the visual-interaction ability of VIRTUE, we introduce a large-scale
Segmentation-and-Scene Caption Retrieval (SCaR) benchmark comprising 1M samples
that aims to retrieve the text caption by jointly considering the entity with a
specific object and image scene. VIRTUE consistently achieves a
state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements across 36 universal
MMEB (3.1%-8.5%) and five visual-interactive SCaR (15.2%-20.3%) tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study develops 15 data quality dimensions for RAG systems through interviews with IT practitioners, revealing the need for new dimensions beyond traditional frameworks, front-loaded quality management, and dynamic approaches to handle issue propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data quality frameworks are inadequate for RAG systems because they were designed for static datasets and don't address the dynamic, multi-stage nature of RAG pipelines used in enterprise AI applications.

Method: Conducted 16 semi-structured interviews with practitioners from leading IT service companies and performed qualitative content analysis to inductively derive data quality dimensions.

Result: Identified 15 distinct data quality dimensions across four RAG processing stages: data extraction, data transformation, prompt & search, and generation. Found that new dimensions are needed, concentrated in early stages, and quality issues transform and propagate through the pipeline.

Conclusion: RAG systems require new data quality dimensions beyond traditional frameworks, front-loaded quality management strategies, and dynamic approaches that account for issue propagation throughout the pipeline stages.

Abstract: Organizations increasingly adopt Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to
enhance Large Language Models with enterprise-specific knowledge. However,
current data quality (DQ) frameworks have been primarily developed for static
datasets, and only inadequately address the dynamic, multi-stage nature of RAG
systems. This study aims to develop DQ dimensions for this new type of AI-based
systems. We conduct 16 semi-structured interviews with practitioners of leading
IT service companies. Through a qualitative content analysis, we inductively
derive 15 distinct DQ dimensions across the four processing stages of RAG
systems: data extraction, data transformation, prompt & search, and generation.
Our findings reveal that (1) new dimensions have to be added to traditional DQ
frameworks to also cover RAG contexts; (2) these new dimensions are
concentrated in early RAG steps, suggesting the need for front-loaded quality
management strategies, and (3) DQ issues transform and propagate through the
RAG pipeline, necessitating a dynamic, step-aware approach to quality
management.

*Shojiro Yamabe,Jun Sakuma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Diffusion language models (DLMs) are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that exploit their iterative denoising process by injecting affirmative tokens, which can bypass safety guardrails and steer generation toward harmful responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the safety risks posed by jailbreak attacks that exploit the parallel token generation and iterative denoising mechanism of DLMs, which is not well understood despite its benefits for latency and bidirectional conditioning.

Method: Proposed a novel safety alignment method that trains DLMs to generate safe responses from contaminated intermediate states containing affirmative tokens, specifically designed to counter the vulnerability in the iterative denoising process.

Result: The proposed method significantly mitigates the vulnerability with minimal impact on task performance and improves robustness against conventional jailbreak attacks.

Conclusion: DLMs have critical vulnerabilities specific to their inference mechanism that require DLM-specific safety research and tailored countermeasures to ensure safe deployment.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) generate tokens in parallel through
iterative denoising, which can reduce latency and enable bidirectional
conditioning. However, the safety risks posed by jailbreak attacks that exploit
this inference mechanism are not well understood. In this paper, we reveal that
DLMs have a critical vulnerability stemming from their iterative denoising
process and propose a countermeasure. Specifically, our investigation shows
that if an affirmative token for a harmful query appears at an intermediate
step, subsequent denoising can be steered toward a harmful response even in
aligned models. As a result, simply injecting such affirmative tokens can
readily bypass the safety guardrails. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
vulnerability allows existing optimization-based jailbreak attacks to succeed
on DLMs. Building on this analysis, we propose a novel safety alignment method
tailored to DLMs that trains models to generate safe responses from
contaminated intermediate states that contain affirmative tokens. Our
experiments indicate that the proposed method significantly mitigates the
vulnerability with minimal impact on task performance. Furthermore, our method
improves robustness against conventional jailbreak attacks. Our work
underscores the need for DLM-specific safety research.

### [154] [ACON: Optimizing Context Compression for Long-horizon LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00615)
*Minki Kang,Wei-Ning Chen,Dongge Han,Huseyin A. Inan,Lukas Wutschitz,Yanzhi Chen,Robert Sim,Saravan Rajmohan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ACON is a framework that compresses agent context (observations and interaction histories) to reduce memory usage while maintaining task performance, using LLM-based compression guideline optimization and distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents face growing context lengths in real-world environments, raising costs and reducing efficiency in long-horizon tasks, while existing context compression methods are limited to single-step tasks.

Method: Uses compression guideline optimization where LLMs analyze failure cases in paired trajectories to update compression guidelines, then distills optimized compressors into smaller models.

Result: Reduces memory usage by 26-54% (peak tokens) while preserving task performance, maintains over 95% accuracy when distilled, and improves smaller LMs' performance by up to 46%.

Conclusion: ACON effectively addresses the context length challenge in agentic tasks through optimized compression and distillation, enabling efficient long-horizon agent deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in dynamic,
real-world environments, where success requires both reasoning and effective
tool use. A central challenge for agentic tasks is the growing context length,
as agents must accumulate long histories of actions and observations. This
expansion raises costs and reduces efficiency in long-horizon tasks, yet prior
work on context compression has mostly focused on single-step tasks or narrow
applications. We introduce Agent Context Optimization (ACON), a unified
framework that optimally compresses both environment observations and
interaction histories into concise yet informative condensations. ACON
leverages compression guideline optimization in natural language space: given
paired trajectories where full context succeeds but compressed context fails,
capable LLMs analyze the causes of failure, and the compression guideline is
updated accordingly. Furthermore, we propose distilling the optimized LLM
compressor into smaller models to reduce the overhead of the additional module.
Experiments on AppWorld, OfficeBench, and Multi-objective QA show that ACON
reduces memory usage by 26-54% (peak tokens) while largely preserving task
performance, preserves over 95% of accuracy when distilled into smaller
compressors, and enhances smaller LMs as long-horizon agents with up to 46%
performance improvement.

*Rosni Vasu,Peter Jansen,Pao Siangliulue,Cristina Sarasua,Abraham Bernstein,Peter Clark,Bhavana Dalvi Mishra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HARPA is an AI system that generates testable, literature-grounded scientific hypotheses by mimicking human researcher workflows, showing significant improvements in feasibility and groundedness compared to baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in automated scientific discovery where existing tools struggle to generate testable, literature-grounded hypotheses and lack adaptability to prior experimental outcomes.

Method: HARPA incorporates human researcher workflow: identifies emerging research trends through literature mining, explores hypothesis design spaces, converges on precise hypotheses by pinpointing research gaps and justifying design choices, and learns a reward model from experimental outcomes.

Result: HARPA outperforms baseline AI-researcher in feasibility (+0.78) and groundedness (+0.85) on 10-point scale. With CodeScientist agent, achieved more successful executions (20 vs 11/40) and fewer failures (16 vs 21/40). Reward model achieved ~28% absolute gain over untrained baseline.

Conclusion: HARPA represents a significant step forward in AI-driven scientific discovery by generating more feasible, grounded hypotheses and adapting to experimental outcomes through learned reward modeling.

Abstract: While there has been a surge of interest in automated scientific discovery
(ASD), especially with the emergence of LLMs, it remains challenging for tools
to generate hypotheses that are both testable and grounded in the scientific
literature. Additionally, existing ideation tools are not adaptive to prior
experimental outcomes. We developed HARPA to address these challenges by
incorporating the ideation workflow inspired by human researchers. HARPA first
identifies emerging research trends through literature mining, then explores
hypothesis design spaces, and finally converges on precise, testable hypotheses
by pinpointing research gaps and justifying design choices. Our evaluations
show that HARPA-generated hypothesis-driven research proposals perform
comparably to a strong baseline AI-researcher across most qualitative
dimensions (e.g., specificity, novelty, overall quality), but achieve
significant gains in feasibility(+0.78, p$<0.05$, bootstrap) and groundedness
(+0.85, p$<0.01$, bootstrap) on a 10-point Likert scale. When tested with the
ASD agent (CodeScientist), HARPA produced more successful executions (20 vs. 11
out of 40) and fewer failures (16 vs. 21 out of 40), showing that expert
feasibility judgments track with actual execution success. Furthermore, to
simulate how researchers continuously refine their understanding of what
hypotheses are both testable and potentially interesting from experience, HARPA
learns a reward model that scores new hypotheses based on prior experimental
outcomes, achieving approx. a 28\% absolute gain over HARPA's untrained
baseline scorer. Together, these methods represent a step forward in the field
of AI-driven scientific discovery.

### [156] [Is Model Editing Built on Sand? Revealing Its Illusory Success and Fragile Foundation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00625)
*Wei Liu,Haomei Xu,Bingqing Liu,Zhiying Deng,Haozhao Wang,Jun Wang,Ruixuan Li,Yee Whye Teh,Wee Sun Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Current model editing methods appear successful but actually exploit hidden shortcuts rather than real semantic understanding, making them unreliable when tested with negative examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem that LLMs encode outdated/incorrect knowledge and current model editing approaches show illusory success by exploiting shortcuts rather than proper knowledge integration.

Method: Systematically developed a suite of new evaluation methods with negative examples to test model editing robustness, particularly using negation queries.

Result: State-of-the-art model editing approaches collapse under simple negation queries, revealing they rely on shortcuts rather than full semantic understanding.

Conclusion: Current model editing literature is built on a fragile foundation and requires urgent reconsideration as the approaches exploit shortcuts rather than achieving robust knowledge integration.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) inevitably encode outdated or incorrect
knowledge. Updating, deleting, and forgetting such knowledge is important for
alignment, safety, and other issues. To address this issue, model editing has
emerged as a promising paradigm: by precisely editing a small subset of
parameters such that a specific fact is updated while preserving other
knowledge. Despite its great success reported in previous papers, we find the
apparent reliability of editing rests on a fragile foundation and the current
literature is largely driven by illusory success. The fundamental goal of
steering the model's output toward a target with minimal modification would
encourage exploiting hidden shortcuts, rather than utilizing real semantics.
This problem directly challenges the feasibility of the current model editing
literature at its very foundation, as shortcuts are inherently at odds with
robust knowledge integration. Coincidentally, this issue has long been obscured
by evaluation frameworks that lack the design of negative examples. To uncover
it, we systematically develop a suite of new evaluation methods. Strikingly, we
find that state-of-the-art approaches collapse even under the simplest negation
queries. Our empirical evidence shows that editing is likely to be based on
shortcuts rather than full semantics, calling for an urgent reconsideration of
the very basis of model editing before further advancements can be meaningfully
pursued.

### [157] [Collaborative-Distilled Diffusion Models (CDDM) for Accelerated and Lightweight Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00627)
*Bingzhang Wang,Kehua Chen,Yinhai Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CDDM is a collaborative distillation method that creates lightweight, real-time trajectory prediction models by progressively transferring knowledge from large teacher diffusion models to small student models, achieving 161x compression and 31x acceleration while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models show strong performance in probabilistic trajectory prediction but their large model size and slow sampling hinder real-world deployment in autonomous vehicles and intelligent transportation systems.

Method: Progressive knowledge distillation from teacher to student models using Collaborative Progressive Distillation (CPD), with dual-signal regularized distillation loss that incorporates guidance from both teacher and ground-truth data to prevent overfitting.

Result: Achieves 96.2% and 95.5% of baseline ADE and FDE performance on pedestrian trajectories with only 231K parameters and 4 or 2 sampling steps (161x compression, 31x acceleration, 9ms latency), demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy on ETH-UCY and nuScenes benchmarks.

Conclusion: CDDM successfully bridges high-performing generative models with practical deployment constraints, enabling resource-efficient probabilistic trajectory prediction for autonomous vehicles and intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a fundamental task in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), supporting efficient motion planning
and real-time traffic safety management. Diffusion models have recently
demonstrated strong performance in probabilistic trajectory prediction, but
their large model size and slow sampling process hinder real-world deployment.
This paper proposes Collaborative-Distilled Diffusion Models (CDDM), a novel
method for real-time and lightweight trajectory prediction. Built upon
Collaborative Progressive Distillation (CPD), CDDM progressively transfers
knowledge from a high-capacity teacher diffusion model to a lightweight student
model, jointly reducing both the number of sampling steps and the model size
across distillation iterations. A dual-signal regularized distillation loss is
further introduced to incorporate guidance from both the teacher and
ground-truth data, mitigating potential overfitting and ensuring robust
performance. Extensive experiments on the ETH-UCY pedestrian benchmark and the
nuScenes vehicle benchmark demonstrate that CDDM achieves state-of-the-art
prediction accuracy. The well-distilled CDDM retains 96.2% and 95.5% of the
baseline model's ADE and FDE performance on pedestrian trajectories, while
requiring only 231K parameters and 4 or 2 sampling steps, corresponding to 161x
compression, 31x acceleration, and 9 ms latency. Qualitative results further
show that CDDM generates diverse and accurate trajectories under dynamic agent
behaviors and complex social interactions. By bridging high-performing
generative models with practical deployment constraints, CDDM enables
resource-efficient probabilistic prediction for AVs and ITS. Code is available

*Alessio Devoto,Maximilian Jeblick,Simon Jégou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Expected Attention is a training-free KV cache compression method that estimates KV pair importance by predicting future query attention, enabling effective compression without performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory consumption of KV cache is a major bottleneck for LLM inference, and existing attention-score-based pruning methods face limitations due to unavailable future attention scores and modern implementations like Flash Attention not materializing full attention matrices.

Method: Leverages distributional properties of LLM activations to compute expected attention scores in closed form for each KV pair, enabling principled ranking and pruning with minimal impact on the residual stream.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both prefilling and decoding phases, achieving effective compression without performance degradation.

Conclusion: The method provides a practical solution to KV cache compression challenges and the authors release KVPress library with over 20 techniques to enable further research.

Abstract: Memory consumption of the Key-Value (KV) cache represents a major bottleneck
for efficient large language model inference. While attention-score-based KV
cache pruning shows promise, it faces critical practical limitations: attention
scores from future tokens are unavailable during compression, and modern
implementations like Flash Attention do not materialize the full attention
matrix, making past scores inaccessible. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce $\textbf{Expected Attention, a training-free compression method}$
that estimates KV pairs importance by predicting how future queries will attend
to them. Our approach leverages the distributional properties of LLM
activations to compute expected attention scores in closed form for each KV
pair. These scores enable principled ranking and pruning of KV pairs with
minimal impact on the residual stream, achieving effective compression without
performance degradation. Importantly, our method operates seamlessly across
both prefilling and decoding phases, consistently outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines in both scenarios. Finally, $\textbf{we release
KVPress, a comprehensive library to enable researchers to implement and
benchmark KV cache compression methods, already including more than 20
techniques}$.

### [160] [Relevance-Zone Reduction in Game Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00689)
*Chi-Huang Lin,Ting Han Wei,Chun-Jui Wang,Hung Guei,Chung-Chin Shih,Yun-Jui Tsai,I-Chen Wu,Ti-Rong Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an iterative method to reduce Relevance-Zone (RZ) sizes in game solving, using constraint generation strategies and an RZ Pattern Table to achieve smaller RZs that improve reuse and pruning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Game solving faces exponential growth in game trees, making many games unsolved. While RZ technique reduces search space by focusing on relevant regions, different solutions create varying RZ sizes, with smaller RZs being more favorable for reuse and efficiency.

Method: An iterative RZ reduction method that repeatedly solves positions while gradually restricting the involved region, using three constraint generation strategies and integrating an RZ Pattern Table to leverage past solutions.

Result: In experiments on 7x7 Killall-Go, the method reduces average RZ size to 85.95% of the original, demonstrating effective reduction of search space.

Conclusion: The reduced RZs can be permanently stored as reusable knowledge for future solving tasks, particularly beneficial for larger board sizes or different openings, enhancing overall game solving efficiency.

Abstract: Game solving aims to find the optimal strategies for all players and
determine the theoretical outcome of a game. However, due to the exponential
growth of game trees, many games remain unsolved, even though methods like
AlphaZero have demonstrated super-human level in game playing. The
Relevance-Zone (RZ) is a local strategy reuse technique that restricts the
search to only the regions relevant to the outcome, significantly reducing the
search space. However, RZs are not unique. Different solutions may result in
RZs of varying sizes. Smaller RZs are generally more favorable, as they
increase the chance of reuse and improve pruning efficiency. To this end, we
propose an iterative RZ reduction method that repeatedly solves the same
position while gradually restricting the region involved, guiding the solver
toward smaller RZs. We design three constraint generation strategies and
integrate an RZ Pattern Table to fully leverage past solutions. In experiments
on 7x7 Killall-Go, our method reduces the average RZ size to 85.95% of the
original. Furthermore, the reduced RZs can be permanently stored as reusable
knowledge for future solving tasks, especially for larger board sizes or
different openings.

*Yunhao Wang,Ziting Li,Shuai Chen,Tao Liu,Chao Song,Junjie Jiang,Jian Zhu,Peng Gao,Bin Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ACPO introduces adaptive curriculum policy optimization with dynamic sample reuse and advantage-aware adaptive clipping to improve vision-language model alignment, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multimodal reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing policy optimization algorithms like PPO have limitations including static training schedules and rigid clipping mechanisms, which hinder effective alignment of large-scale vision-language models for complex reasoning tasks.

Method: ACPO uses a dual-component adaptive strategy: (1) dynamic curriculum that transitions from stable on-policy exploration to efficient off-policy exploitation via progressive sample reuse, and (2) Advantage-Aware Adaptive Clipping (AAAC) that replaces fixed clipping with dynamic, sample-wise bounds based on normalized token advantages.

Result: Extensive experiments on MathVista, LogicVista, and MMMU-Pro benchmarks show ACPO consistently outperforms strong baselines like DAPO and PAPO, achieving state-of-the-art performance with accelerated convergence and superior training stability.

Conclusion: ACPO effectively addresses limitations of existing policy optimization methods for vision-language model alignment through its adaptive curriculum and clipping mechanisms, demonstrating significant improvements in multimodal reasoning performance.

Abstract: Aligning large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning via
reinforcement learning is often hampered by the limitations of existing policy
optimization algorithms, such as static training schedules and the rigid,
uniform clipping mechanism in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). In this work,
we introduce Adaptive Curriculum Policy Optimization (ACPO), a novel framework
that addresses these challenges through a dual-component adaptive learning
strategy. First, ACPO employs a dynamic curriculum that orchestrates a
principled transition from a stable, near on-policy exploration phase to an
efficient, off-policy exploitation phase by progressively increasing sample
reuse. Second, we propose an Advantage-Aware Adaptive Clipping (AAAC) mechanism
that replaces the fixed clipping hyperparameter with dynamic, sample-wise
bounds modulated by the normalized advantage of each token. This allows for
more granular and robust policy updates, enabling larger gradients for
high-potential samples while safeguarding against destructive ones. We conduct
extensive experiments on a suite of challenging multimodal reasoning
benchmarks, including MathVista, LogicVista, and MMMU-Pro. Results demonstrate
that ACPO consistently outperforms strong baselines such as DAPO and PAPO,
achieving state-of-the-art performance, accelerated convergence, and superior
training stability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AttentionDep is a domain-aware attention model that uses social media posts from platforms like Facebook, X, and Reddit to detect depression severity. It combines contextual features with mental health domain knowledge through attention mechanisms and ordinal regression, achieving state-of-the-art performance with interpretable predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media platforms offer valuable insights into individuals' mental states, making them promising sources for automated depression detection. However, existing methods lack explainability and domain-specific knowledge integration needed for trustworthy mental health assessment systems.

Method: Hierarchical encoding of posts using unigrams and bigrams with attention mechanisms to highlight clinically relevant tokens. Incorporates domain knowledge from a mental health knowledge graph via cross-attention. Uses ordinal regression framework to respect the natural ordering of depression severity levels.

Result: AttentionDep outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by over 5% in graded F1 score across multiple datasets, while providing interpretable insights into its predictions through attention mechanisms.

Conclusion: The proposed approach advances the development of trustworthy and transparent AI systems for mental health assessment from social media by combining contextual understanding with domain knowledge and providing explainable predictions.

Abstract: In today's interconnected society, social media platforms provide a window
into individuals' thoughts, emotions, and mental states. This paper explores
the use of platforms like Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Reddit for
depression severity detection. We propose AttentionDep, a domain-aware
attention model that drives explainable depression severity estimation by
fusing contextual and domain knowledge. Posts are encoded hierarchically using
unigrams and bigrams, with attention mechanisms highlighting clinically
relevant tokens. Domain knowledge from a curated mental health knowledge graph
is incorporated through a cross-attention mechanism, enriching the contextual
features. Finally, depression severity is predicted using an ordinal regression
framework that respects the clinical-relevance and natural ordering of severity
levels. Our experiments demonstrate that AttentionDep outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by over 5% in graded F1 score across datasets, while
providing interpretable insights into its predictions. This work advances the

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data augmentation pipeline to enhance LLM robustness in formal theorem proving through symmetry (syntactic and semantic) and difficulty perspectives, resulting in EvolProver which achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs for formal theorem proving lack generalizability and are fragile to minor transformations of problem statements, limiting their practical utility.

Method: Proposed a data augmentation pipeline with three methods: EvolAST (AST-based syntactic symmetry), EvolDomain (LLM-based semantic symmetry across domains), and EvolDifficulty (evolutionary instructions for difficulty scaling). Used evolved data to train EvolProver, a 7B-parameter non-reasoning theorem prover.

Result: EvolProver achieves 53.8% pass@32 on FormalMATH-Lite (SOTA for comparable size), 69.8% on MiniF2F-Test, 52.2% on Ineq-Comp-Seed, and 34.0% on Ineq-Comp-Transformed (all SOTA for non-reasoning models). Ablation studies confirm pipeline effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed data augmentation pipeline significantly enhances LLM robustness in formal theorem proving, enabling EvolProver to achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks without requiring reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for formal theorem proving have shown
significant promise, yet they often lack generalizability and are fragile to
even minor transformations of problem statements. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel data augmentation pipeline designed to enhance model
robustness from two perspectives: symmetry and difficulty. From the symmetry
perspective, we propose two complementary methods: EvolAST, an Abstract Syntax
Tree (AST) based approach that targets syntactic symmetry to generate
semantically equivalent problem variants, and EvolDomain, which leverages LLMs
to address semantic symmetry by translating theorems across mathematical
domains. From the difficulty perspective, we propose EvolDifficulty, which uses
carefully designed evolutionary instructions to guide LLMs in generating new
theorems with a wider range of difficulty. We then use the evolved data to
train EvolProver, a 7B-parameter non-reasoning theorem prover. EvolProver
establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on FormalMATH-Lite with a 53.8%
pass@32 rate, surpassing all models of comparable size, including
reasoning-based models. It also sets new SOTA records for non-reasoning models
on MiniF2F-Test (69.8% pass@32), Ineq-Comp-Seed (52.2% pass@32), and
Ineq-Comp-Transformed (34.0% pass@32). Ablation studies further confirm our
data augmentation pipeline's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes DDIM Inversion Attack (DIA), a defensive method that disrupts malicious image editing by attacking the DDIM inversion trajectory path, outperforming previous defensive approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DDIM inversion enables real image editing but has been misused for creating deepfakes and misinformation. Existing defenses like AdvDM and Photoguard have weak performance due to misalignment with the denoising trajectory.

Method: DIA attacks the integrated DDIM trajectory path to disrupt the diffusion process, specifically targeting the inversion operation used for image editing.

Result: DIA effectively disrupts malicious image editing and surpasses previous defensive methods across various editing techniques.

Conclusion: The framework provides practical defense methods against malicious AI use and can benefit both industry and research community in combating unethical content generation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown to be strong representation learners, showcasing
state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains. Aside from accelerated
sampling, DDIM also enables the inversion of real images back to their latent
codes. A direct inheriting application of this inversion operation is real
image editing, where the inversion yields latent trajectories to be utilized
during the synthesis of the edited image. Unfortunately, this practical tool
has enabled malicious users to freely synthesize misinformative or deepfake
contents with greater ease, which promotes the spread of unethical and abusive,
as well as privacy-, and copyright-infringing contents. While defensive
algorithms such as AdvDM and Photoguard have been shown to disrupt the
diffusion process on these images, the misalignment between their objectives
and the iterative denoising trajectory at test time results in weak disruptive
performance.In this work, we present the DDIM Inversion Attack (DIA) that
attacks the integrated DDIM trajectory path. Our results support the effective
disruption, surpassing previous defensive methods across various editing
methods. We believe that our frameworks and results can provide practical
defense methods against the malicious use of AI for both the industry and the
research community. Our code is available here:

*Nicholas Leisegang,Giovanni Casini,Thomas Meyer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper compares two approaches for handling inconsistent knowledge bases: weighted-knowledge bases with cost-based semantics and c-representations. It shows semantic equivalence between these formalisms under certain conditions and compares their entailment relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between two different approaches for dealing with inconsistent knowledge bases in ontology-mediated data querying and non-monotonic reasoning, enabling potential cross-fertilization between these research areas.

Method: Semantic comparison of weighted-knowledge bases (with cost-based semantics) and c-representations by analyzing how both approaches assign numerical rankings to interpretations based on rule violations, and examining conditions for semantic equivalence.

Result: The paper demonstrates that under certain conditions, weighted knowledge bases and sets of defeasible conditionals can generate identical orderings on interpretations, establishing semantic equivalence up to relative cost. Some entailment notions are also shown to be equivalently expressible in both formalisms.

Conclusion: The results establish connections between cost-based semantics and c-representations, potentially benefiting future work in both areas by enabling transfer of techniques and insights between these formalisms for handling inconsistent knowledge.

Abstract: Weighted-knowledge bases and cost-based semantics represent a recent
formalism introduced by Bienvenu et al. for Ontology Mediated Data Querying in
the case where a given knowledge base is inconsistent. This is done by adding a
weight to each statement in the knowledge base (KB), and then giving each DL
interpretation a cost based on how often it breaks rules in the KB. In this
paper we compare this approach with c-representations, a form of non-monotonic
reasoning originally introduced by Kern-Isberner. c-Representations describe a
means to interpret defeasible concept inclusions in the first-order case. This
is done by assigning a numerical ranking to each interpretations via penalties
for each violated conditional. We compare these two approaches on a semantic
level. In particular, we show that under certain conditions a weighted
knowledge base and a set of defeasible conditionals can generate the same
ordering on interpretations, and therefore an equivalence of semantic
structures up to relative cost. Moreover, we compare entailment described in
both cases, where certain notions are equivalently expressible in both
formalisms. Our results have the potential to benefit further work on both
cost-based semantics and c-representations

### [168] [Logical Consistency Between Disagreeing Experts and Its Role in AI Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00821)
*Andrés Corrada-Emmanuel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper formalizes a logic for unsupervised evaluation of classifiers by analyzing agreements and disagreements between experts. It uses linear programming to compute consistent group evaluations and develops no-knowledge alarms to detect when LLM judges violate grading thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the asymmetry in utility between expert agreements and disagreements, and to enable unsupervised evaluation of classifiers without requiring ground truth labels.

Method: The method involves formalizing a logic of unsupervised evaluation, using linear programming in integer space to compute consistent group evaluations from statistical summaries of aligned decisions, and applying logical constraints and axioms as inequalities and equalities.

Result: The approach demonstrates practical utility by building no-knowledge alarms that can detect when LLMs-as-Judges violate specified minimum grading thresholds, using only logical consistency without requiring ground truth.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that unsupervised evaluation using logical consistency alone is feasible and practically useful, particularly for monitoring LLM judges' performance without access to true labels.

Abstract: If two experts disagree on a test, we may conclude both cannot be 100 per
cent correct. But if they completely agree, no possible evaluation can be
excluded. This asymmetry in the utility of agreements versus disagreements is
explored here by formalizing a logic of unsupervised evaluation for
classifiers. Its core problem is computing the set of group evaluations that
are logically consistent with how we observe them agreeing and disagreeing in
their decisions. Statistical summaries of their aligned decisions are inputs
into a Linear Programming problem in the integer space of possible correct or
incorrect responses given true labels. Obvious logical constraints, such as,
the number of correct responses cannot exceed the number of observed responses,
are inequalities. But in addition, there are axioms, universally applicable
linear equalities that apply to all finite tests. The practical and immediate
utility of this approach to unsupervised evaluation using only logical
consistency is demonstrated by building no-knowledge alarms that can detect
when one or more LLMs-as-Judges are violating a minimum grading threshold
specified by the user.

Motivation: Increasing integration of distributed energy resources and renewables creates challenges for power system protection, as conventional fixed-threshold schemes cannot reliably handle dynamic grid conditions. Machine learning offers promise but lacks systematic benchmarks.

Method: Used classical ML models with voltage and current waveforms segmented into sliding windows (10-50ms) under realistic real-time constraints. Evaluated performance based on accuracy, robustness to window size, and runtime efficiency.

Result: Best-performing fault classification model achieved F1 score of 0.992±0.001, while top fault localization model reached R2 of 0.806±0.008 with mean processing time of 0.563 ms.

Conclusion: Machine learning models demonstrate strong performance for power system protection tasks, offering reliable fault classification and localization capabilities that outperform conventional fixed-threshold schemes in dynamic grid conditions.

Abstract: The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs),
particularly renewables, poses significant challenges for power system
protection, with fault classification (FC) and fault localization (FL) being
among the most critical tasks. Conventional protection schemes, based on fixed
thresholds, cannot reliably identify and localize short circuits with the
increasing complexity of the grid under dynamic conditions. Machine learning
(ML) offers a promising alternative; however, systematic benchmarks across
models and settings remain limited. This work presents, for the first time, a
comparative benchmarking study of classical ML models for FC and FL in power
system protection based on EMT data. Using voltage and current waveforms
segmented into sliding windows of 10 ms to 50 ms, we evaluate models under
realistic real-time constraints. Performance is assessed in terms of accuracy,
robustness to window size, and runtime efficiency. The best-performing FC model
achieved an F1 score of 0.992$\pm$0.001, while the top FL model reached an R2
of 0.806$\pm$0.008 with a mean processing time of 0.563 ms.

*Jianhao Chen,Chenxu Wang,Gengrui Zhang,Peng Ye,Lei Bai,Wei Hu,Yuzhong Qu,Shuyue Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to learn compact representations of LLM abilities using item response theory and Mixture-of-Experts networks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in model routing and benchmark accuracy prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently managing and utilizing the growing number of large language models (LLMs) remains challenging, and there's a need for compact representations of LLM abilities to facilitate downstream tasks like model routing and performance prediction.

Method: Framed as estimating the probability that a model correctly answers a query, the approach uses item response theory with three factors: model's multi-skill ability vector, query's discrimination vector, and query's difficulty scalar. These parameters are learned jointly using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network that couples model- and query-level embeddings.

Result: Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance in both model routing and benchmark accuracy prediction. The learned parameters encode meaningful, interpretable information about model capabilities and query characteristics.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully learns compact representations of LLM abilities that facilitate downstream tasks and provide interpretable insights into model capabilities and query characteristics.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a surge in the number of large language models
(LLMs), yet efficiently managing and utilizing these vast resources remains a
significant challenge. In this work, we explore how to learn compact
representations of LLM abilities that can facilitate downstream tasks, such as
model routing and performance prediction on new benchmarks. We frame this
problem as estimating the probability that a given model will correctly answer
a specific query. Inspired by the item response theory (IRT) in psychometrics,
we model this probability as a function of three key factors: (i) the model's
multi-skill ability vector, (2) the query's discrimination vector that
separates models of differing skills, and (3) the query's difficulty scalar. To
learn these parameters jointly, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network
that couples model- and query-level embeddings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach leads to state-of-the-art performance in both
model routing and benchmark accuracy prediction. Moreover, analysis validates
that the learned parameters encode meaningful, interpretable information about
model capabilities and query characteristics.

Abstract: Organizations are increasingly focused on leveraging data from their

data into actionable knowledge remains a difficult and time-consuming task.
There is often a gap between the volume of data collected and the ability to

*Ran Liu,Yuan Fang,Xiaoli Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FusionAdapter improves few-shot relationship learning in multimodal knowledge graphs by using adapter modules and fusion strategies to preserve modality-specific characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMKG methods align modalities into a shared space but overlook distinct modality contributions, limiting performance in low-resource settings.

Method: Proposes FusionAdapter with adapter modules for efficient modality adaptation to unseen relations and fusion strategy to integrate multimodal representations while preserving modality-specific characteristics.

Result: Extensive experiments on two benchmark MMKG datasets show FusionAdapter achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FusionAdapter effectively adapts and fuses diverse modality information to improve generalization to novel relations with minimal supervision.

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) incorporate various modalities, including
text and images, to enhance entity and relation representations. Notably,
different modalities for the same entity often present complementary and
diverse information. However, existing MMKG methods primarily align modalities
into a shared space, which tends to overlook the distinct contributions of
specific modalities, limiting their performance particularly in low-resource
settings. To address this challenge, we propose FusionAdapter for the learning
of few-shot relationships (FSRL) in MMKG. FusionAdapter introduces (1) an
adapter module that enables efficient adaptation of each modality to unseen
relations and (2) a fusion strategy that integrates multimodal entity
representations while preserving diverse modality-specific characteristics. By
effectively adapting and fusing information from diverse modalities,
FusionAdapter improves generalization to novel relations with minimal
supervision. Extensive experiments on two benchmark MMKG datasets demonstrate
that FusionAdapter achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: DAIL is a meta-learned adversarial imitation learning algorithm that discovers data-driven reward assignment functions using LLM-guided evolution, outperforming human-designed baselines and improving training stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AIL methods focus on density ratio estimation but overlook the importance of reward assignment functions, which are typically human-designed and may limit performance and stability.

Method: Leverage LLM-guided evolutionary framework to explore and discover data-driven reward assignment functions based on imitation policy performance, creating a meta-learned AIL algorithm.

Result: DAIL generalizes across unseen environments and policy optimization algorithms, outperforming state-of-the-art human-designed baselines and providing more stable training.

Conclusion: The discovered reward assignment functions play a crucial role in AIL stability, and data-driven approaches can significantly improve imitation learning performance over human-designed methods.

Abstract: Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) methods, while effective in settings
with limited expert demonstrations, are often considered unstable. These
approaches typically decompose into two components: Density Ratio (DR)
estimation $\frac{\rho_E}{\rho_{\pi}}$, where a discriminator estimates the
relative occupancy of state-action pairs under the policy versus the expert;
and Reward Assignment (RA), where this ratio is transformed into a reward
signal used to train the policy. While significant research has focused on
improving density estimation, the role of reward assignment in influencing
training dynamics and final policy performance has been largely overlooked. RA
functions in AIL are typically derived from divergence minimization objectives,
relying heavily on human design and ingenuity. In this work, we take a
different approach: we investigate the discovery of data-driven RA functions,
i.e, based directly on the performance of the resulting imitation policy. To
this end, we leverage an LLM-guided evolutionary framework that efficiently
explores the space of RA functions, yielding \emph{Discovered Adversarial
Imitation Learning} (DAIL), the first meta-learnt AIL algorithm. Remarkably,
DAIL generalises across unseen environments and policy optimization algorithms,
outperforming the current state-of-the-art of \emph{human-designed} baselines.
Finally, we analyse why DAIL leads to more stable training, offering novel
insights into the role of RA functions in the stability of AIL. Code is

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a test-time search method with stochasticity to enhance neural cut separation for CVRP, introducing stochastic edge selection and GraphCHiP algorithm to generate more diverse RCIs and FCIs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning-based separation methods for CVRP produce fewer cuts than expected due to insufficient sensitivity to generate diverse subsets, limiting their effectiveness in cutting plane methods.

Method: Proposes test-time search with stochasticity: 1) stochastic edge selection in graph coarsening instead of greedy approach, 2) GraphCHiP algorithm that uses coarsening history to identify both RCIs and FCIs.

Result: Experiments show reduced dual gap compared to existing neural separation methods, and successful identification of effective FCIs on specific instances despite the challenging nature of finding such cuts.

Conclusion: The proposed test-time search with stochasticity and GraphCHiP algorithm effectively enhances neural cut separation for CVRP, generating more diverse and high-quality cuts including previously challenging FCIs.

Abstract: The identification of valid inequalities, such as the rounded capacity
inequalities (RCIs), is a key component of cutting plane methods for the
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). While a deep learning-based
separation method can learn to find high-quality cuts, our analysis reveals
that the model produces fewer cuts than expected because it is insufficiently
sensitive to generate a diverse set of generated subsets. This paper proposes
an alternative: enhancing the performance of a trained model at inference time
through a new test-time search with stochasticity. First, we introduce
stochastic edge selection into the graph coarsening procedure, replacing the
previously proposed greedy approach. Second, we propose the Graph Coarsening
History-based Partitioning (GraphCHiP) algorithm, which leverages coarsening
history to identify not only RCIs but also, for the first time, the Framed
capacity inequalities (FCIs). Experiments on randomly generated CVRP instances
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing the dual gap compared
to the existing neural separation method. Additionally, our method discovers
effective FCIs on a specific instance, despite the challenging nature of
identifying such cuts.

Motivation: Current LLM-based quantum circuit generation faces challenges with precise parameter values and lack of quantum domain knowledge, leading to low-quality or incorrect circuits.

Method: Proposes QUASAR framework combining RL with tool-augmented LLMs, featuring quantum circuit verification using external simulators and hierarchical reward mechanisms for training.

Result: Achieved 99.31% validity in Pass@1 and 100% in Pass@10 with a 4B LLM, outperforming GPT-4o, GPT-5, DeepSeek-V3 and other baselines in both syntax and semantic performance.

Conclusion: QUASAR effectively enhances quantum circuit generation by integrating domain-specific knowledge through verification tools and sophisticated RL training, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Designing and optimizing task-specific quantum circuits are crucial to
leverage the advantage of quantum computing. Recent large language model
(LLM)-based quantum circuit generation has emerged as a promising automatic
solution. However, the fundamental challenges remain unaddressed: (i)
parameterized quantum gates require precise numerical values for optimal
performance, which also depend on multiple aspects, including the number of
quantum gates, their parameters, and the layout/depth of the circuits. (ii)
LLMs often generate low-quality or incorrect quantum circuits due to the lack
of quantum domain-specific knowledge. We propose QUASAR, an agentic
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for quantum circuits generation and
optimization based on tool-augmented LLMs. To align the LLM with
quantum-specific knowledge and improve the generated quantum circuits, QUASAR
designs (i) a quantum circuit verification approach with external quantum
simulators and (ii) a sophisticated hierarchical reward mechanism in RL
training. Extensive evaluation shows improvements in both syntax and semantic
performance of the generated quantum circuits. When augmenting a 4B LLM, QUASAR
has achieved the validity of 99.31% in Pass@1 and 100% in Pass@10,
outperforming industrial LLMs of GPT-4o, GPT-5 and DeepSeek-V3 and several

Motivation: Rare-disease diagnosis faces challenges from extreme data scarcity, privacy concerns, and limited edge device resources, requiring a unified solution that addresses these issues simultaneously.

Method: Integrates three components: (i) few-shot federated optimization with meta-learning, (ii) energy-aware client scheduling to reduce dropouts, and (iii) secure aggregation with calibrated differential privacy.

Result: Achieves up to 10% accuracy improvement over baseline FL, reduces client dropouts by over 50% without degrading convergence, and maintains privacy-utility trade-offs within clinically acceptable bounds.

Conclusion: AFFR provides a practical pathway for equitable and trustworthy federated diagnosis of rare conditions by unifying multiple critical aspects into a deployable framework.

Abstract: Rare-disease diagnosis remains one of the most pressing challenges in digital
health, hindered by extreme data scarcity, privacy concerns, and the limited
resources of edge devices. This paper proposes the Adaptive Federated Few-Shot
Rare-Disease Diagnosis (AFFR) framework, which integrates three pillars: (i)
few-shot federated optimization with meta-learning to generalize from limited
patient samples, (ii) energy-aware client scheduling to mitigate device
dropouts and ensure balanced participation, and (iii) secure aggregation with
calibrated differential privacy to safeguard sensitive model updates. Unlike
prior work that addresses these aspects in isolation, AFFR unifies them into a
modular pipeline deployable on real-world clinical networks. Experimental
evaluation on simulated rare-disease detection datasets demonstrates up to 10%
improvement in accuracy compared with baseline FL, while reducing client
dropouts by over 50% without degrading convergence. Furthermore,
privacy-utility trade-offs remain within clinically acceptable bounds. These
findings highlight AFFR as a practical pathway for equitable and trustworthy
federated diagnosis of rare conditions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A unified framework for after-sales demand forecasting combining statistical, ML, and deep learning models with role-driven analytics, handling COVID-19 as a distinct regime and providing decision-focused insights through performance scorecards and trend analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of after-sales demand forecasting across multiple countries and parts by creating a practical architecture that integrates forecasting models with business-focused analytics and monitoring capabilities.

Method: Uses a revenue- and cluster-aware ensemble of statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models with exogenous signals (installed base, pricing, macro indicators, life cycle, seasonality). Implements Pareto-aware segmentation for high-revenue items and pooled forecasting for long tail, with horizon-aware ensembling using business-relevant loss functions. Embeds LLMs for role-aware narratives and automated reporting.

Result: The system provides country-part forecasts with calibrated intervals, performance scorecards with accuracy metrics, bias decomposition, geographic/product hotspots, and trend analysis. It enables planners to move from current accuracy assessment to predictive insights and decision-making.

Conclusion: The framework successfully closes the loop between forecasting, monitoring, and inventory decisions across 90+ countries and ~6,000 parts, transforming forecasting from a static accuracy question to a dynamic decision-support system with actionable insights.

Abstract: This paper presents a practical architecture for after-sales demand
forecasting and monitoring that unifies a revenue- and cluster-aware ensemble
of statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models with a role-driven
analytics layer for scorecards and trend diagnostics. The framework ingests
exogenous signals (installed base, pricing, macro indicators, life cycle,
seasonality) and treats COVID-19 as a distinct regime, producing country-part
forecasts with calibrated intervals. A Pareto-aware segmentation forecasts
high-revenue items individually and pools the long tail via clusters, while
horizon-aware ensembling aligns weights with business-relevant losses (e.g.,
WMAPE). Beyond forecasts, a performance scorecard delivers decision-focused
insights: accuracy within tolerance thresholds by revenue share and count, bias
decomposition (over- vs under-forecast), geographic and product-family
hotspots, and ranked root causes tied to high-impact part-country pairs. A
trend module tracks trajectories of MAPE/WMAPE and bias across recent months,
flags entities that are improving or deteriorating, detects change points
aligned with known regimes, and attributes movements to lifecycle and seasonal
factors. LLMs are embedded in the analytics layer to generate role-aware
narratives and enforce reporting contracts. They standardize business
definitions, automate quality checks and reconciliations, and translate
quantitative results into concise, explainable summaries for planners and
executives. The system exposes a reproducible workflow -- request
specification, model execution, database-backed artifacts, and AI-generated
narratives -- so planners can move from "How accurate are we now?" to "Where is
accuracy heading and which levers should we pull?", closing the loop between
forecasting, monitoring, and inventory decisions across more than 90 countries
and about 6,000 parts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods for discovering concept representations in language models focus on specific geometries for specific features, lacking generalization capabilities.

Method: Supervised Multi-Dimensional Scaling (SMDS) - a model-agnostic method to automatically discover feature manifolds in language models.

Result: SMDS reveals that different features form various geometric structures (circles, lines, clusters) that consistently reflect concept properties, are stable across model families and sizes, actively support reasoning, and dynamically reshape in response to context changes.

Conclusion: The findings support a model of entity-based reasoning where language models encode and transform structured representations through feature manifolds.

Abstract: The linear representation hypothesis states that language models (LMs) encode
concepts as directions in their latent space, forming organized,
multidimensional manifolds. Prior efforts focus on discovering specific
geometries for specific features, and thus lack generalization. We introduce
Supervised Multi-Dimensional Scaling (SMDS), a model-agnostic method to
automatically discover feature manifolds. We apply SMDS to temporal reasoning
as a case study, finding that different features form various geometric
structures such as circles, lines, and clusters. SMDS reveals many insights on
these structures: they consistently reflect the properties of the concepts they
represent; are stable across model families and sizes; actively support
reasoning in models; and dynamically reshape in response to context changes.
Together, our findings shed light on the functional role of feature manifolds,
supporting a model of entity-based reasoning in which LMs encode and transform
structured representations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates 70+ LLMs on triplet similarity tasks using THINGS database concepts to measure human-model representational alignment. Key findings: instruction-finetuning and larger attention head dimensionality improve alignment, while multimodal pretraining and parameter size have limited effect. Existing benchmarks inadequately capture human-AI representational alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM benchmarks don't effectively measure representational alignment between humans and models, making it unclear which computational ingredients (architectures, fine-tuning methods, training datasets) are crucial for developing human-like representations in LLMs.

Method: Evaluated over 70 models with varying computational ingredients on triplet similarity tasks using THINGS database concepts - a cognitive science method for measuring human conceptual representations. Compared human and model representations to identify factors affecting alignment.

Result: Models with instruction-finetuning and larger attention head dimensionality showed highest human alignment. Multimodal pretraining and parameter size had limited impact on alignment. Existing benchmarks (MMLU, MUSR) inadequately capture representational alignment variance.

Conclusion: Instruction-finetuning and attention head dimensionality are key computational ingredients for advancing LLMs toward human conceptual representation models. Current benchmarks have significant limitations in measuring human-AI alignment, highlighting a critical gap in LLM evaluation.

Abstract: The ability to translate diverse patterns of inputs into structured patterns
of behavior has been thought to rest on both humans' and machines' ability to
learn robust representations of relevant concepts. The rapid advancement of
transformer-based large language models (LLMs) has led to a diversity of
computational ingredients -- architectures, fine tuning methods, and training
datasets among others -- but it remains unclear which of these ingredients are
most crucial for building models that develop human-like representations.
Further, most current LLM benchmarks are not suited to measuring
representational alignment between humans and models, making benchmark scores
unreliable for assessing if current LLMs are making progress towards becoming
useful cognitive models. We address these limitations by first evaluating a set
of over 70 models that widely vary in their computational ingredients on a
triplet similarity task, a method well established in the cognitive sciences
for measuring human conceptual representations, using concepts from the THINGS
database. Comparing human and model representations, we find that models that
undergo instruction-finetuning and which have larger dimensionality of
attention heads are among the most human aligned, while multimodal pretraining
and parameter size have limited bearing on alignment. Correlations between
alignment scores and scores on existing benchmarks reveal that while some
benchmarks (e.g., MMLU) are better suited than others (e.g., MUSR) for
capturing representational alignment, no existing benchmark is capable of fully
accounting for the variance of alignment scores, demonstrating their
insufficiency in capturing human-AI alignment. Taken together, our findings
help highlight the computational ingredients most essential for advancing LLMs
towards models of human conceptual representation and address a key
benchmarking gap in LLM evaluation.

### [182] [Activation-Deactivation: A General Framework for Robust Post-hoc Explainable AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01038)
*Akchunya Chanchal,David A. Kelly,Hana Chockler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Activation-Deactivation (AD), a novel forward-pass paradigm that removes occluded input features' effects by switching off corresponding model parts, implemented as ConvAD for CNNs. This provides more robust explanations without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current black-box explainability methods rely on occluding input parts, creating out-of-distribution images and requiring domain knowledge for occlusion value selection, raising doubts about explanation quality.

Method: Proposed ConvAD mechanism implements the AD paradigm by deactivating model parts corresponding to occluded features, ensuring the decision-making process remains unchanged. It can be added to any trained CNN without additional training.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows AD explanations achieve up to 62.5% improvement in robustness compared to occlusion-based methods, with consistent improvements across datasets and model architectures.

Conclusion: ConvAD provides more robust explanations without requiring domain knowledge for occlusion value selection, addressing key limitations of current black-box explainability methods.

Abstract: Black-box explainability methods are popular tools for explaining the
decisions of image classifiers. A major drawback of these tools is their
reliance on mutants obtained by occluding parts of the input, leading to
out-of-distribution images. This raises doubts about the quality of the
explanations. Moreover, choosing an appropriate occlusion value often requires
domain knowledge. In this paper we introduce a novel forward-pass paradigm
Activation-Deactivation (AD), which removes the effects of occluded input
features from the model's decision-making by switching off the parts of the
model that correspond to the occlusions. We introduce ConvAD, a drop-in
mechanism that can be easily added to any trained Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN), and which implements the AD paradigm. This leads to more robust
explanations without any additional training or fine-tuning. We prove that the
ConvAD mechanism does not change the decision-making process of the network. We
provide experimental evaluation across several datasets and model
architectures. We compare the quality of AD-explanations with explanations
achieved using a set of masking values, using the proxies of robustness, size,
and confidence drop-off. We observe a consistent improvement in robustness of
AD explanations (up to 62.5%) compared to explanations obtained with
occlusions, demonstrating that ConvAD extracts more robust explanations without
the need for domain knowledge.

### [183] [Typed Chain-of-Thought: A Curry-Howard Framework for Verifying LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01069)
*Elija Perrier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes using the Curry-Howard correspondence to verify the faithfulness of Chain-of-Thought reasoning by mapping natural language rationales to formal proof structures, enabling formal verification of computational faithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Chain-of-Thought prompting improves reasoning, the faithfulness of generated rationales remains unverified, posing problems for model interpretability and trustworthiness.

Method: The authors operationalize the Curry-Howard correspondence by extracting CoT reasoning steps and mapping them into formal typed proof structures, where successful conversion serves as verification of computational faithfulness.

Result: The framework provides a methodology to transform narrative explanations into formally verifiable programs, offering certificates of faithfulness beyond heuristic interpretability.

Conclusion: This approach moves beyond heuristic interpretability towards formal verification, providing a path to build more reliable and trustworthy AI systems through verifiable reasoning traces.

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances the reasoning capabilities of
large language models, the faithfulness of the generated rationales remains an
open problem for model interpretability. We propose a novel theoretical lens
for this problem grounded in the Curry-Howard correspondence, which posits a
direct relationship between formal proofs and computer programs. Under this
paradigm, a faithful reasoning trace is analogous to a well-typed program,
where each intermediate step corresponds to a typed logical inference. We
operationalise this analogy, presenting methods to extract and map the
informal, natural language steps of CoT into a formal, typed proof structure.
Successfully converting a CoT trace into a well-typed proof serves as a strong,
verifiable certificate of its computational faithfulness, moving beyond
heuristic interpretability towards formal verification. Our framework provides
a methodology to transform plausible narrative explanations into formally
verifiable programs, offering a path towards building more reliable and
trustworthy AI systems.

*Guobin Shen,Dongcheng Zhao,Haibo Tong,Jindong Li,Feifei Zhao,Yi Zeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SIRL leverages LLMs' internal safety instincts by using entropy differences between refusals and harmful content as self-generated rewards, achieving strong jailbreak defense without external supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM safety is challenging due to lack of universal standards and reliable content validators, making effective training signals difficult to obtain.

Method: Safety Instincts Reinforcement Learning (SIRL) transforms internal confidence into self-generated reward signals by reinforcing low-entropy refusal behaviors, eliminating dependence on external validators.

Result: SIRL maintains 89%+ Defense Success Rates against 20+ jailbreak methods using only 15,000 unlabeled prompts, surpassing supervised methods while preserving performance on other benchmarks.

Conclusion: Effective alignment can emerge from within models, paving the way for autonomous AI safety mechanisms that scale without extensive human oversight.

Abstract: Ensuring Large Language Model (LLM) safety remains challenging due to the
absence of universal standards and reliable content validators, making it
difficult to obtain effective training signals. We discover that aligned models
already possess robust internal safety beliefs: they consistently produce
high-confidence refusals to harmful requests while exhibiting high entropy when
generating potentially dangerous content. This entropy gap reveals an untapped
signal--models intrinsically "know" when to refuse. We introduce Safety
Instincts Reinforcement Learning (SIRL), which transforms this internal
confidence into a self-generated reward signal, eliminating dependence on
external validators or human annotations. SIRL teaches models to trust their
safety instincts by reinforcing low-entropy refusal behaviors. Evaluated on
Llama and Qwen models, SIRL maintains 89%+ Defense Success Rates (DSRs) against
20+ jailbreak methods, from static prompts to adaptive attacks. Using only
15,000 unlabeled prompts, SIRL surpasses resource-intensive supervised methods
while preserving performance on mathematics, coding, and conversation
benchmarks. Our work demonstrates that effective alignment can emerge from
within, paving the way for more autonomous and robust AI safety mechanisms that
scale without extensive human oversight.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A two-layer production planning framework combining Constraint Programming for order scheduling and MDP-based decision-making for worker allocation to optimize both operational efficiency and workforce fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for human-centric production planning that balances operational efficiency with workforce fairness in industrial manufacturing, integrating human factors like worker preferences and constraints.

Method: Two-layer approach: Layer 1 uses Constraint Programming for Order-Line allocation respecting machine capacities and due dates; Layer 2 uses Markov Decision Process for Worker-Line allocation considering worker preferences, experience, resilience, and medical constraints. Three solution strategies (greedy, MCTS, RL) were compared.

Result: CP-based scheduling produced compact, feasible production plans with low tardiness. MDP-based worker allocation significantly improved fairness and preference alignment. Domain experts validated effectiveness and suggested refinements for earliness penalties and worker assignment continuity.

Conclusion: Combining CP with learning-based decision-making provides a robust approach for human-centric production planning, enabling simultaneous optimization of throughput and workforce well-being in industrial manufacturing.

Abstract: This work presents a two-layer, human-centric production planning framework
designed to optimize both operational efficiency and workforce fairness in
industrial manufacturing. The first layer formulates the Order-Line allocation
as a Constraint Programming (CP) problem, generating high-utilization
production schedules that respect machine capacities, processing times, and due
dates. The second layer models Worker-Line allocation as a Markov Decision
Process (MDP), integrating human factors such as worker preference, experience,
resilience, and medical constraints into the assignment process. Three solution
strategies, greedy allocation, MCTS, and RL, are implemented and compared
across multiple evaluation scenarios. The proposed system is validated through
16 test sessions with domain experts from the automotive industry, combining
quantitative key performance indicators (KPIs) with expert ratings. Results
indicate that the CP-based scheduling approach produces compact, feasible
production plans with low tardiness, while the MDP-based worker allocation
significantly improves fairness and preference alignment compared to baseline
approaches. Domain experts rated both the Order-Line and Worker-Line components
as effective and highlighted opportunities to further refine the objective
function to penalize excessive earliness and improve continuity in worker
assignments. Overall, the findings demonstrate that combining CP with
learning-based decision-making provides a robust approach for human-centric
production planning. The approach enables simultaneous optimization of
throughput and workforce well-being, offering a practical foundation for fair
and efficient manufacturing scheduling in industrial settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PRISM-Consult is a clinician-aligned panel-of-experts architecture that extends the compact PRISM sequence model into a routed family of domain specialists for emergency department clinical consultations, achieving high routing quality and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a practical framework for safe, auditable, and low-latency clinical consultations at scale by developing a routed system of domain specialists that can efficiently handle diverse medical cases while maintaining interpretability and parameter efficiency.

Method: Extends PRISM sequence model into a routed panel-of-experts architecture with specialists for Cardiac-Vascular, Pulmonary, Gastro-Oesophageal, Musculoskeletal, and Psychogenic domains. Uses structured clinical event tokenization, light-weight router that dispatches based on initial tokens, and inherits PRISM's small transformer backbone for parameter efficiency.

Result: Specialists exhibit smooth convergence with low development perplexities across domains, router achieves high routing quality and large compute savings versus consult-all approach under safety-first policy. Framework demonstrates practical performance on real-world Emergency Department cohorts.

Conclusion: PRISM-Consult provides a viable path to clinical deployment with validation steps including external/temporal replication, asymmetric life-threat thresholds, and multi-label arbitration to meet prospective clinical standards for safe and scalable consultations.

Abstract: We present PRISM-Consult, a clinician-aligned panel-of-experts architecture
that extends the compact PRISM sequence model into a routed family of domain
specialists. Episodes are tokenized as structured clinical events; a
light-weight router reads the first few tokens and dispatches to specialist
models (Cardiac-Vascular, Pulmonary, Gastro-Oesophageal, Musculoskeletal,
Psychogenic). Each specialist inherits PRISM's small transformer backbone and
token template, enabling parameter efficiency and interpretability. On
real-world Emergency Department cohorts, specialists exhibit smooth convergence
with low development perplexities across domains, while the router achieves
high routing quality and large compute savings versus consult-all under a
safety-first policy. We detail the data methodology (initial vs. conclusive
ICD-9 families), routing thresholds and calibration, and report per-domain
results to avoid dominance by common events. The framework provides a practical
path to safe, auditable, and low-latency consult at scale, and we outline
validation steps-external/temporal replication, asymmetric life-threat
thresholds, and multi-label arbitration-to meet prospective clinical deployment
standards.

*Evan Heus,Rick Bookstaber,Dhruv Sharma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An LLM-centric agent framework for supply chain risk analysis that treats supply chains as knowledge graphs, uses network centrality for retrieval, and employs context shells to make quantitative data understandable to LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with complex multi-modal financial risk data, standard RAG oversimplifies relationships, and specialist models are costly and static.

Method: Treat supply chain as knowledge graph, use graph traverser guided by network centrality scores, orchestrate graph retrieval with numerical data and news streams, employ context shells to embed raw figures in natural language.

Result: Enables generation of concise, explainable, and context-rich risk narratives in real-time without costly fine-tuning or dedicated graph database.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap between LLMs and complex financial risk analysis through network-KG duality and context shells.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with the complex, multi-modal, and
network-native data underlying financial risk. Standard Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) oversimplifies relationships, while specialist models are
costly and static. We address this gap with an LLM-centric agent framework for
supply chain risk analysis. Our core contribution is to exploit the inherent
duality between networks and knowledge graphs (KG). We treat the supply chain
network as a KG, allowing us to use structural network science principles for
retrieval. A graph traverser, guided by network centrality scores, efficiently
extracts the most economically salient risk paths. An agentic architecture
orchestrates this graph retrieval alongside data from numerical factor tables
and news streams. Crucially, it employs novel ``context shells'' -- descriptive
templates that embed raw figures in natural language -- to make quantitative
data fully intelligible to the LLM. This lightweight approach enables the model
to generate concise, explainable, and context-rich risk narratives in real-time
without costly fine-tuning or a dedicated graph database.

TL;DR: Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker is a 15B parameter multimodal reasoning model that achieves frontier-level performance through progressive three-stage training design rather than scale, matching larger models while being deployable on single GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that frontier-level multimodal reasoning can be achieved through thoughtful training design rather than massive scale, making advanced AI accessible to organizations with limited computational resources.

Method: Three-stage progressive methodology: (1) depth upscaling from Pixtral-12B, (2) staged continual pre-training with synthetic data for visual reasoning, and (3) high-quality text-only supervised fine-tuning with explicit reasoning traces.

### [189] [Generalized Parallel Scaling with Interdependent Generations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01143)
*Harry Dong,David Brandfonbrener,Eryk Helenowski,Yun He,Mrinal Kumar,Han Fang,Yuejie Chi,Karthik Abinav Sankararaman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Bridge enables parallel LLM inference by generating interdependent responses instead of independent ones, using a small parameter overhead to share information between parallel generations for improved quality and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current parallel LLM inference generates responses independently, wasting potential information sharing between parallel generations and partitioning compute resources inefficiently.

Method: Bridge reinterprets batched LLM hidden states as holistic tensors rather than independent slices, adding only 2.8%-5.1% new parameters to create interdependent parallel responses.

Result: Bridge improves relative mean accuracy gains from reinforcement learning by up to 50%, boosts consistency of correct responses, and scales to any generation width with better performance than independent generations.

Conclusion: Bridge unlocks a more general mode of parallel scaling that effectively leverages information between sequences, compatible with any post-generation aggregation technique.

Abstract: Parallel LLM inference scaling involves sampling a set of $N>1$ responses for
a single input prompt. However, these $N$ parallel responses tend to be
generated independently from each other, partitioning compute resources and
leaving potentially useful information in one generation untapped by others.
This is in contrast to response length scaling where past computation is used
in all future steps. For higher quality responses and response sets, we propose
Bridge to generate interdependent responses in parallel by rethinking batched
LLM hidden states as holistic tensors rather than independent slices. With only
a small amount (2.8%-5.1%) of new parameters, Bridge improves the relative mean
accuracy gains from reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards by up to 50%
and boosts consistency of correct responses. Trained once, Bridge scales to any
generation width, all with greater performance than independent generations,
unlocking a more general mode of parallel scaling that effectively leverages
information between sequences, compatible with any post-generation aggregation
technique.
