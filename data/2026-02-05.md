  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting's commercial value and explicit structure raise IP protection concerns, but current research is fragmented without unified understanding of mechanisms and challenges.

Method: Present a systematic survey with bottom-up framework examining: (i) Gaussian-based perturbation mechanisms, (ii) passive/active protection paradigms, (iii) robustness threats in generative AI era.

Result: Reveals gaps in technical foundations and robustness characterization, identifies opportunities for deeper investigation into 3DGS IP protection.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a mainstream representation for real-time 3D scene synthesis, enabling applications in virtual and augmented reality, robotics, and 3D content creation. Its rising commercial value and explicit parametric structure raise emerging intellectual property (IP) protection concerns, prompting a surge of research on 3DGS IP protection. However, current progress remains fragmented, lacking a unified view of the underlying mechanisms, protection paradigms, and robustness challenges. To address this gap, we present the first systematic survey on 3DGS IP protection and introduce a bottom-up framework that examines (i) underlying Gaussian-based perturbation mechanisms, (ii) passive and active protection paradigms, and (iii) robustness threats under emerging generative AI era, revealing gaps in technical foundations and robustness characterization and indicating opportunities for deeper investigation. Finally, we outline six research directions across robustness, efficiency, and protection paradigms, offering a roadmap toward reliable and trustworthy IP protection for 3DGS assets.

*Ali Bayeh,Samira Sadaoui,Malek Mouhoub*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TruKAN replaces KAN's B-spline basis with truncated power functions for better efficiency and interpretability while maintaining expressiveness, outperforming other KAN variants in vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between computational efficiency and adherence to KAN principles by developing a more interpretable and efficient KAN variant that maintains expressiveness while improving training time and accuracy.

Method: Propose TruKAN architecture that replaces B-spline basis with truncated power functions from k-order spline theory, combining truncated power term with polynomial term, using shared or individual knots. Integrate into EfficientNet-V2 framework and compare with MLP-, KAN-, and SineKAN-based models using hybrid optimization and layer normalization techniques.

Result: TruKAN outperforms other KAN models in accuracy, computational efficiency, and memory usage on complex vision tasks, demonstrating advantages beyond prior KAN studies. Shows greater interpretability due to simplified basis functions and knot configurations.

Conclusion: TruKAN successfully balances approximation efficacy with transparency, offering a more interpretable and efficient alternative to existing KAN variants while maintaining strong performance on computer vision benchmarks.

Abstract: To address the trade-off between computational efficiency and adherence to Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) principles, we propose TruKAN, a new architecture based on the KAN structure and learnable activation functions. TruKAN replaces the B-spline basis in KAN with a family of truncated power functions derived from k-order spline theory. This change maintains the KAN's expressiveness while enhancing accuracy and training time. Each TruKAN layer combines a truncated power term with a polynomial term and employs either shared or individual knots. TruKAN exhibits greater interpretability than other KAN variants due to its simplified basis functions and knot configurations. By prioritizing interpretable basis functions, TruKAN aims to balance approximation efficacy with transparency. We develop the TruKAN model and integrate it into an advanced EfficientNet-V2-based framework, which is then evaluated on computer vision benchmark datasets. To ensure a fair comparison, we develop various models: MLP-, KAN-, SineKAN and TruKAN-based EfficientNet frameworks and assess their training time and accuracy across small and deep architectures. The training phase uses hybrid optimization to improve convergence stability. Additionally, we investigate layer normalization techniques for all the models and assess the impact of shared versus individual knots in TruKAN. Overall, TruKAN outperforms other KAN models in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency and memory usage on the complex vision task, demonstrating advantages beyond the limited settings explored in prior KAN studies.

*Maxx Richard Rahman,Mostafa Hammouda,Wolfgang Maass*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiGAN integrates latent diffusion modeling with attention-guided convolutional networks to improve early Alzheimer's disease detection from limited longitudinal neuroimaging data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early Alzheimer's diagnosis is challenging due to subtle, irregular progression of brain changes in prodromal stages. Existing deep learning methods require large datasets and fail to handle temporal continuity and modality irregularities in real-world clinical data.

Method: Proposes Diffusion-Guided Attention Network (DiGAN) with two components: 1) diffusion model synthesizes realistic longitudinal neuroimaging trajectories from limited data, enriching temporal context and handling unevenly spaced visits; 2) attention-convolutional layer captures discriminative structural-temporal patterns distinguishing normal cognition from mild cognitive impairment and subjective cognitive decline.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and ADNI datasets show DiGAN outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines for early-stage AD detection.

Conclusion: DiGAN demonstrates potential for early Alzheimer's disease detection by effectively addressing data limitations and temporal irregularities in longitudinal neuroimaging through diffusion-based synthesis and attention-guided feature learning.

Abstract: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a major challenge due to the subtle and temporally irregular progression of structural brain changes in the prodromal stages. Existing deep learning approaches require large longitudinal datasets and often fail to model the temporal continuity and modality irregularities inherent in real-world clinical data. To address these limitations, we propose the Diffusion-Guided Attention Network (DiGAN), which integrates latent diffusion modelling with an attention-guided convolutional network. The diffusion model synthesizes realistic longitudinal neuroimaging trajectories from limited training data, enriching temporal context and improving robustness to unevenly spaced visits. The attention-convolutional layer then captures discriminative structural--temporal patterns that distinguish cognitively normal subjects from those with mild cognitive impairment and subjective cognitive decline. Experiments on synthetic and ADNI datasets demonstrate that DiGAN outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines, showing its potential for early-stage AD detection.

*Haijiang Yan,Nick Chater,Adam Sanborn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PriorProbe is a novel method that uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo with People to recover individual cognitive priors, enabling personalized neural networks that outperform standard models on ambiguous facial expression recognition tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for eliciting individual-level cognitive priors either fail to uniquely identify them or introduce systematic biases, limiting effective personalization of neural networks.

Method: PriorProbe uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo with People to recover fine-grained, individual-specific priors, applied to facial expression recognition tasks to personalize neural networks.

Result: PriorProbe-derived priors yield substantial performance gains over neural networks alone and alternative prior sources, while preserving the network's inference on ground-truth labels.

Conclusion: PriorProbe provides a general and interpretable framework for personalizing deep neural networks by accurately recovering individual cognitive priors.

Abstract: Incorporating individual-level cognitive priors offers an important route to personalizing neural networks, yet accurately eliciting such priors remains challenging: existing methods either fail to uniquely identify them or introduce systematic biases. Here, we introduce PriorProbe, a novel elicitation approach grounded in Markov Chain Monte Carlo with People that recovers fine-grained, individual-specific priors. Focusing on a facial expression recognition task, we apply PriorProbe to individual participants and test whether integrating the recovered priors with a state-of-the-art neural network improves its ability to predict an individual's classification on ambiguous stimuli. The PriorProbe-derived priors yield substantial performance gains, outperforming both the neural network alone and alternative sources of priors, while preserving the network's inference on ground-truth labels. Together, these results demonstrate that PriorProbe provides a general and interpretable framework for personalizing deep neural networks.

### [5] [Explainable Computer Vision Framework for Automated Pore Detection and Criticality Assessment in Additive Manufacturing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03883)
*Akshansh Mishra,Rakesh Morisetty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Explainable AI framework for detecting and assessing pore criticality in 3D-printed parts using tomographic data, revealing surface proximity as the dominant factor in failure prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Internal porosity in additively manufactured components compromises structural performance, and existing automated defect detection methods lack interpretability, preventing engineers from understanding the physical basis of criticality predictions.

Method: Used 3D tomographic volumes reconstructed from grayscale slices, applied intensity-based thresholding with connected component analysis to identify 500 pores, characterized pores with geometric descriptors (size, aspect ratio, extent, spatial position), constructed pore interaction network with 24,950 connections, used machine learning models to predict criticality scores, and applied SHAP analysis to quantify feature contributions.

Result: Normalized surface distance dominates model predictions with more than an order of magnitude greater importance than all other descriptors; pore size provides minimal influence; geometric parameters show negligible impact; strong inverse relationship between surface proximity and criticality reveals boundary-driven failure mechanisms.

Conclusion: The interpretable framework enables transparent defect assessment and provides actionable insights for process optimization and quality control in additive manufacturing, addressing the critical need for explainable defect analysis in industrial applications.

Abstract: Internal porosity remains a critical defect mode in additively manufactured components, compromising structural performance and limiting industrial adoption. Automated defect detection methods exist but lack interpretability, preventing engineers from understanding the physical basis of criticality predictions. This study presents an explainable computer vision framework for pore detection and criticality assessment in three-dimensional tomographic volumes. Sequential grayscale slices were reconstructed into volumetric datasets, and intensity-based thresholding with connected component analysis identified 500 individual pores. Each pore was characterized using geometric descriptors including size, aspect ratio, extent, and spatial position relative to the specimen boundary. A pore interaction network was constructed using percentile-based Euclidean distance criteria, yielding 24,950 inter-pore connections. Machine learning models predicted pore criticality scores from extracted features, and SHAP analysis quantified individual feature contributions. Results demonstrate that normalized surface distance dominates model predictions, contributing more than an order of magnitude greater importance than all other descriptors. Pore size provides minimal influence, while geometric parameters show negligible impact. The strong inverse relationship between surface proximity and criticality reveals boundary-driven failure mechanisms. This interpretable framework enables transparent defect assessment and provides actionable insights for process optimization and quality control in additive manufacturing.

*Xindan Zhang,Weilong Yan,Yufei Shi,Xuerui Qiu,Tao He,Ying Li,Ming Li,Hehe Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4DPC²hat is the first multimodal large language model for dynamic point cloud understanding, featuring a large-scale dataset and Mamba-enhanced temporal reasoning with failure-aware bootstrapping learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal LLMs focus on static 3D objects, but understanding dynamic point cloud sequences remains unexplored due to lack of large-scale cross-modal datasets and difficulty modeling motions in spatio-temporal contexts.

Method: 1) Construct 4DPC²hat-200K dataset via two-stage pipeline (topology-consistent 4D point construction + two-level captioning); 2) Mamba-enhanced temporal reasoning MLLM for long-range dependencies; 3) Failure-aware bootstrapping learning strategy that iteratively identifies deficiencies and generates targeted QA supervision.

Result: Dataset contains 44K dynamic object sequences, 700K point cloud frames, and 200K curated QA pairs. Model significantly improves action understanding and temporal reasoning compared to existing models, establishing strong foundation for 4D dynamic point cloud understanding.

Conclusion: 4DPC²hat bridges the gap in dynamic point cloud understanding through comprehensive dataset construction, Mamba-enhanced temporal modeling, and adaptive learning strategy, enabling effective 4D point cloud comprehension.

Abstract: Point clouds provide a compact and expressive representation of 3D objects, and have recently been integrated into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing methods primarily focus on static objects, while understanding dynamic point cloud sequences remains largely unexplored. This limitation is mainly caused by the lack of large-scale cross-modal datasets and the difficulty of modeling motions in spatio-temporal contexts. To bridge this gap, we present 4DPC$^2$hat, the first MLLM tailored for dynamic point cloud understanding. To this end, we construct a large-scale cross-modal dataset 4DPC$^2$hat-200K via a meticulous two-stage pipeline consisting of topology-consistent 4D point construction and two-level captioning. The dataset contains over 44K dynamic object sequences, 700K point cloud frames, and 200K curated question-answer (QA) pairs, supporting inquiries about counting, temporal relationship, action, spatial relationship, and appearance. At the core of the framework, we introduce a Mamba-enhanced temporal reasoning MLLM to capture long-range dependencies and dynamic patterns among a point cloud sequence. Furthermore, we propose a failure-aware bootstrapping learning strategy that iteratively identifies model deficiencies and generates targeted QA supervision to continuously strengthen corresponding reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 4DPC$^2$hat significantly improves action understanding and temporal reasoning compared with existing models, establishing a strong foundation for 4D dynamic point cloud understanding.

### [7] [Audit After Segmentation: Reference-Free Mask Quality Assessment for Language-Referred Audio-Visual Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03892)
*Jinxing Zhou,Yanghao Zhou,Yaoting Wang,Zongyan Han,Jiaqi Ma,Henghui Ding,Rao Muhammad Anwer,Hisham Cholakkal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces MQA-RefAVS, a new task for assessing segmentation mask quality in audio-visual-language segmentation without ground truth, with benchmark MQ-RAVSBench and MLLM-based auditor MQ-Auditor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Ref-AVS systems generate segmentation masks but lack interpretable quality assessment. There's a need to evaluate mask quality without ground truth references and provide actionable diagnoses.

Method: Proposes MQA-RefAVS task requiring IoU estimation, error type identification, and quality-control recommendations. Creates MQ-RAVSBench benchmark with diverse error modes, and develops MQ-Auditor, a multimodal LLM that reasons over audio-visual-language inputs and mask information.

Result: MQ-Auditor outperforms strong open-source and commercial MLLMs, can detect segmentation failures, and supports downstream segmentation improvement when integrated with existing Ref-AVS systems.

Conclusion: MQA-RefAVS addresses the underexplored area of interpretable mask quality assessment in multimodal segmentation, providing both quantitative evaluation and actionable recommendations for quality control.

Abstract: Language-referred audio-visual segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to segment target objects described by natural language by jointly reasoning over video, audio, and text. Beyond generating segmentation masks, providing rich and interpretable diagnoses of mask quality remains largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce Mask Quality Assessment in the Ref-AVS context (MQA-RefAVS), a new task that evaluates the quality of candidate segmentation masks without relying on ground-truth annotations as references at inference time. Given audio-visual-language inputs and each provided segmentation mask, the task requires estimating its IoU with the unobserved ground truth, identifying the corresponding error type, and recommending an actionable quality-control decision. To support this task, we construct MQ-RAVSBench, a benchmark featuring diverse and representative mask error modes that span both geometric and semantic issues. We further propose MQ-Auditor, a multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based auditor that explicitly reasons over multimodal cues and mask information to produce quantitative and qualitative mask quality assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MQ-Auditor outperforms strong open-source and commercial MLLMs and can be integrated with existing Ref-AVS systems to detect segmentation failures and support downstream segmentation improvement. Data and codes will be released at https://github.com/jasongief/MQA-RefAVS.

TL;DR: GPAIR: Ultrafast 3D photoacoustic iterative reconstruction using Gaussian kernels achieves sub-second reconstruction for 8.4M voxels, enabling near-real-time clinical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms for 3D photoacoustic computed tomography suffer from extremely long reconstruction times (hundreds of seconds to hours), severely limiting practical clinical applicability due to computational burden.

Method: GPAIR transforms traditional spatial grids with continuous isotropic Gaussian kernels, derives analytical closed-form expressions for pressure waves, and implements GPU-accelerated differentiable Triton operators for computational efficiency.

Result: Achieves orders-of-magnitude acceleration with ultrafast sub-second reconstruction speed for 3D targets containing 8.4 million voxels in animal experiments, enabling near-real-time large-scale 3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: GPAIR represents a revolutionary ultrafast image reconstruction method that significantly advances 3D PACT toward practical clinical applications by overcoming computational bottlenecks.

Abstract: Although the iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithm can substantially correct reconstruction artifacts in photoacoustic (PA) computed tomography (PACT), it suffers from long reconstruction times, especially for large-scale three-dimensional (3D) imaging in which IR takes hundreds of seconds to hours. The computing burden severely limits the practical applicability of IR algorithms. In this work, we proposed an ultrafast IR method for 3D PACT, called Gaussian-kernel-based Ultrafast 3D Photoacoustic Iterative Reconstruction (GPAIR), which achieves orders-of-magnitude acceleration in computing. GPAIR transforms traditional spatial grids with continuous isotropic Gaussian kernels. By deriving analytical closed-form expression for pressure waves and implementing powerful GPU-accelerated differentiable Triton operators, GPAIR demonstrates extraordinary ultrafast sub-second reconstruction speed for 3D targets containing 8.4 million voxels in animal experiments. This revolutionary ultrafast image reconstruction enables near-real-time large-scale 3D PA reconstruction, significantly advancing 3D PACT toward clinical applications.

*Hugo Markoff,Stefan Hein Bengtson,Michael Ørsted*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViT foundation models with dimensionality reduction and clustering can achieve near-perfect species-level clustering of animal images without manual labeling, enabling efficient biodiversity monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual labeling of animal images is a bottleneck in ecological research, limiting the scale and efficiency of biodiversity monitoring. There's a need for automated methods to process thousands of unlabeled animal images.

Method: Comprehensive benchmarking framework evaluating five Vision Transformer (ViT) models combined with five dimensionality reduction techniques and four clustering algorithms (two supervised, two unsupervised). Tested across 60 species (30 mammals, 30 birds) using 200 validated images per species.

Result: Near-perfect species-level clustering (V-measure: 0.958) using DINOv3 embeddings with t-SNE and supervised hierarchical clustering. Unsupervised approaches achieved competitive performance (0.943) while rejecting only 1.14% of images as outliers. Robust to long-tailed species distributions, and intentional over-clustering reliably extracted intra-specific variation (age classes, sexual dimorphism, pelage differences).

Conclusion: ViT foundation models can effectively reduce thousands of unlabeled animal images to species-level clusters, with unsupervised methods performing competitively without prior species knowledge. The approach enables efficient biodiversity monitoring and reveals ecologically meaningful intra-specific patterns.

Abstract: Manual labeling of animal images remains a significant bottleneck in ecological research, limiting the scale and efficiency of biodiversity monitoring efforts. This study investigates whether state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) foundation models can reduce thousands of unlabeled animal images directly to species-level clusters. We present a comprehensive benchmarking framework evaluating five ViT models combined with five dimensionality reduction techniques and four clustering algorithms, two supervised and two unsupervised, across 60 species (30 mammals and 30 birds), with each test using a random subset of 200 validated images per species. We investigate when clustering succeeds at species-level, where it fails, and whether clustering within the species-level reveals ecologically meaningful patterns such as sex, age, or phenotypic variation. Our results demonstrate near-perfect species-level clustering (V-measure: 0.958) using DINOv3 embeddings with t-SNE and supervised hierarchical clustering methods. Unsupervised approaches achieve competitive performance (0.943) while requiring no prior species knowledge, rejecting only 1.14% of images as outliers requiring expert review. We further demonstrate robustness to realistic long-tailed distributions of species and show that intentional over-clustering can reliably extract intra-specific variation including age classes, sexual dimorphism, and pelage differences. We introduce an open-source benchmarking toolkit and provide recommendations for ecologists to select appropriate methods for sorting their specific taxonomic groups and data.

### [10] [Benchmarking Bias Mitigation Toward Fairness Without Harm from Vision to LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03895)
*Xuwei Tan,Ziyu Hu,Xueru Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NH-Fair is a unified benchmark for evaluating fairness in vision and vision-language models, showing that well-tuned ERM often matches specialized debiasing methods, while composite data augmentation consistently improves fairness without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing bias mitigation methods are difficult to compare due to heterogeneous datasets, inconsistent fairness metrics, isolated evaluation of vision vs. multi-modal models, and insufficient hyperparameter tuning that undermines fair comparisons.

Method: NH-Fair introduces a unified benchmark spanning both vision models and large vision-language models (LVLMs) under standardized data, metrics, and training protocols, covering supervised and zero-shot regimes. It includes systematic ERM tuning studies and reproducible evaluation pipelines.

Result: 1) Systematic tuning identifies training choices with large influence on utility and disparities; 2) Many debiasing methods don't outperform well-tuned ERM, while composite data-augmentation consistently delivers parity gains without utility loss; 3) LVLMs achieve higher average accuracy but still exhibit subgroup disparities, with scaling gains smaller than architectural/training choices.

Conclusion: NH-Fair provides a reproducible, tuning-aware pipeline for rigorous fairness evaluation, showing that careful training protocol design and composite data augmentation are more effective than many specialized debiasing methods, and that fairness challenges persist even in large vision-language models.

Abstract: Machine learning models trained on real-world data often inherit and amplify biases against certain social groups, raising urgent concerns about their deployment at scale. While numerous bias mitigation methods have been proposed, comparing the effectiveness of bias mitigation methods remains difficult due to heterogeneous datasets, inconsistent fairness metrics, isolated evaluation of vision versus multi-modal models, and insufficient hyperparameter tuning that undermines fair comparisons. We introduce NH-Fair, a unified benchmark for fairness without harm that spans both vision models and large vision-language models (LVLMs) under standardized data, metrics, and training protocols, covering supervised and zero-shot regimes. Our key contributions are: (1) a systematic ERM tuning study that identifies training choices with large influence on both utility and disparities, yielding empirically grounded guidelines to help practitioners reduce expensive hyperparameter tuning space in achieving strong fairness and accuracy; (2) evidence that many debiasing methods do not reliably outperform a well-tuned ERM baseline, whereas a composite data-augmentation method consistently delivers parity gains without sacrificing utility, emerging as a promising practical strategy. (3) an analysis showing that while LVLMs achieve higher average accuracy, they still exhibit subgroup disparities, and gains from scaling are typically smaller than those from architectural or training-protocol choices. NH-Fair provides a reproducible, tuning-aware pipeline for rigorous, harm-aware fairness evaluation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EASA-Net: An entropy-aware structural alignment network for zero-shot handwritten Chinese character recognition that uses information entropy priors and dual-view radical trees to bridge visual-semantic gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot HCCR methods treat characters as flat radical sequences, ignoring hierarchical topology and uneven information density of different components, leading to suboptimal performance in recognizing unseen characters.

Method: Proposes EASA-Net with three key components: 1) Information Entropy Prior to dynamically modulate positional embeddings via multiplicative interaction, 2) Dual-View Radical Tree to extract multi-granularity structural features integrated via adaptive Sigmoid-based gating, and 3) Top-K Semantic Feature Fusion mechanism using centroid of semantic neighbors to rectify visual ambiguities.

Result: Establishes new state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing CLIP-based baselines in challenging zero-shot setting, and demonstrates exceptional data efficiency with rapid adaptability using minimal support samples.

Conclusion: The proposed entropy-aware structural alignment approach effectively bridges the visual-semantic gap in zero-shot HCCR by modeling hierarchical topology and information density, achieving superior performance and data efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Zero-shot Handwritten Chinese Character Recognition (HCCR) aims to recognize unseen characters by leveraging radical-based semantic compositions. However, existing approaches often treat characters as flat radical sequences, neglecting the hierarchical topology and the uneven information density of different components. To address these limitations, we propose an Entropy-Aware Structural Alignment Network that bridges the visual-semantic gap through information-theoretic modeling. First, we introduce an Information Entropy Prior to dynamically modulate positional embeddings via multiplicative interaction, acting as a saliency detector that prioritizes discriminative roots over ubiquitous components. Second, we construct a Dual-View Radical Tree to extract multi-granularity structural features, which are integrated via an adaptive Sigmoid-based gating network to encode both global layout and local spatial roles. Finally, a Top-K Semantic Feature Fusion mechanism is devised to augment the decoding process by utilizing the centroid of semantic neighbors, effectively rectifying visual ambiguities through feature-level consensus. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method establishes new state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing CLIP-based baselines in the challenging zero-shot setting. Furthermore, the framework exhibits exceptional data efficiency, demonstrating rapid adaptability with minimal support samples.

*Levi Lingsch,Georgios Kissas,Johannes Jakubik,Siddhartha Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Phaedra is a new tokenizer for scientific images that better preserves physical and spectral properties compared to existing tokenizers designed for visual perception, improving reconstruction accuracy and generalization for PDE datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image tokenizers are optimized for realistic visual perception but struggle with scientific images that have large dynamic ranges and require preservation of physical/spectral properties. There's a need for tokenizers specifically designed for scientific applications like PDE simulation.

Method: Proposed Phaedra tokenizer, inspired by classical shape-gain quantization and proper orthogonal decomposition, designed to capture both fine details and precise magnitudes in scientific images. Evaluated across PDE datasets using metrics measuring fidelity of PDE properties in physical and spectral space.

Result: Phaedra consistently improves reconstruction across PDE datasets and shows strong out-of-distribution generalization to three complex tasks: known PDEs with different conditions, unknown PDEs, and real-world Earth observation/weather data.

Conclusion: Specialized tokenizers like Phaedra are necessary for scientific images to preserve physical properties, offering better accuracy and generalization than tokenizers designed for visual perception, enabling more effective deep learning applications in scientific domains.

Abstract: Tokens are discrete representations that allow modern deep learning to scale by transforming high-dimensional data into sequences that can be efficiently learned, generated, and generalized to new tasks. These have become foundational for image and video generation and, more recently, physical simulation. As existing tokenizers are designed for the explicit requirements of realistic visual perception of images, it is necessary to ask whether these approaches are optimal for scientific images, which exhibit a large dynamic range and require token embeddings to retain physical and spectral properties. In this work, we investigate the accuracy of a suite of image tokenizers across a range of metrics designed to measure the fidelity of PDE properties in both physical and spectral space. Based on the observation that these struggle to capture both fine details and precise magnitudes, we propose Phaedra, inspired by classical shape-gain quantization and proper orthogonal decomposition. We demonstrate that Phaedra consistently improves reconstruction across a range of PDE datasets. Additionally, our results show strong out-of-distribution generalization capabilities to three tasks of increasing complexity, namely known PDEs with different conditions, unknown PDEs, and real-world Earth observation and weather data.

Conclusion: SpatiaLab exposes critical limitations in VLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities and provides a diverse, real-world evaluation framework to guide future research toward robust, human-aligned spatial understanding.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human cognition, yet it remains a major challenge for contemporary vision-language models (VLMs). Prior work largely relied on synthetic or LLM-generated environments with limited task designs and puzzle-like setups, failing to capture the real-world complexity, visual noise, and diverse spatial relationships that VLMs encounter. To address this, we introduce SpatiaLab, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLMs' spatial reasoning in realistic, unconstrained contexts. SpatiaLab comprises 1,400 visual question-answer pairs across six major categories: Relative Positioning, Depth & Occlusion, Orientation, Size & Scale, Spatial Navigation, and 3D Geometry, each with five subcategories, yielding 30 distinct task types. Each subcategory contains at least 25 questions, and each main category includes at least 200 questions, supporting both multiple-choice and open-ended evaluation. Experiments across diverse state-of-the-art VLMs, including open- and closed-source models, reasoning-focused, and specialized spatial reasoning models, reveal a substantial gap in spatial reasoning capabilities compared with humans. In the multiple-choice setup, InternVL3.5-72B achieves 54.93% accuracy versus 87.57% for humans. In the open-ended setting, all models show a performance drop of around 10-25%, with GPT-5-mini scoring highest at 40.93% versus 64.93% for humans. These results highlight key limitations in handling complex spatial relationships, depth perception, navigation, and 3D geometry. By providing a diverse, real-world evaluation framework, SpatiaLab exposes critical challenges and opportunities for advancing VLMs' spatial reasoning, offering a benchmark to guide future research toward robust, human-aligned spatial understanding.

*Peihao Xiang,Kaida Wu,Ou Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gardener: A data-free, one-shot block pruning method for masked self-supervised vision transformers that uses information entropy of pretrained weights to identify redundant blocks without needing any data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Masked self-supervised vision transformers have large model sizes that challenge resource-constrained deployment and efficient transfer learning. The paper investigates whether all transformer blocks are equally important for downstream performance.

Method: Gardener uses information-theoretic measurements of pretrained block weights (information entropy) to estimate block importance without data. It identifies redundant blocks through simple entropy analysis, correlating weight entropy with oracle sensitivity from iterative block removal and finetuning.

Result: Gardener matches or outperforms existing data-free pruning baselines and approaches sensitivity-based pruning performance. Remarkably, even after pruning up to 91.7% of blocks, pruned models retain competitive transfer performance on video recognition benchmarks.

Conclusion: Masked self-supervised vision transformers have substantial block-level redundancy, and information-theoretic analysis offers a principled, efficient pathway for model compression and resource-efficient transfer learning without requiring data access.

Abstract: Masked self-supervised vision transformers have become a dominant pretraining paradigm, yet their substantial model size poses significant challenges for resource-constrained deployment and efficient transfer learning. A fundamental question remains: are all transformer blocks equally important for downstream performance? In this paper, we show that block importance in masked self-supervised vision transformers can be accurately estimated without access to any data. Our key finding is that the information entropy of pretrained block weights strongly correlates with oracle sensitivity obtained via iterative block removal and finetuning. This observation enables Gardener, a data-free, one-shot, block-level pruning principle that identifies redundant blocks through simple information-theoretic measurements. We evaluate Gardener on VideoMAE-B across multiple pruning ratios and downstream video recognition benchmarks. Despite its negligible computational overhead, Gardener consistently matches or outperforms existing data-free pruning baselines and closely approaches sensitivity-based pruning. Remarkably, even after pruning up to 91.7\% of blocks, the pruned model retains competitive transfer performance. Our results reveal substantial block-level redundancy in masked self-supervised vision transformers and demonstrate that information-theoretic analysis offers a principled and efficient pathway for model compression and resource-efficient transfer learning.

*Leeje Jang,Yijun Lin,Yao-Yi Chiang,Jerod Weinman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TiCLS is a new scene text spotting method that integrates external linguistic knowledge from character-level pretrained language models to better handle ambiguous or fragmented text in real-world images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scene text spotting methods rely mainly on visual cues and implicit character dependencies, overlooking the benefits of external linguistic knowledge. Previous attempts to use language models either lack external knowledge or use models misaligned with word-level scene text granularity.

Method: TiCLS is an end-to-end text spotter that explicitly incorporates external linguistic knowledge from character-level pretrained language models. It introduces a linguistic decoder that fuses visual and linguistic features, which can be initialized by a pretrained language model.

Result: Experiments on ICDAR 2015 and Total-Text datasets show that TiCLS achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of PLM-guided linguistic integration for scene text spotting.

Conclusion: The proposed TiCLS demonstrates that explicitly incorporating external linguistic knowledge from character-level pretrained language models significantly improves scene text spotting performance, especially for ambiguous or fragmented text instances.

Abstract: Scene text spotting aims to detect and recognize text in real-world images, where instances are often short, fragmented, or visually ambiguous. Existing methods primarily rely on visual cues and implicitly capture local character dependencies, but they overlook the benefits of external linguistic knowledge. Prior attempts to integrate language models either adapt language modeling objectives without external knowledge or apply pretrained models that are misaligned with the word-level granularity of scene text. We propose TiCLS, an end-to-end text spotter that explicitly incorporates external linguistic knowledge from a character-level pretrained language model. TiCLS introduces a linguistic decoder that fuses visual and linguistic features, yet can be initialized by a pretrained language model, enabling robust recognition of ambiguous or fragmented text. Experiments on ICDAR 2015 and Total-Text demonstrate that TiCLS achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of PLM-guided linguistic integration for scene text spotting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnyStyle enables pose-free 3D reconstruction with zero-shot stylization using text or image conditioning, improving controllability while preserving geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's growing demand for rapid 3D asset creation, but existing feed-forward 3D reconstruction methods lack effective stylization and appearance control. Current approaches rely on image-based conditioning which limits controllability and flexibility.

Method: AnyStyle introduces a modular stylization architecture with multimodal conditioning (textual and visual style inputs) that requires minimal modifications to existing feed-forward 3D reconstruction backbones like 3D Gaussian Splatting.

Result: Experiments show AnyStyle improves style controllability over prior methods while preserving high-quality geometric reconstruction. A user study confirms superior stylization quality compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: AnyStyle provides an effective framework for pose-free 3D reconstruction with flexible zero-shot stylization capabilities, advancing the field of controllable 3D asset creation.

Abstract: The growing demand for rapid and scalable 3D asset creation has driven interest in feed-forward 3D reconstruction methods, with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) emerging as an effective scene representation. While recent approaches have demonstrated pose-free reconstruction from unposed image collections, integrating stylization or appearance control into such pipelines remains underexplored. Existing attempts largely rely on image-based conditioning, which limits both controllability and flexibility. In this work, we introduce AnyStyle, a feed-forward 3D reconstruction and stylization framework that enables pose-free, zero-shot stylization through multimodal conditioning. Our method supports both textual and visual style inputs, allowing users to control the scene appearance using natural language descriptions or reference images. We propose a modular stylization architecture that requires only minimal architectural modifications and can be integrated into existing feed-forward 3D reconstruction backbones. Experiments demonstrate that AnyStyle improves style controllability over prior feed-forward stylization methods while preserving high-quality geometric reconstruction. A user study further confirms that AnyStyle achieves superior stylization quality compared to an existing state-of-the-art approach. Repository: https://github.com/joaxkal/AnyStyle.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HW/SW co-design methodology using HLS for parameterized CNN accelerators on FPGAs to optimize multiple constraints (latency, power, area, cost) rather than just maximizing GOPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FPGA-based CNN accelerators focus primarily on maximizing performance (GOPS), but real embedded DL applications have multiple constraints including latency, power consumption, area, and cost that need to be balanced.

Method: Hardware-software co-design methodology using high-level synthesis (HLS) tools to create parameterized CNN accelerator designs, enabling easier optimization across multiple design constraints through design parameterization.

Result: The proposed methodology outperforms non-parameterized design approaches and can be easily extended to other types of deep learning applications.

Conclusion: HLS-based parameterized HW/SW co-design provides an effective approach for optimizing FPGA-based CNN accelerators across multiple real-world constraints beyond just performance metrics.

Abstract: Convolutional neural network (CNN) accelerators implemented on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are typically designed with a primary focus on maximizing performance, often measured in giga-operations per second (GOPS). However, real-life embedded deep learning (DL) applications impose multiple constraints related to latency, power consumption, area, and cost. This work presents a hardware-software (HW/SW) co-design methodology in which a CNN accelerator is described using high-level synthesis (HLS) tools that ease the parameterization of the design, facilitating more effective optimizations across multiple design constraints. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed design methodology is able to outperform non-parameterized design approaches, and it can be easily extended to other types of DL applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes unsupervised framework using tissue masks and deformation metrics for fast, reliable registration quality assessment of histopathological whole slide images without ground truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity registration of histopathological WSIs is crucial for integrated molecular analysis but challenging to evaluate without ground-truth annotations. Existing WSI-level assessments are time-consuming, unreliable, and computationally intensive, limiting large-scale applicability.

Method: Unsupervised framework that jointly employs down-sampled tissue masks-based metrics (measuring global structural correspondence) and deformations-based metrics (evaluating local smoothness, continuity, and transformation realism) for registration quality assessment of registered H&E and IHC WSI pairs.

Result: Validation across multiple IHC markers and multi-expert assessments demonstrates strong correlation between automated metrics and human evaluations.

Conclusion: The framework offers reliable, real-time registration quality assessment with high fidelity and minimal computational resources, making it suitable for large-scale quality control in digital pathology when ground truth is unavailable.

Abstract: High-fidelity registration of histopathological whole slide images (WSIs), such as hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemistry (IHC), is vital for integrated molecular analysis but challenging to evaluate without ground-truth (GT) annotations. Existing WSI-level assessments -- using annotated landmarks or intensity-based similarity metrics -- are often time-consuming, unreliable, and computationally intensive, limiting large-scale applicability. This study proposes a fast, unsupervised framework that jointly employs down-sampled tissue masks- and deformations-based metrics for registration quality assessment (RQA) of registered H&E and IHC WSI pairs. The masks-based metrics measure global structural correspondence, while the deformations-based metrics evaluate local smoothness, continuity, and transformation realism. Validation across multiple IHC markers and multi-expert assessments demonstrate a strong correlation between automated metrics and human evaluations. In the absence of GT, this framework offers reliable, real-time RQA with high fidelity and minimal computational resources, making it suitable for large-scale quality control in digital pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lightweight automated framework for detecting and restoring artifacts in AFM images using classification, segmentation, and geometry-aware inpainting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AFM images suffer from artifacts due to environmental noise, scanning imperfections, and tip-sample interactions, degrading image quality and hindering accurate nanoscale analysis.

Method: Pipeline includes: 1) classification model to detect artifacts, 2) lightweight semantic segmentation network for precise artifact masking, 3) adaptive mask expansion based on structural orientation, 4) directional neighbor-based inpainting for 3D continuity, and 5) localized Gaussian smoothing. Integrated into user-friendly GUI with real-time parameter adjustment.

Result: Experimental results show effective artifact removal while preserving nanoscale structural details, enabling robust AFM data interpretation.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust, geometry-aware solution for high-fidelity AFM data analysis through automated artifact detection and restoration.

Abstract: Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) enables high-resolution surface imaging at the nanoscale, yet the output is often degraded by artifacts introduced by environmental noise, scanning imperfections, and tip-sample interactions. To address this challenge, a lightweight and fully automated framework for artifact detection and restoration in AFM image analysis is presented. The pipeline begins with a classification model that determines whether an AFM image contains artifacts. If necessary, a lightweight semantic segmentation network, custom-designed and trained on AFM data, is applied to generate precise artifact masks. These masks are adaptively expanded based on their structural orientation and then inpainted using a directional neighbor-based interpolation strategy to preserve 3D surface continuity. A localized Gaussian smoothing operation is then applied for seamless restoration. The system is integrated into a user-friendly GUI that supports real-time parameter adjustments and batch processing. Experimental results demonstrate the effective artifact removal while preserving nanoscale structural details, providing a robust, geometry-aware solution for high-fidelity AFM data interpretation.

TL;DR: SeeingThroughClutter reconstructs structured 3D from single images by iteratively removing and modeling objects using VLMs, improving performance in cluttered scenes without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods rely on intermediate tasks like semantic segmentation and depth estimation that underperform in complex, occluded scenes. There's a need for better 3D reconstruction in cluttered environments.

Method: Iterative object removal and reconstruction pipeline using VLMs as orchestrators. Objects are detected, segmented, removed, and 3D fitted one at a time, with removal enabling cleaner segmentations of subsequent objects.

Result: State-of-the-art robustness on 3D-Front and ADE20K datasets. The method shows improved performance in highly occluded scenes without requiring task-specific training.

Conclusion: The iterative object removal approach effectively handles cluttered scenes, benefits from foundation model advances, and demonstrates superior 3D reconstruction in complex environments.

Abstract: We present SeeingThroughClutter, a method for reconstructing structured 3D representations from single images by segmenting and modeling objects individually. Prior approaches rely on intermediate tasks such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation, which often underperform in complex scenes, particularly in the presence of occlusion and clutter. We address this by introducing an iterative object removal and reconstruction pipeline that decomposes complex scenes into a sequence of simpler subtasks. Using VLMs as orchestrators, foreground objects are removed one at a time via detection, segmentation, object removal, and 3D fitting. We show that removing objects allows for cleaner segmentations of subsequent objects, even in highly occluded scenes. Our method requires no task-specific training and benefits directly from ongoing advances in foundation models. We demonstrate stateof-the-art robustness on 3D-Front and ADE20K datasets.

TL;DR: HPA10M dataset with 10.5M IHC images enables iSight AI model for automated immunohistochemistry assessment, outperforming foundation models and pathologists in multi-task evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI models for H&E-stained slides show promise but have limited applicability to IHC due to domain-specific variations, creating a need for specialized IHC AI systems.

Method: Created HPA10M dataset with 10.5M IHC images from Human Protein Atlas, then trained iSight multi-task learning framework combining visual features with tissue metadata via token-level attention to predict staining intensity, location, quantity, tissue type, and malignancy.

Result: iSight achieved 85.5% accuracy for location, 76.6% for intensity, and 75.7% for quantity, outperforming foundation models by 2.5-10.2%. In user studies, iSight outperformed initial pathologist assessments and improved inter-pathologist agreement (Cohen's κ increased from 0.63 to 0.70).

Conclusion: This work establishes foundation for AI systems to improve IHC diagnostic accuracy and demonstrates potential for integrating iSight into clinical workflows to enhance consistency and reliability of IHC assessment through expert-AI co-assessment.

Abstract: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides information on protein expression in tissue sections and is commonly used to support pathology diagnosis and disease triage. While AI models for H\&E-stained slides show promise, their applicability to IHC is limited due to domain-specific variations. Here we introduce HPA10M, a dataset that contains 10,495,672 IHC images from the Human Protein Atlas with comprehensive metadata included, and encompasses 45 normal tissue types and 20 major cancer types. Based on HPA10M, we trained iSight, a multi-task learning framework for automated IHC staining assessment. iSight combines visual features from whole-slide images with tissue metadata through a token-level attention mechanism, simultaneously predicting staining intensity, location, quantity, tissue type, and malignancy status. On held-out data, iSight achieved 85.5\% accuracy for location, 76.6\% for intensity, and 75.7\% for quantity, outperforming fine-tuned foundation models (PLIP, CONCH) by 2.5--10.2\%. In addition, iSight demonstrates well-calibrated predictions with expected calibration errors of 0.0150-0.0408. Furthermore, in a user study with eight pathologists evaluating 200 images from two datasets, iSight outperformed initial pathologist assessments on the held-out HPA dataset (79\% vs 68\% for location, 70\% vs 57\% for intensity, 68\% vs 52\% for quantity). Inter-pathologist agreement also improved after AI assistance in both held-out HPA (Cohen's $κ$ increased from 0.63 to 0.70) and Stanford TMAD datasets (from 0.74 to 0.76), suggesting expert--AI co-assessment can improve IHC interpretation. This work establishes a foundation for AI systems that can improve IHC diagnostic accuracy and highlights the potential for integrating iSight into clinical workflows to enhance the consistency and reliability of IHC assessment.

TL;DR: VideoBrain: An end-to-end framework enabling VLMs to adaptively sample frames from long videos using dual complementary agents (semantic retrieval + dense sampling), achieving better performance with 30-40% fewer frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-form video understanding is challenging due to computational constraints vs. need to capture information across thousands of frames. Existing approaches either sample uniformly (risking information loss) or select keyframes in single pass (no recovery from poor choices).

Method: Proposes VideoBrain with dual complementary agents: CLIP-based agent for semantic retrieval across video and Uniform agent for dense temporal sampling within intervals. VLM directly perceives frames and reasons about information sufficiency. Introduces behavior-aware reward function with data classification pipeline to prevent indiscriminate agent invocation.

Result: Achieves +3.5% to +9.0% improvement over baseline on four long video benchmarks while using 30-40% fewer frames. Shows strong cross-dataset generalization to short video benchmarks.

Conclusion: VideoBrain enables efficient long-form video understanding through adaptive visual information acquisition, outperforming existing approaches with significantly reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Long-form video understanding remains challenging for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) due to the inherent tension between computational constraints and the need to capture information distributed across thousands of frames. Existing approaches either sample frames uniformly (risking information loss) or select keyframes in a single pass (with no recovery from poor choices). We propose VideoBrain, an end-to-end framework that enables VLMs to adaptively acquire visual information through learned sampling policies. Our approach features dual complementary agents: a CLIP-based agent for semantic retrieval across the video and a Uniform agent for dense temporal sampling within intervals. Unlike prior agent-based methods that rely on text-only LLMs orchestrating visual tools, our VLM directly perceives frames and reasons about information sufficiency. To prevent models from invoking agents indiscriminately to maximize rewards, we introduce a behavior-aware reward function coupled with a data classification pipeline that teaches the model when agent invocation is genuinely beneficial. Experiments on four long video benchmarks demonstrate that VideoBrain achieves +3.5% to +9.0% improvement over the baseline while using 30-40% fewer frames, with strong cross-dataset generalization to short video benchmarks.

Method: Proposes DMS2F-HAD, a dual-branch Mamba-based model that uses Mamba's linear-time modeling to efficiently learn distinct spatial and spectral features in specialized branches, integrated via a dynamic gated fusion mechanism for enhanced anomaly localization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art average AUC of 98.78% across fourteen benchmark HSI datasets, with inference speed 4.6 times faster than comparable deep learning methods.

Conclusion: DMS2F-HAD demonstrates strong generalization, scalability, and superior efficiency, positioning it as a strong candidate for practical hyperspectral anomaly detection applications.

Abstract: Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) aims to identify rare and irregular targets in high-dimensional hyperspectral images (HSIs), which are often noisy and unlabelled data. Existing deep learning methods either fail to capture long-range spectral dependencies (e.g., convolutional neural networks) or suffer from high computational cost (e.g., Transformers). To address these challenges, we propose DMS2F-HAD, a novel dual-branch Mamba-based model. Our architecture utilizes Mamba's linear-time modeling to efficiently learn distinct spatial and spectral features in specialized branches, which are then integrated by a dynamic gated fusion mechanism to enhance anomaly localization. Across fourteen benchmark HSI datasets, our proposed DMS2F-HAD not only achieves a state-of-the-art average AUC of 98.78%, but also demonstrates superior efficiency with an inference speed 4.6 times faster than comparable deep learning methods.

TL;DR: SuperPoint-E improves SfM in endoscopy videos through enhanced feature extraction with Tracking Adaptation supervision, resulting in denser 3D reconstructions and longer video coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving Structure-from-Motion (SfM) performance in endoscopy videos by boosting feature extraction quality, as current methods struggle with feature detection and description in endoscopic environments.

Method: Proposes SuperPoint-E, a local feature extraction method using Tracking Adaptation supervision strategy to enhance feature detection and description specifically for endoscopy.

Result: SuperPoint-E produces denser 3D reconstructions covering more and longer video segments, with features that are more densely detected, have higher precision, and more discriminative descriptors that reduce need for guided matching.

Conclusion: The approach significantly outperforms original SuperPoint and COLMAP pipeline for SfM on endoscopy videos, demonstrating substantial improvements in 3D reconstruction quality.

Abstract: In this work, we focus on boosting the feature extraction to improve the performance of Structure-from-Motion (SfM) in endoscopy videos. We present SuperPoint-E, a new local feature extraction method that, using our proposed Tracking Adaptation supervision strategy, significantly improves the quality of feature detection and description in endoscopy. Extensive experimentation on real endoscopy recordings studies our approach's most suitable configuration and evaluates SuperPoint-E feature quality. The comparison with other baselines also shows that our 3D reconstructions are denser and cover more and longer video segments because our detector fires more densely and our features are more likely to survive (i.e. higher detection precision). In addition, our descriptor is more discriminative, making the guided matching step almost redundant. The presented approach brings significant improvements in the 3D reconstructions obtained, via SfM on endoscopy videos, compared to the original SuperPoint and the gold standard SfM COLMAP pipeline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs need to analyze complex documents like flowcharts, but creating large-scale datasets of flowchart images with corresponding text is time-consuming, creating a bottleneck for developing precise flowchart understanding capabilities.

Method: Generated a synthetic visual QA dataset using LLMs, comprising task descriptions for business occupations, flowchart images rendered from domain-specific language code, and related QA pairs.

Result: Fine-tuning with JSynFlow significantly improves VLM performance on flowchart-based QA tasks.

Conclusion: JSynFlow provides an effective synthetic dataset solution for training VLMs on Japanese flowchart understanding, addressing the data scarcity problem in this domain.

Abstract: Vision and language models (VLMs) are expected to analyse complex documents, such as those containing flowcharts, through a question-answering (QA) interface. The ability to recognise and interpret these flowcharts is in high demand, as they provide valuable insights unavailable in text-only explanations. However, developing VLMs with precise flowchart understanding requires large-scale datasets of flowchart images and corresponding text, the creation of which is highly time-consuming. To address this challenge, we introduce JSynFlow, a synthesised visual QA dataset for Japanese flowcharts, generated using large language models (LLMs). Our dataset comprises task descriptions for various business occupations, the corresponding flowchart images rendered from domain-specific language (DSL) code, and related QA pairs. This paper details the dataset's synthesis procedure and demonstrates that fine-tuning with JSynFlow significantly improves VLM performance on flowchart-based QA tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current segmentation benchmarks focus on single imaging modalities, hiding deployment-relevant performance variations where optimal architectures differ across modalities. Materials researchers lack tools to select appropriate architectures for their specific imaging setups or assess model trustworthiness on new samples.

Method: Developed a cross-modal evaluation framework for materials image segmentation across SEM, AFM, XCT, and optical microscopy. Evaluated six encoder-decoder combinations across seven datasets to systematically compare architecture performance across different imaging contexts.

Result: Optimal segmentation architectures vary systematically by imaging context: UNet performs best for high-contrast 2D imaging, while DeepLabv3+ is preferred for the most challenging cases. The framework also provides deployment feedback through out-of-distribution detection and counterfactual explanations.

Conclusion: The framework addresses a practical gap in materials characterization by providing architecture selection guidance, reliability signals, and interpretability tools that help researchers choose appropriate models for their specific imaging setups and assess when models can be trusted on new samples.

Abstract: Segmentation architectures are typically benchmarked on single imaging modalities, obscuring deployment-relevant performance variations: an architecture optimal for one modality may underperform on another. We present a cross-modal evaluation framework for materials image segmentation spanning SEM, AFM, XCT, and optical microscopy. Our evaluation of six encoder-decoder combinations across seven datasets reveals that optimal architectures vary systematically by context: UNet excels for high-contrast 2D imaging while DeepLabv3+ is preferred for the hardest cases. The framework also provides deployment feedback via out-of-distribution detection and counterfactual explanations that reveal which microstructural features drive predictions. Together, the architecture guidance, reliability signals, and interpretability tools address a practical gap in materials characterization, where researchers lack tools to select architectures for their specific imaging setup or assess when models can be trusted on new samples.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ISCS is a plug-and-play method that improves 3D medical imaging reconstruction from 2D diffusion models by controlling inter-slice stochastic noise consistency during sampling, eliminating slice discontinuities without extra computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D medical imaging reconstruction using 2D diffusion models suffers from severe inter-slice discontinuities due to the intrinsic randomness of diffusion sampling, while existing regularization methods introduce sensitive hyperparameters and can cause over-smoothing.

Method: Inter-Slice Consistent Stochasticity (ISCS) controls the consistency of stochastic noise components during diffusion sampling to align sampling trajectories across slices, without adding new loss terms or optimization steps. It's a plug-and-play approach that works with any 2D-trained diffusion-based 3D reconstruction pipeline.

Result: Experiments on several medical imaging problems show that ISCS effectively improves 3D imaging performance based on 2D diffusion models, demonstrating that controlling inter-slice stochasticity is a principled approach for high-fidelity 3D medical imaging.

Conclusion: ISCS provides a simple yet effective solution to the inter-slice discontinuity problem in 3D medical imaging reconstruction using 2D diffusion models, offering a plug-and-play approach that enhances performance without additional computational cost.

Abstract: 3D medical imaging is in high demand and essential for clinical diagnosis and scientific research. Currently, diffusion models (DMs) have become an effective tool for medical imaging reconstruction thanks to their ability to learn rich, high-quality data priors. However, learning the 3D data distribution with DMs in medical imaging is challenging, not only due to the difficulties in data collection but also because of the significant computational burden during model training. A common compromise is to train the DMs on 2D data priors and reconstruct stacked 2D slices to address 3D medical inverse problems. However, the intrinsic randomness of diffusion sampling causes severe inter-slice discontinuities of reconstructed 3D volumes. Existing methods often enforce continuity regularizations along the z-axis, which introduces sensitive hyper-parameters and may lead to over-smoothing results. In this work, we revisit the origin of stochasticity in diffusion sampling and introduce Inter-Slice Consistent Stochasticity (ISCS), a simple yet effective strategy that encourages interslice consistency during diffusion sampling. Our key idea is to control the consistency of stochastic noise components during diffusion sampling, thereby aligning their sampling trajectories without adding any new loss terms or optimization steps. Importantly, the proposed ISCS is plug-and-play and can be dropped into any 2D trained diffusion based 3D reconstruction pipeline without additional computational cost. Experiments on several medical imaging problems show that our method can effectively improve the performance of medical 3D imaging problems based on 2D diffusion models. Our findings suggest that controlling inter-slice stochasticity is a principled and practically attractive route toward high-fidelity 3D medical imaging with 2D diffusion priors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Point2Insert is a sparse-point-based framework for flexible object insertion in videos that uses only a few points instead of dense masks, enabling precise spatial control with minimal user effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing object insertion methods have limitations: mask-based approaches require labor-intensive mask annotations, while instruction-based methods struggle with precise location placement. There's a need for accurate, low-effort object placement in videos.

Method: Two-stage training: Stage 1 trains an insertion model using sparse-point prompts or binary masks; Stage 2 adapts to video insertion using paired videos from an object removal model. Uses mask-guided insertion as teacher for knowledge distillation into point-guided model.

Result: Point2Insert consistently outperforms strong baselines and even surpasses models with 10x more parameters, demonstrating superior performance in video object insertion tasks.

Conclusion: Point2Insert provides a flexible, user-friendly solution for video object insertion that eliminates tedious mask drawing while maintaining precise spatial control through sparse point annotations.

Abstract: This paper introduces Point2Insert, a sparse-point-based framework for flexible and user-friendly object insertion in videos, motivated by the growing popularity of accurate, low-effort object placement. Existing approaches face two major challenges: mask-based insertion methods require labor-intensive mask annotations, while instruction-based methods struggle to place objects at precise locations. Point2Insert addresses these issues by requiring only a small number of sparse points instead of dense masks, eliminating the need for tedious mask drawing. Specifically, it supports both positive and negative points to indicate regions that are suitable or unsuitable for insertion, enabling fine-grained spatial control over object locations. The training of Point2Insert consists of two stages. In Stage 1, we train an insertion model that generates objects in given regions conditioned on either sparse-point prompts or a binary mask. In Stage 2, we further train the model on paired videos synthesized by an object removal model, adapting it to video insertion. Moreover, motivated by the higher insertion success rate of mask-guided editing, we leverage a mask-guided insertion model as a teacher to distill reliable insertion behavior into the point-guided model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Point2Insert consistently outperforms strong baselines and even surpasses models with $\times$10 more parameters.

*Yi-Kuan Hsieh,Jun-Wei Hsieh,Xin li,Ming-Ching Chang,Yu-Chee Tseng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISMamba introduces a rotation-robust scan order for Vision SSMs using concentric rings and partial channel filtering, achieving better accuracy, efficiency, and rotation invariance than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision SSMs serialize 2D images into 1D sequences using fixed scan orders, which critically affects performance by breaking spatial adjacency and object continuity, especially under geometric transformations like rotation.

Method: PRISMamba partitions images into concentric rings, performs order-agnostic aggregation within each ring, propagates context across rings via short radial SSMs, and uses partial channel filtering to route only informative channels through the recurrent pathway.

Result: Achieves 84.5% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with 3.9G FLOPs and 3,054 img/s on A100, outperforming VMamba in accuracy and throughput while maintaining performance under rotation (vs. 1-2% drops for fixed scans).

Conclusion: Scan-order design combined with channel filtering is crucial for accuracy, efficiency, and rotation robustness in Vision SSMs, representing an underexplored but important factor in vision model architecture.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to attention for vision tasks, offering lineartime sequence processing with competitive accuracy. Vision SSMs, however, require serializing 2D images into 1D token sequences along a predefined scan order, a factor often overlooked. We show that scan order critically affects performance by altering spatial adjacency, fracturing object continuity, and amplifying degradation under geometric transformations such as rotation. We present Partial RIng Scan Mamba (PRISMamba), a rotation-robust traversal that partitions an image into concentric rings, performs order-agnostic aggregation within each ring, and propagates context across rings through a set of short radial SSMs. Efficiency is further improved via partial channel filtering, which routes only the most informative channels through the recurrent ring pathway while keeping the rest on a lightweight residual branch. On ImageNet-1K, PRISMamba achieves 84.5% Top-1 with 3.9G FLOPs and 3,054 img/s on A100, outperforming VMamba in both accuracy and throughput while requiring fewer FLOPs. It also maintains performance under rotation, whereas fixed-path scans drop by 1~2%. These results highlight scan-order design, together with channel filtering, as a crucial, underexplored factor for accuracy, efficiency, and rotation robustness in Vision SSMs. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoloEv-Net: Efficient event-based action recognition using compact holographic spatiotemporal representation and global spectral gating to reduce redundancy and improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing event-based action recognition methods suffer from computational redundancy in dense voxel representations, structural redundancy in multi-branch architectures, and under-utilization of spectral information for capturing global motion patterns.

Method: Proposes HoloEv-Net with: (1) Compact Holographic Spatiotemporal Representation (CHSR) that embeds spatial cues into Time-Height view to preserve 3D contexts in 2D representation, (2) Global Spectral Gating (GSG) module using FFT for global token mixing in frequency domain with minimal parameters.

Result: HoloEv-Net-Base achieves SOTA on THU-EACT-50-CHL (+10.29%), HARDVS (+1.71%), and DailyDVS-200 (+6.25%). HoloEv-Net-Small reduces parameters by 5.4×, FLOPs by 300×, and latency by 2.4× while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: HoloEv-Net addresses key redundancies in EAR methods through compact representation and spectral processing, achieving superior performance and extreme efficiency suitable for edge deployment.

Abstract: Event-based Action Recognition (EAR) has attracted significant attention due to the high temporal resolution and high dynamic range of event cameras. However, existing methods typically suffer from (i) the computational redundancy of dense voxel representations, (ii) structural redundancy inherent in multi-branch architectures, and (iii) the under-utilization of spectral information in capturing global motion patterns. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient EAR framework named HoloEv-Net. First, to simultaneously tackle representation and structural redundancies, we introduce a Compact Holographic Spatiotemporal Representation (CHSR). Departing from computationally expensive voxel grids, CHSR implicitly embeds horizontal spatial cues into the Time-Height (T-H) view, effectively preserving 3D spatiotemporal contexts within a 2D representation. Second, to exploit the neglected spectral cues, we design a Global Spectral Gating (GSG) module. By leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for global token mixing in the frequency domain, GSG enhances the representation capability with negligible parameter overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our framework. Specifically, HoloEv-Net-Base achieves state-of-the-art performance on THU-EACT-50-CHL, HARDVS and DailyDVS-200, outperforming existing methods by 10.29%, 1.71% and 6.25%, respectively. Furthermore, our lightweight variant, HoloEv-Net-Small, delivers highly competitive accuracy while offering extreme efficiency, reducing parameters by 5.4 times, FLOPs by 300times, and latency by 2.4times compared to heavy baselines, demonstrating its potential for edge deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenEMMA framework adapted for instruction-grounded driving using doScenes dataset, showing instruction conditioning reduces ADE by 98.7% and improves trajectory alignment by up to 5.1% with well-phrased prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior instruction-following planners rely on simulation or fixed command vocabularies, limiting real-world generalization. The doScenes dataset provides real-world free-form instructions linked to ground-truth motion, enabling instruction-conditioned planning.

Method: Adapt OpenEMMA (open-source MLLM-based end-to-end driving framework) to ingest front-camera views, ego-state, and passenger-style prompts from doScenes, outputting 10-step speed-curvature trajectories with linguistic conditioning before generation.

Result: Instruction conditioning substantially improves robustness, preventing extreme baseline failures (98.7% reduction in mean ADE). Even without outliers, well-phrased prompts improve ADE by up to 5.1%. Analysis reveals what makes effective instructions for the framework.

Conclusion: Instruction-grounded driving with free-form prompts significantly enhances planning performance. The work establishes reproducible baseline for instruction-aware planning and releases evaluation prompts/scripts to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Instruction-grounded driving, where passenger language guides trajectory planning, requires vehicles to understand intent before motion. However, most prior instruction-following planners rely on simulation or fixed command vocabularies, limiting real-world generalization. doScenes, the first real-world dataset linking free-form instructions (with referentiality) to nuScenes ground-truth motion, enables instruction-conditioned planning. In this work, we adapt OpenEMMA, an open-source MLLM-based end-to-end driving framework that ingests front-camera views and ego-state and outputs 10-step speed-curvature trajectories, to this setting, presenting a reproducible instruction-conditioned baseline on doScenes and investigate the effects of human instruction prompts on predicted driving behavior. We integrate doScenes directives as passenger-style prompts within OpenEMMA's vision-language interface, enabling linguistic conditioning before trajectory generation. Evaluated on 849 annotated scenes using ADE, we observe that instruction conditioning substantially improves robustness by preventing extreme baseline failures, yielding a 98.7% reduction in mean ADE. When such outliers are removed, instructions still influence trajectory alignment, with well-phrased prompts improving ADE by up to 5.1%. We use this analysis to discuss what makes a "good" instruction for the OpenEMMA framework. We release the evaluation prompts and scripts to establish a reproducible baseline for instruction-aware planning. GitHub: https://github.com/Mi3-Lab/doScenes-VLM-Planning

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiMo is a unified diffusion-style framework for bidirectional text-motion understanding and generation using iterative masked token refinement, supporting T2M, M2T, and M2M tasks in a single model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior masked modeling motion generation methods focus only on text-to-motion, lacking bidirectional understanding and generation capabilities between text and motion.

Method: Discrete diffusion framework with iterative masked token refinement, residual vector quantization (RVQ) for motion token fidelity, and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for alignment and controllability.

Result: Strong motion quality and competitive bidirectional understanding on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets, with additional capabilities in motion completion, prediction, and caption correction.

Conclusion: DiMo successfully extends masked modeling to bidirectional text-motion tasks within a unified framework, enabling quality-latency trade-offs and diverse applications without architectural changes.

Abstract: Prior masked modeling motion generation methods predominantly study text-to-motion. We present DiMo, a discrete diffusion-style framework, which extends masked modeling to bidirectional text--motion understanding and generation. Unlike GPT-style autoregressive approaches that tokenize motion and decode sequentially, DiMo performs iterative masked token refinement, unifying Text-to-Motion (T2M), Motion-to-Text (M2T), and text-free Motion-to-Motion (M2M) within a single model. This decoding paradigm naturally enables a quality-latency trade-off at inference via the number of refinement steps.We further improve motion token fidelity with residual vector quantization (RVQ) and enhance alignment and controllability with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML show strong motion quality and competitive bidirectional understanding under a unified framework. In addition, we demonstrate model ability in text-free motion completion, text-guided motion prediction and motion caption correction without architectural change.Additional qualitative results are available on our project page: https://animotionlab.github.io/DiMo/.

*Hyeonjae Kim,Dongjin Kim,Eugene Jin,Tae Hyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel framework synthesizes realistic low-resolution images from single high-resolution images using flow matching in latent degradation space, enabling creation of large-scale real-world SR training datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning SR methods perform well on synthetic degradations (like bicubic downsampling) but struggle with real-world images containing complex nonlinear degradations (noise, blur, compression artifacts). Existing approaches require painstaking collection of real LR-HR pairs limited to specific downscaling factors.

Method: Leverages latent degradation space with flow matching to synthesize authentic LR images from a single HR image. The approach generates LR images with realistic artifacts at unseen degradation levels, facilitating creation of large-scale real-world SR training datasets.

Result: Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative assessments verify that synthetic LR images accurately replicate real-world degradations. Both traditional and arbitrary-scale SR models trained using these datasets consistently yield much better HR outcomes.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the challenge of real-world SR by enabling scalable generation of realistic training data, overcoming limitations of existing approaches that rely on limited real LR-HR pairs.

Abstract: While deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods have shown impressive outcomes with synthetic degradation scenarios such as bicubic downsampling, they frequently struggle to perform well on real-world images that feature complex, nonlinear degradations like noise, blur, and compression artifacts. Recent efforts to address this issue have involved the painstaking compilation of real low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) image pairs, usually limited to several specific downscaling factors. To address these challenges, our work introduces a novel framework capable of synthesizing authentic LR images from a single HR image by leveraging the latent degradation space with flow matching. Our approach generates LR images with realistic artifacts at unseen degradation levels, which facilitates the creation of large-scale, real-world SR training datasets. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative assessments verify that our synthetic LR images accurately replicate real-world degradations. Furthermore, both traditional and arbitrary-scale SR models trained using our datasets consistently yield much better HR outcomes.

*Feng Wang,Yichun Shi,Ceyuan Yang,Qiushan Guo,Jingxiang Sun,Alan Yuille,Peng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VTok is a unified video tokenization framework that decouples spatial and temporal representations using key frames and residual tokens, achieving more efficient and expressive video encoding for both generation and understanding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language systems use naive frame-sampling strategies for video tokenization, which is inefficient and doesn't optimally capture temporal information. There's a need for a more compact yet expressive video representation that works for both generation and understanding tasks.

Method: VTok decouples spatial and temporal representations by retaining spatial features from a single key frame while encoding each subsequent frame into a single residual token. This reduces video representation complexity from the product of frame count and per-frame token count to their sum.

Result: VTok achieves 3.4% higher accuracy on TV-Align benchmark and 1.9% higher VBench score compared to naive tokenization baselines. It produces more coherent motion and stronger guidance following in text-to-video generation with shorter token sequences per video.

Conclusion: VTok provides an efficient and effective unified video tokenization framework that outperforms existing methods on both understanding and generation tasks, offering a standardized paradigm for future video research.

Abstract: This work presents VTok, a unified video tokenization framework that can be used for both generation and understanding tasks. Unlike the leading vision-language systems that tokenize videos through a naive frame-sampling strategy, we propose to decouple the spatial and temporal representations of videos by retaining the spatial features of a single key frame while encoding each subsequent frame into a single residual token, achieving compact yet expressive video tokenization. Our experiments suggest that VTok effectively reduces the complexity of video representation from the product of frame count and per-frame token count to their sum, while the residual tokens sufficiently capture viewpoint and motion changes relative to the key frame. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of VTok: it achieves notably higher performance on a range of video understanding and text-to-video generation benchmarks compared with baselines using naive tokenization, all with shorter token sequences per video (e.g., 3.4% higher accuracy on our TV-Align benchmark and 1.9% higher VBench score). Remarkably, VTok produces more coherent motion and stronger guidance following in text-to-video generation, owing to its more consistent temporal encoding. We hope VTok can serve as a standardized video tokenization paradigm for future research in video understanding and generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing trajectory forecasting approaches suffer from prior misalignment where learned or fixed priors fail to capture the full distribution of plausible futures, limiting both prediction accuracy and diversity. The authors theoretically establish that prediction error is lower-bounded by prior quality, making prior modeling a key performance bottleneck.

Method: AGMA (Adaptive Gaussian Mixture Anchors) constructs expressive priors through two stages: (1) extracting diverse behavioral patterns from training data, and (2) distilling them into a scene-adaptive global prior for inference.

Result: Extensive experiments on ETH-UCY, Stanford Drone, and JRDB datasets demonstrate that AGMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, confirming the critical role of high-quality priors in trajectory forecasting.

Conclusion: The paper establishes that prior quality is a fundamental bottleneck in trajectory forecasting and demonstrates that AGMA's adaptive prior construction approach effectively addresses this limitation, leading to improved prediction accuracy and diversity.

Abstract: Human trajectory forecasting requires capturing the multimodal nature of pedestrian behavior. However, existing approaches suffer from prior misalignment. Their learned or fixed priors often fail to capture the full distribution of plausible futures, limiting both prediction accuracy and diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While sparse 3D representations solve encoding bottlenecks in autonomous vehicle perception, they create new challenges for decoders: how to efficiently aggregate information from sparse, non-uniform voxel features without computationally prohibitive dense attention.

Method: Proposes a Prototype-based Sparse Transformer Decoder with two-stage process: 1) sparse prototype selection where each query adaptively identifies compact sets of salient voxel features, and 2) complementary denoising paradigm using ground-truth masks to ensure stable query-prototype association across decoder layers.

Result: SPOT-Occ outperforms previous methods with significant margin in speed while also improving accuracy for 3D occupancy prediction from cameras.

Conclusion: The proposed prototype-guided attention mechanism with denoising provides an efficient solution for sparse 3D feature aggregation, enabling real-time and accurate 3D occupancy prediction crucial for autonomous vehicle deployment.

Abstract: Achieving highly accurate and real-time 3D occupancy prediction from cameras is a critical requirement for the safe and practical deployment of autonomous vehicles. While this shift to sparse 3D representations solves the encoding bottleneck, it creates a new challenge for the decoder: how to efficiently aggregate information from a sparse, non-uniformly distributed set of voxel features without resorting to computationally prohibitive dense attention.
  In this paper, we propose a novel Prototype-based Sparse Transformer Decoder that replaces this costly interaction with an efficient, two-stage process of guided feature selection and focused aggregation. Our core idea is to make the decoder's attention prototype-guided. We achieve this through a sparse prototype selection mechanism, where each query adaptively identifies a compact set of the most salient voxel features, termed prototypes, for focused feature aggregation.
  To ensure this dynamic selection is stable and effective, we introduce a complementary denoising paradigm. This approach leverages ground-truth masks to provide explicit guidance, guaranteeing a consistent query-prototype association across decoder layers. Our model, dubbed SPOT-Occ, outperforms previous methods with a significant margin in speed while also improving accuracy. Source code is released at https://github.com/chensuzeyu/SpotOcc.

TL;DR: One-DVA is a transformer-based video autoencoder with adaptive 1D encoding and diffusion-based decoding that addresses limitations of existing video autoencoders through variable-length compression and improved reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video autoencoders have three major limitations: (1) fixed-rate compression wastes tokens on simple videos, (2) inflexible CNN architectures prevent variable-length latent modeling, and (3) deterministic decoders struggle to recover appropriate details from compressed latents.

Method: Proposes One-Dimensional Diffusion Video Autoencoder (One-DVA) with transformer-based framework: encoder uses query-based vision transformers with variable-length dropout for adaptive 1D encoding, decoder uses pixel-space diffusion transformer for reconstruction. Two-stage training strategy with latent distribution regularization for generative modeling.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to 3D-CNN VAEs on reconstruction metrics at identical compression ratios, supports adaptive compression for higher compression ratios, and enables better downstream latent generation through regularization and decoder fine-tuning.

Conclusion: One-DVA addresses key limitations of existing video autoencoders by providing adaptive compression, flexible architecture, and improved reconstruction through diffusion-based decoding, making it suitable for downstream generative modeling tasks.

Abstract: Recent video generation models largely rely on video autoencoders that compress pixel-space videos into latent representations. However, existing video autoencoders suffer from three major limitations: (1) fixed-rate compression that wastes tokens on simple videos, (2) inflexible CNN architectures that prevent variable-length latent modeling, and (3) deterministic decoders that struggle to recover appropriate details from compressed latents. To address these issues, we propose One-Dimensional Diffusion Video Autoencoder (One-DVA), a transformer-based framework for adaptive 1D encoding and diffusion-based decoding. The encoder employs query-based vision transformers to extract spatiotemporal features and produce latent representations, while a variable-length dropout mechanism dynamically adjusts the latent length. The decoder is a pixel-space diffusion transformer that reconstructs videos with the latents as input conditions. With a two-stage training strategy, One-DVA achieves performance comparable to 3D-CNN VAEs on reconstruction metrics at identical compression ratios. More importantly, it supports adaptive compression and thus can achieve higher compression ratios. To better support downstream latent generation, we further regularize the One-DVA latent distribution for generative modeling and fine-tune its decoder to mitigate artifacts caused by the generation process.

Conclusion: Demonstrates potential of leveraging foundation models like MUSt3R for scalable monocular 3D scene reconstruction in real-world settings with metric-space predictions.

Abstract: The recent paradigm shift in 3D vision led to the rise of foundation models with remarkable capabilities in 3D perception from uncalibrated images. However, extending these models to large-scale RGB stream 3D reconstruction remains challenging due to memory limitations. This work proposes S-MUSt3R, a simple and efficient pipeline that extends the limits of foundation models for monocular 3D reconstruction. Our approach addresses the scalability bottleneck of foundation models through a simple strategy of sequence segmentation followed by segment alignment and lightweight loop closure optimization. Without model retraining, we benefit from remarkable 3D reconstruction capacities of MUSt3R model and achieve trajectory and reconstruction performance comparable to traditional methods with more complex architecture. We evaluate S-MUSt3R on TUM, 7-Scenes and proprietary robot navigation datasets and show that S-MUSt3R runs successfully on long RGB sequences and produces accurate and consistent 3D reconstruction. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging the MUSt3R model for scalable monocular 3D scene in real-world settings, with an important advantage of making predictions directly in the metric space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard CNN/UNet approaches struggle with uncertainty in brain MRI segmentation due to partial volume effects and tissue ambiguity, limiting segmentation accuracy.

Method: Proposes IF-UNet that integrates intuitionistic fuzzy logic into UNet architecture, processing data through membership, nonmembership, and hesitation degrees to address tissue ambiguity and boundary uncertainties.

Result: Evaluation on IBSR dataset shows improved segmentation quality with better handling of uncertainty, measured by accuracy, Dice coefficient, and IoU metrics.

Conclusion: IF-UNet effectively improves brain image segmentation by better managing uncertainty from partial volume effects through intuitionistic fuzzy logic integration.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of MRI brain images is essential for image analysis, diagnosis of neuro-logical disorders and medical image computing. In the deep learning approach, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), especially UNet, are widely applied in medical image segmentation. However, it is difficult to deal with uncertainty due to the partial volume effect in brain images. To overcome this limitation, we propose an enhanced framework, named UNet with intuitionistic fuzzy logic (IF-UNet), which incorporates intuitionistic fuzzy logic into UNet. The model processes input data in terms of membership, nonmembership, and hesitation degrees, allowing it to better address tissue ambiguity resulting from partial volume effects and boundary uncertainties. The proposed architecture is evaluated on the Internet Brain Segmentation Repository (IBSR) dataset, and its performance is computed using accuracy, Dice coefficient, and intersection over union (IoU). Experimental results confirm that IF-UNet improves segmentation quality with handling uncertainty in brain images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AGILE: A robust framework for reconstructing dynamic hand-object interactions from monocular videos using agentic generation instead of traditional reconstruction, producing simulation-ready assets with high geometric accuracy and physical plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for reconstructing hand-object interactions from monocular videos face two major problems: (1) neural rendering often produces fragmented, non-simulation-ready geometries under heavy occlusion, and (2) reliance on brittle Structure-from-Motion initialization frequently fails on in-the-wild footage.

Method: AGILE shifts from reconstruction to agentic generation: (1) uses a Vision-Language Model to guide generative model synthesis of complete, watertight object meshes with high-fidelity texture; (2) bypasses SfM with robust anchor-and-track strategy - initializes object pose at interaction onset using foundation model and propagates temporally; (3) contact-aware optimization integrates semantic, geometric, and interaction stability constraints for physical plausibility.

Result: Extensive experiments on HO3D, DexYCB, and in-the-wild videos show AGILE outperforms baselines in global geometric accuracy and demonstrates exceptional robustness on challenging sequences where prior methods frequently fail. Produces simulation-ready assets validated via real-to-sim retargeting for robotic applications.

Conclusion: AGILE provides a robust framework for reconstructing dynamic hand-object interactions by shifting from traditional reconstruction to agentic generation, overcoming limitations of neural rendering and brittle SfM initialization, while prioritizing physical validity to produce simulation-ready assets for robotics and VR applications.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic hand-object interactions from monocular videos is critical for dexterous manipulation data collection and creating realistic digital twins for robotics and VR. However, current methods face two prohibitive barriers: (1) reliance on neural rendering often yields fragmented, non-simulation-ready geometries under heavy occlusion, and (2) dependence on brittle Structure-from-Motion (SfM) initialization leads to frequent failures on in-the-wild footage. To overcome these limitations, we introduce AGILE, a robust framework that shifts the paradigm from reconstruction to agentic generation for interaction learning. First, we employ an agentic pipeline where a Vision-Language Model (VLM) guides a generative model to synthesize a complete, watertight object mesh with high-fidelity texture, independent of video occlusions. Second, bypassing fragile SfM entirely, we propose a robust anchor-and-track strategy. We initialize the object pose at a single interaction onset frame using a foundation model and propagate it temporally by leveraging the strong visual similarity between our generated asset and video observations. Finally, a contact-aware optimization integrates semantic, geometric, and interaction stability constraints to enforce physical plausibility. Extensive experiments on HO3D, DexYCB, and in-the-wild videos reveal that AGILE outperforms baselines in global geometric accuracy while demonstrating exceptional robustness on challenging sequences where prior art frequently collapses. By prioritizing physical validity, our method produces simulation-ready assets validated via real-to-sim retargeting for robotic applications.

*Aditya R. Bhattacharya,Debanjan Goswami,Shayok Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ACIL: Active learning framework for class incremental learning that reduces annotation costs by selecting only the most informative samples for labeling in each episode.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current continual learning methods require full annotation of all training samples in each episode, which is costly and wasteful since most samples become inaccessible in future episodes. There's a need to reduce annotation effort while maintaining model performance.

Method: Proposes ACIL framework that uses uncertainty and diversity criteria to select the most informative samples for annotation in each episode. These selected exemplar samples are then appended to the data in subsequent episodes to prevent catastrophic forgetting.

Result: Extensive empirical analyses on several vision datasets show that ACIL effectively reduces annotation costs while avoiding catastrophic forgetting, outperforming relevant baselines.

Conclusion: ACIL provides a practical solution to the annotation cost problem in continual learning by combining active learning principles with class incremental learning, offering significant annotation savings without compromising model performance.

Abstract: Continual learning (or class incremental learning) is a realistic learning scenario for computer vision systems, where deep neural networks are trained on episodic data, and the data from previous episodes are generally inaccessible to the model. Existing research in this domain has primarily focused on avoiding catastrophic forgetting, which occurs due to the continuously changing class distributions in each episode and the inaccessibility of the data from previous episodes. However, these methods assume that all the training samples in every episode are annotated; this not only incurs a huge annotation cost, but also results in a wastage of annotation effort, since most of the samples in a given episode will not be accessible to the model in subsequent episodes. Active learning algorithms identify the salient and informative samples from large amounts of unlabeled data and are instrumental in reducing the human annotation effort in inducing a deep neural network. In this paper, we propose ACIL, a novel active learning framework for class incremental learning settings. We exploit a criterion based on uncertainty and diversity to identify the exemplar samples that need to be annotated in each episode, and will be appended to the data in the next episode. Such a framework can drastically reduce annotation cost and can also avoid catastrophic forgetting. Our extensive empirical analyses on several vision datasets corroborate the promise and potential of our framework against relevant baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monocular video human mesh recovery methods struggle with metric consistency and temporal stability due to depth ambiguities, scale uncertainties, depth ordering issues, scale drift, and occlusion-induced instabilities. RGB features and temporal smoothing alone are insufficient for robust performance.

Method: Three synergistic components: 1) Depth-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion module adaptively integrates geometric priors with RGB features via confidence-aware gating; 2) Depth-guided Metric-Aware Pose and Shape (D-MAPS) estimator leverages depth-calibrated bone statistics for scale-consistent initialization; 3) Motion-Depth Aligned Refinement (MoDAR) module enforces temporal coherence through cross-modal attention between motion dynamics and geometric cues.

Result: Achieves superior results on three challenging benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against heavy occlusion and spatial accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed depth-guided framework effectively addresses fundamental challenges in monocular video human mesh recovery by leveraging geometric priors and cross-modal attention, achieving metric-aware temporal consistency that outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Monocular video human mesh recovery faces fundamental challenges in maintaining metric consistency and temporal stability due to inherent depth ambiguities and scale uncertainties.

*Yong Li,Yuanzhi Wang,Yi Ding,Shiqing Zhang,Ke Lu,Cuntai Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DHMD is a novel multimodal emotion recognition framework that decouples modality features into homogeneous and heterogeneous components and uses hierarchical knowledge distillation for better cross-modal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MER methods struggle with multimodal heterogeneities and varying modality contributions, needing better approaches to handle these challenges.

Method: DHMD decouples each modality's features into modality-irrelevant (homogeneous) and modality-exclusive (heterogeneous) components using self-regression. It then employs two-stage knowledge distillation: coarse-grained KD via Graph Distillation Unit with dynamic graphs, and fine-grained KD through cross-modal dictionary matching for semantic alignment.

Result: DHMD outperforms state-of-the-art MER methods with 1.3%/2.4% (ACC7), 1.3%/1.9% (ACC2) and 1.9%/1.8% (F1) relative improvements on CMU-MOSI/CMU-MOSEI datasets. Visualization shows meaningful distribution patterns in graph edges and dictionary activations.

Conclusion: The proposed DHMD framework effectively addresses multimodal heterogeneity through feature decoupling and hierarchical distillation, achieving superior emotion recognition performance while providing interpretable insights into cross-modal interactions.

Abstract: Human multimodal emotion recognition (MER) seeks to infer human emotions by integrating information from language, visual, and acoustic modalities. Although existing MER approaches have achieved promising results, they still struggle with inherent multimodal heterogeneities and varying contributions from different modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, Decoupled Hierarchical Multimodal Distillation (DHMD). DHMD decouples each modality's features into modality-irrelevant (homogeneous) and modality-exclusive (heterogeneous) components using a self-regression mechanism. The framework employs a two-stage knowledge distillation (KD) strategy: (1) coarse-grained KD via a Graph Distillation Unit (GD-Unit) in each decoupled feature space, where a dynamic graph facilitates adaptive distillation among modalities, and (2) fine-grained KD through a cross-modal dictionary matching mechanism, which aligns semantic granularities across modalities to produce more discriminative MER representations. This hierarchical distillation approach enables flexible knowledge transfer and effectively improves cross-modal feature alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that DHMD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MER methods, achieving 1.3\%/2.4\% (ACC$_7$), 1.3\%/1.9\% (ACC$_2$) and 1.9\%/1.8\% (F1) relative improvement on CMU-MOSI/CMU-MOSEI dataset, respectively. Meanwhile, visualization results reveal that both the graph edges and dictionary activations in DHMD exhibit meaningful distribution patterns across modality-irrelevant/-exclusive feature spaces.

*Siyu Jiang,Feiyang Chen,Xiaojin Zhang,Kun He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KVSmooth reduces hallucination in Multimodal LLMs by applying attention-entropy-guided adaptive smoothing to KV-Cache during inference, improving both precision and recall without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs suffer from hallucination (generating visually inconsistent content) due to semantic drift during decoding, which diverges from visual facts as sequence length increases, hindering reliable deployment.

Method: Training-free plug-and-play method that applies exponential moving average (EMA) smoothing to keys and values in KV-Cache, using attention distribution entropy to dynamically quantify token sink degree and adaptively adjust smoothing strength.

Result: Significantly reduces hallucination (CHAIR_S from 41.8 to 18.2) while improving overall performance (F1 score from 77.5 to 79.2), achieving higher precision and recall simultaneously unlike prior methods that trade off one for the other.

Conclusion: KVSmooth effectively mitigates hallucination in MLLMs through efficient inference-time smoothing of hidden states, demonstrating strong generalization and practical deployment advantages over computationally expensive alternatives.

Abstract: Despite the significant progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, hallucination -- corresponding to the generation of visually inconsistent objects, attributes, or relations -- remains a major obstacle to their reliable deployment. Unlike pure language models, MLLMs must ground their generation process in visual inputs. However, existing models often suffer from semantic drift during decoding, causing outputs to diverge from visual facts as the sequence length increases.
  To address this issue, we propose KVSmooth, a training-free and plug-and-play method that mitigates hallucination by performing attention-entropy-guided adaptive smoothing on hidden states. Specifically, KVSmooth applies an exponential moving average (EMA) to both keys and values in the KV-Cache, while dynamically quantifying the sink degree of each token through the entropy of its attention distribution to adaptively adjust the smoothing strength.
  Unlike computationally expensive retraining or contrastive decoding methods, KVSmooth operates efficiently during inference without additional training or model modification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KVSmooth significantly reduces hallucination ($\mathit{CHAIR}_{S}$ from $41.8 \rightarrow 18.2$) while improving overall performance ($F_1$ score from $77.5 \rightarrow 79.2$), achieving higher precision and recall simultaneously. In contrast, prior methods often improve one at the expense of the other, validating the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

TL;DR: SkeletonGaussian is a framework for generating editable dynamic 3D Gaussians from monocular video using hierarchical articulated representation with skeleton-driven rigid motion and hexplane-based non-rigid refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 4D generation methods represent motion as implicit deformation fields, limiting direct control and editability. The authors aim to create a more interpretable and editable approach for dynamic 3D object generation.

Method: Proposes SkeletonGaussian framework with hierarchical articulated representation: extracts skeleton, drives rigid motion via linear blend skinning, then refines with hexplane-based non-rigid deformations for fine-grained motion details.

Result: SkeletonGaussian surpasses existing methods in generation quality while enabling intuitive motion editing, establishing a new paradigm for editable 4D generation.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the editability limitations of previous 4D generation methods by introducing explicit skeleton-driven motion representation with hierarchical decomposition, opening new possibilities for controllable dynamic 3D content creation.

Abstract: 4D generation has made remarkable progress in synthesizing dynamic 3D objects from input text, images, or videos. However, existing methods often represent motion as an implicit deformation field, which limits direct control and editability. To address this issue, we propose SkeletonGaussian, a novel framework for generating editable dynamic 3D Gaussians from monocular video input. Our approach introduces a hierarchical articulated representation that decomposes motion into sparse rigid motion explicitly driven by a skeleton and fine-grained non-rigid motion. Concretely, we extract a robust skeleton and drive rigid motion via linear blend skinning, followed by a hexplane-based refinement for non-rigid deformations, enhancing interpretability and editability. Experimental results demonstrate that SkeletonGaussian surpasses existing methods in generation quality while enabling intuitive motion editing, establishing a new paradigm for editable 4D generation.

*Jue Gong,Zihan Zhou,Jingkai Wang,Xiaohong Liu,Yulun Zhang,Xiaokang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new method for face fill-light enhancement that uses a physically-based dataset and diffusion model to add virtual fill light while preserving background illumination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing face relighting methods often modify the entire scene or suppress input illumination, causing foreground-background inconsistency and not meeting practical fill-light enhancement needs.

Method: Created LightYourFace-160K dataset with physically consistent renderer using 6D disk-shaped fill light parameters. Pretrained physics-aware lighting prompt (PALP) to embed lighting parameters, then trained fill-light diffusion (FiLitDiff) model conditioned on these physical lighting codes.

Result: Strong perceptual quality and competitive full-reference metrics on held-out paired sets, with better background illumination preservation compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables controllable, high-fidelity fill lighting at low computational cost while maintaining scene consistency, with dataset and model publicly available.

Abstract: Face fill-light enhancement (FFE) brightens underexposed faces by adding virtual fill light while keeping the original scene illumination and background unchanged. Most face relighting methods aim to reshape overall lighting, which can suppress the input illumination or modify the entire scene, leading to foreground-background inconsistency and mismatching practical FFE needs. To support scalable learning, we introduce LightYourFace-160K (LYF-160K), a large-scale paired dataset built with a physically consistent renderer that injects a disk-shaped area fill light controlled by six disentangled factors, producing 160K before-and-after pairs. We first pretrain a physics-aware lighting prompt (PALP) that embeds the 6D parameters into conditioning tokens, using an auxiliary planar-light reconstruction objective. Building on a pretrained diffusion backbone, we then train a fill-light diffusion (FiLitDiff), an efficient one-step model conditioned on physically grounded lighting codes, enabling controllable and high-fidelity fill lighting at low computational cost. Experiments on held-out paired sets demonstrate strong perceptual quality and competitive full-reference metrics, while better preserving background illumination.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LASER improves VQA accuracy by dynamically selecting optimal attention layers for visual grounding based on query complexity, instead of using fixed layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed visual-token budgets in LVLMs force uniform image resolution, losing fine details and causing hallucinations. Current attention-guided methods use static layers chosen on simple tasks, which don't transfer well to complex reasoning.

Method: Propose Visual Activation by Query (VAQ) metric to identify query-specific optimal attention layers, then develop LASER - a training-free inference procedure that adaptively selects layers for visual localization and question answering based on task complexity.

Result: Experiments across diverse VQA benchmarks show LASER significantly improves VQA accuracy across tasks with varying complexity levels.

Conclusion: Visual grounding is dynamic - simple tasks use middle layers while complex tasks need deeper layer reactivation. LASER's adaptive layer selection effectively addresses limitations of static approaches.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced rapidly by aligning visual patches with the text embedding space, but a fixed visual-token budget forces images to be resized to a uniform pretraining resolution, often erasing fine-grained details and causing hallucinations via over-reliance on language priors. Recent attention-guided enhancement (e.g., cropping or region-focused attention allocation) alleviates this, yet it commonly hinges on a static "magic layer" empirically chosen on simple recognition benchmarks and thus may not transfer to complex reasoning tasks. In contrast to this static assumption, we propose a dynamic perspective on visual grounding. Through a layer-wise sensitivity analysis, we demonstrate that visual grounding is a dynamic process: while simple object recognition tasks rely on middle layers, complex visual search and reasoning tasks require visual information to be reactivated at deeper layers. Based on this observation, we introduce Visual Activation by Query (VAQ), a metric that identifies the layer whose attention map is most relevant to query-specific visual grounding by measuring attention sensitivity to the input query. Building on VAQ, we further propose LASER (Layer-adaptive Attention-guided Selective visual and decoding Enhancement for Reasoning), a training-free inference procedure that adaptively selects task-appropriate layers for visual localization and question answering. Experiments across diverse VQA benchmarks show that LASER significantly improves VQA accuracy across tasks with varying levels of complexity.

TL;DR: JOintGS is a unified framework that jointly optimizes camera extrinsics, human poses, and 3D Gaussian representations from monocular RGB videos, achieving superior reconstruction quality with real-time rendering even with noisy initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing high-fidelity animatable 3D human avatars from monocular RGB videos is challenging in unconstrained scenarios where camera parameters and human poses from off-the-shelf methods are often inaccurate. Existing splatting methods depend on precise camera calibration and pose annotations, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: JOintGS jointly optimizes camera extrinsics, human poses, and 3D Gaussian representations through synergistic refinement. Key innovations include: explicit foreground-background disentanglement for mutual reinforcement (static background anchors camera estimation, refined cameras improve body alignment, optimized poses enhance scene reconstruction), temporal dynamics module for pose-dependent deformations, and residual color field for illumination variations.

Result: Extensive experiments on NeuMan and EMDB datasets show JOintGS achieves 2.1~dB PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods on NeuMan dataset while maintaining real-time rendering. The method demonstrates significantly enhanced robustness to noisy initialization compared to baselines.

Conclusion: JOintGS presents an effective unified framework for high-fidelity human avatar reconstruction from monocular videos, overcoming limitations of existing methods by jointly optimizing camera, pose, and 3D Gaussian representations, with demonstrated superior performance and robustness.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity animatable 3D human avatars from monocular RGB videos remains challenging, particularly in unconstrained in-the-wild scenarios where camera parameters and human poses from off-the-shelf methods (e.g., COLMAP, HMR2.0) are often inaccurate. Splatting (3DGS) advances demonstrate impressive rendering quality and real-time performance, they critically depend on precise camera calibration and pose annotations, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. We present JOintGS, a unified framework that jointly optimizes camera extrinsics, human poses, and 3D Gaussian representations from coarse initialization through a synergistic refinement mechanism. Our key insight is that explicit foreground-background disentanglement enables mutual reinforcement: static background Gaussians anchor camera estimation via multi-view consistency; refined cameras improve human body alignment through accurate temporal correspondence; optimized human poses enhance scene reconstruction by removing dynamic artifacts from static constraints. We further introduce a temporal dynamics module to capture fine-grained pose-dependent deformations and a residual color field to model illumination variations. Extensive experiments on NeuMan and EMDB datasets demonstrate that JOintGS achieves superior reconstruction quality, with 2.1~dB PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods on NeuMan dataset, while maintaining real-time rendering. Notably, our method shows significantly enhanced robustness to noisy initialization compared to the baseline.Our source code is available at https://github.com/MiliLab/JOintGS.

Conclusion: CoFT provides an effective unsupervised adaptation framework for VLMs that addresses limitations of existing pseudo-labeling methods through collaborative filtering and dual-prompt learning, achieving strong performance without labeled data.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP exhibit strong zero-shot generalization, but adapting them to downstream tasks typically requires costly labeled data. Existing unsupervised self-training methods rely on pseudo-labeling, yet often suffer from unreliable confidence filtering, confirmation bias, and underutilization of low-confidence samples. We propose Collaborative Fine-Tuning (CoFT), an unsupervised adaptation framework that leverages unlabeled data through a dual-model, cross-modal collaboration mechanism. CoFT introduces a dual-prompt learning strategy with positive and negative textual prompts to explicitly model pseudo-label cleanliness in a sample-dependent manner, removing the need for hand-crafted thresholds or noise assumptions. The negative prompt also regularizes lightweight visual adaptation modules, improving robustness under noisy supervision. CoFT employs a two-phase training scheme, transitioning from parameter-efficient fine-tuning on high-confidence samples to full fine-tuning guided by collaboratively filtered pseudo-labels. Building on CoFT, CoFT+ further enhances adaptation via iterative fine-tuning, momentum contrastive learning, and LLM-generated prompts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Features from different pretrained models have distinct distributions due to varying pretraining objectives/architectures, making it challenging to learn invariant representations from large-scale unlabeled visual data in a fully unsupervised transfer manner.

Method: Proposes multiview self-representation learning (MSRL) with: 1) individual linear models on frozen pretrained backbones, 2) information-passing mechanism via self-representation learning for feature aggregation, 3) assignment probability distribution consistency scheme to exploit complementary information across views and enforce representation invariance.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark visual datasets show MSRL consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: MSRL effectively learns invariant representations from heterogeneous multiview data by combining self-representation learning with cross-view consistency constraints, providing theoretical analysis of key components.

Abstract: Features of the same sample generated by different pretrained models often exhibit inherently distinct feature distributions because of discrepancies in the model pretraining objectives or architectures. Learning invariant representations from large-scale unlabeled visual data with various pretrained models in a fully unsupervised transfer manner remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a multiview self-representation learning (MSRL) method in which invariant representations are learned by exploiting the self-representation property of features across heterogeneous views. The features are derived from large-scale unlabeled visual data through transfer learning with various pretrained models and are referred to as heterogeneous multiview data. An individual linear model is stacked on top of its corresponding frozen pretrained backbone. We introduce an information-passing mechanism that relies on self-representation learning to support feature aggregation over the outputs of the linear model. Moreover, an assignment probability distribution consistency scheme is presented to guide multiview self-representation learning by exploiting complementary information across different views. Consequently, representation invariance across different linear models is enforced through this scheme. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the information-passing mechanism, the assignment probability distribution consistency and the incremental views. Extensive experiments with multiple benchmark visual datasets demonstrate that the proposed MSRL method consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP to downstream tasks with limited annotations is challenging. Existing active learning approaches don't explicitly model uncertainty from the model perspective, relying instead on entropy-based criteria or representation clustering.

Method: Introduces dual-prompt tuning: a positive prompt enhances discriminability of task-specific textual embeddings with tuned visual embeddings, while a negative prompt is trained in reverse to explicitly model prediction correctness probability, providing uncertainty signals for active sample selection.

Result: Extensive experiments across different fine-tuning paradigms show the method consistently outperforms existing active learning approaches under the same annotation budget.

Conclusion: The proposed robust uncertainty modeling framework with dual-prompt tuning effectively addresses active CLIP adaptation challenges by providing principled uncertainty signals for sample selection while improving classification reliability.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP exhibit strong transferability, yet adapting them to downstream image classification tasks under limited annotation budgets remains challenging. In active learning settings, the model must select the most informative samples for annotation from a large pool of unlabeled data. Existing approaches typically estimate uncertainty via entropy-based criteria or representation clustering, without explicitly modeling uncertainty from the model perspective. In this work, we propose a robust uncertainty modeling framework for active CLIP adaptation based on dual-prompt tuning. We introduce two learnable prompts in the textual branch of CLIP. The positive prompt enhances the discriminability of task-specific textual embeddings corresponding to light-weight tuned visual embeddings, improving classification reliability. Meanwhile, the negative prompt is trained in an reversed manner to explicitly model the probability that the predicted label is correct, providing a principled uncertainty signal for guiding active sample selection. Extensive experiments across different fine-tuning paradigms demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing active learning methods under the same annotation budget.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct editing of 3D meshes remains underexplored compared to 3D Gaussian Splatting or multi-view image approaches. Existing methods like VoxHammer use voxel-based representations with limited resolution and require labor-intensive 3D masks.

Method: 1) Analysis of spatial properties in VecSet tokens reveals token subsets govern distinct geometric regions. 2) Mask-guided Token Seeding and Attention-aligned Token Gating for precise region localization using 2D image conditions. 3) Drift-aware Token Pruning to reject geometric outliers during denoising. 4) Detail-preserving Texture Baking to preserve both geometric details and textural information.

Result: Proposed VecSet-Edit pipeline enables high-fidelity 3D mesh editing using VecSet LRM backbone, overcoming limitations of voxel-based approaches by providing precise region control with only 2D image conditions while maintaining original mesh details.

Conclusion: VecSet-Edit represents a significant advancement in 3D mesh editing by leveraging VecSet LRM's capabilities, offering a more efficient and precise approach compared to existing voxel-based methods while preserving both geometric and textural fidelity.

Abstract: 3D editing has emerged as a critical research area to provide users with flexible control over 3D assets. While current editing approaches predominantly focus on 3D Gaussian Splatting or multi-view images, the direct editing of 3D meshes remains underexplored. Prior attempts, such as VoxHammer, rely on voxel-based representations that suffer from limited resolution and necessitate labor-intensive 3D mask. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{VecSet-Edit}, the first pipeline that leverages the high-fidelity VecSet Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) as a backbone for mesh editing. Our approach is grounded on a analysis of the spatial properties in VecSet tokens, revealing that token subsets govern distinct geometric regions. Based on this insight, we introduce Mask-guided Token Seeding and Attention-aligned Token Gating strategies to precisely localize target regions using only 2D image conditions. Also, considering the difference between VecSet diffusion process versus voxel we design a Drift-aware Token Pruning to reject geometric outliers during the denoising process. Finally, our Detail-preserving Texture Baking module ensures that we not only preserve the geometric details of original mesh but also the textural information.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SparVAR is a training-free acceleration framework for Visual AutoRegressive models that uses sparse attention patterns to reduce computational complexity while preserving high-frequency details, achieving up to 5× faster attention and 2.28× overall acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR models suffer from quartic computational complexity growth with resolution, causing substantial latency. Existing acceleration methods skip high-resolution scales, which discards high-frequency details and harms image quality.

Method: Exploits three VAR attention properties: (1) strong attention sinks, (2) cross-scale activation similarity, and (3) pronounced locality. Dynamically predicts sparse attention patterns from a sparse decision scale, constructs scale self-similar sparse attention via index-mapping, implements cross-scale local sparse attention with efficient block-wise sparse kernels.

Result: Achieves >5× faster forward speed than FlashAttention, reduces 8B model 1024×1024 image generation to 1s without skipping scales. Achieves 1.57× speed-up over FlashAttention-accelerated VAR baseline while preserving high-frequency details. Combined with scale-skipping: up to 2.28× acceleration with competitive visual quality.

Conclusion: SparVAR provides effective training-free acceleration for VAR models by exploiting attention sparsity patterns, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining image quality, making high-resolution VAR generation more practical.

Abstract: Visual AutoRegressive (VAR) modeling has garnered significant attention for its innovative next-scale prediction paradigm. However, mainstream VAR paradigms attend to all tokens across historical scales at each autoregressive step. As the next scale resolution grows, the computational complexity of attention increases quartically with resolution, causing substantial latency. Prior accelerations often skip high-resolution scales, which speeds up inference but discards high-frequency details and harms image quality. To address these problems, we present SparVAR, a training-free acceleration framework that exploits three properties of VAR attention: (i) strong attention sinks, (ii) cross-scale activation similarity, and (iii) pronounced locality. Specifically, we dynamically predict the sparse attention pattern of later high-resolution scales from a sparse decision scale, and construct scale self-similar sparse attention via an efficient index-mapping mechanism, enabling high-efficiency sparse attention computation at large scales. Furthermore, we propose cross-scale local sparse attention and implement an efficient block-wise sparse kernel, which achieves $\mathbf{> 5\times}$ faster forward speed than FlashAttention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SparseVAR can reduce the generation time of an 8B model producing $1024\times1024$ high-resolution images to the 1s, without skipping the last scales. Compared with the VAR baseline accelerated by FlashAttention, our method achieves a $\mathbf{1.57\times}$ speed-up while preserving almost all high-frequency details. When combined with existing scale-skipping strategies, SparseVAR attains up to a $\mathbf{2.28\times}$ acceleration, while maintaining competitive visual generation quality.

Conclusion: NeMO's object-centric representation with single-network multi-task capability enhances novel object interaction, improving scalability and efficiency by enabling quick object onboarding without retraining or extensive preprocessing.

Abstract: We present Neural Memory Object (NeMO), a novel object-centric representation that can be used to detect, segment and estimate the 6DoF pose of objects unseen during training using RGB images. Our method consists of an encoder that requires only a few RGB template views depicting an object to generate a sparse object-like point cloud using a learned UDF containing semantic and geometric information. Next, a decoder takes the object encoding together with a query image to generate a variety of dense predictions. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method can be used for few-shot object perception without requiring any camera-specific parameters or retraining on target data. Our proposed concept of outsourcing object information in a NeMO and using a single network for multiple perception tasks enhances interaction with novel objects, improving scalability and efficiency by enabling quick object onboarding without retraining or extensive pre-processing.

*Weihao Gao,Zhuo Deng,Zheng Gong,Lan Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltraSeg family: Extremely compressed (<0.3M params) polyp segmentation models achieving 90 FPS on CPU while maintaining >94% accuracy of 31M-parameter U-Net, enabling deployment in resource-constrained clinical settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current high-precision polyp segmentation models require GPUs, making them impractical for deployment in primary hospitals, mobile endoscopy units, and capsule robots where computational resources are limited.

Method: Developed UltraSeg family with two variants: UltraSeg-108K for single-center data and UltraSeg-130K for multi-center, multi-modal images. Used joint optimization of encoder-decoder widths, constrained dilated convolutions to enlarge receptive fields, and cross-layer lightweight fusion module.

Result: Models achieve 90 FPS on a single CPU core while retaining >94% of the Dice score of a 31M-parameter U-Net, using only 0.4% of its parameters. Evaluated on seven public datasets, establishing strong baseline for extreme-compression domain.

Conclusion: UltraSeg provides a clinically viable, CPU-native solution for colonoscopy polyp segmentation and offers a reproducible blueprint for broader minimally invasive surgical vision applications in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Early detection of colorectal cancer hinges on real-time, accurate polyp identification and resection. Yet current high-precision segmentation models rely on GPUs, making them impractical to deploy in primary hospitals, mobile endoscopy units, or capsule robots. To bridge this gap, we present the UltraSeg family, operating in an extreme-compression regime (<0.3 M parameters). UltraSeg-108K (0.108 M parameters) is optimized for single-center data, while UltraSeg-130K (0.13 M parameters) generalizes to multi-center, multi-modal images. By jointly optimizing encoder-decoder widths, incorporating constrained dilated convolutions to enlarge receptive fields, and integrating a cross-layer lightweight fusion module, the models achieve 90 FPS on a single CPU core without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluated on seven public datasets, UltraSeg retains >94% of the Dice score of a 31 M-parameter U-Net while utilizing only 0.4% of its parameters, establishing a strong, clinically viable baseline for the extreme-compression domain and offering an immediately deployable solution for resource-constrained settings. This work provides not only a CPU-native solution for colonoscopy but also a reproducible blueprint for broader minimally invasive surgical vision applications. Source code is publicly available to ensure reproducibility and facilitate future benchmarking.

Conclusion: Med-MMFL fills the critical gap in medical FL benchmarking by providing standardized evaluation for multimodal federated learning, supporting reproducibility and fair comparison of future MMFL methods under realistic medical settings.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized medical institutions while preserving data privacy. However, medical FL benchmarks remain scarce, with existing efforts focusing mainly on unimodal or bimodal modalities and a limited range of medical tasks. This gap underscores the need for standardized evaluation to advance systematic understanding in medical MultiModal FL (MMFL). To this end, we introduce Med-MMFL, the first comprehensive MMFL benchmark for the medical domain, encompassing diverse modalities, tasks, and federation scenarios. Our benchmark evaluates six representative state-of-the-art FL algorithms, covering different aggregation strategies, loss formulations, and regularization techniques. It spans datasets with 2 to 4 modalities, comprising a total of 10 unique medical modalities, including text, pathology images, ECG, X-ray, radiology reports, and multiple MRI sequences. Experiments are conducted across naturally federated, synthetic IID, and synthetic non-IID settings to simulate real-world heterogeneity.

### [58] [When and Where to Attack? Stage-wise Attention-Guided Adversarial Attack on Large Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04356)
*Jaehyun Kwak,Nam Cao,Boryeong Cho,Segyu Lee,Sumyeong Ahn,Se-Young Yun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAGA is a stage-wise attention-guided adversarial attack framework that progressively concentrates perturbations on high-attention regions of LVLMs, achieving state-of-the-art attack success with highly imperceptible adversarial examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attacks on LVLMs using random cropping are stochastic and inefficient with limited perturbation budgets. The authors observed that regional attention scores correlate with adversarial loss sensitivity, and attacking high-attention regions causes structured attention redistribution to other salient areas.

Method: SAGA (Stage-wise Attention-Guided Attack) is an attention-guided framework that progressively concentrates perturbations on high-attention regions. It uses the observation that attacking high-attention regions induces structured redistribution of attention toward subsequent salient regions, enabling more efficient use of constrained perturbation budgets.

Result: SAGA consistently achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates across ten different Large Vision-Language Models while producing highly imperceptible adversarial examples. The method demonstrates more efficient use of limited perturbation budgets compared to random cropping approaches.

Conclusion: Attention-guided adversarial attacks like SAGA are more effective than stochastic approaches for exposing safety vulnerabilities in LVLMs. The framework successfully leverages attention mechanisms to create imperceptible yet highly effective adversarial examples, advancing the understanding of multimodal system vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks against Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are crucial for exposing safety vulnerabilities in modern multimodal systems. Recent attacks based on input transformations, such as random cropping, suggest that spatially localized perturbations can be more effective than global image manipulation. However, randomly cropping the entire image is inherently stochastic and fails to use the limited per-pixel perturbation budget efficiently. We make two key observations: (i) regional attention scores are positively correlated with adversarial loss sensitivity, and (ii) attacking high-attention regions induces a structured redistribution of attention toward subsequent salient regions. Based on these findings, we propose Stage-wise Attention-Guided Attack (SAGA), an attention-guided framework that progressively concentrates perturbations on high-attention regions. SAGA enables more efficient use of constrained perturbation budgets, producing highly imperceptible adversarial examples while consistently achieving state-of-the-art attack success rates across ten LVLMs. The source code is available at https://github.com/jackwaky/SAGA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a semi-supervised segmentation framework with Class-Aware Adaptive Thresholding and Prototype Bank System for mapping informal settlements across 8 cities, outperforming SOTA methods and showing strong domain transfer with only 10% labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale mapping of informal settlements is constrained by annotation scarcity and data quality issues (spectral ambiguity between formal/informal structures, annotation noise), especially in cities like Lahore, Karachi, and Mumbai.

Method: Introduces new benchmark datasets for Lahore, Karachi, and Mumbai (1,869 km² total). Proposes semi-supervised segmentation framework with: 1) Class-Aware Adaptive Thresholding to dynamically adjust confidence thresholds and prevent minority class suppression, and 2) Prototype Bank System to enforce semantic consistency by anchoring predictions to historically learned high-fidelity feature representations.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised baselines across 8 cities spanning 3 continents. Shows superior domain transfer capability: model trained on only 10% of source labels achieves 0.461 mIoU on unseen geographies, outperforming zero-shot generalization of fully supervised models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses class imbalance and feature degradation in semi-supervised learning for informal settlement mapping, demonstrating robust performance and strong cross-domain generalization with minimal labeled data.

Abstract: Rapid urban expansion has fueled the growth of informal settlements in major cities of low- and middle-income countries, with Lahore and Karachi in Pakistan and Mumbai in India serving as prominent examples. However, large-scale mapping of these settlements is severely constrained not only by the scarcity of annotations but by inherent data quality challenges, specifically high spectral ambiguity between formal and informal structures and significant annotation noise. We address this by introducing a benchmark dataset for Lahore, constructed from scratch, along with companion datasets for Karachi and Mumbai, which were derived from verified administrative boundaries, totaling 1,869 $\text{km}^2$ of area. To evaluate the global robustness of our framework, we extend our experiments to five additional established benchmarks, encompassing eight cities across three continents, and provide comprehensive data quality assessments of all datasets. We also propose a new semi-supervised segmentation framework designed to mitigate the class imbalance and feature degradation inherent in standard semi-supervised learning pipelines. Our method integrates a Class-Aware Adaptive Thresholding mechanism that dynamically adjusts confidence thresholds to prevent minority class suppression and a Prototype Bank System that enforces semantic consistency by anchoring predictions to historically learned high-fidelity feature representations. Extensive experiments across a total of eight cities spanning three continents demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised baselines. Most notably, our method demonstrates superior domain transfer capability whereby a model trained on only 10% of source labels reaches a 0.461 mIoU on unseen geographies and outperforms the zero-shot generalization of fully supervised models.

*Sijia Chen,Lijuan Ma,Yanqiu Yu,En Yu,Liman Liu,Wenbing Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes RGBD Referring Multi-Object Tracking (DRMOT) using RGB, depth, and language for 3D-aware tracking, introduces DRSet dataset, and presents DRTrack framework with MLLM guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RMOT models rely only on 2D RGB data, making it challenging to handle complex spatial semantics (e.g., "the person closest to the camera") and maintain reliable identities under severe occlusion due to lack of explicit 3D spatial information.

Method: Proposes DRMOT task requiring RGB-Depth-Language fusion, constructs DRSet dataset with 187 scenes and 240 language descriptions (56 with depth info), and develops DRTrack framework using MLLM-guided depth-referring tracking with depth-aware target grounding and trajectory association.

Result: Extensive experiments on DRSet dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DRTrack framework for 3D-aware tracking.

Conclusion: Introduces RGBD Referring Multi-Object Tracking as a novel task that leverages multi-modal fusion of RGB, depth, and language to enable more accurate spatial-semantic grounding and robust tracking under challenging conditions like occlusion.

Abstract: Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) aims to track specific targets based on language descriptions and is vital for interactive AI systems such as robotics and autonomous driving. However, existing RMOT models rely solely on 2D RGB data, making it challenging to accurately detect and associate targets characterized by complex spatial semantics (e.g., ``the person closest to the camera'') and to maintain reliable identities under severe occlusion, due to the absence of explicit 3D spatial information. In this work, we propose a novel task, RGBD Referring Multi-Object Tracking (DRMOT), which explicitly requires models to fuse RGB, Depth (D), and Language (L) modalities to achieve 3D-aware tracking. To advance research on the DRMOT task, we construct a tailored RGBD referring multi-object tracking dataset, named DRSet, designed to evaluate models' spatial-semantic grounding and tracking capabilities. Specifically, DRSet contains RGB images and depth maps from 187 scenes, along with 240 language descriptions, among which 56 descriptions incorporate depth-related information. Furthermore, we propose DRTrack, a MLLM-guided depth-referring tracking framework. DRTrack performs depth-aware target grounding from joint RGB-D-L inputs and enforces robust trajectory association by incorporating depth cues. Extensive experiments on the DRSet dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ISFM, an Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion Mamba framework for multi-modal image fusion that combines spatial and frequency features through interactive guidance rather than simple serial/parallel fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMIF methods that use frequency domain information typically rely on simple serial or parallel spatial-frequency fusion without interaction, limiting their ability to effectively combine complementary information from different modalities.

Method: 1) Modality-Specific Extractor (MSE) with linear computational complexity for long-range dependencies; 2) Multi-scale Frequency Fusion (MFF) for adaptive integration of low/high-frequency components; 3) Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion (ISF) where frequency features guide spatial features across modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments on six MMIF datasets demonstrate that ISFM achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed ISFM framework effectively integrates spatial and frequency information through interactive fusion, outperforming existing methods in multi-modal image fusion tasks.

Abstract: Multi-Modal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to combine images from different modalities to produce fused images, retaining texture details and preserving significant information. Recently, some MMIF methods incorporate frequency domain information to enhance spatial features. However, these methods typically rely on simple serial or parallel spatial-frequency fusion without interaction. In this paper, we propose a novel Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion Mamba (ISFM) framework for MMIF. Specifically, we begin with a Modality-Specific Extractor (MSE) to extract features from different modalities. It models long-range dependencies across the image with linear computational complexity. To effectively leverage frequency information, we then propose a Multi-scale Frequency Fusion (MFF). It adaptively integrates low-frequency and high-frequency components across multiple scales, enabling robust representations of frequency features. More importantly, we further propose an Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion (ISF). It incorporates frequency features to guide spatial features across modalities, enhancing complementary representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on six MMIF datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our ISFM can achieve better performances than other state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/Namn23/ISFM.

TL;DR: SAR-RAG combines multimodal LLM with vector database for improved SAR automatic target recognition by retrieving similar past examples with known vehicle types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR images make military vehicles indistinguishable; existing SAR ATR methods need improvement for better vehicle differentiation, identification, and measurement.

Method: SAR-RAG combines multimodal large language model with vector database of semantic embeddings to retrieve contextual image exemplars with known vehicle types, enabling comparison with test examples.

Result: Improved ATR prediction accuracy demonstrated through search/retrieval metrics, categorical classification accuracy, and numeric regression of vehicle dimensions compared to MLLM baseline.

Conclusion: SAR-RAG enhances SAR ATR performance by adding retrieval-augmented generation as an attached memory bank, improving recognition through contextual example comparison.

Abstract: We present a visual-context image retrieval-augmented generation (ImageRAG) assisted AI agent for automatic target recognition (ATR) of synthetic aperture radar (SAR). SAR is a remote sensing method used in defense and security applications to detect and monitor the positions of military vehicles, which may appear indistinguishable in images. Researchers have extensively studied SAR ATR to improve the differentiation and identification of vehicle types, characteristics, and measurements. Test examples can be compared with known vehicle target types to improve recognition tasks. New methods enhance the capabilities of neural networks, transformer attention, and multimodal large language models. An agentic AI method may be developed to utilize a defined set of tools, such as searching through a library of similar examples. Our proposed method, SAR Retrieval-Augmented Generation (SAR-RAG), combines a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with a vector database of semantic embeddings to support contextual search for image exemplars with known qualities. By recovering past image examples with known true target types, our SAR-RAG system can compare similar vehicle categories, achieving improved ATR prediction accuracy. We evaluate this through search and retrieval metrics, categorical classification accuracy, and numeric regression of vehicle dimensions. These metrics all show improvements when SAR-RAG is added to an MLLM baseline method as an attached ATR memory bank.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LCUDiff upgrades latent diffusion models from 4-channel to 16-channel latent space for better human-centric image restoration, using channel splitting distillation and prior-preserving adaptation while maintaining one-step efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human-centric image restoration methods struggle with insufficient fidelity, especially in human body restoration. Current diffusion-based methods using pre-trained text-to-image models have VAE bottlenecks that limit restoration quality.

Method: Proposes LCUDiff framework that upgrades 4-channel latent diffusion models to 16-channel space. Uses channel splitting distillation to align first 4 channels with pre-trained priors while adding 12 channels for high-frequency details. Implements prior-preserving adaptation to handle dimension mismatch, and decoder router for per-sample routing based on restoration quality scores.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show competitive results with higher fidelity and fewer artifacts under mild degradations, while preserving one-step inference efficiency.

Conclusion: LCUDiff effectively addresses VAE bottlenecks in diffusion-based human-centric restoration by expanding latent space capacity, achieving better fidelity with maintained efficiency through careful architectural upgrades and adaptation techniques.

Abstract: Existing methods for restoring degraded human-centric images often struggle with insufficient fidelity, particularly in human body restoration (HBR). Recent diffusion-based restoration methods commonly adapt pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, where the variational autoencoder (VAE) can significantly bottleneck restoration fidelity. We propose LCUDiff, a stable one-step framework that upgrades a pre-trained latent diffusion model from the 4-channel latent space to the 16-channel latent space. For VAE fine-tuning, channel splitting distillation (CSD) is used to keep the first four channels aligned with pre-trained priors while allocating the additional channels to effectively encode high-frequency details. We further design prior-preserving adaptation (PPA) to smoothly bridge the mismatch between 4-channel diffusion backbones and the higher-dimensional 16-channel latent. In addition, we propose a decoder router (DeR) for per-sample decoder routing using restoration-quality score annotations, which improves visual quality across diverse conditions. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show competitive results with higher fidelity and fewer artifacts under mild degradations, while preserving one-step efficiency.

TL;DR: Machine learning model achieves 95.57% accuracy in classifying nail diseases using InceptionV3 with adversarial training and SHAP explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of nail diseases is important as they can indicate underlying health problems, but challenging due to subtle visual differences between disease types. Current diagnosis often occurs too late when conditions become severe.

Method: Used four CNN models (InceptionV3, DenseNet201, EfficientNetV2, ResNet50) on 3,835 nail images across six disease categories. Applied adversarial training to improve robustness and SHAP for explainability. Images resized to 224x224 pixels.

Result: InceptionV3 achieved best performance with 95.57% accuracy, followed by DenseNet201 at 94.79%. Adversarial training improved model robustness against tricky/noisy images.

Conclusion: The automated classification system could serve as a helpful diagnostic support tool for doctors, making nail disease diagnosis more accurate and faster through explainable AI.

Abstract: Human nail diseases are gradually observed over all age groups, especially among older individuals, often going ignored until they become severe. Early detection and accurate diagnosis of such conditions are important because they sometimes reveal our body's health problems. But it is challenging due to the inferred visual differences between disease types. This paper presents a machine learning-based model for automated classification of nail diseases based on a publicly available dataset, which contains 3,835 images scaling six categories. In 224x224 pixels, all images were resized to ensure consistency. To evaluate performance, four well-known CNN models-InceptionV3, DenseNet201, EfficientNetV2, and ResNet50 were trained and analyzed. Among these, InceptionV3 outperformed the others with an accuracy of 95.57%, while DenseNet201 came next with 94.79%. To make the model stronger and less likely to make mistakes on tricky or noisy images, we used adversarial training. To help understand how the model makes decisions, we used SHAP to highlight important features in the predictions. This system could be a helpful support for doctors, making nail disease diagnosis more accurate and faster.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrajVG is a 3D reconstruction framework that explicitly predicts cross-frame 3D correspondence via camera-coordinate 3D trajectories, addressing motion degradation in feed-forward models through geometric consistency objectives and unified mixed-supervision training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feed-forward multi-frame 3D reconstruction models degrade on videos with object motion due to ambiguous global references and drifting local pointmaps that cause cross-frame misalignment and duplicated structures.

Method: Proposes TrajVG framework that predicts camera-coordinate 3D trajectories, coupling sparse trajectories, per-frame local point maps, and relative camera poses with geometric consistency objectives: (1) bidirectional trajectory-pointmap consistency with controlled gradient flow, and (2) pose consistency using static track anchors that suppress gradients from dynamic regions. Uses mixed supervision with self-supervised objectives from pseudo 2D tracks.

Result: Extensive experiments across 3D tracking, pose estimation, pointmap reconstruction, and video depth show TrajVG surpasses current feedforward performance baselines.

Conclusion: TrajVG effectively addresses motion degradation in 3D reconstruction by making cross-frame correspondence explicit through 3D trajectory prediction and geometric consistency constraints, enabling robust performance on dynamic scenes with mixed supervision.

Abstract: Feed-forward multi-frame 3D reconstruction models often degrade on videos with object motion. Global-reference becomes ambiguous under multiple motions, while the local pointmap relies heavily on estimated relative poses and can drift, causing cross-frame misalignment and duplicated structures. We propose TrajVG, a reconstruction framework that makes cross-frame 3D correspondence an explicit prediction by estimating camera-coordinate 3D trajectories. We couple sparse trajectories, per-frame local point maps, and relative camera poses with geometric consistency objectives: (i) bidirectional trajectory-pointmap consistency with controlled gradient flow, and (ii) a pose consistency objective driven by static track anchors that suppresses gradients from dynamic regions. To scale training to in-the-wild videos where 3D trajectory labels are scarce, we reformulate the same coupling constraints into self-supervised objectives using only pseudo 2D tracks, enabling unified training with mixed supervision. Extensive experiments across 3D tracking, pose estimation, pointmap reconstruction, and video depth show that TrajVG surpasses the current feedforward performance baseline.

Abstract: Point tracking aims to follow visual points through complex motion, occlusion, and viewpoint changes, and has advanced rapidly with modern foundation models. Yet progress toward general point tracking remains constrained by limited high-quality data, as existing datasets often provide insufficient diversity and imperfect trajectory annotations. To this end, we introduce SynthVerse, a large-scale, diverse synthetic dataset specifically designed for point tracking. SynthVerse includes several new domains and object types missing from existing synthetic datasets, such as animated-film-style content, embodied manipulation, scene navigation, and articulated objects. SynthVerse substantially expands dataset diversity by covering a broader range of object categories and providing high-quality dynamic motions and interactions, enabling more robust training and evaluation for general point tracking. In addition, we establish a highly diverse point tracking benchmark to systematically evaluate state-of-the-art methods under broader domain shifts. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that training with SynthVerse yields consistent improvements in generalization and reveal limitations of existing trackers under diverse settings.

Motivation: Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for segmentation are limited by their frozen internal knowledge, making them inadequate for real-world scenarios requiring up-to-date information or domain-specific concepts.

Method: Proposes Seg-ReSearch with interleaved reasoning and external search, trained using hierarchical reward design that balances initial guidance with progressive incentives to overcome sparse outcome signals vs rigid step-wise supervision dilemma.

Result: Seg-ReSearch substantially improves state-of-the-art approaches on the new OK-VOS benchmark (requiring outside knowledge for video object segmentation) and two existing reasoning segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: Seg-ReSearch overcomes the knowledge bottleneck of existing segmentation systems by enabling external search capabilities, creating a more flexible and capable paradigm for real-world applications.

Abstract: Segmentation based on language has been a popular topic in computer vision. While recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have endowed segmentation systems with reasoning capabilities, these efforts remain confined by the frozen internal knowledge of MLLMs, which limits their potential for real-world scenarios that involve up-to-date information or domain-specific concepts. In this work, we propose \textbf{Seg-ReSearch}, a novel segmentation paradigm that overcomes the knowledge bottleneck of existing approaches. By enabling interleaved reasoning and external search, Seg-ReSearch empowers segmentation systems to handle dynamic, open-world queries that extend beyond the frozen knowledge of MLLMs. To effectively train this capability, we introduce a hierarchical reward design that harmonizes initial guidance with progressive incentives, mitigating the dilemma between sparse outcome signals and rigid step-wise supervision. For evaluation, we construct OK-VOS, a challenging benchmark that explicitly requires outside knowledge for video object segmentation. Experiments on OK-VOS and two existing reasoning segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our Seg-ReSearch improves state-of-the-art approaches by a substantial margin.

*Timothy Schaumlöffel,Arthur Aubret,Gemma Roig,Jochen Triesch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Combining central vision simulation and temporal slowness learning from human-like visual experience improves semantic object representation encoding, with central vision enhancing foreground object features and temporal slowness capturing broader semantic information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how humans develop semantic object representations from egocentric visual streams with minimal supervision, specifically investigating the roles of central vision (high-resolution foveal processing) and temporal slowness learning (learning similar representations for temporally close inputs).

Method: Simulated five months of human-like visual experience using Ego4D dataset, generated gaze coordinates with state-of-the-art gaze prediction model, extracted crops mimicking central vision, and trained a time-contrastive Self-Supervised Learning model on these crops.

Result: Combining temporal slowness and central vision improves encoding of different semantic facets of object representations. Central vision strengthens foreground object feature extraction, while temporal slowness (especially during fixational eye movements) enables encoding of broader semantic information about objects.

Conclusion: The findings provide new insights into how humans may develop semantic object representations from natural visual experience, highlighting the complementary roles of central vision processing and temporal slowness learning mechanisms.

Abstract: Humans acquire semantic object representations from egocentric visual streams with minimal supervision. Importantly, the visual system processes with high resolution only the center of its field of view and learns similar representations for visual inputs occurring close in time. This emphasizes slowly changing information around gaze locations. This study investigates the role of central vision and slowness learning in the formation of semantic object representations from human-like visual experience. We simulate five months of human-like visual experience using the Ego4D dataset and generate gaze coordinates with a state-of-the-art gaze prediction model. Using these predictions, we extract crops that mimic central vision and train a time-contrastive Self-Supervised Learning model on them. Our results show that combining temporal slowness and central vision improves the encoding of different semantic facets of object representations. Specifically, focusing on central vision strengthens the extraction of foreground object features, while considering temporal slowness, especially during fixational eye movements, allows the model to encode broader semantic information about objects. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which humans may develop semantic object representations from natural visual experience.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SALAD-Pan is a sensor-agnostic latent diffusion method for efficient pansharpening that achieves 2-3x speedup while outperforming state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based pansharpening methods operate in pixel space, suffer from high latency, and are sensor-specific, requiring separate models for different multispectral imagery.

Method: Uses band-wise single-channel VAE to encode HRMS into compact latent representations, injects spectral properties with PAN/MS images through interactive control structures, and adds lightweight cross-spectral attention to diffusion model for spectral consistency.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion methods on GaoFen-2, QuickBird, and WorldView-3 datasets, achieves 2-3x inference speedup, and demonstrates robust zero-shot cross-sensor capability.

Conclusion: SALAD-Pan provides an efficient, sensor-agnostic pansharpening solution with superior performance, faster inference, and cross-sensor generalization capability.

Abstract: Recently, diffusion models bring novel insights for Pan-sharpening and notably boost fusion precision. However, most existing models perform diffusion in the pixel space and train distinct models for different multispectral (MS) imagery, suffering from high latency and sensor-specific limitations. In this paper, we present SALAD-Pan, a sensor-agnostic latent space diffusion method for efficient pansharpening. Specifically, SALAD-Pan trains a band-wise single-channel VAE to encode high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) into compact latent representations, supporting MS images with various channel counts and establishing a basis for acceleration. Then spectral physical properties, along with PAN and MS images, are injected into the diffusion backbone through unidirectional and bidirectional interactive control structures respectively, achieving high-precision fusion in the diffusion process. Finally, a lightweight cross-spectral attention module is added to the central layer of diffusion model, reinforcing spectral connections to boost spectral consistency and further elevate fusion precision. Experimental results on GaoFen-2, QuickBird, and WorldView-3 demonstrate that SALAD-Pan outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods across all three datasets, attains a 2-3x inference speedup, and exhibits robust zero-shot (cross-sensor) capability.

*Byungwoo Jeon,Yoonwoo Jeong,Hyunseok Lee,Minsu Cho,Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VaLR is a vision-aligned latent reasoning framework that addresses progressive visual information dilution in MLLMs during long-context reasoning by generating vision-aligned latent tokens before each reasoning step.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal LLMs struggle with extensive multi-step reasoning tasks due to progressive dilution of visual information during long-context generation, which prevents them from fully exploiting test-time scaling capabilities.

Method: VaLR dynamically generates vision-aligned latent tokens before each Chain of Thought reasoning step, aligning intermediate MLLM embeddings with vision encoder embeddings to preserve visual knowledge during reasoning.

Result: VaLR consistently outperforms existing approaches across benchmarks requiring long-context understanding or precise visual perception, showing test-time scaling behavior not seen in prior MLLMs. It achieves a 19.9% improvement (33.0% to 52.9%) on VSI-Bench over Qwen2.5-VL.

Conclusion: VaLR effectively addresses the visual information dilution problem in MLLMs, enabling better multi-step reasoning through vision-aligned latent guidance and demonstrating significant performance gains on challenging benchmarks.

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on diverse understanding tasks, these models struggle to solve problems which require extensive multi-step reasoning. This is primarily due to the progressive dilution of visual information during long-context generation, which hinders their ability to fully exploit test-time scaling. To address this issue, we introduce Vision-aligned Latent Reasoning (VaLR), a simple, yet effective reasoning framework that dynamically generates vision-aligned latent tokens before each Chain of Thought reasoning step, guiding the model to reason based on perceptual cues in the latent space. Specifically, VaLR is trained to preserve visual knowledge during reasoning by aligning intermediate embeddings of MLLM with those from vision encoders. Empirical results demonstrate that VaLR consistently outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of benchmarks requiring long-context understanding or precise visual perception, while exhibiting test-time scaling behavior not observed in prior MLLMs. In particular, VaLR improves the performance significantly from 33.0% to 52.9% on VSI-Bench, achieving a 19.9%p gain over Qwen2.5-VL.

*Cem Eteke,Enzo Tartaglione*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NiFi enables extreme 3DGS compression down to 0.1MB using diffusion-based one-step distillation to restore quality at low rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS enables real-time novel view rendering but has high space requirements, limiting applications like immersive communication. While compression helps, low-rate compression introduces severe artifacts that degrade visual quality.

Method: NiFi uses artifact-aware, diffusion-based one-step distillation for extreme 3DGS compression and restoration, specifically designed to handle compression artifacts at very low bitrates.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality at extremely low rates (down to 0.1 MB), with up to 1000x rate improvement over standard 3DGS while maintaining comparable perceptual performance.

Conclusion: NiFi provides an effective solution for extreme 3DGS compression, enabling practical applications by dramatically reducing storage requirements while preserving visual quality through artifact-aware restoration.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) revolutionized novel view rendering. Instead of inferring from dense spatial points, as implicit representations do, 3DGS uses sparse Gaussians. This enables real-time performance but increases space requirements, hindering applications such as immersive communication. 3DGS compression emerged as a field aimed at alleviating this issue. While impressive progress has been made, at low rates, compression introduces artifacts that degrade visual quality significantly. We introduce NiFi, a method for extreme 3DGS compression through restoration via artifact-aware, diffusion-based one-step distillation. We show that our method achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality at extremely low rates, down to 0.1 MB, and towards 1000x rate improvement over 3DGS at comparable perceptual performance. The code will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DU-VLM is a vision-language model that understands image degradations as hierarchical structured predictions (type, parameter keys, continuous values) using autoregressive token prediction, enabling zero-shot control of diffusion models for image restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are good at qualitative description but lack understanding of the parametric physics behind image degradations, which is critical for computer vision tasks like image restoration.

Method: Redefine degradation understanding as hierarchical structured prediction (type, parameter keys, continuous values), unify under autoregressive next-token prediction with bounded error, train DU-VLM with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning using structured rewards, enable zero-shot control of pre-trained diffusion models.

Result: Significantly outperforms generalist baselines in accuracy and robustness, exhibits generalization to unseen distributions, can serve as zero-shot controller for diffusion models without fine-tuning the generative backbone.

Conclusion: DU-VLM successfully bridges the gap between qualitative degradation description and parametric physics understanding, enabling hierarchical structured prediction of degradations and practical zero-shot image restoration applications.

Abstract: Understanding visual degradations is a critical yet challenging problem in computer vision. While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at qualitative description, they often fall short in understanding the parametric physics underlying image degradations. In this work, we redefine degradation understanding as a hierarchical structured prediction task, necessitating the concurrent estimation of degradation types, parameter keys, and their continuous physical values. Although these sub-tasks operate in disparate spaces, we prove that they can be unified under one autoregressive next-token prediction paradigm, whose error is bounded by the value-space quantization grid. Building on this insight, we introduce DU-VLM, a multimodal chain-of-thought model trained with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning using structured rewards. Furthermore, we show that DU-VLM can serve as a zero-shot controller for pre-trained diffusion models, enabling high-fidelity image restoration without fine-tuning the generative backbone. We also introduce \textbf{DU-110k}, a large-scale dataset comprising 110,000 clean-degraded pairs with grounded physical annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms generalist baselines in both accuracy and robustness, exhibiting generalization to unseen distributions.

*Gabriele Magrini,Federico Becattini,Niccolò Biondi,Pietro Pala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PEPR uses event cameras as privileged information during training to make RGB models more robust to domain shifts like day-to-night changes, without requiring events at test time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB models are vulnerable to domain shifts (like lighting changes), while event cameras provide sparse but domain-invariant information. The challenge is to leverage event data during training to improve RGB model robustness without losing semantic richness.

Method: Privileged Event-based Predictive Regularization (PEPR) - reframes Learning Using Privileged Information as a predictive problem in shared latent space. Instead of direct feature alignment, trains RGB encoder to predict event-based latent features, distilling robustness while preserving semantic detail.

Result: The standalone RGB model shows improved robustness to domain shifts (day-to-night and others), outperforming alignment-based baselines on object detection and semantic segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: PEPR effectively leverages event camera data as privileged information to train more robust RGB models that maintain semantic richness while being resilient to domain shifts, without requiring event data at inference time.

Abstract: Deep neural networks for visual perception are highly susceptible to domain shift, which poses a critical challenge for real-world deployment under conditions that differ from the training data. To address this domain generalization challenge, we propose a cross-modal framework under the learning using privileged information (LUPI) paradigm for training a robust, single-modality RGB model. We leverage event cameras as a source of privileged information, available only during training. The two modalities exhibit complementary characteristics: the RGB stream is semantically dense but domain-dependent, whereas the event stream is sparse yet more domain-invariant. Direct feature alignment between them is therefore suboptimal, as it forces the RGB encoder to mimic the sparse event representation, thereby losing semantic detail. To overcome this, we introduce Privileged Event-based Predictive Regularization (PEPR), which reframes LUPI as a predictive problem in a shared latent space. Instead of enforcing direct cross-modal alignment, we train the RGB encoder with PEPR to predict event-based latent features, distilling robustness without sacrificing semantic richness. The resulting standalone RGB model consistently improves robustness to day-to-night and other domain shifts, outperforming alignment-based baselines across object detection and semantic segmentation.

Method: Proposes SalFormer360 using transformer architecture: fine-tuned SegFormer encoder for 360-degree content + custom decoder + viewing center bias to model user attention patterns in 360-degree environments.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three largest benchmark datasets: 8.4% higher PCC on Sport360, 2.5% on PVS-HM, and 18.6% on VR-EyeTracking compared to previous best methods.

Abstract: Saliency estimation has received growing attention in recent years due to its importance in a wide range of applications. In the context of 360-degree video, it has been particularly valuable for tasks such as viewport prediction and immersive content optimization. In this paper, we propose SalFormer360, a novel saliency estimation model for 360-degree videos built on a transformer-based architecture. Our approach is based on the combination of an existing encoder architecture, SegFormer, and a custom decoder. The SegFormer model was originally developed for 2D segmentation tasks, and it has been fine-tuned to adapt it to 360-degree content. To further enhance prediction accuracy in our model, we incorporated Viewing Center Bias to reflect user attention in 360-degree environments. Extensive experiments on the three largest benchmark datasets for saliency estimation demonstrate that SalFormer360 outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. In terms of Pearson Correlation Coefficient, our model achieves 8.4% higher performance on Sport360, 2.5% on PVS-HM, and 18.6% on VR-EyeTracking compared to previous state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: ImmuVis is positioned as a practical, efficient foundation model for real-world IMC modeling that addresses the fundamental challenge of variable marker sets in multiplex imaging.

Abstract: We present ImmuVis, an efficient convolutional foundation model for imaging mass cytometry (IMC), a high-throughput multiplex imaging technology that handles molecular marker measurements as image channels and enables large-scale spatial tissue profiling. Unlike natural images, multiplex imaging lacks a fixed channel space, as real-world marker sets vary across studies, violating a core assumption of standard vision backbones. To address this, ImmuVis introduces marker-adaptive hyperconvolutions that generate convolutional kernels from learned marker embeddings, enabling a single model to operate on arbitrary measured marker subsets without retraining. We pretrain ImmuVis on the largest to-date dataset, IMC17M (28 cohorts, 24,405 images, 265 markers, over 17M patches), using self-supervised masked reconstruction. ImmuVis outperforms SOTA baselines and ablations in virtual staining and downstream classification tasks at substantially lower compute cost than transformer-based alternatives, and is the sole model that provides calibrated uncertainty via a heteroscedastic likelihood objective. These results position ImmuVis as a practical, efficient foundation model for real-world IMC modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PIO-FVLM is a training-free method that accelerates vision-language models by compressing visual tokens based on their importance to preserving output results, achieving significant speedups with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual token compression methods rely on heuristics based on similarity metrics, which have limitations in compression performance and practical deployment. The authors aim to develop a more effective approach from the perspective of inference objectives.

Method: PIO-FVLM transforms visual token compression into preserving output result invariance. It reorders vision tokens using token-level gradient saliency from a layer-local proxy loss, then selects the most valuable tokens following non-maximum suppression (NMS) principles. The method is training-free, compatible with FlashAttention, and can be used as encoder-free or combined with encoder compression approaches.

Result: On LLaVA-Next-7B, PIO-FVLM retains only 11.1% of visual tokens while maintaining 97.2% of original performance, achieving 2.67× prefill speedup, 2.11× inference speedup, 6.22× lower FLOPs, and 6.05× reduced KV Cache overhead.

Conclusion: PIO-FVLM provides an effective, training-free approach to accelerate vision-language model inference by compressing visual tokens based on their importance to output preservation, offering significant speed improvements with minimal performance degradation.

Abstract: Recently, reducing redundant visual tokens in vision-language models (VLMs) to accelerate VLM inference has emerged as a hot topic. However, most existing methods rely on heuristics constructed based on inter-visual-token similarity or cross-modal visual-text similarity, which gives rise to certain limitations in compression performance and practical deployment. In contrast, we propose PIO-FVLM from the perspective of inference objectives, which transforms visual token compression into preserving output result invariance and selects tokens primarily by their importance to this goal. Specially, vision tokens are reordered with the guidance of token-level gradient saliency generated by our designed layer-local proxy loss, a coarse constraint from the current layer to the final result. Then the most valuable vision tokens are selected following the non-maximum suppression (NMS) principle. The proposed PIO-FVLM is training-free and compatible with FlashAttention, friendly to practical application and deployment. It can be deployed independently as an encoder-free method, or combined with encoder compression approaches like VisionZip for use as an encoder-involved method. On LLaVA-Next-7B, PIO-FVLM retains just 11.1% of visual tokens but maintains 97.2% of the original performance, with a 2.67$\times$ prefill speedup, 2.11$\times$ inference speedup, 6.22$\times$ lower FLOPs, and 6.05$\times$ reduced KV Cache overhead.

Motivation: VLMs show strong zero-shot performance but remain unexplored for space applications where manual annotation is challenging due to low visibility, illumination variations, and object blending with planetary backgrounds.

Method: 1) Automatically generate pseudo-labels for small subset of unlabeled real data using pre-trained VLM; 2) Use teacher-student label distillation framework to train lightweight models; 3) Despite noisy pseudo-labels, distillation process improves performance over direct zero-shot VLM inference.

Result: Experimental evaluations on SPARK-2024, SPEED+, and TANGO datasets show consistent improvements in average precision (AP) by up to 10 points for segmentation tasks compared to direct zero-shot VLM inference.

Conclusion: Proposed annotation-free pipeline effectively leverages VLMs for space target detection/segmentation without manual labeling, demonstrating significant performance gains through pseudo-label distillation despite label noise.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in open-world zero-shot visual recognition. However, their potential in space-related applications remains largely unexplored. In the space domain, accurate manual annotation is particularly challenging due to factors such as low visibility, illumination variations, and object blending with planetary backgrounds. Developing methods that can detect and segment spacecraft and orbital targets without requiring extensive manual labeling is therefore of critical importance. In this work, we propose an annotation-free detection and segmentation pipeline for space targets using VLMs. Our approach begins by automatically generating pseudo-labels for a small subset of unlabeled real data with a pre-trained VLM. These pseudo-labels are then leveraged in a teacher-student label distillation framework to train lightweight models. Despite the inherent noise in the pseudo-labels, the distillation process leads to substantial performance gains over direct zero-shot VLM inference. Experimental evaluations on the SPARK-2024, SPEED+, and TANGO datasets on segmentation tasks demonstrate consistent improvements in average precision (AP) by up to 10 points.

*Gonçalo P. Matos,Carlos Santiago,João P. Costeira,Ricardo L. Saldanha,Ernesto M. Morgado*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method using 3D centroid constellations to match and track individual fruits across time in orchards, enabling growth monitoring and autonomous navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual fruit tracking for growth monitoring is labor-intensive and non-scalable. Existing computer vision approaches fail to reliably match the same fruits across different time points due to camera position changes, non-rigidity, occlusions, and lack of distinct visual features.

Method: Proposes a new paradigm using constellations of 3D centroids with a novel descriptor for very sparse 3D point clouds. Instead of matching individual fruits, the method matches entire constellations of fruit positions, which handles non-rigidity, occlusions, and challenging imagery better.

Result: The method successfully matches fruits across videos and through time. It also enables building orchard maps and determining camera pose in 6DoF, supporting autonomous robot navigation and selective fruit picking.

Conclusion: The constellation-based approach provides a robust solution for fruit tracking across time, overcoming limitations of previous methods and enabling practical applications in precision agriculture including growth monitoring and autonomous operations.

Abstract: Following crop growth through the vegetative cycle allows farmers to predict fruit setting and yield in early stages, but it is a laborious and non-scalable task if performed by a human who has to manually measure fruit sizes with a caliper or dendrometers. In recent years, computer vision has been used to automate several tasks in precision agriculture, such as detecting and counting fruits, and estimating their size. However, the fundamental problem of matching the exact same fruits from one video, collected on a given date, to the fruits visible in another video, collected on a later date, which is needed to track fruits' growth through time, remains to be solved. Few attempts were made, but they either assume that the camera always starts from the same known position and that there are sufficiently distinct features to match, or they used other sources of data like GPS. Here we propose a new paradigm to tackle this problem, based on constellations of 3D centroids, and introduce a descriptor for very sparse 3D point clouds that can be used to match fruits across videos. Matching constellations instead of individual fruits is key to deal with non-rigidity, occlusions and challenging imagery with few distinct visual features to track. The results show that the proposed method can be successfully used to match fruits across videos and through time, and also to build an orchard map and later use it to locate the camera pose in 6DoF, thus providing a method for autonomous navigation of robots in the orchard and for selective fruit picking, for example.

TL;DR: A prompt-controlled diffusion framework generates synthetic remote-sensing images with controlled class ratios and domains to address long-tailed pixel imbalance in semantic segmentation datasets like LoveDA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote-sensing imagery suffers from severe long-tailed pixel imbalance, especially in datasets like LoveDA which has Urban/Rural splits with distinct appearances and inconsistent class-frequency statistics across domains.

Method: Two-stage framework: Stage A uses domain-aware, masked ratio-conditioned discrete diffusion to generate layouts with controlled class ratios; Stage B translates layouts into photorealistic images using Stable Diffusion with ControlNet guidance.

Result: Mixing synthetic ratio and domain-controlled pairs with real data yields consistent improvements across multiple segmentation backbones, with gains concentrated on minority classes and improved Urban/Rural generalization.

Conclusion: Controllable augmentation via diffusion models is a practical mechanism to mitigate long-tail bias in remote-sensing segmentation, enabling better handling of class imbalance and domain differences.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote-sensing imagery is critical for urban mapping and land-cover monitoring, yet training data typically exhibits severe long-tailed pixel imbalance. In the dataset LoveDA, this challenge is compounded by an explicit Urban/Rural split with distinct appearance and inconsistent class-frequency statistics across domains. We present a prompt-controlled diffusion augmentation framework that synthesizes paired label--image samples with explicit control of both domain and semantic composition. Stage~A uses a domain-aware, masked ratio-conditioned discrete diffusion model to generate layouts that satisfy user-specified class-ratio targets while respecting learned co-occurrence structure. Stage~B translates layouts into photorealistic, domain-consistent images using Stable Diffusion with ControlNet guidance. Mixing the resulting ratio and domain-controlled synthetic pairs with real data yields consistent improvements across multiple segmentation backbones, with gains concentrated on minority classes and improved Urban and Rural generalization, demonstrating controllable augmentation as a practical mechanism to mitigate long-tail bias in remote-sensing segmentation.

### [82] [Light Forcing: Accelerating Autoregressive Video Diffusion via Sparse Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04789)
*Chengtao Lv,Yumeng Shi,Yushi Huang,Ruihao Gong,Shen Ren,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Light Forcing is a sparse attention solution for autoregressive video generation that addresses quadratic complexity bottlenecks through chunk-aware growth and hierarchical sparse attention, achieving better quality and efficiency than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sparse attention solutions for bidirectional models don't work well for autoregressive video generation due to isolated chunk consideration and insufficient use of past context, leading to performance degradation.

Method: Proposes Light Forcing with two key components: 1) Chunk-Aware Growth mechanism that quantitatively estimates chunk contributions to determine sparsity allocation, enabling progressive sparsity increase and knowledge inheritance; 2) Hierarchical Sparse Attention with frame and block level mask selection to capture historical and local context in coarse-to-fine manner.

Result: Outperforms existing sparse attention in quality (84.5 on VBench) and efficiency (1.2-1.3× end-to-end speedup). Combined with FP8 quantization and LightVAE, achieves 2.3× speedup and 19.7 FPS on RTX 5090 GPU.

Conclusion: Light Forcing is the first sparse attention solution specifically designed for autoregressive video generation models, effectively addressing attention complexity bottlenecks while maintaining quality through adaptive chunk-aware and hierarchical attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Advanced autoregressive (AR) video generation models have improved visual fidelity and interactivity, but the quadratic complexity of attention remains a primary bottleneck for efficient deployment. While existing sparse attention solutions have shown promise on bidirectional models, we identify that applying these solutions to AR models leads to considerable performance degradation for two reasons: isolated consideration of chunk generation and insufficient utilization of past informative context. Motivated by these observations, we propose \textsc{Light Forcing}, the \textit{first} sparse attention solution tailored for AR video generation models. It incorporates a \textit{Chunk-Aware Growth} mechanism to quantitatively estimate the contribution of each chunk, which determines their sparsity allocation. This progressive sparsity increase strategy enables the current chunk to inherit prior knowledge in earlier chunks during generation. Additionally, we introduce a \textit{Hierarchical Sparse Attention} to capture informative historical and local context in a coarse-to-fine manner. Such two-level mask selection strategy (\ie, frame and block level) can adaptively handle diverse attention patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing sparse attention in quality (\eg, 84.5 on VBench) and efficiency (\eg, $1.2{\sim}1.3\times$ end-to-end speedup). Combined with FP8 quantization and LightVAE, \textsc{Light Forcing} further achieves a $2.3\times$ speedup and 19.7\,FPS on an RTX~5090 GPU. Code will be released at \href{https://github.com/chengtao-lv/LightForcing}{https://github.com/chengtao-lv/LightForcing}.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs struggle with visualized text in images despite performing well on pure-text queries, revealing a significant modality gap that VISTA-Bench systematically evaluates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs are benchmarked primarily on pure-text queries, but real-world scenarios often contain visualized text embedded in images. The paper aims to assess whether VLMs handle visualized text comparably to pure text, addressing a gap in existing evaluation frameworks.

Method: Introduces VISTA-Bench, a systematic benchmark spanning multimodal perception, reasoning, and unimodal understanding domains. It evaluates visualized text understanding by comparing model performance on pure-text versus visualized-text questions under controlled rendering conditions, testing over 20 representative VLMs.

Result: Extensive evaluation reveals a pronounced modality gap: models performing well on pure-text queries degrade substantially when equivalent semantic content is presented as visualized text. This gap amplifies with increased perceptual difficulty, showing sensitivity to rendering variations despite unchanged semantics.

Conclusion: VISTA-Bench provides a principled framework to diagnose VLMs' limitations in handling visualized text and guides progress toward more unified language representations across tokenized text and pixels. The benchmark highlights the need for improved cross-modal understanding capabilities in VLMs.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in cross-modal understanding across textual and visual inputs, yet existing benchmarks predominantly focus on pure-text queries. In real-world scenarios, language also frequently appears as visualized text embedded in images, raising the question of whether current VLMs handle such input requests comparably. We introduce VISTA-Bench, a systematic benchmark from multimodal perception, reasoning, to unimodal understanding domains. It evaluates visualized text understanding by contrasting pure-text and visualized-text questions under controlled rendering conditions. Extensive evaluation of over 20 representative VLMs reveals a pronounced modality gap: models that perform well on pure-text queries often degrade substantially when equivalent semantic content is presented as visualized text. This gap is further amplified by increased perceptual difficulty, highlighting sensitivity to rendering variations despite unchanged semantics. Overall, VISTA-Bench provides a principled evaluation framework to diagnose this limitation and to guide progress toward more unified language representations across tokenized text and pixels.

*Ronghuan Wu,Wanchao Su,Kede Ma,Jing Liao,Rafał K. Mantiuk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Existing LDR diffusion models can be adapted to HDR generation without retraining by using perceptually uniform encodings (PU21/PQ) to bridge the statistical gap between linear RGB HDR and sRGB LDR data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HDR formats and displays are becoming prevalent, but state-of-the-art image generators (like Stable Diffusion and FLUX) are limited to LDR output due to lack of large-scale HDR training data. There's a need to adapt existing models to HDR generation without expensive retraining.

Method: Use perceptually uniform encodings (PU21 or PQ) to convert HDR inputs, bridging the statistical gap between linear RGB HDR and sRGB LDR. Freeze the pretrained VAE and finetune only the denoiser via low-rank adaptation in perceptually uniform space. This enables both text-to-HDR synthesis and single-image RAW-to-HDR reconstruction.

Result: LDR-pretrained VAEs reconstruct PU21-encoded HDR inputs with fidelity comparable to LDR data, while linear RGB inputs cause severe degradations. The adaptation method consistently improves perceptual fidelity, text-image alignment, and effective dynamic range compared to previous techniques.

Conclusion: Existing diffusion models can be efficiently adapted to HDR generation by working in perceptually uniform space, avoiding expensive retraining while achieving high-quality HDR results for both text-to-image synthesis and RAW reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: High-dynamic-range (HDR) formats and displays are becoming increasingly prevalent, yet state-of-the-art image generators (e.g., Stable Diffusion and FLUX) typically remain limited to low-dynamic-range (LDR) output due to the lack of large-scale HDR training data. In this work, we show that existing pretrained diffusion models can be easily adapted to HDR generation without retraining from scratch. A key challenge is that HDR images are natively represented in linear RGB, whose intensity and color statistics differ substantially from those of sRGB-encoded LDR images. This gap, however, can be effectively bridged by converting HDR inputs into perceptually uniform encodings (e.g., using PU21 or PQ). Empirically, we find that LDR-pretrained variational autoencoders (VAEs) reconstruct PU21-encoded HDR inputs with fidelity comparable to LDR data, whereas linear RGB inputs cause severe degradations. Motivated by this finding, we describe an efficient adaptation strategy that freezes the VAE and finetunes only the denoiser via low-rank adaptation in a perceptually uniform space. This results in a unified computational method that supports both text-to-HDR synthesis and single-image RAW-to-HDR reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate that our perceptually encoded adaptation consistently improves perceptual fidelity, text-image alignment, and effective dynamic range, relative to previous techniques.

TL;DR: XtraLight-MedMamba: Ultra-lightweight state-space deep learning framework for classifying precancerous colon polyps from whole-slide images, achieving 97.18% accuracy with only ~32K parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current risk stratification of precancerous colon polyps relies on subjective histopathologic interpretation, which is limited for low-grade dysplasia assessment. Digital pathology and deep learning offer opportunities to identify subtle morphological patterns associated with malignant progression that are imperceptible to human observers.

Method: XtraLight-MedMamba combines ConvNext-based shallow feature extraction with parallel vision mamba to model long- and short-range dependencies. Includes Spatial and Channel Attention Bridge (SCAB) for multiscale feature extraction and Fixed Non-Negative Orthogonal Classifier (FNOClassifier) for parameter reduction and improved generalization.

Result: Achieved 97.18% accuracy and 0.9767 F1-score using only ~32,000 parameters on a curated dataset of low-grade tubular adenomas stratified by subsequent CRC development. Outperformed transformer-based and conventional Mamba architectures with significantly higher model complexity.

Conclusion: The ultra-lightweight XtraLight-MedMamba framework demonstrates superior performance in classifying neoplastic tubular adenomas from whole-slide images, offering an efficient solution for CRC risk stratification with minimal computational requirements.

Abstract: Accurate risk stratification of precancerous polyps during routine colonoscopy screenings is essential for lowering the risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). However, assessment of low-grade dysplasia remains limited by subjective histopathologic interpretation. Advancements in digital pathology and deep learning provide new opportunities to identify subtle and fine morphologic patterns associated with malignant progression that may be imperceptible to the human eye. In this work, we propose XtraLight-MedMamba, an ultra-lightweight state-space-based deep learning framework for classifying neoplastic tubular adenomas from whole-slide images (WSIs). The architecture is a blend of ConvNext based shallow feature extractor with parallel vision mamba to efficiently model both long- and short-range dependencies and image generalization. An integration of Spatial and Channel Attention Bridge (SCAB) module enhances multiscale feature extraction, while Fixed Non-Negative Orthogonal Classifier (FNOClassifier) enables substantial parameter reduction and improved generalization. The model was evaluated on a curated dataset acquired from patients with low-grade tubular adenomas, stratified into case and control cohorts based on subsequent CRC development. XtraLight-MedMamba achieved an accuracy of 97.18% and an F1-score of 0.9767 using approximately 32,000 parameters, outperforming transformer-based and conventional Mamba architectures with significantly higher model complexity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LitS is a novel neighborhood descriptor for 2D/3D point clouds that uses piecewise constant functions on the unit circle to track surrounding points in different directions, providing local geometric information that can be aggregated for global structural understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the advancement of 3D scanning technologies, point clouds have become fundamental for representing 3D spatial data, but practical analysis depends crucially on available neighborhood descriptors to accurately characterize local geometries of point clouds.

Method: LitS are piecewise constant functions on the unit circle where each domain element represents a direction in a local reference system. Evaluating LitS at any direction gives information about the number of neighbors in a cone-like region centered around that direction. LitS comes in two versions (regular and cumulative) with two parameters to adapt to various contexts and point cloud types.

Result: LitS is a versatile neighborhood descriptor capable of capturing nuances of local point arrangements and resilient to common point cloud data issues such as variable density and noise. It conveys rich information about local neighborhoods that can be leveraged for global structural understanding by analyzing how LitS changes between close points.

Conclusion: LitS provides a robust and adaptable neighborhood descriptor for point clouds that addresses key challenges in point cloud analysis, offering a foundation for improved understanding of both local geometries and global structures in 2D and 3D spatial data.

Abstract: With the advancement of 3D scanning technologies, point clouds have become fundamental for representing 3D spatial data, with applications that span across various scientific and technological fields. Practical analysis of this data depends crucially on available neighborhood descriptors to accurately characterize the local geometries of the point cloud. This paper introduces LitS, a novel neighborhood descriptor for 2D and 3D point clouds. LitS are piecewise constant functions on the unit circle that allow points to keep track of their surroundings. Each element in LitS' domain represents a direction with respect to a local reference system. Once constructed, evaluating LitS at any given direction gives us information about the number of neighbors in a cone-like region centered around that same direction. Thus, LitS conveys a lot of information about the local neighborhood of a point, which can be leveraged to gain global structural understanding by analyzing how LitS changes between close points. In addition, LitS comes in two versions ('regular' and 'cumulative') and has two parameters, allowing them to adapt to various contexts and types of point clouds. Overall, they are a versatile neighborhood descriptor, capable of capturing the nuances of local point arrangements and resilient to common point cloud data issues such as variable density and noise.

*Soumya Jahagirdar,Walid Bousselham,Anna Kukleva,Hilde Kuehne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mask-LLaVA is a token-efficient autoregressive VLM that combines multi-level visual features (mask-based object tokens, global tokens, local patches) to reduce inference compute while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autoregressive VLMs use many visual tokens, increasing computational cost at inference time. There's a need for compact yet information-rich visual representations to reduce compute requirements.

Method: Proposes Mask-LLaVA framework combining mask-based object representations with global tokens and local patch tokens. Uses all tokens during training but allows flexible dropping of mask-based object tokens at test time for adaptive token reduction.

Result: Achieves competitive results to token-efficient methods and comparable performance to original LLaVA baseline using only a fraction of visual tokens. Enables dynamic token selection at test time without significant performance drop.

Conclusion: Combining multi-level visual features enables efficient learning with fewer tokens while allowing flexible token reduction at inference, addressing the compute bottleneck in autoregressive VLMs.

Abstract: Current autoregressive Vision Language Models (VLMs) usually rely on a large number of visual tokens to represent images, resulting in a need for more compute especially at inference time. To address this problem, we propose Mask-LLaVA, a framework that leverages different levels of visual features to create a compact yet information-rich visual representation for autoregressive VLMs. Namely, we combine mask-based object representations together with global tokens and local patch tokens. While all tokens are used during training, it shows that the resulting model can flexibly drop especially the number of mask-based object-tokens at test time, allowing to adapt the number of tokens during inference without the need to retrain the model and without a significant drop in performance. We evaluate the proposed approach on a suite of standard benchmarks showing results competitive to current token efficient methods and comparable to the original LLaVA baseline using only a fraction of visual tokens. Our analysis demonstrates that combining multi-level features enables efficient learning with fewer tokens while allowing dynamic token selection at test time for good performance.

TL;DR: FlatDINO compresses DINOv2 patch features into 32 continuous tokens (8x sequence reduction, 48x dimensionality compression) for more efficient diffusion-based image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense patch grids from SSL encoders like DINOv2 contain significant redundancy, making diffusion models needlessly expensive to train and run.

Method: Introduces FlatDINO, a variational autoencoder that compresses DINOv2 patch representations into a 1D sequence of just 32 continuous tokens.

Result: On ImageNet 256x256, DiT-XL trained on FlatDINO latents achieves gFID 1.80 with classifier-free guidance while requiring 8x fewer FLOPs per forward pass and up to 4.5x fewer FLOPs per training step.

Conclusion: FlatDINO enables efficient diffusion-based image generation by dramatically compressing SSL patch features while maintaining quality, though results are preliminary and work is ongoing.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that diffusion models can generate high-quality images by operating directly on SSL patch features rather than pixel-space latents. However, the dense patch grids from encoders like DINOv2 contain significant redundancy, making diffusion needlessly expensive. We introduce FlatDINO, a variational autoencoder that compresses this representation into a one-dimensional sequence of just 32 continuous tokens -an 8x reduction in sequence length and 48x compression in total dimensionality. On ImageNet 256x256, a DiT-XL trained on FlatDINO latents achieves a gFID of 1.80 with classifier-free guidance while requiring 8x fewer FLOPs per forward pass and up to 4.5x fewer FLOPs per training step compared to diffusion on uncompressed DINOv2 features. These are preliminary results and this work is in progress.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail at long-horizon 4D scene generation from single images because they decouple physical state from visual representation, preventing generative refinements from updating underlying physics for subsequent interactions.

Method: Introduces a true closed-loop system with a novel unified representation that creates a bidirectional link between physical state and visual primitives, allowing generative refinements to correct both dynamics and appearance. Also includes a robust update mechanism that gathers supervision from multiple viewpoints to resolve optimization ambiguity.

Result: Experiments show that from a single image, PerpetualWonder can successfully simulate complex, multi-step interactions from long-horizon actions while maintaining physical plausibility and visual consistency.

Conclusion: PerpetualWonder enables effective long-horizon, action-conditioned 4D scene generation from single images by solving the physical-visual decoupling problem through a closed-loop system with unified representation.

Abstract: We introduce PerpetualWonder, a hybrid generative simulator that enables long-horizon, action-conditioned 4D scene generation from a single image.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dense point trackers rely on cost volumes with quadratic complexity, limiting scalability and efficiency. There's a need for more efficient approaches that can handle dense point tracking without computational bottlenecks.

Method: Proposes WarpTrack, which uses warping instead of cost volumes - iteratively refines track estimates by warping features from target to query frame based on current estimates. Combines this with a transformer architecture for joint spatiotemporal reasoning across all tracks.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on TAP-Vid-DAVIS, TAP-Vid-Kinetics, and Robo-TAP benchmarks. Remarkably, also excels at optical flow, sometimes outperforming specialized methods on Sintel, KITTI, and Spring benchmarks.

Conclusion: Warping-based architectures can unify dense point tracking and optical flow estimation, offering a simpler, more efficient alternative to cost volume approaches while maintaining or exceeding SOTA performance.

Abstract: Dense point tracking is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with applications ranging from video analysis to robotic manipulation. State-of-the-art trackers typically rely on cost volumes to match features across frames, but this approach incurs quadratic complexity in spatial resolution, limiting scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose \method, a novel dense point tracker that eschews cost volumes in favor of warping. Inspired by recent advances in optical flow, our approach iteratively refines track estimates by warping features from the target frame to the query frame based on the current estimate. Combined with a transformer architecture that performs joint spatiotemporal reasoning across all tracks, our design establishes long-range correspondences without computing feature correlations. Our model is simple and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard dense point tracking benchmarks, including TAP-Vid-DAVIS, TAP-Vid-Kinetics, and Robo-TAP. Remarkably, the model also excels at optical flow, sometimes outperforming specialized methods on the Sintel, KITTI, and Spring benchmarks. These results suggest that warping-based architectures can unify dense point tracking and optical flow estimation.

*Erik Goh,John Kos,Ashok Goel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TMK framework improves LLM reasoning on planning tasks, achieving 97.3% accuracy on symbolic tasks where previous methods failed (31.5%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with reasoning and planning tasks, and existing prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought have limitations. The Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) framework from cognitive science offers explicit representations of what, how, and why actions are taken, potentially addressing LLM reasoning deficiencies.

Method: Applied TMK framework to LLM prompting, evaluating on PlanBench benchmark with Blocksworld domain. TMK provides explicit task decomposition with causal, teleological, and hierarchical reasoning structures, helping models decompose complex planning problems into manageable sub-tasks.

Result: TMK prompting enabled reasoning models to achieve 97.3% accuracy on opaque symbolic tasks (Random Blocksworld) where they previously failed (31.5%). Shows significant performance inversion and bridges gap between semantic approximation and symbolic manipulation.

Conclusion: TMK functions not just as context but as a mechanism that steers reasoning models away from default linguistic modes toward formal, code-execution pathways, demonstrating potential to significantly improve LLM reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) can struggle with reasoning ability and planning tasks. Many prompting techniques have been developed to assist with LLM reasoning, notably Chain-of-Thought (CoT); however, these techniques, too, have come under scrutiny as LLMs' ability to reason at all has come into question. Borrowing from the domain of cognitive and educational science, this paper investigates whether the Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) framework can improve LLM reasoning capabilities beyond its previously demonstrated success in educational applications. The TMK framework's unique ability to capture causal, teleological, and hierarchical reasoning structures, combined with its explicit task decomposition mechanisms, makes it particularly well-suited for addressing language model reasoning deficiencies, and unlike other hierarchical frameworks such as HTN and BDI, TMK provides explicit representations of not just what to do and how to do it, but also why actions are taken. The study evaluates TMK by experimenting on the PlanBench benchmark, focusing on the Blocksworld domain to test for reasoning and planning capabilities, examining whether TMK-structured prompting can help language models better decompose complex planning problems into manageable sub-tasks. Results also highlight significant performance inversion in reasoning models. TMK prompting enables the reasoning model to achieve up to an accuracy of 97.3\% on opaque, symbolic tasks (Random versions of Blocksworld in PlanBench) where it previously failed (31.5\%), suggesting the potential to bridge the gap between semantic approximation and symbolic manipulation. Our findings suggest that TMK functions not merely as context, but also as a mechanism that steers reasoning models away from their default linguistic modes to engage formal, code-execution pathways in the context of the experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent LLM systems for mathematical reasoning lack reliably revisable representations, operate in rigid sequential pipelines that can't correct earlier steps, rely on unreliable heuristic self-evaluation, and programmatic context can distract language models and degrade accuracy.

Method: Iteratively Improved Program Construction (IIPC) - a reasoning method that iteratively refines programmatic reasoning chains and combines execution feedback with the native Chain-of-Thought abilities of the base LLM to maintain high-level contextual focus.

Result: IIPC surpasses competing approaches in the majority of reasoning benchmarks on multiple base LLMs.

Conclusion: IIPC provides an effective approach to improving mathematical reasoning in LLMs by enabling iterative refinement of programmatic reasoning with execution feedback while maintaining contextual focus, with all code released as open source.

Abstract: Mathematical problem solving is a fundamental benchmark for assessing the reasoning capabilities of artificial intelligence and a gateway to applications in education, science, and engineering where reliable symbolic reasoning is essential. Although recent advances in multi-agent LLM-based systems have enhanced their mathematical reasoning capabilities, they still lack a reliably revisable representation of the reasoning process. Existing agents either operate in rigid sequential pipelines that cannot correct earlier steps or rely on heuristic self-evaluation that can fail to identify and fix errors. In addition, programmatic context can distract language models and degrade accuracy. To address these gaps, we introduce Iteratively Improved Program Construction (IIPC), a reasoning method that iteratively refines programmatic reasoning chains and combines execution feedback with the native Chain-of-thought abilities of the base LLM to maintain high-level contextual focus. IIPC surpasses competing approaches in the majority of reasoning benchmarks on multiple base LLMs. All code and implementations are released as open source.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM multi-agent systems achieve superior reasoning through iterative debate but suffer from high computational costs and error propagation during deployment, limiting practical applications.

Method: Proposes AgentArk framework with three hierarchical distillation strategies: reasoning-enhanced fine-tuning, trajectory-based augmentation, and process-aware distillation to transform multi-agent interactions into implicit model capabilities.

Result: Distilled models preserve single-agent efficiency while exhibiting strong reasoning and self-correction performance of multiple agents, with enhanced robustness and generalization across diverse reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: AgentArk enables efficient and robust multi-agent development by shifting computational burden from inference to training, providing a promising direction for practical deployment of multi-agent intelligence.

Abstract: While large language model (LLM) multi-agent systems achieve superior reasoning performance through iterative debate, practical deployment is limited by their high computational cost and error propagation. This paper proposes AgentArk, a novel framework to distill multi-agent dynamics into the weights of a single model, effectively transforming explicit test-time interactions into implicit model capabilities. This equips a single agent with the intelligence of multi-agent systems while remaining computationally efficient. Specifically, we investigate three hierarchical distillation strategies across various models, tasks, scaling, and scenarios: reasoning-enhanced fine-tuning; trajectory-based augmentation; and process-aware distillation. By shifting the burden of computation from inference to training, the distilled models preserve the efficiency of one agent while exhibiting strong reasoning and self-correction performance of multiple agents. They further demonstrate enhanced robustness and generalization across diverse reasoning tasks. We hope this work can shed light on future research on efficient and robust multi-agent development.

*Shuhui Qu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AEC is an epistemic-categorical planning approach that separates grounded facts from beliefs, using environment queries for high uncertainty and model predictions for filtering, with strict feasibility checks to prevent prediction errors from causing infeasible commitments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Planning in partially observable environments is challenging because task-critical preconditions may be unknown, and grounding them through interaction is costly. While learned world models can predict missing facts cheaply, prediction errors can silently lead to infeasible commitments.

Method: Active Epistemic Control (AEC) maintains separate grounded fact store (for commitment) and belief store (for pruning candidate plans). It dynamically chooses between querying the environment to ground unresolved predicates when uncertainty is high, or simulating predicates to filter hypotheses when confidence is sufficient. Final commitment is gated by grounded precondition coverage and SQ-BCP pullback-style compatibility checks.

Result: Experiments on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld show that AEC achieves competitive success with fewer replanning rounds than strong LLM-agent baselines.

Conclusion: AEC provides an effective epistemic-categorical planning layer that integrates model-based belief management with categorical feasibility checks, preventing prediction errors from directly certifying feasibility while maintaining efficiency through intelligent use of environment queries and model predictions.

Abstract: Planning in interactive environments is challenging under partial observability: task-critical preconditions (e.g., object locations or container states) may be unknown at decision time, yet grounding them through interaction is costly. Learned world models can cheaply predict missing facts, but prediction errors can silently induce infeasible commitments. We present \textbf{Active Epistemic Control (AEC)}, an epistemic-categorical planning layer that integrates model-based belief management with categorical feasibility checks. AEC maintains a strict separation between a \emph{grounded fact store} used for commitment and a \emph{belief store} used only for pruning candidate plans. At each step, it either queries the environment to ground an unresolved predicate when uncertainty is high or predictions are ambiguous, or simulates the predicate to filter hypotheses when confidence is sufficient. Final commitment is gated by grounded precondition coverage and an SQ-BCP pullback-style compatibility check, so simulated beliefs affect efficiency but cannot directly certify feasibility. Experiments on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld show that AEC achieves competitive success with fewer replanning rounds than strong LLM-agent baselines.

Motivation: Test-time computation in LLM reasoning is bottlenecked by expensive verification, with many verifier calls wasted on redundant or unpromising intermediate hypotheses.

Method: State-level selective verification framework with: (1) deterministic feasibility gating over structured move interface, (2) pre-verification ranking using hybrid learned state-distance and residual scoring, and (3) adaptive allocation of verifier calls based on local uncertainty.

Result: Achieves higher accuracy than best-of-N, majority voting, and beam search while using 44% fewer verifier calls on the MATH benchmark.

Conclusion: Selective verification at the state level, rather than solution-level or uniform intermediate verification, optimally distributes verification effort where it's most informative, significantly reducing computational costs while improving reasoning performance.

Abstract: Test-time computation has become a primary driver of progress in large language model (LLM) reasoning, but it is increasingly bottlenecked by expensive verification. In many reasoning systems, a large fraction of verifier calls are spent on redundant or unpromising intermediate hypotheses. We study reasoning under a \emph{verification-cost-limited} setting and ask how verification effort should be allocated across intermediate states. We propose a state-level selective verification framework that combines (i) deterministic feasibility gating over a structured move interface, (ii) pre-verification ranking using a hybrid of learned state-distance and residual scoring, and (iii) adaptive allocation of verifier calls based on local uncertainty. Unlike solution-level best-of-$N$ or uniform intermediate verification, our method distributes verification where it is most informative. On the \textsc{MATH} benchmark, our approach achieves higher accuracy than best-of-$N$, majority voting, and beam search while using 44\% fewer verifier calls.

### [96] [Monitorability as a Free Gift: How RLVR Spontaneously Aligns Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03978)
*Zidi Xiong,Shan Chen,Himabindu Lakkaraju*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Monitorability (CoT transparency) in Large Reasoning Models isn't universally improved by RLVR training - gains depend heavily on data diversity and instruction-following data, and are orthogonal to capability improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate when and how monitorability (the degree to which chain-of-thought traces faithfully reflect internal computation) emerges as a "free gift" during Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) training of Large Reasoning Models.

Method: Systematic evaluation across model families and training domains, mechanistic analysis of monitorability gains, and controlled experiments varying training/evaluation difficulty to study data dependencies and underlying mechanisms.

Result: Monitorability improvements are strongly data-dependent (requiring data diversity and instruction-following data), orthogonal to capability gains, and primarily driven by response distribution sharpening (entropy reduction) and increased attention to prompts rather than stronger causal reliance on reasoning traces.

Conclusion: Monitorability doesn't universally emerge as a free gift in RLVR - its emergence depends on specific training conditions, particularly data characteristics, and operates independently from model capability improvements, providing a holistic understanding of when transparency gains occur.

Abstract: As Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are increasingly deployed, auditing their chain-of-thought (CoT) traces for safety becomes critical. Recent work has reported that monitorability--the degree to which CoT faithfully and informatively reflects internal computation--can appear as a "free gift" during the early stages of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We make this observation concrete through a systematic evaluation across model families and training domains. Our results show that this effect is not universal: monitorability improvements are strongly data-dependent. In particular, we demonstrate the critical role of data diversity and instruction-following data during RLVR training. We further show that monitorability is orthogonal to capability--improvements in reasoning performance do not imply increased transparency. Through mechanistic analysis, we attribute monitorability gains primarily to response distribution sharpening (entropy reduction) and increased attention to the prompt, rather than stronger causal reliance on reasoning traces. We also reveal how monitorability dynamics vary with controlled training and evaluation difficulty. Together, these findings provide a holistic view of how monitorability emerges under RLVR, clarifying when gains are likely to occur and when they are not.

*Shutong Fan,Lan Zhang,Xiaoyong Yuan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Adversarial explanation attacks manipulate LLM-generated explanations to maintain human trust in incorrect AI outputs, exploiting the cognitive channel between AI and users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern AI systems operate within human decision loops where users interpret model recommendations. LLMs generate natural-language explanations that shape user trust, creating a new attack surface at the cognitive layer between AI and humans.

Method: Introduced adversarial explanation attacks (AEAs) formalized through the trust miscalibration gap metric. Conducted controlled experiment (n=205) systematically varying four dimensions of explanation framing: reasoning mode, evidence type, communication style, and presentation format.

Result: Users report nearly identical trust for adversarial and benign explanations, with adversarial explanations preserving most benign trust despite being incorrect. Most vulnerable cases occur when AEAs resemble expert communication. Vulnerability highest on hard tasks, fact-driven domains, and among less educated, younger, or highly trusting participants.

Conclusion: First systematic security study treating explanations as adversarial cognitive channel, quantifying impact on human trust in AI-assisted decision making. Reveals significant threat where persuasive explanations can reinforce trust in incorrect predictions.

Abstract: Most adversarial threats in artificial intelligence target the computational behavior of models rather than the humans who rely on them. Yet modern AI systems increasingly operate within human decision loops, where users interpret and act on model recommendations. Large Language Models generate fluent natural-language explanations that shape how users perceive and trust AI outputs, revealing a new attack surface at the cognitive layer: the communication channel between AI and its users. We introduce adversarial explanation attacks (AEAs), where an attacker manipulates the framing of LLM-generated explanations to modulate human trust in incorrect outputs. We formalize this behavioral threat through the trust miscalibration gap, a metric that captures the difference in human trust between correct and incorrect outputs under adversarial explanations. By incorporating this gap, AEAs explore the daunting threats in which persuasive explanations reinforce users' trust in incorrect predictions. To characterize this threat, we conducted a controlled experiment (n = 205), systematically varying four dimensions of explanation framing: reasoning mode, evidence type, communication style, and presentation format. Our findings show that users report nearly identical trust for adversarial and benign explanations, with adversarial explanations preserving the vast majority of benign trust despite being incorrect. The most vulnerable cases arise when AEAs closely resemble expert communication, combining authoritative evidence, neutral tone, and domain-appropriate reasoning. Vulnerability is highest on hard tasks, in fact-driven domains, and among participants who are less formally educated, younger, or highly trusting of AI. This is the first systematic security study that treats explanations as an adversarial cognitive channel and quantifies their impact on human trust in AI-assisted decision making.

### [98] [Axiomatic Foundations of Counterfactual Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04028)
*Leila Amgoud,Martin Cooper*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an axiomatic framework for counterfactual explainers in AI systems, proving impossibility theorems and establishing five distinct types of counterfactual explanations through representation theorems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in existing counterfactual explanation literature: lack of systematic study of alternative counterfactual types and absence of global explanations that reveal overall system reasoning, while improving trust in autonomous systems.

Method: Develops an axiomatic framework with desirable properties for counterfactual explainers, proves impossibility theorems about axiom combinations, establishes representation theorems linking axiom subsets to explainer families, and analyzes computational complexity.

Result: Identifies five fundamentally different types of counterfactual explanations (some local, some global), characterizes existing explainers within this taxonomy, and provides formal characterization of their behavior.

Conclusion: The framework provides systematic understanding of counterfactual explanation diversity, reveals trade-offs between different explanation types, and offers formal foundation for evaluating and selecting appropriate explainers for different applications.

Abstract: Explaining autonomous and intelligent systems is critical in order to improve trust in their decisions. Counterfactuals have emerged as one of the most compelling forms of explanation. They address ``why not'' questions by revealing how decisions could be altered. Despite the growing literature, most existing explainers focus on a single type of counterfactual and are restricted to local explanations, focusing on individual instances. There has been no systematic study of alternative counterfactual types, nor of global counterfactuals that shed light on a system's overall reasoning process.
  This paper addresses the two gaps by introducing an axiomatic framework built on a set of desirable properties for counterfactual explainers. It proves impossibility theorems showing that no single explainer can satisfy certain axiom combinations simultaneously, and fully characterizes all compatible sets. Representation theorems then establish five one-to-one correspondences between specific subsets of axioms and the families of explainers that satisfy them. Each family gives rise to a distinct type of counterfactual explanation, uncovering five fundamentally different types of counterfactuals. Some of these correspond to local explanations, while others capture global explanations. Finally, the framework situates existing explainers within this taxonomy, formally characterizes their behavior, and analyzes the computational complexity of generating such explanations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ORBIT trains LLMs via meta-RL to learn from interaction experience in-context, enabling effective online decision-making without weight updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel at static tasks but struggle with online decision-making where information must be acquired through interaction, feedback is delayed, and exploration-exploitation tradeoffs are needed.

Method: ORBIT: multi-task, multi-episode meta-reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs to learn from interaction in context.

Result: After meta-training, Qwen3-14B shows substantially improved in-context online learning on unseen environments, matching GPT-5.2 and outperforming standard RL fine-tuning. Scaling shows consistent gains with model size.

Conclusion: Training LLMs with meta-RL enables effective learn-at-inference-time decision-making, with significant headroom for improvement as models scale.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance when all task-relevant information is available upfront, as in static prediction and instruction-following problems. However, many real-world decision-making tasks are inherently online: crucial information must be acquired through interaction, feedback is delayed, and effective behavior requires balancing information collection and exploitation over time. While in-context learning enables adaptation without weight updates, existing LLMs often struggle to reliably leverage in-context interaction experience in such settings. In this work, we show that this limitation can be addressed through training. We introduce ORBIT, a multi-task, multi-episode meta-reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs to learn from interaction in context. After meta-training, a relatively small open-source model (Qwen3-14B) demonstrates substantially improved in-context online learning on entirely unseen environments, matching the performance of GPT-5.2 and outperforming standard RL fine-tuning by a large margin. Scaling experiments further reveal consistent gains with model size, suggesting significant headroom for learn-at-inference-time decision-making agents.

*Harsha Vardhan Khurdula,Vineet Agarwal,Yoeven D Khemlani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Interfaze is a system that treats LLM applications as context-building problems, using a stack of small models and tools for perception/action with a thin controller, achieving competitive benchmarks while reducing reliance on expensive monolithic LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern LLM applications should focus on building and acting over context rather than just selecting the right monolithic model, to reduce computational costs while maintaining competitive performance.

Method: Three-layer architecture: (1) heterogeneous DNNs with small language models for perception tasks (OCR, ASR, multimodal), (2) context-construction layer for crawling/indexing external sources, (3) action layer for browsing, code execution, and web automation, all coordinated by a thin controller that exposes a single OpenAI-style endpoint.

Result: Achieves 83.6% on MMLU-Pro, 91.4% on MMLU, 81.3% on GPQA-Diamond, 57.8% on LiveCodeBench v5, 90.0% on AIME-2025, with strong multimodal scores (MMMU 77.3%, AI2D 91.5%, ChartQA 90.9%, Common Voice 90.8%). Most queries handled by small-model stack, with LLM operating only on distilled context.

Conclusion: Interfaze demonstrates that shifting computation from expensive monolithic LLMs to specialized small models and tools can achieve competitive accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs, offering a more efficient alternative to traditional LLM application architectures.

Abstract: We present Interfaze, a system that treats modern LLM applications as a problem of building and acting over context, not just picking the right monolithic model. Instead of a single transformer, we combine (i) a stack of heterogeneous DNNs paired with small language models as perception modules for OCR involving complex PDFs, charts and diagrams, and multilingual ASR with (ii) a context-construction layer that crawls, indexes, and parses external sources (web pages, code, PDFs) into compact structured state, and (iii) an action layer that can browse, retrieve, execute code in a sandbox, and drive a headless browser for dynamic web pages. A thin controller sits on top of this stack and exposes a single, OpenAI-style endpoint: it decides which small models and actions to run and always forwards the distilled context to a user-selected LLM that produces the final response.
  On this architecture, Interfaze-Beta achieves 83.6% on MMLU-Pro, 91.4% on MMLU, 81.3% on GPQA-Diamond, 57.8% on LiveCodeBench v5, and 90.0% on AIME-2025, along with strong multimodal scores on MMMU (val) (77.3%), AI2D (91.5%), ChartQA (90.9%), and Common Voice v16 (90.8%). We show that most queries are handled primarily by the small-model and tool stack, with the large LLM operating only on distilled context, yielding competitive accuracy while shifting the bulk of computation away from the most expensive and monolithic models.

*Ruiting Dai,Zheyu Wang,Haoyu Yang,Yihan Liu,Chengzhi Wang,Zekun Zhang,Zishan Huang,Jiaman Cen,Lisi Mo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OMG-Agent is a novel framework that addresses data incompleteness in multimodal systems through a dynamic coarse-to-fine agentic workflow, decoupling tasks into semantic planning, evidence retrieval, and execution stages to overcome hallucinations and retrieval rigidity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data incompleteness severely impairs multimodal system reliability. Existing methods face bottlenecks: parametric/generative models suffer from hallucinations due to over-reliance on internal memory, while retrieval-augmented frameworks struggle with retrieval rigidity. Both are constrained by Semantic-Detail Entanglement - a structural conflict between logical reasoning and signal synthesis that compromises fidelity.

Method: OMG-Agent shifts from static mapping to dynamic coarse-to-fine Agentic Workflow, mimicking deliberate-then-act cognitive process. It decouples tasks into three synergistic stages: (1) MLLM-driven Semantic Planner with Progressive Contextual Reasoning to create deterministic structured semantic plans; (2) non-parametric Evidence Retriever to ground abstract semantics in external knowledge; (3) Retrieval-Injected Executor that uses retrieved evidence as flexible feature prompts to synthesize high-fidelity details.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show OMG-Agent consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods, maintaining robustness under extreme missingness. Achieves 2.6-point gain on CMU-MOSI at 70% missing rates.

Conclusion: OMG-Agent provides a novel framework that overcomes limitations of existing multimodal reconstruction methods by explicitly decoupling semantic planning from detail synthesis through an agentic workflow, achieving superior performance and robustness against data incompleteness.

Abstract: Data incompleteness severely impedes the reliability of multimodal systems. Existing reconstruction methods face distinct bottlenecks: conventional parametric/generative models are prone to hallucinations due to over-reliance on internal memory, while retrieval-augmented frameworks struggle with retrieval rigidity. Critically, these end-to-end architectures are fundamentally constrained by Semantic-Detail Entanglement -- a structural conflict between logical reasoning and signal synthesis that compromises fidelity. In this paper, we present \textbf{\underline{O}}mni-\textbf{\underline{M}}odality \textbf{\underline{G}}eneration Agent (\textbf{OMG-Agent}), a novel framework that shifts the paradigm from static mapping to a dynamic coarse-to-fine Agentic Workflow. By mimicking a \textit{deliberate-then-act} cognitive process, OMG-Agent explicitly decouples the task into three synergistic stages: (1) an MLLM-driven Semantic Planner that resolves input ambiguity via Progressive Contextual Reasoning, creating a deterministic structured semantic plan; (2) a non-parametric Evidence Retriever that grounds abstract semantics in external knowledge; and (3) a Retrieval-Injected Executor that utilizes retrieved evidence as flexible feature prompts to overcome rigidity and synthesize high-fidelity details. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that OMG-Agent consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods, maintaining robustness under extreme missingness, e.g., a $2.6$-point gain on CMU-MOSI at $70$\% missing rates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs automate complex tasks like vibe coding, users struggle to guide them effectively due to insufficient expertise, difficulty articulating precise intent, and inability to validate complex outputs, creating a supervision gap in scalable oversight.

Method: Scalable Interactive Oversight (SIO) framework decomposes complex intent into recursive tree of manageable decisions, elicits low-burden feedback at each node, and recursively aggregates signals into precise global guidance.

Result: In web development tasks, SIO enables non-experts to produce expert-level Product Requirement Documents with 54% improvement in alignment. Framework can be optimized via Reinforcement Learning using only online user feedback.

Conclusion: SIO offers practical pathway for maintaining human control as AI scales by enabling effective oversight on tasks that surpass human ability to specify or verify, addressing critical challenge in scalable oversight.

Abstract: As Large Language Models increasingly automate complex, long-horizon tasks such as \emph{vibe coding}, a supervision gap has emerged. While models excel at execution, users often struggle to guide them effectively due to insufficient domain expertise, the difficulty of articulating precise intent, and the inability to reliably validate complex outputs. It presents a critical challenge in scalable oversight: enabling humans to responsibly steer AI systems on tasks that surpass their own ability to specify or verify. To tackle this, we propose Scalable Interactive Oversight, a framework that decomposes complex intent into a recursive tree of manageable decisions to amplify human supervision. Rather than relying on open-ended prompting, our system elicits low-burden feedback at each node and recursively aggregates these signals into precise global guidance. Validated in web development task, our framework enables non-experts to produce expert-level Product Requirement Documents, achieving a 54\% improvement in alignment. Crucially, we demonstrate that this framework can be optimized via Reinforcement Learning using only online user feedback, offering a practical pathway for maintaining human control as AI scales.

TL;DR: InterPReT enables laypeople to teach AI agents through interactive instructions and demonstrations, making imitation learning more accessible to non-experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing imitation learning requires professional demonstrations and technical monitoring, creating barriers for laypeople who want to teach AI agents new skills. The goal is to lower the barrier for end-users to train AI agents.

Method: Interactive Policy Restructuring and Training (InterPReT) - takes user instructions to continually update policy structure and optimize parameters to fit user demonstrations, allowing interactive teaching, monitoring, and review of decision-making.

Result: User study (N=34) on teaching an AI agent to drive in a racing game shows InterPReT yields more robust policies without impairing system usability compared to generic imitation learning baseline when laypeople provide demonstrations and determine stopping points.

Conclusion: InterPReT is more suitable for end-users without technical ML background to train dependable policies, making AI agent training accessible to non-experts through interactive teaching.

Abstract: Imitation learning has shown success in many tasks by learning from expert demonstrations. However, most existing work relies on large-scale demonstrations from technical professionals and close monitoring of the training process. These are challenging for a layperson when they want to teach the agent new skills. To lower the barrier of teaching AI agents, we propose Interactive Policy Restructuring and Training (InterPReT), which takes user instructions to continually update the policy structure and optimize its parameters to fit user demonstrations. This enables end-users to interactively give instructions and demonstrations, monitor the agent's performance, and review the agent's decision-making strategies. A user study (N=34) on teaching an AI agent to drive in a racing game confirms that our approach yields more robust policies without impairing system usability, compared to a generic imitation learning baseline, when a layperson is responsible for both giving demonstrations and determining when to stop. This shows that our method is more suitable for end-users without much technical background in machine learning to train a dependable policy

TL;DR: Empirical-MCTS: A dual-loop framework that transforms stateless MCTS into continuous learning by combining local search with global memory optimization through PE-EMP and Memory Optimization Agent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current inference-time scaling strategies like MCTS are stateless, discarding successful reasoning patterns after each problem and failing to accumulate wisdom like human problem-solving. Need to bridge this gap between structured search and empirical learning.

Method: Introduces Empirical-MCTS with two novel mechanisms: 1) Pairwise-Experience-Evolutionary Meta-Prompting (PE-EMP) for real-time meta-prompt evolution using pairwise feedback, and 2) Memory Optimization Agent that manages a global repository as dynamic policy prior using atomic operations to distill insights across problems.

Result: Significantly outperforms both stateless MCTS strategies and standalone experience-driven agents on complex reasoning benchmarks including AIME25, ARC-AGI-2, and MathArena Apex.

Conclusion: Coupling structured search with empirical accumulation is critical for mastering complex, open-ended reasoning tasks, demonstrating the importance of continuous learning in LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling strategies, particularly Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current approaches remain predominantly stateless, discarding successful reasoning patterns after each problem instance and failing to mimic the empirical accumulation of wisdom characteristic of human problem-solving. To bridge this gap, we introduce Empirical-MCTS, a dual-loop framework that transforms stateless search into a continuous, non-parametric learning process. The framework unifies local exploration with global memory optimization through two novel mechanisms: Pairwise-Experience-Evolutionary Meta-Prompting (PE-EMP) and a Memory Optimization Agent. PE-EMP functions as a reflexive optimizer within the local search, utilizing pairwise feedback to dynamically synthesize adaptive criteria and evolve meta-prompts (system prompts) in real-time. Simultaneously, the Memory Optimization Agent manages a global repository as a dynamic policy prior, employing atomic operations to distill high-quality insights across problems. Extensive evaluations on complex reasoning benchmarks, including AIME25, ARC-AGI-2, and MathArena Apex, demonstrate that Empirical-MCTS significantly outperforms both stateless MCTS strategies and standalone experience-driven agents. These results underscore the critical necessity of coupling structured search with empirical accumulation for mastering complex, open-ended reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: Agent-Omit: A framework that trains LLM agents to adaptively skip unnecessary thoughts and observations during multi-turn interactions to improve efficiency while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches treat all interaction turns equally, ignoring that thought necessity and observation utility vary across turns, leading to inefficiency in agent-environment interactions.

Method: 1) Quantitative investigation of thought/observation impact on agent effectiveness/efficiency; 2) Synthesize cold-start data for fine-tuning omission behaviors; 3) Omit-aware agentic reinforcement learning with dual sampling mechanism and tailored omission reward; 4) Theoretical proof of policy deviation bounds.

Result: Agent-Omit-8B achieves performance comparable to frontier LLM agents and obtains the best effectiveness-efficiency trade-off compared to seven efficient LLM agent methods across five benchmarks.

Conclusion: Agent-Omit successfully enables LLM agents to adaptively omit redundant thoughts and observations, achieving superior efficiency without compromising effectiveness in multi-turn interactions.

Abstract: Managing agent thought and observation during multi-turn agent-environment interactions is an emerging strategy to improve agent efficiency. However, existing studies treat the entire interaction trajectories equally, overlooking the thought necessity and observation utility varies across turns. To this end, we first conduct quantitative investigations into how thought and observation affect agent effectiveness and efficiency. Based on our findings, we propose Agent-Omit, a unified training framework that empowers LLM agents to adaptively omit redundant thoughts and observations. Specifically, we first synthesize a small amount of cold-start data, including both single-turn and multi-turn omission scenarios, to fine-tune the agent for omission behaviors. Furthermore, we introduce an omit-aware agentic reinforcement learning approach, incorporating a dual sampling mechanism and a tailored omission reward to incentivize the agent's adaptive omission capability. Theoretically, we prove that the deviation of our omission policy is upper-bounded by KL-divergence. Experimental results on five agent benchmarks show that our constructed Agent-Omit-8B could obtain performance comparable to seven frontier LLM agent, and achieve the best effectiveness-efficiency trade-off than seven efficient LLM agents methods.

TL;DR: PCE framework converts LLM reasoning traces into structured decision trees for uncertainty-aware planning in multi-agent environments, reducing communication overhead while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based embodied agents rely heavily on frequent inter-agent communication to handle uncertainty, which incurs high token/time costs and disrupts workflows, especially with human partners.

Method: PCE (Planner-Composer-Evaluator) framework transforms fragmented LLM reasoning assumptions into structured decision trees with internal nodes encoding environment assumptions and leaves mapping to actions, then scores paths by scenario likelihood, goal gain, and execution cost.

Result: PCE outperforms communication-centric baselines in success rate and task efficiency across two multi-agent benchmarks (C-WAH and TDW-MAT) with three LLM backbones, while maintaining comparable token usage. Ablations show PCE complements model capacity and reasoning depth scaling.

Conclusion: PCE provides a principled approach to convert latent LLM assumptions into reliable uncertainty-aware planning strategies, producing communication patterns perceived as more efficient and trustworthy by human partners.

Abstract: Embodied agents operating in multi-agent, partially observable, and decentralized environments must plan and act despite pervasive uncertainty about hidden objects and collaborators' intentions. Recent advances in applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to embodied agents have addressed many long-standing challenges, such as high-level goal decomposition and online adaptation. Yet, uncertainty is still primarily mitigated through frequent inter-agent communication. This incurs substantial token and time costs, and can disrupt established workflows, when human partners are involved. We introduce PCE, a Planner-Composer-Evaluator framework that converts the fragmented assumptions latent in LLM reasoning traces into a structured decision tree. Internal nodes encode environment assumptions and leaves map to actions; each path is then scored by scenario likelihood, goal-directed gain, and execution cost to guide rational action selection without heavy communication. Across two challenging multi-agent benchmarks (C-WAH and TDW-MAT) and three diverse LLM backbones, PCE consistently outperforms communication-centric baselines in success rate and task efficiency while showing comparable token usage. Ablation results indicate that the performance gains obtained by scaling model capacity or reasoning depth persist even when PCE is applied, while PCE consistently raises the baseline across both capacity and reasoning-depth scales, confirming that structured uncertainty handling complements both forms of scaling. A user study further demonstrates that PCE produces communication patterns that human partners perceive as more efficient and trustworthy. Together, these results establish a principled route for turning latent LLM assumptions into reliable strategies for uncertainty-aware planning.

Conclusion: ZeroConf AI pipelines using Digital Twins enable seamless AI integration in CPS by addressing fragmentation and coupling issues, providing scalable, reusable intelligent functionality for industrial applications.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), particularly in the industrial domain, has amplified the challenges associated with the effective integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Fragmentation across IoT and IIoT technologies, manifested through diverse communication protocols, data formats and device capabilities, creates a substantial gap between low-level physical layers and high-level intelligent functionalities. Recently, Digital Twin (DT) technology has emerged as a promising solution, offering structured, interoperable and semantically rich digital representations of physical assets. Current approaches are often siloed and tightly coupled, limiting scalability and reuse of AI functionalities. This work proposes a modular and interoperable solution that enables seamless AI pipeline integration into CPS by minimizing configuration and decoupling the roles of DTs and AI components. We introduce the concept of Zero Configuration (ZeroConf) AI pipelines, where DTs orchestrate data management and intelligent augmentation. The approach is demonstrated in a MicroFactory scenario, showing support for concurrent ML models and dynamic data processing, effectively accelerating the deployment of intelligent services in complex industrial settings.

Conclusion: The confidence-aware, dynamically adaptive approach of ReThinker represents an effective solution for expert-level scientific reasoning, overcoming limitations of rigid pipelines and brittle coordination while enabling scalable training through automated data synthesis.

Abstract: Expert-level scientific reasoning remains challenging for large language models, particularly on benchmarks such as Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), where rigid tool pipelines, brittle multi-agent coordination, and inefficient test-time scaling often limit performance. We introduce ReThinker, a confidence-aware agentic framework that orchestrates retrieval, tool use, and multi-agent reasoning through a stage-wise Solver-Critic-Selector architecture. Rather than following a fixed pipeline, ReThinker dynamically allocates computation based on model confidence, enabling adaptive tool invocation, guided multi-dimensional reflection, and robust confidence-weighted selection. To support scalable training without human annotation, we further propose a reverse data synthesis pipeline and an adaptive trajectory recycling strategy that transform successful reasoning traces into high-quality supervision. Experiments on HLE, GAIA, and XBench demonstrate that ReThinker consistently outperforms state-of-the-art foundation models with tools and existing deep research systems, achieving state-of-the-art results on expert-level reasoning tasks.

*Niv Fono,Yftah Ziser,Omer Ben-Porat*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GenAI systems both compete with and depend on Q&A forums, creating a paradox. The paper proposes a sequential interaction framework for sustainable collaboration between AI and human knowledge platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a paradox where Generative AI systems draw users away from Q&A forums while simultaneously depending on the data those forums produce to improve their performance. This creates a sustainability problem for knowledge sharing platforms.

Method: Proposes a framework of sequential interaction where a GenAI system proposes questions to a forum that can publish some of them. The framework captures intricacies like non-monetary exchanges, asymmetric information, and incentive misalignment. Validated through comprehensive, data-driven simulations using real Stack Exchange data and commonly used LLMs.

Result: Demonstrated incentive misalignment empirically, yet showed that players can achieve roughly half of the utility in an ideal full-information scenario. The framework enables sustainable collaboration that preserves effective knowledge sharing.

Conclusion: There is potential for sustainable collaboration between AI systems and human knowledge platforms through structured interaction frameworks that address incentive misalignment and information asymmetry.

Abstract: While Generative AI (GenAI) systems draw users away from (Q&A) forums, they also depend on the very data those forums produce to improve their performance. Addressing this paradox, we propose a framework of sequential interaction, in which a GenAI system proposes questions to a forum that can publish some of them. Our framework captures several intricacies of such a collaboration, including non-monetary exchanges, asymmetric information, and incentive misalignment. We bring the framework to life through comprehensive, data-driven simulations using real Stack Exchange data and commonly used LLMs. We demonstrate the incentive misalignment empirically, yet show that players can achieve roughly half of the utility in an ideal full-information scenario. Our results highlight the potential for sustainable collaboration that preserves effective knowledge sharing between AI systems and human knowledge platforms.

### [110] [Vibe AIGC: A New Paradigm for Content Generation via Agentic Orchestration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04575)
*Jiaheng Liu,Yuanxing Zhang,Shihao Li,Xinping Lei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Vibe AIGC introduces a new paradigm shifting from model-centric scaling to agentic orchestration, where users provide high-level "vibes" that are decomposed into executable multi-agent workflows, bridging the intent-execution gap in generative AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative AI faces a "usability ceiling" with an Intent-Execution Gap - the disparity between creator's high-level intent and stochastic, black-box single-shot models. The model-centric paradigm driven by scaling laws has limitations despite visual fidelity improvements.

Method: Introduces Vibe AIGC, a paradigm for content generation via agentic orchestration with hierarchical multi-agent workflows. Users provide a "Vibe" (high-level aesthetic preferences, functional logic). A centralized Meta-Planner deconstructs this Vibe into executable, verifiable, and adaptive agentic pipelines.

Result: Transitions from stochastic inference to logical orchestration, bridging the gap between human imagination and machine execution. Transforms AI from a fragile inference engine into a robust system-level engineering partner.

Conclusion: This paradigm shift will redefine human-AI collaborative economy and democratize creation of complex, long-horizon digital assets by making AI a reliable engineering partner rather than just a stochastic generator.

Abstract: For the past decade, the trajectory of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been dominated by a model-centric paradigm driven by scaling laws. Despite significant leaps in visual fidelity, this approach has encountered a ``usability ceiling'' manifested as the Intent-Execution Gap (i.e., the fundamental disparity between a creator's high-level intent and the stochastic, black-box nature of current single-shot models). In this paper, inspired by the Vibe Coding, we introduce the \textbf{Vibe AIGC}, a new paradigm for content generation via agentic orchestration, which represents the autonomous synthesis of hierarchical multi-agent workflows.
  Under this paradigm, the user's role transcends traditional prompt engineering, evolving into a Commander who provides a Vibe, a high-level representation encompassing aesthetic preferences, functional logic, and etc. A centralized Meta-Planner then functions as a system architect, deconstructing this ``Vibe'' into executable, verifiable, and adaptive agentic pipelines. By transitioning from stochastic inference to logical orchestration, Vibe AIGC bridges the gap between human imagination and machine execution. We contend that this shift will redefine the human-AI collaborative economy, transforming AI from a fragile inference engine into a robust system-level engineering partner that democratizes the creation of complex, long-horizon digital assets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WideSeek-R1 is a multi-agent LLM framework using width scaling with parallel subagents to tackle broad information-seeking tasks, achieving performance comparable to much larger single-agent models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As tasks grow broader, the bottleneck shifts from individual agent competence to organizational capability. Existing multi-agent systems use inefficient hand-crafted workflows and sequential interactions that fail to parallelize work effectively.

Method: Proposed WideSeek-R1, a lead-agent-subagent framework trained via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Uses shared LLM with isolated contexts and specialized tools, jointly optimizing lead agent and parallel subagents on 20k curated broad information-seeking tasks.

Result: WideSeek-R1-4B achieves 40.0% item F1 score on WideSearch benchmark, comparable to single-agent DeepSeek-R1-671B. Shows consistent performance gains as number of parallel subagents increases, demonstrating effectiveness of width scaling.

Conclusion: Width scaling with multi-agent systems is a promising complementary dimension to depth scaling, enabling smaller models to achieve performance comparable to much larger single-agent models through effective parallelization and orchestration.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have largely focused on depth scaling, where a single agent solves long-horizon problems with multi-turn reasoning and tool use. However, as tasks grow broader, the key bottleneck shifts from individual competence to organizational capability. In this work, we explore a complementary dimension of width scaling with multi-agent systems to address broad information seeking. Existing multi-agent systems often rely on hand-crafted workflows and turn-taking interactions that fail to parallelize work effectively. To bridge this gap, we propose WideSeek-R1, a lead-agent-subagent framework trained via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to synergize scalable orchestration and parallel execution. By utilizing a shared LLM with isolated contexts and specialized tools, WideSeek-R1 jointly optimizes the lead agent and parallel subagents on a curated dataset of 20k broad information-seeking tasks. Extensive experiments show that WideSeek-R1-4B achieves an item F1 score of 40.0% on the WideSearch benchmark, which is comparable to the performance of single-agent DeepSeek-R1-671B. Furthermore, WideSeek-R1-4B exhibits consistent performance gains as the number of parallel subagents increases, highlighting the effectiveness of width scaling.

*Shubham Vatsal,Harsh Dubey,Aditi Singh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Systematic review of 49 LLM-based healthcare agent studies using 7-dimensional taxonomy reveals implementation asymmetries: strong on knowledge integration but weak on adaptation, safety, and action-oriented tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing literature on LLM-based healthcare agents lacks a unified framework, with studies being either broad surveys or narrow dives into single capabilities, leaving the field without common structure for comparison and analysis.

Method: Developed 7-dimensional taxonomy with 29 sub-dimensions, applied explicit inclusion/exclusion criteria and labeling rubric (Fully/Partially/Not Implemented) to map 49 studies, then conducted quantitative analysis of capability prevalence and co-occurrence patterns.

Result: Clear asymmetries identified: External Knowledge Integration common (76% Fully Implemented) while Event-Triggered Activation (92% Not Implemented) and Drift Detection & Mitigation (98% Not Implemented) rare. Multi-Agent Design dominant (82% Fully Implemented). Information-centric tasks lead while action-oriented areas like Treatment Planning show substantial gaps (59% Not Implemented).

Conclusion: The taxonomy provides a common framework for analyzing LLM-based healthcare agents, revealing significant implementation gaps in adaptation, safety, and action-oriented capabilities that need attention for robust clinical deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents that plan, use tools and act has begun to shape healthcare and medicine. Reported studies demonstrate competence on various tasks ranging from EHR analysis and differential diagnosis to treatment planning and research workflows. Yet the literature largely consists of overviews which are either broad surveys or narrow dives into a single capability (e.g., memory, planning, reasoning), leaving healthcare work without a common frame. We address this by reviewing 49 studies using a seven-dimensional taxonomy: Cognitive Capabilities, Knowledge Management, Interaction Patterns, Adaptation & Learning, Safety & Ethics, Framework Typology and Core Tasks & Subtasks with 29 operational sub-dimensions. Using explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria and a labeling rubric (Fully Implemented, Partially Implemented, Not Implemented), we map each study to the taxonomy and report quantitative summaries of capability prevalence and co-occurrence patterns. Our empirical analysis surfaces clear asymmetries. For instance, the External Knowledge Integration sub-dimension under Knowledge Management is commonly realized (~76% Fully Implemented) whereas Event-Triggered Activation sub-dimenison under Interaction Patterns is largely absent (~92% Not Implemented) and Drift Detection & Mitigation sub-dimension under Adaptation & Learning is rare (~98% Not Implemented). Architecturally, Multi-Agent Design sub-dimension under Framework Typology is the dominant pattern (~82% Fully Implemented) while orchestration layers remain mostly partial. Across Core Tasks & Subtasks, information centric capabilities lead e.g., Medical Question Answering & Decision Support and Benchmarking & Simulation, while action and discovery oriented areas such as Treatment Planning & Prescription still show substantial gaps (~59% Not Implemented).

*Haosen Ge,Hamsa Bastani,Osbert Bastani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques claims of exponential AI growth, arguing current data shows inflection point already passed and highlighting fragility of exponential growth forecasts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the METR report's claim of exponential AI growth since 2019 and demonstrate the fragility of such forecasts, given substantial real-world consequences of AI capabilities.

Method: Re-analyzed METR's data using sigmoid/logistic curves, finding inflection point already passed; proposed more complex model decomposing AI capabilities into base and reasoning components with individual improvement rates.

Result: Found data doesn't support exponential growth even in short-term; inflection point has already occurred; complex model supports near-future inflection point hypothesis.

Conclusion: Existing exponential growth forecasts are fragile; the goal is not to establish rigorous forecasts but to highlight this fragility in AI capability predictions.

Abstract: Rapidly increasing AI capabilities have substantial real-world consequences, ranging from AI safety concerns to labor market consequences. The Model Evaluation & Threat Research (METR) report argues that AI capabilities have exhibited exponential growth since 2019. In this note, we argue that the data does not support exponential growth, even in shorter-term horizons. Whereas the METR study claims that fitting sigmoid/logistic curves results in inflection points far in the future, we fit a sigmoid curve to their current data and find that the inflection point has already passed. In addition, we propose a more complex model that decomposes AI capabilities into base and reasoning capabilities, exhibiting individual rates of improvement. We prove that this model supports our hypothesis that AI capabilities will exhibit an inflection point in the near future. Our goal is not to establish a rigorous forecast of our own, but to highlight the fragility of existing forecasts of exponential growth.

*Zhaotian Weng,Antonis Antoniades,Deepak Nathani,Zhen Zhang,Xiao Pu,Xin Eric Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GEA introduces group-based evolution for AI agents, enabling experience sharing within groups to outperform individual evolution methods on coding benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing self-evolving paradigms that use tree-structured evolution with isolated branches, which leads to inefficient utilization of exploratory diversity and requires more human intervention.

Method: Group-Evolving Agents (GEA) treats groups of agents as evolutionary units, enabling explicit experience sharing and reuse within groups throughout evolution, rather than evolving individual agents in isolation.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art self-evolving methods (71.0% vs. 56.7% on SWE-bench Verified, 88.3% vs. 68.3% on Polyglot) and matches/exceeds human-designed frameworks. Shows better conversion of exploratory diversity into sustained progress and greater robustness.

Conclusion: GEA represents an effective paradigm for open-ended self-improvement that enables more efficient evolution through group-based experience sharing, achieving superior performance and robustness compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Open-ended self-improving agents can autonomously modify their own structural designs to advance their capabilities and overcome the limits of pre-defined architectures, thus reducing reliance on human intervention. We introduce Group-Evolving Agents (GEA), a new paradigm for open-ended self-improvements, which treats a group of agents as the fundamental evolutionary unit, enabling explicit experience sharing and reuse within the group throughout evolution. Unlike existing open-ended self-evolving paradigms that adopt tree-structured evolution, GEA overcomes the limitation of inefficient utilization of exploratory diversity caused by isolated evolutionary branches. We evaluate GEA on challenging coding benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art self-evolving methods (71.0% vs. 56.7% on SWE-bench Verified, 88.3% vs. 68.3% on Polyglot) and matches or exceeds top human-designed agent frameworks (71.8% and 52.0% on two benchmarks, respectively). Analysis reveals that GEA more effectively converts early-stage exploratory diversity into sustained, long-term progress, achieving stronger performance under the same number of evolved agents. Furthermore, GEA exhibits consistent transferability across different coding models and greater robustness, fixing framework-level bugs in 1.4 iterations on average, versus 5 for self-evolving methods.

TL;DR: QwQ-32B improves abstract problem solving through in-context refinement of token representations during reasoning, developing structural rather than semantic encodings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning language models outperform non-reasoning models on abstract problems, but the internal mechanisms enabling this superior performance remain poorly understood.

Method: Mechanistic analysis of QwQ-32B on Mystery Blocksworld domain, using steering experiments to test causal effects of refined representations and symbolic substitutions.

Result: Model gradually improves internal representations during reasoning, develops abstract structural encodings, and refined representations boost accuracy while symbolic ones can replace obfuscated encodings with minimal loss.

Conclusion: One key factor driving reasoning model performance is in-context refinement of token representations (Fluid Reasoning Representations), which enables better abstract problem solving.

Abstract: Reasoning language models, which generate long chains of thought, dramatically outperform non-reasoning language models on abstract problems. However, the internal model mechanisms that allow this superior performance remain poorly understood. We present a mechanistic analysis of how QwQ-32B - a model specifically trained to produce extensive reasoning traces - process abstract structural information. On Mystery Blocksworld - a semantically obfuscated planning domain - we find that QwQ-32B gradually improves its internal representation of actions and concepts during reasoning. The model develops abstract encodings that focus on structure rather than specific action names. Through steering experiments, we establish causal evidence that these adaptations improve problem solving: injecting refined representations from successful traces boosts accuracy, while symbolic representations can replace many obfuscated encodings with minimal performance loss. We find that one of the factors driving reasoning model performance is in-context refinement of token representations, which we dub Fluid Reasoning Representations.

TL;DR: Cooperative multi-sensor localization approach fuses V2V/V2I data with point cloud registration SLAM to improve vehicle localization accuracy in GPS-unreliable urban environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPS signals are often unreliable in urban environments, creating a critical challenge for accurate vehicle localization that needs to be addressed.

Method: Integrates cooperative V2V and V2I data with point cloud registration-based SLAM, processing point clouds from vehicle-mounted LiDAR, stereo cameras, and intersection-deployed sensors.

Result: Significantly improves localization accuracy and robustness in complex, GPS-noisy urban scenarios by leveraging shared infrastructure data.

Conclusion: The cooperative multi-sensor, multi-modal approach effectively addresses urban vehicle localization challenges where GPS is unreliable.

Abstract: Accurate vehicle localization is a critical challenge in urban environments where GPS signals are often unreliable. This paper presents a cooperative multi-sensor and multi-modal localization approach to address this issue by fusing data from vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) systems. Our approach integrates cooperative data with a point cloud registration-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm. The system processes point clouds generated from diverse sensor modalities, including vehicle-mounted LiDAR and stereo cameras, as well as sensors deployed at intersections. By leveraging shared data from infrastructure, our method significantly improves localization accuracy and robustness in complex, GPS-noisy urban scenarios.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Non-roboticists interpret Robot Foundation Model (RFM) evaluation data similarly to experts, using task success rate (TSR) as intended while also valuing failure case information that's often omitted in evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users of RFM-based home robots need to understand risks when asking robots to perform novel tasks beyond their training. Since evaluations primarily report TSR, it's important to validate whether non-experts interpret this information correctly to make informed decisions about robot capabilities.

Method: Conducted a study where non-roboticist users viewed real evaluation data from published RFM research projects, including task success rates, failure case descriptions, and videos. Analyzed how they interpreted and used this performance information.

Result: Non-experts used TSR information consistently with expert expectations and highly valued additional information like failure cases that are rarely reported in RFM evaluations. Users wanted both historical evaluation data and robot-generated performance estimates for novel tasks.

Conclusion: RFM evaluations should expand beyond just reporting TSR to include failure case information that non-expert users find valuable. Providing both historical performance data and robot self-assessments for novel tasks would better support user decision-making about robot capabilities.

Abstract: Robot Foundation Models (RFMs) represent a promising approach to developing general-purpose home robots. Given the broad capabilities of RFMs, users will inevitably ask an RFM-based robot to perform tasks that the RFM was not trained or evaluated on. In these cases, it is crucial that users understand the risks associated with attempting novel tasks due to the relatively high cost of failure. Furthermore, an informed user who understands an RFM's capabilities will know what situations and tasks the robot can handle. In this paper, we study how non-roboticists interpret performance information from RFM evaluations. These evaluations typically report task success rate (TSR) as the primary performance metric. While TSR is intuitive to experts, it is necessary to validate whether novices also use this information as intended. Toward this end, we conducted a study in which users saw real evaluation data, including TSR, failure case descriptions, and videos from multiple published RFM research projects. The results highlight that non-experts not only use TSR in a manner consistent with expert expectations but also highly value other information types, such as failure cases that are not often reported in RFM evaluations. Furthermore, we find that users want access to both real data from previous evaluations of the RFM and estimates from the robot about how well it will do on a novel task.

### [118] [VLS: Steering Pretrained Robot Policies via Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03973)
*Shuo Liu,Ishneet Sukhvinder Singh,Yiqing Xu,Jiafei Duan,Ranjay Krishna*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Vision-Language Steering (VLS) enables training-free inference-time adaptation of frozen generative robot policies to handle test-time spatial and semantic shifts without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pretrained diffusion/flow-matching policies fail under train-test shifts (obstacles, shifted surfaces, clutter) because action generation is tightly coupled to training-specific spatial configurations. Retraining is costly and misaligned since required behaviors exist but can't be selectively adapted at test time.

Method: VLS treats adaptation as inference-time control problem, steering sampling process of frozen generative policies using vision-language models to synthesize trajectory-differentiable reward functions that guide denoising toward trajectories satisfying test-time requirements.

Result: VLS outperforms prior steering methods with 31% improvement on CALVIN and 13% gain on LIBERO-PRO benchmarks. Real-world deployment on Franka robot demonstrates robust inference-time adaptation under spatial and semantic shifts.

Conclusion: VLS provides effective training-free framework for adapting frozen generative policies to test-time variations using vision-language guidance, addressing limitations of imitation learning under distribution shifts without parameter modification.

Abstract: Why do pretrained diffusion or flow-matching policies fail when the same task is performed near an obstacle, on a shifted support surface, or amid mild clutter? Such failures rarely reflect missing motor skills; instead, they expose a limitation of imitation learning under train-test shifts, where action generation is tightly coupled to training-specific spatial configurations and task specifications. Retraining or fine-tuning to address these failures is costly and conceptually misaligned, as the required behaviors already exist but cannot be selectively adapted at test time. We propose Vision-Language Steering (VLS), a training-free framework for inference-time adaptation of frozen generative robot policies. VLS treats adaptation as an inference-time control problem, steering the sampling process of a pretrained diffusion or flow-matching policy in response to out-of-distribution observation-language inputs without modifying policy parameters. By leveraging vision-language models to synthesize trajectory-differentiable reward functions, VLS guides denoising toward action trajectories that satisfy test-time spatial and task requirements. Across simulation and real-world evaluations, VLS consistently outperforms prior steering methods, achieving a 31% improvement on CALVIN and a 13% gain on LIBERO-PRO. Real-world deployment on a Franka robot further demonstrates robust inference-time adaptation under test-time spatial and semantic shifts.

*Weikang Qiu,Tinglin Huang,Aosong Feng,Rex Ying*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SD-VLA improves Vision-Language-Action models by disentangling visual inputs into static and dynamic tokens, reducing context length and enabling KV cache reuse for faster inference and better long-horizon performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models face two major challenges: limited long-horizon context understanding and inefficient inference due to quadratic attention complexity and large parameter counts. The observation that much visual information remains static across timesteps (e.g., backgrounds) motivates a more efficient approach.

Method: Proposes SD-VLA framework that disentangles visual inputs into multi-level static and dynamic tokens. This enables retaining a single copy of static tokens across frames to reduce context length, and reusing KV cache of static tokens through a lightweight recache gate that updates only when necessary.

Result: Outperforms baselines on new long-horizon benchmark by 39.8% absolute improvement in success rate, achieves 3.9% gain on SimplerEnv benchmark, and delivers 2.26x inference speedup over base VLA model.

Conclusion: SD-VLA enables efficient multi-frame integration and inference for VLA models, addressing both long-horizon context limitations and computational inefficiency, making VLA models more practical for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for generalist robotic control. Built upon vision-language model (VLM) architectures, VLAs predict actions conditioned on visual observations and language instructions, achieving strong performance and generalization across tasks. However, VLAs face two major challenges: limited long-horizon context and inefficient inference due to the quadratic attention complexity and large parameter counts. Our work is motivated by the observation that much of the visual information in a trajectory remains static across timesteps (e.g., the background). Leveraging this property, we propose SD-VLA, a framework that disentangles visual inputs into multi-level static and dynamic tokens, which enables (1) retaining a single copy of static tokens across frames to significantly reduce context length, and (2) reusing the key-value (KV) cache of static tokens through a lightweight recache gate that updates only when necessary. This design enables efficient multi-frame integration and efficient inference. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark that more effectively evaluates the long-horizon temporal dependency modeling ability of VLAs. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms baselines on this benchmark by 39.8% absolute improvement in success rate, and achieves a 3.9% gain on the SimplerEnv benchmark. Moreover, SD-VLA delivers a 2.26x inference speedup over the base VLA model on the same benchmark, enabling faster and more practical real-world deployment.

*Hossein B. Jond,Martin Saska*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Bio-inspired anticipatory flocking model (FDA) enhances swarm coordination by blending reactive alignment with predictive neighbor velocity estimates, improving consensus, robustness to delays/noise, and flock displacement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural collectives like bird flocks use anticipatory cues (postural/wingbeat signals) that current reactive flocking models overlook. Multi-rotor attitude tilts also precede directional changes, suggesting anticipatory signals could enhance robotic swarm coordination.

Method: Proposes Future Direction-Aware (FDA) flocking: agents combine reactive alignment with predictive term based on short-term estimates of neighbors' future velocities. Uses tunable blending parameter to interpolate between reactive and anticipatory behaviors.

Result: FDA achieves faster/higher alignment, enhanced translational displacement of flock, improved robustness to sensing/communication delays and measurement noise compared to purely reactive baseline models.

Conclusion: Bio-inspired anticipatory augmentation improves swarm coordination by mitigating destabilizing effects of delays/noise. Future work includes adaptive blending strategies, weighted prediction schemes, and experimental validation on drone swarms.

Abstract: Understanding self-organization in natural collectives such as bird flocks inspires swarm robotics, yet most flocking models remain reactive, overlooking anticipatory cues that enhance coordination. Motivated by avian postural and wingbeat signals, as well as multirotor attitude tilts that precede directional changes, this work introduces a principled, bio-inspired anticipatory augmentation of reactive flocking termed Future Direction-Aware (FDA) flocking. In the proposed framework, agents blend reactive alignment with a predictive term based on short-term estimates of neighbors' future velocities, regulated by a tunable blending parameter that interpolates between reactive and anticipatory behaviors. This predictive structure enhances velocity consensus and cohesion-separation balance while mitigating the adverse effects of sensing and communication delays and measurement noise that destabilize reactive baselines. Simulation results demonstrate that FDA achieves faster and higher alignment, enhanced translational displacement of the flock, and improved robustness to delays and noise compared to a purely reactive model. Future work will investigate adaptive blending strategies, weighted prediction schemes, and experimental validation on multirotor drone swarms.

*Aabha Tamhankar,Jay Patil,Giovanni Pittiglio*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A robotic system for autonomous shaping of neuroendovascular guidewires using patient-specific anatomical data to create navigation-specific wire configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neuroendovascular access relies on manual wire shaping by surgeons based on experience and pre-operative images, which is complex, variable, and expertise-dependent, especially in convoluted anatomy.

Method: Developed a bench-top guidewire shaping robot with a model that maps desired wire shapes into robot actions, calibrated using experimental data. The system can produce common clinical tip geometries (C, S, Angled, Hook) and navigate complex 3D anatomy.

Result: The robot successfully produced clinically common tip geometries with model-predicted shapes showing RMS error of 0.56mm in 2D validation. Demonstrated 3D tip shaping and ability to traverse complex endoluminal navigation from petrous ICA to PComm.

Conclusion: The robotic system enables standardized autonomous shaping of neuroendovascular guidewires, reducing dependence on surgeon expertise and potentially improving consistency in complex anatomical navigation.

Abstract: Neuroendovascular access often relies on passive microwires that are hand-shaped at the back table and then used to track a microcatheter to the target. Neuroendovascular surgeons determine the shape of the wire by examining the patient pre-operative images and using their experience to identify anatomy specific shapes of the wire that would facilitate reaching the target. This procedure is particularly complex in convoluted anatomical structures and is heavily dependent on the level of expertise of the surgeon. Towards enabling standardized autonomous shaping, we present a bench-top guidewire shaping robot capable of producing navigation-specific desired wire configurations. We present a model that can map the desired wire shape into robot actions, calibrated using experimental data. We show that the robot can produce clinically common tip geometries (C, S, Angled, Hook) and validate them with respect to the model-predicted shapes in 2D. Our model predicts the shape with a Root Mean Square (RMS) error of 0.56mm across all shapes when compared to the experimental results. We also demonstrate 3D tip shaping capabilities and the ability to traverse complex endoluminal navigation from the petrous Internal Carotid Artery (ICA) to the Posterior Communicating Artery (PComm).

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Robust quadrotor control in GNSS-denied, non-inertial environments using EKF-UI with external position measurements only, eliminating IMU dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quadrotors operating on moving platforms (trucks, elevators) face GNSS denial and unreliable IMUs due to platform-induced accelerations, causing conventional estimators to fail by confusing quadrotor vs. platform motion.

Method: Uses Extended Kalman Filter with Unknown Inputs (EKF-UI) with only external position measurements (no IMU/GNSS), paired with cascaded PID controller for 3D tracking. Validated with motion capture systems to isolate localization errors.

Result: Experimental validation on moving-cart testbed shows significant stability and trajectory tracking improvements over standard EKF, enabling operation on moving platforms without inertial feedback.

Conclusion: The EKF-UI framework enables robust quadrotor control in non-inertial environments by decoupling platform motion from quadrotor dynamics, facilitating practical deployment on moving vehicles and platforms.

Abstract: We present a robust control and estimation framework for quadrotors operating in Global Navigation Satellite System(GNSS)-denied, non-inertial environments where inertial sensors such as Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) become unreliable due to platform-induced accelerations. In such settings, conventional estimators fail to distinguish whether the measured accelerations arise from the quadrotor itself or from the non-inertial platform, leading to drift and control degradation. Unlike conventional approaches that depend heavily on IMU and GNSS, our method relies exclusively on external position measurements combined with a Extended Kalman Filter with Unknown Inputs (EKF-UI) to account for platform motion. The estimator is paired with a cascaded PID controller for full 3D tracking. To isolate estimator performance from localization errors, all tests are conducted using high-precision motion capture systems. Experimental results in a moving-cart testbed validate our approach under both translational in X-axis and Y-axis dissonance. Compared to standard EKF, the proposed method significantly improves stability and trajectory tracking without requiring inertial feedback, enabling practical deployment on moving platforms such as trucks or elevators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual ultrasonic sacral osteotomy (MUSO) has limitations in trajectory accuracy and depth control, leading to potential over-penetration and safety concerns during delicate sacral resections.

Method: Developed an autonomous USO robotic system integrating an ultrasonic osteotome with a 7-DoF robotic manipulator guided by optical tracking. Compared robotic USO (RUSO) with manual USO (MUSO) using Sawbones phantoms under identical osteotomy conditions.

Result: RUSO achieved sub-millimeter trajectory accuracy (0.11 mm RMSE vs 1.10 mm for MUSO) and precise depth control (8.1 mm vs 16.0 mm over-penetration in MUSO). Robotic system showed order-of-magnitude improvement in accuracy.

Conclusion: Robotic procedures can overcome critical limitations of manual osteotomy, establishing a foundation for safer and more precise sacral resections in clinical applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an autonomous Ultrasonic Sacral Osteotomy (USO) robotic system that integrates an ultrasonic osteotome with a seven-degree-of-freedom (DoF) robotic manipulator guided by an optical tracking system. To assess multi-directional control along both the surface trajectory and cutting depth of this system, we conducted quantitative comparisons between manual USO (MUSO) and robotic USO (RUSO) in Sawbones phantoms under identical osteotomy conditions. The RUSO system achieved sub-millimeter trajectory accuracy (0.11 mm RMSE), an order of magnitude improvement over MUSO (1.10 mm RMSE). Moreover, MUSO trials showed substantial over-penetration (16.0 mm achieved vs. 8.0 mm target), whereas the RUSO system maintained precise depth control (8.1 mm). These results demonstrate that robotic procedures can effectively overcome the critical limitations of manual osteotomy, establishing a foundation for safer and more precise sacral resections.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GenMRP is a generative framework for multi-route planning that combines efficiency with personalization by using a skeleton-to-capillary approach to construct relevant sub-networks and iterative route generation with correctional boosting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches have limitations: precomputed cost methods lack personalization and route diversity, while recent generative methods are too inefficient for large-scale real-time navigation applications.

Method: GenMRP uses a skeleton-to-capillary approach to dynamically construct small relevant sub-networks, then iteratively generates routes using a Link Cost Model that incorporates road features, user history, and previous routes, with correctional boosting to balance quality and diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments show GenMRP achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency in both offline and online environments, and has been successfully deployed in a real-world navigation app.

Conclusion: GenMRP effectively addresses the limitations of existing approaches by providing an efficient, personalized, and diverse multi-route planning solution suitable for industrial-scale navigation applications.

Abstract: Existing industrial-scale navigation applications contend with massive road networks, typically employing two main categories of approaches for route planning. The first relies on precomputed road costs for optimal routing and heuristic algorithms for generating alternatives, while the second, generative methods, has recently gained significant attention. However, the former struggles with personalization and route diversity, while the latter fails to meet the efficiency requirements of large-scale real-time scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose GenMRP, a generative framework for multi-route planning. To ensure generation efficiency, GenMRP first introduces a skeleton-to-capillary approach that dynamically constructs a relevant sub-network significantly smaller than the full road network. Within this sub-network, routes are generated iteratively. The first iteration identifies the optimal route, while the subsequent ones generate alternatives that balance quality and diversity using the newly proposed correctional boosting approach. Each iteration incorporates road features, user historical sequences, and previously generated routes into a Link Cost Model to update road costs, followed by route generation using the Dijkstra algorithm. Extensive experiments show that GenMRP achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency in both offline and online environments. To facilitate further research, we have publicly released the training and evaluation dataset. GenMRP has been fully deployed in a real-world navigation app, demonstrating its effectiveness and benefits.

*Hyeonbeom Choi,Daechul Ahn,Youhan Lee,Taewook Kang,Seongwon Cho,Jonghyun Choi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SCALE is a single-pass inference strategy that modulates both visual perception and action based on self-uncertainty, improving VLA model robustness without additional training or verifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time scaling methods for Vision-Language-Action models require additional training, verifiers, and multiple forward passes, and only intervene at action decoding while keeping visual representations fixed. This is insufficient under perceptual ambiguity where reconsidering perception is as important as deciding actions.

Method: SCALE (Self-uncertainty driven Control for Adaptive Language-Embodied agents) uses a simple inference strategy that jointly modulates visual perception and action based on 'self-uncertainty', inspired by uncertainty-driven exploration in Active Inference theory. It requires no additional training, no verifier, and only a single forward pass.

Result: Experiments on simulated and real-world benchmarks show that SCALE improves state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action models and outperforms existing test-time scaling methods while maintaining single-pass efficiency.

Conclusion: SCALE provides an effective, efficient approach to enhance VLA model robustness by jointly adapting perception and action based on uncertainty, enabling adaptive execution across varying conditions without the overhead of existing methods.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising paradigm for general-purpose robotic control, with test-time scaling (TTS) gaining attention to enhance robustness beyond training. However, existing TTS methods for VLAs require additional training, verifiers, and multiple forward passes, making them impractical for deployment. Moreover, they intervene only at action decoding while keeping visual representations fixed-insufficient under perceptual ambiguity, where reconsidering how to perceive is as important as deciding what to do. To address these limitations, we propose SCALE, a simple inference strategy that jointly modulates visual perception and action based on 'self-uncertainty', inspired by uncertainty-driven exploration in Active Inference theory-requiring no additional training, no verifier, and only a single forward pass. SCALE broadens exploration in both perception and action under high uncertainty, while focusing on exploitation when confident-enabling adaptive execution across varying conditions. Experiments on simulated and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that SCALE improves state-of-the-art VLAs and outperforms existing TTS methods while maintaining single-pass efficiency.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ALORE is an autonomous large-object rearrangement system for legged manipulators that uses hierarchical RL and task planning to efficiently rearrange diverse heavy objects in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rearranging large, heavy objects like furniture is labor-intensive for humans but challenging for robots due to diverse objects, complex environments, and the need for collision-free loco-manipulation of multiple objects.

Method: Three key components: 1) Hierarchical RL training pipeline with high-level object velocity controller on top of low-level whole-body controller; 2) Unified interaction configuration representation and object velocity estimator for single-policy generalization; 3) Task-and-motion planning framework optimizing object visitation order and assignment.

Result: Superior performance in policy generalization, object-velocity tracking accuracy, and multi-object rearrangement efficiency compared to baselines. Successfully completed 8 continuous loops rearranging 32 chairs over 40 minutes without failure, and executed long-distance autonomous rearrangement over ~40m route.

Conclusion: ALORE demonstrates robust and effective autonomous large-object rearrangement for legged manipulators, with validated performance in both simulation and real-world experiments, showing potential to alleviate human workload in furniture rearrangement tasks.

Abstract: Endowing robots with the ability to rearrange various large and heavy objects, such as furniture, can substantially alleviate human workload. However, this task is extremely challenging due to the need to interact with diverse objects and efficiently rearrange multiple objects in complex environments while ensuring collision-free loco-manipulation. In this work, we present ALORE, an autonomous large-object rearrangement system for a legged manipulator that can rearrange various large objects across diverse scenarios. The proposed system is characterized by three main features: (i) a hierarchical reinforcement learning training pipeline for multi-object environment learning, where a high-level object velocity controller is trained on top of a low-level whole-body controller to achieve efficient and stable joint learning across multiple objects; (ii) two key modules, a unified interaction configuration representation and an object velocity estimator, that allow a single policy to regulate planar velocity of diverse objects accurately; and (iii) a task-and-motion planning framework that jointly optimizes object visitation order and object-to-target assignment, improving task efficiency while enabling online replanning. Comparisons against strong baselines show consistent superiority in policy generalization, object-velocity tracking accuracy, and multi-object rearrangement efficiency. Key modules are systematically evaluated, and extensive simulations and real-world experiments are conducted to validate the robustness and effectiveness of the entire system, which successfully completes 8 continuous loops to rearrange 32 chairs over nearly 40 minutes without a single failure, and executes long-distance autonomous rearrangement over an approximately 40 m route.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OAT is a learned action tokenizer for autoregressive robot policies that provides high compression, total decodability, and left-to-right causal ordering, enabling efficient and flexible continuous action generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive policies are promising for scalable robot learning but require effective tokenization of continuous actions. Existing approaches either produce too long token sequences or lack structure needed for next-token prediction.

Method: Ordered Action Tokenization (OAT) uses transformer with registers, finite scalar quantization, and ordering-inducing training mechanisms to discretize action chunks into ordered token sequences that align with autoregressive generation.

Result: Across 20+ tasks in simulation and real-world settings, autoregressive policies with OAT outperform prior tokenization schemes and diffusion-based baselines while offering greater inference flexibility.

Conclusion: OAT provides an effective action tokenization scheme that satisfies key desiderata for autoregressive robot policies, enabling scalable robot learning with discrete abstraction and flexible inference capabilities.

Abstract: Autoregressive policies offer a compelling foundation for scalable robot learning by enabling discrete abstraction, token-level reasoning, and flexible inference. However, applying autoregressive modeling to continuous robot actions requires an effective action tokenization scheme. Existing approaches either rely on analytical discretization methods that produce prohibitively long token sequences, or learned latent tokenizers that lack structure, limiting their compatibility with next-token prediction. In this work, we identify three desiderata for action tokenization - high compression, total decodability, and a left-to-right causally ordered token space - and introduce Ordered Action Tokenization (OAT), a learned action tokenizer that satisfies all three. OAT discretizes action chunks into an ordered sequence of tokens using transformer with registers, finite scalar quantization, and ordering-inducing training mechanisms. The resulting token space aligns naturally with autoregressive generation and enables prefix-based detokenization, yielding an anytime trade-off between inference cost and action fidelity. Across more than 20 tasks spanning four simulation benchmarks and real-world settings, autoregressive policies equipped with OAT consistently outperform prior tokenization schemes and diffusion-based baselines, while offering significantly greater flexibility at inference time.

TL;DR: VLA models for robot manipulation move beyond MSE loss by using Minimum Error Entropy (MEE) objectives to reshape action error distributions, improving performance across various settings with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models use standard supervised losses (cross-entropy for discrete, MSE for continuous actions) that impose strong pointwise constraints. These conventional approaches may not optimally handle error distributions in continuous-action VLA training.

Method: Introduce Minimum Error Entropy (MEE) into VLA architectures with a trajectory-level MEE objective and two weighted variants, combined with MSE for continuous-action training. Applied to multiple VLA architectures across simulation and real-world tasks.

Result: Consistent improvements in success rates and robustness across standard, few-shot, and noisy settings. Gains persist in imbalanced data regimes within a characterized operating range, with negligible training cost and no inference efficiency impact.

Conclusion: MEE-based supervision effectively reshapes action error distributions in VLA models, providing performance improvements across diverse settings while maintaining computational efficiency, with theoretical analyses explaining its effectiveness.

Abstract: In robotic manipulation, vision-language-action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising paradigm for learning generalizable and scalable robot policies. Most existing VLA frameworks rely on standard supervised objectives, typically cross-entropy for discrete actions and mean squared error (MSE) for continuous action regression, which impose strong pointwise constraints on individual predictions. In this work, we focus on continuous-action VLA models and move beyond conventional MSE-based regression by reshaping action error distributions during training. Drawing on information-theoretic principles, we introduce Minimum Error Entropy (MEE) into modern VLA architectures and propose a trajectory-level MEE objective, together with two weighted variants, combined with MSE for continuous-action VLA training. We evaluate our approaches across standard, few-shot, and noisy settings on multiple representative VLA architectures, using simulation benchmarks such as LIBERO and SimplerEnv as well as real-world robotic manipulation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in success rates and robustness across these settings. Under imbalanced data regimes, the gains persist within a well-characterized operating range, while incurring negligible additional training cost and no impact on inference efficiency. We further provide theoretical analyses that explain why MEE-based supervision is effective and characterize its practical range.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing language-guided grasping methods use multi-stage pipelines that separate perception and grasping, leading to poor cross-modal fusion, redundant computation, and limited generalization in cluttered, occluded, or low-texture scenes.

Method: End-to-end multi-task framework built on CLIP architecture with two key innovations: 1) Depth-guided Geometric Module (DGGM) that converts depth into geometric priors injected into attention mechanism, and 2) Adaptive Dense Channel Integration that balances multi-layer features for better visual representations.

Result: Extensive experiments on OCID-VLG dataset and in simulation/real-world hardware demonstrate precise and robust language-guided grasping in complex, cluttered environments, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: GeoLanG enables reliable multimodal robotic manipulation in real-world human-centric settings by unifying visual-linguistic representations and effectively leveraging depth information for better target discrimination in challenging scenes.

Abstract: Language-guided grasping has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling robots to identify and manipulate target objects through natural language instructions, yet it remains highly challenging in cluttered or occluded scenes. Existing methods often rely on multi-stage pipelines that separate object perception and grasping, which leads to limited cross-modal fusion, redundant computation, and poor generalization in cluttered, occluded, or low-texture scenes. To address these limitations, we propose GeoLanG, an end-to-end multi-task framework built upon the CLIP architecture that unifies visual and linguistic inputs into a shared representation space for robust semantic alignment and improved generalization. To enhance target discrimination under occlusion and low-texture conditions, we explore a more effective use of depth information through the Depth-guided Geometric Module (DGGM), which converts depth into explicit geometric priors and injects them into the attention mechanism without additional computational overhead. In addition, we propose Adaptive Dense Channel Integration, which adaptively balances the contributions of multi-layer features to produce more discriminative and generalizable visual representations. Extensive experiments on the OCID-VLG dataset, as well as in both simulation and real-world hardware, demonstrate that GeoLanG enables precise and robust language-guided grasping in complex, cluttered environments, paving the way toward more reliable multimodal robotic manipulation in real-world human-centric settings.

Conclusion: AppleVLM addresses key limitations of existing VLM-based driving models through enhanced perception and planning modules, enabling robust end-to-end autonomous driving with improved generalization across diverse scenarios and real-world deployment capability.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a promising paradigm integrating perception, decision-making, and control within a unified learning framework. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have gained significant attention for their potential to enhance the robustness and generalization of end-to-end driving models in diverse and unseen scenarios. However, existing VLM-based approaches still face challenges, including suboptimal lane perception, language understanding biases, and difficulties in handling corner cases. To address these issues, we propose AppleVLM, an advanced perception and planning-enhanced VLM model for robust end-to-end driving. AppleVLM introduces a novel vision encoder and a planning strategy encoder to improve perception and decision-making. Firstly, the vision encoder fuses spatial-temporal information from multi-view images across multiple timesteps using a deformable transformer mechanism, enhancing robustness to camera variations and facilitating scalable deployment across different vehicle platforms. Secondly, unlike traditional VLM-based approaches, AppleVLM introduces a dedicated planning modality that encodes explicit Bird's-Eye-View spatial information, mitigating language biases in navigation instructions. Finally, a VLM decoder fine-tuned by a hierarchical Chain-of-Thought integrates vision, language, and planning features to output robust driving waypoints. We evaluate AppleVLM in closed-loop experiments on two CARLA benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art driving performance. Furthermore, we deploy AppleVLM on an AGV platform and successfully showcase real-world end-to-end autonomous driving in complex outdoor environments.

*Guoqing Ma,Siheng Wang,Zeyu Zhang,Shan Yu,Hao Tang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GeneralVLA is a hierarchical vision-language-action model that enables zero-shot robotic manipulation by combining affordance perception, 3D trajectory planning, and control policies without requiring real-world data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models show strong generalization in vision and language but limited zero-shot capability in robotics. Current methods struggle with unseen scenarios and require extensive real-world data collection or human demonstrations.

Method: Three-level hierarchical VLA model: 1) High-level ASM for affordance segmentation, 2) Mid-level 3DAgent for task understanding and 3D trajectory planning, 3) Low-level 3D-aware control policy for precise manipulation. No real-world data collection needed.

Result: Successfully generates trajectories for 14 tasks, outperforming VoxPoser. Generated demonstrations train more robust behavior cloning policies than human demonstrations or data from VoxPoser, Scaling-up, and Code-As-Policies.

Conclusion: GeneralVLA provides a scalable method for both generating robotic data and solving novel tasks in zero-shot settings, bridging the generalization gap between foundation models and robotics.

Abstract: Large foundation models have shown strong open-world generalization to complex problems in vision and language, but similar levels of generalization have yet to be achieved in robotics. One fundamental challenge is that the models exhibit limited zero-shot capability, which hampers their ability to generalize effectively to unseen scenarios. In this work, we propose GeneralVLA (Generalizable Vision-Language-Action Models with Knowledge-Guided Trajectory Planning), a hierarchical vision-language-action (VLA) model that can be more effective in utilizing the generalization of foundation models, enabling zero-shot manipulation and automatically generating data for robotics. In particular, we study a class of hierarchical VLA model where the high-level ASM (Affordance Segmentation Module) is finetuned to perceive image keypoint affordances of the scene; the mid-level 3DAgent carries out task understanding, skill knowledge, and trajectory planning to produce a 3D path indicating the desired robot end-effector trajectory. The intermediate 3D path prediction is then served as guidance to the low-level, 3D-aware control policy capable of precise manipulation. Compared to alternative approaches, our method requires no real-world robotic data collection or human demonstration, making it much more scalable to diverse tasks and viewpoints. Empirically, GeneralVLA successfully generates trajectories for 14 tasks, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as VoxPoser. The generated demonstrations can train more robust behavior cloning policies than training with human demonstrations or from data generated by VoxPoser, Scaling-up, and Code-As-Policies. We believe GeneralVLA can be the scalable method for both generating data for robotics and solving novel tasks in a zero-shot setting. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/GeneralVLA.

Conclusion: SDD Planner effectively reconciles safety constraints with driving styles in real time, demonstrating superior performance across benchmarks and practical applicability for real-world autonomous driving deployment.

Abstract: Achieving safe and stylized trajectory planning in complex real-world scenarios remains a critical challenge for autonomous driving systems. This paper proposes the SDD Planner, a diffusion-based framework designed to effectively reconcile safety constraints with driving styles in real time. The framework integrates two core modules: a Multi-Source Style-Aware Encoder, which employs distance-sensitive attention to fuse dynamic agent data and environmental contexts for heterogeneous safety-style perception; and a Style-Guided Dynamic Trajectory Generator, which adaptively modulates priority weights within the diffusion denoising process to generate user-preferred yet safe trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDD Planner achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the StyleDrive benchmark, it improves the SM-PDMS metric by 3.9% over WoTE, the strongest baseline. Furthermore, on the NuPlan Test14 and Test14-hard benchmarks, SDD Planner ranks first with overall scores of 91.76 and 80.32, respectively, outperforming leading methods such as PLUTO. Real-vehicle closed-loop tests further confirm that SDD Planner maintains high safety standards while aligning with preset driving styles, validating its practical applicability for real-world deployment.

*Dhyey Manish Rajani,Michael Milford,Tobias Fischer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Automatic threshold selection for Visual Place Recognition that maximizes recall while meeting user-defined precision requirements, eliminating manual tuning and adapting to environmental changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VPR systems require hand-tuned thresholds that are fixed during deployment, leading to degraded performance under environmental changes. There's a need for automatic threshold selection that adapts to new environments while maintaining performance.

Method: Uses a small calibration traversal with known correspondences and transfers thresholds to deployment via quantile normalization of similarity score distributions. This ensures threshold stability across calibration sizes and query subsets.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering up to 25% higher recall in high-precision operating regimes. The method is robust to sampling variability and eliminates manual tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides automatic, adaptive threshold selection for VPR systems that generalizes across operating conditions and environments, significantly improving performance while eliminating manual parameter tuning.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a key component for localisation in GNSS-denied environments, but its performance critically depends on selecting an image matching threshold (operating point) that balances precision and recall. Thresholds are typically hand-tuned offline for a specific environment and fixed during deployment, leading to degraded performance under environmental change. We propose a method that, given a user-defined precision requirement, automatically selects the operating point of a VPR system to maximise recall. The method uses a small calibration traversal with known correspondences and transfers thresholds to deployment via quantile normalisation of similarity score distributions. This quantile transfer ensures that thresholds remain stable across calibration sizes and query subsets, making the method robust to sampling variability. Experiments with multiple state-of-the-art VPR techniques and datasets show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art, delivering up to 25% higher recall in high-precision operating regimes. The method eliminates manual tuning by adapting to new environments and generalising across operating conditions. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid robots experience significant performance degradation when facing small changes in dynamics, task specifications, or environment conditions, necessitating robust control methods that can adapt to domain shifts without per-domain retraining.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Train a teacher policy using history-conditioned reinforcement learning that infers latent dynamics context from recent state-action trajectories, 2) Perform online distillation to transfer teacher's capabilities to a transformer-based student policy operating on sparse root-relative 3D joint keypoint trajectories.

Conclusion: Combining history-conditioned adaptation with online distillation creates a robust humanoid control framework that can adapt to domain shifts, demonstrating superior performance in challenging scenarios with unseen dynamics and perturbations.

Abstract: Humanoid robots can suffer significant performance drops under small changes in dynamics, task specifications, or environment setup. We propose HoRD, a two-stage learning framework for robust humanoid control under domain shift. First, we train a high-performance teacher policy via history-conditioned reinforcement learning, where the policy infers latent dynamics context from recent state--action trajectories to adapt online to diverse randomized dynamics. Second, we perform online distillation to transfer the teacher's robust control capabilities into a transformer-based student policy that operates on sparse root-relative 3D joint keypoint trajectories. By combining history-conditioned adaptation with online distillation, HoRD enables a single policy to adapt zero-shot to unseen domains without per-domain retraining.

*Tobias Cook,Leo Micklem,Huazhi Dong,Yunjie Yang,Michael Mistry,Francesco Giorgio Serchi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Soft morphing wings with proprioceptive sensing enable underwater vehicles to detect and reject hydrodynamic disturbances in shallow waters, mimicking biological strategies for stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unmanned underwater vehicles struggle with stability in shallow waters due to waves, currents, and turbulence, while marine organisms successfully navigate these conditions using proprioceptive feedback and flexible appendages.

Method: Developed soft morphing wings with proprioceptive sensing that detect flow disturbances through camber deformation, created a dynamic model of hydraulically actuated soft wing, implemented curvature-based sensing for angle of attack estimation, and designed a controller using disturbance observer.

Result: Experimental validation showed accurate disturbance estimation in angle of attack and successful disturbance rejection in lift response using proprioceptive estimates.

Conclusion: Proprioceptive sensing combined with disturbance observer provides a biologically-inspired solution for soft underwater vehicles to maintain stability in hazardous shallow water environments.

Abstract: Unmanned underwater vehicles are increasingly employed for maintenance and surveying tasks at sea, but their operation in shallow waters is often hindered by hydrodynamic disturbances such as waves, currents, and turbulence. These unsteady flows can induce rapid changes in direction and speed, compromising vehicle stability and manoeuvrability. Marine organisms contend with such conditions by combining proprioceptive feedback with flexible fins and tails to reject disturbances. Inspired by this strategy, we propose soft morphing wings endowed with proprioceptive sensing to mitigate environmental perturbations. The wing's continuous deformation provides a natural means to infer dynamic disturbances: sudden changes in camber directly reflect variations in the oncoming flow. By interpreting this proprioceptive signal, a disturbance observer can reconstruct flow parameters in real time. To enable this, we develop and experimentally validate a dynamic model of a hydraulically actuated soft wing with controllable camber. We then show that curvature-based sensing allows accurate estimation of disturbances in the angle of attack. Finally, we demonstrate that a controller leveraging these proprioceptive estimates can reject disturbances in the lift response of the soft wing. By combining proprioceptive sensing with a disturbance observer, this technique mirrors biological strategies and provides a pathway for soft underwater vehicles to maintain stability in hazardous environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid robot deployment is challenging due to the need for tight integration of perception, locomotion, and manipulation under partial information and dynamic environments, requiring robust transitions between different sub-tasks.

Method: Proposes EgoActing task and EgoActor model - a unified VLM that predicts locomotion primitives, head movements, manipulation commands, and human-robot interactions. Uses multi-source supervision: real-world egocentric RGB demonstrations, spatial reasoning QA, and simulated environment demonstrations.

Result: EgoActor achieves fluent action inference under 1 second with both 8B and 4B parameter models, effectively bridges abstract task planning with concrete motor execution, and generalizes across diverse tasks and unseen environments in both simulated and real-world evaluations.

Conclusion: EgoActor demonstrates that a unified vision-language model can effectively ground high-level instructions into precise humanoid actions, enabling robust, context-aware decision-making and fluent execution in dynamic real-world settings.

Abstract: Deploying humanoid robots in real-world settings is fundamentally challenging, as it demands tight integration of perception, locomotion, and manipulation under partial-information observations and dynamically changing environments. As well as transitioning robustly between sub-tasks of different types. Towards addressing these challenges, we propose a novel task - EgoActing, which requires directly grounding high-level instructions into various, precise, spatially aware humanoid actions. We further instantiate this task by introducing EgoActor, a unified and scalable vision-language model (VLM) that can predict locomotion primitives (e.g., walk, turn, move sideways, change height), head movements, manipulation commands, and human-robot interactions to coordinate perception and execution in real-time. We leverage broad supervision over egocentric RGB-only data from real-world demonstrations, spatial reasoning question-answering, and simulated environment demonstrations, enabling EgoActor to make robust, context-aware decisions and perform fluent action inference (under 1s) with both 8B and 4B parameter models. Extensive evaluations in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that EgoActor effectively bridges abstract task planning and concrete motor execution, while generalizing across diverse tasks and unseen environments.

TL;DR: TACO is a replay-free continual neural mapping framework that treats past model snapshots as temporal neighbors and enforces weighted consensus with historical representations to adapt to changing environments without storing previous data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural mapping systems fail to support continual adaptation to changing environments under strict memory/computation constraints, relying on replaying historical observations and assuming static scenes, which doesn't work for dynamic robotic settings.

Method: Reformulates mapping as temporal consensus optimization, treating past model snapshots as temporal neighbors. Updates current map by enforcing weighted consensus with historical representations, allowing reliable past geometry to constrain optimization while permitting unreliable/outdated regions to be revised.

Result: TACO robustly adapts to scene changes and consistently outperforms other continual learning baselines in both simulated and real-world experiments, achieving balance between memory efficiency and adaptability without storing/replaying previous data.

Conclusion: TACO provides an effective replay-free framework for continual neural mapping that enables robots to adapt to changing environments while maintaining memory and computational efficiency, addressing key limitations of existing mapping systems.

Abstract: Neural implicit mapping has emerged as a powerful paradigm for robotic navigation and scene understanding. However, real-world robotic deployment requires continual adaptation to changing environments under strict memory and computation constraints, which existing mapping systems fail to support. Most prior methods rely on replaying historical observations to preserve consistency and assume static scenes. As a result, they cannot adapt to continual learning in dynamic robotic settings. To address these challenges, we propose TACO (TemporAl Consensus Optimization), a replay-free framework for continual neural mapping. We reformulate mapping as a temporal consensus optimization problem, where we treat past model snapshots as temporal neighbors. Intuitively, our approach resembles a model consulting its own past knowledge. We update the current map by enforcing weighted consensus with historical representations. Our method allows reliable past geometry to constrain optimization while permitting unreliable or outdated regions to be revised in response to new observations. TACO achieves a balance between memory efficiency and adaptability without storing or replaying previous data. Through extensive simulated and real-world experiments, we show that TACO robustly adapts to scene changes, and consistently outperforms other continual learning baselines.

TL;DR: Unicomp: A unified discrete-time modeling framework for robotic manipulation that consistently captures both free motion and frictional contact using complementarity-based dynamics, enabling stable contact-rich behaviors at interactive speeds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robotic manipulation planners separate free-space motion and contact regimes or use simplified contact representations, limiting fidelity of contact-mode transitions and hindering robust execution of contact-rich behaviors in real time.

Method: Presents Unicomp framework using complementarity-based rigid-body dynamics, formulating free-space motion and contact as coupled linear/nonlinear complementarity problems. For planar patch contact, derives frictional contact model from maximum power dissipation principle with ellipsoidal limit surface representation.

Result: The formulation yields a discrete-time predictive model relating generalized velocities and contact wrenches through quadratic constraints, suitable for real-time optimization-based planning. Experimental results show stable, physically consistent behavior at interactive speeds.

Conclusion: Unicomp enables principled transitions between contact modes without fixed-contact assumptions, capturing coupled force-moment effects including torsional friction, and supports contact-rich whole-body maneuvers in real-time robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments requires planners to reason jointly about free-space motion and sustained, frictional contact with the environment. Existing (local) planning and simulation frameworks typically separate these regimes or rely on simplified contact representations, particularly when modeling non-convex or distributed contact patches. Such approximations limit the fidelity of contact-mode transitions and hinder the robust execution of contact-rich behaviors in real time. This paper presents a unified discrete-time modeling framework for robotic manipulation that consistently captures both free motion and frictional contact within a single mathematical formalism (Unicomp). Building on complementarity-based rigid-body dynamics, we formulate free-space motion and contact interactions as coupled linear and nonlinear complementarity problems, enabling principled transitions between contact modes without enforcing fixed-contact assumptions. For planar patch contact, we derive a frictional contact model from the maximum power dissipation principle in which the set of admissible contact wrenches is represented by an ellipsoidal limit surface. This representation captures coupled force-moment effects, including torsional friction, while remaining agnostic to the underlying pressure distribution across the contact patch. The resulting formulation yields a discrete-time predictive model that relates generalized velocities and contact wrenches through quadratic constraints and is suitable for real-time optimization-based planning. Experimental results show that the proposed approach enables stable, physically consistent behavior at interactive speeds across tasks, from planar pushing to contact-rich whole-body maneuvers.

Conclusion: CoMe-VLA framework successfully enables versatile active perception for manipulation by leveraging human egocentric data, providing structured approach to complex environment interaction through cognitive and memory-aware architecture.

Abstract: Achieving generalizable manipulation in unconstrained environments requires the robot to proactively resolve information uncertainty, i.e., the capability of active perception. However, existing methods are often confined in limited types of sensing behaviors, restricting their applicability to complex environments. In this work, we formalize active perception as a non-Markovian process driven by information gain and decision branching, providing a structured categorization of visual active perception paradigms. Building on this perspective, we introduce CoMe-VLA, a cognitive and memory-aware vision-language-action (VLA) framework that leverages large-scale human egocentric data to learn versatile exploration and manipulation priors. Our framework integrates a cognitive auxiliary head for autonomous sub-task transitions and a dual-track memory system to maintain consistent self and environmental awareness by fusing proprioceptive and visual temporal contexts. By aligning human and robot hand-eye coordination behaviors in a unified egocentric action space, we train the model progressively in three stages. Extensive experiments on a wheel-based humanoid have demonstrated strong robustness and adaptability of our proposed method across diverse long-horizon tasks spanning multiple active perception scenarios.

*Roberto Ferroni,Daniele Filippo Mauceri,Jacopo Carpaneto,Alessandra Pedrocchi,Tommaso Proietti*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Soft shoulder exosuit redesign (v2) improves comfort and functional mobility while maintaining assistive performance compared to previous version (v1).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous wearable exosuits for shoulder assistance often neglect comfort as an explicit design objective, despite its critical importance for real-life, long-term usage and user adoption.

Method: Redesigned soft shoulder exosuit (v2) with improved comfort features and shifted assistance from coronal to sagittal plane for better functional hand positioning. Conducted controlled comparison between v1 and v2 with 8 healthy participants performing static holding, dynamic lifting, and functional pick-and-place tasks, measuring muscle activity, kinematics, and user-reported outcomes.

Result: Both versions increased endurance time and reduced deltoid activation, but v2 showed clear advantages: facilitated forward arm positioning, increased transverse plane mobility by up to 30°, and substantial improvements in wearability with lower perceived pressure and higher ratings in effectiveness, ease of use, and comfort.

Conclusion: Targeted, user-centered design refinements can improve both comfort and functional interaction without compromising assistive performance, advancing the development of soft exosuits suitable for prolonged daily use.

Abstract: Reduced shoulder mobility limits upper-limb function and the performance of activities of daily living across a wide range of conditions. Wearable exosuits have shown promise in assisting arm elevation, reducing muscle effort, and supporting functional movements; however, comfort is rarely prioritized as an explicit design objective, despite it strongly affects real-life, long-term usage. This study presents a redesigned soft shoulder exosuit (Soft Shoulder v2) developed to address comfort-related limitations identified in our previous version, while preserving assistive performance. In parallel, assistance was also improved, shifting from the coronal plane to the sagittal plane to better support functionally relevant hand positioning. A controlled comparison between the previous (v1) and redesigned (v2) modules was conducted in eight healthy participants, who performed static holding, dynamic lifting, and a functional pick and place task. Muscle activity, kinematics, and user-reported outcomes were assessed. Both versions increased endurance time, reduced deltoid activation, and preserved transparency during unpowered shoulder elevation. However, the difference between them emerged most clearly during functional tasks and comfort evaluation. The redesigned module facilitated forward arm positioning and increased transverse plane mobility by up to 30 deg, without increasing muscular demand. User-reported outcomes further indicated a substantial improvement in wearability, with markedly lower perceived pressure and higher ratings in effectiveness, ease of use, and comfort compared to the previous design. Taken together, these findings show that targeted, user-centered design refinements can improve comfort and functional interaction without compromising assistive performance, advancing the development of soft exosuits suitable for prolonged and daily use.

TL;DR: Thesis presents Radar-Inertial Odometry (RIO) algorithms for UAV navigation using low-cost FMCW radar and IMU fusion, with novel EKF and factor graph approaches plus deep learning for point correspondence in noisy radar data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radar sensing technology has advanced with miniaturization and precision improvements, making it attractive for robotics. Traditional sensors like LiDAR and cameras fail in extreme conditions (smoke, fog, extreme illumination), but radar is immune to these due to electromagnetic wave characteristics. Need for robust navigation in challenging environments using affordable sensors.

Method: Developed Radar-Inertial Odometry (RIO) algorithms using multi-state tightly-coupled Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Factor Graphs (FG) to fuse IMU readings with radar data (instantaneous velocities and distances to 3D points). Used lightweight, low-cost FMCW radar. Also introduced deep learning approach to find 3D point correspondences in sparse, noisy radar point clouds.

Result: Real-time capable algorithms running on portable, resource-constrained embedded computers using inexpensive consumer-grade sensors. Demonstrated fusion of radar and IMU for UAV navigation state estimation in challenging environmental conditions where traditional sensors fail.

Conclusion: Radar-Inertial Odometry provides robust navigation solution for UAVs in extreme environmental conditions using affordable sensors. The combination of traditional filtering approaches (EKF, factor graphs) with modern deep learning techniques enables effective handling of sparse, noisy radar data for real-time operation.

Abstract: Recently, the progress in the radar sensing technology consisting in the miniaturization of the packages and increase in measuring precision has drawn the interest of the robotics research community. Indeed, a crucial task enabling autonomy in robotics is to precisely determine the pose of the robot in space. To fulfill this task sensor fusion algorithms are often used, in which data from one or several exteroceptive sensors like, for example, LiDAR, camera, laser ranging sensor or GNSS are fused together with the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) measurements to obtain an estimate of the navigation states of the robot. Nonetheless, owing to their particular sensing principles, some exteroceptive sensors are often incapacitated in extreme environmental conditions, like extreme illumination or presence of fine particles in the environment like smoke or fog. Radars are largely immune to aforementioned factors thanks to the characteristics of electromagnetic waves they use. In this thesis, we present Radar-Inertial Odometry (RIO) algorithms to fuse the information from IMU and radar in order to estimate the navigation states of a (Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle) UAV capable of running on a portable resource-constrained embedded computer in real-time and making use of inexpensive, consumer-grade sensors. We present novel RIO approaches relying on the multi-state tightly-coupled Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Factor Graphs (FG) fusing instantaneous velocities of and distances to 3D points delivered by a lightweight, low-cost, off-the-shelf Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar with IMU readings. We also show a novel way to exploit advances in deep learning to retrieve 3D point correspondences in sparse and noisy radar point clouds.

*Julia Kuhn,Francesco Verdoja,Tsvetomila Mihaylova,Ville Kyrki*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Adding explicit spatial relations to 3D scene graphs improves LLMs' ability to ground objects from natural language commands, with open-vocabulary VLM-generated relations showing limited advantage over closed-vocabulary ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots need to understand natural language commands in human environments, requiring task inference, action decomposition, and grounding in environmental knowledge. Current 3D scene graphs often lack explicit spatial relations that humans use to describe environments, limiting LLMs' ability to interpret commands effectively.

Method: Proposed an LLM-based pipeline for target object grounding from open-vocabulary language commands, and a VLM-based pipeline to add open-vocabulary spatial edges to 3D scene graphs from robot-captured images. Evaluated two LLMs on downstream task of target object grounding with different spatial relation representations.

Result: Explicit spatial relations in 3D scene graphs improve LLMs' object grounding ability. Open-vocabulary relation generation with VLMs is feasible from robot-captured images, but shows limited advantage over closed-vocabulary relations.

Conclusion: Incorporating spatial relations into 3D scene graphs enhances natural language command interpretation for robots, with both open- and closed-vocabulary approaches being viable, though the practical advantage of open-vocabulary relations is modest.

Abstract: Robots are finding wider adoption in human environments, increasing the need for natural human-robot interaction. However, understanding a natural language command requires the robot to infer the intended task and how to decompose it into executable actions, and to ground those actions in the robot's knowledge of the environment, including relevant objects, agents, and locations. This challenge can be addressed by combining the capabilities of Large language models (LLMs) to understand natural language with 3D scene graphs (3DSGs) for grounding inferred actions in a semantic representation of the environment. However, many 3DSGs lack explicit spatial relations between objects, even though humans often rely on these relations to describe an environment. This paper investigates whether incorporating open- or closed-vocabulary spatial relations into 3DSGs can improve the ability of LLMs to interpret natural language commands. To address this, we propose an LLM-based pipeline for target object grounding from open-vocabulary language commands and a vision language model (VLM)-based pipeline to add open-vocabulary spatial edges to 3DSGs from images captured while mapping. Finally, two LLMs are evaluated in a study assessing their performance on the downstream task of target object grounding. Our study demonstrates that explicit spatial relations improve the ability of LLMs to ground objects. Moreover, open-vocabulary relation generation with VLMs proves feasible from robot-captured images, but their advantage over closed-vocabulary relations is found to be limited.

TL;DR: Vision-gated control for active lumbar exoskeleton using egocentric vision and gaze tracking improves assistance timing and user experience in load lifting tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing back-support exoskeletons lack timely and context-aware assistance; current approaches use load estimation or vision systems that don't directly inform control, creating a need for more responsive assistance.

Method: Vision-gated control framework integrating real-time grasp detection from first-person YOLO-based perception, finite-state machine for task progression, and variable admittance controller that adapts torque to posture and object state.

Result: Vision-gated assistance significantly reduces perceived physical demand and improves fluency, trust, and comfort; enables earlier and stronger assistance; users prefer vision-gated mode over non-vision and no-exoskeleton conditions.

Conclusion: Egocentric vision enhances responsiveness, ergonomics, safety, and acceptance of back-support exoskeletons by providing context-aware assistance.

Abstract: Back-support exoskeletons have been proposed to mitigate spinal loading in industrial handling, yet their effectiveness critically depends on timely and context-aware assistance. Most existing approaches rely either on load-estimation techniques (e.g., EMG, IMU) or on vision systems that do not directly inform control. In this work, we present a vision-gated control framework for an active lumbar occupational exoskeleton that leverages egocentric vision with wearable gaze tracking. The proposed system integrates real-time grasp detection from a first-person YOLO-based perception system, a finite-state machine (FSM) for task progression, and a variable admittance controller to adapt torque delivery to both posture and object state. A user study with 15 participants performing stooping load lifting trials under three conditions (no exoskeleton, exoskeleton without vision, exoskeleton with vision) shows that vision-gated assistance significantly reduces perceived physical demand and improves fluency, trust, and comfort. Quantitative analysis reveals earlier and stronger assistance when vision is enabled, while questionnaire results confirm user preference for the vision-gated mode. These findings highlight the potential of egocentric vision to enhance the responsiveness, ergonomics, safety, and acceptance of back-support exoskeletons.

*Nozomi Nakajima,Pedro Reynolds-Cuéllar,Caitrin Lynch,Kate Darling*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Analysis of robotics publications shows minimal concrete definitions/examples of "dull, dirty, dangerous" (DDD) work, prompting development of a framework for better job context consideration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The DDD concept is widely used in robotics to justify robot applications, but lacks clear definitions and concrete examples in the literature, creating a need for better conceptualization.

Method: 1) Empirical analysis of robotics publications (1980-2024) mentioning DDD; 2) Review of social science literature on dull, dirty, dangerous work; 3) Development of a framework for considering job context.

Result: Only 2.7% of publications define DDD, and only 8.7% provide concrete examples of DDD tasks/jobs, revealing significant gaps in how the robotics community conceptualizes and applies the DDD concept.

Conclusion: The paper proposes a framework to help robotics researchers better consider job contexts when applying the DDD concept, encouraging more informed perspectives on robotics' impact on human labor.

Abstract: In robotics, the concept of "dull, dirty, and dangerous" (DDD) work has been used to motivate where robots might be useful. In this paper, we conduct an empirical analysis of robotics publications between 1980 and 2024 that mention DDD, and find that only 2.7% of publications define DDD and 8.7% of publications provide concrete examples of tasks or jobs that are DDD. We then review the social science literature on "dull," "dirty," and "dangerous" work to provide definitions and guidance on how to conceptualize DDD for robotics. Finally, we propose a framework that helps the robotics community consider the job context for our technology, encouraging a more informed perspective on how robotics may impact human labor.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PDF-HR is a lightweight pose prior for humanoid robots that represents pose distribution as a continuous differentiable manifold, predicting distance to plausible poses for optimization and control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pose and motion priors are crucial for humanoid robotics but limited adoption due to scarcity of high-quality humanoid motion data, despite extensive study in human motion recovery domains.

Method: Introduces Pose Distance Fields for Humanoid Robots (PDF-HR) - a continuous, differentiable manifold that predicts distance of arbitrary poses to a corpus of retargeted robot poses, providing smooth plausibility measure.

Result: PDF-HR consistently and substantially strengthens strong baselines across diverse humanoid tasks including motion tracking, style-based mimicry, and general motion retargeting.

Conclusion: PDF-HR serves as an effective plug-and-play prior that can be integrated as reward shaping, regularizer, or standalone plausibility scorer, enhancing various humanoid robotics pipelines.

Abstract: Pose and motion priors play a crucial role in humanoid robotics. Although such priors have been widely studied in human motion recovery (HMR) domain with a range of models, their adoption for humanoid robots remains limited, largely due to the scarcity of high-quality humanoid motion data. In this work, we introduce Pose Distance Fields for Humanoid Robots (PDF-HR), a lightweight prior that represents the robot pose distribution as a continuous and differentiable manifold. Given an arbitrary pose, PDF-HR predicts its distance to a large corpus of retargeted robot poses, yielding a smooth measure of pose plausibility that is well suited for optimization and control. PDF-HR can be integrated as a reward shaping term, a regularizer, or a standalone plausibility scorer across diverse pipelines. We evaluate PDF-HR on various humanoid tasks, including single-trajectory motion tracking, general motion tracking, style-based motion mimicry, and general motion retargeting. Experiments show that this plug-and-play prior consistently and substantially strengthens strong baselines. Code and models will be released.

### [153] [Capturing Visual Environment Structure Correlates with Control Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04880)
*Jiahua Dong,Yunze Man,Pavel Tokmakov,Yu-Xiong Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Probing visual encoders for environment state decoding accuracy strongly correlates with downstream policy performance, enabling efficient representation selection for robot policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct evaluation of visual representations via policy rollouts is expensive, and existing proxy metrics focus too narrowly on specific visual aspects like object shape, limiting generalization across environments.

Method: Probe pretrained visual encoders by measuring how well they support decoding of environment state (geometry, object structure, physical attributes) from images using simulation environments with ground-truth state access.

Result: Probing accuracy strongly correlates with downstream policy performance across diverse environments and learning settings, significantly outperforming prior metrics and enabling efficient representation selection.

Conclusion: Learning to encode the latent physical state of the environment is a promising objective for control, and the study provides insight into representational properties that support generalizable manipulation.

Abstract: The choice of visual representation is key to scaling generalist robot policies. However, direct evaluation via policy rollouts is expensive, even in simulation. Existing proxy metrics focus on the representation's capacity to capture narrow aspects of the visual world, like object shape, limiting generalization across environments. In this paper, we take an analytical perspective: we probe pretrained visual encoders by measuring how well they support decoding of environment state -- including geometry, object structure, and physical attributes -- from images. Leveraging simulation environments with access to ground-truth state, we show that this probing accuracy strongly correlates with downstream policy performance across diverse environments and learning settings, significantly outperforming prior metrics and enabling efficient representation selection. More broadly, our study provides insight into the representational properties that support generalizable manipulation, suggesting that learning to encode the latent physical state of the environment is a promising objective for control.
