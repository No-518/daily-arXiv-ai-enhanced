### [1] [MA-LipNet: Multi-Dimensional Attention Networks for Robust Lipreading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20881)
*Matteo Rossi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MA-LipNet uses multi-attention modules across channel, spatial, and temporal dimensions to purify visual features for improved lipreading performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lipreading methods suffer from limited feature discriminability and poor generalization due to subtle articulatory gestures, requiring better feature purification.

Method: Proposes MA-LipNet with three sequential attention modules: Channel Attention (CA) for channel-wise recalibration, Joint Spatial-Temporal Attention (JSTA) for coarse-grained filtering, and Separate Spatial-Temporal Attention (SSTA) for fine-grained refinement.

Result: Extensive experiments on CMLR and GRID datasets show significant reductions in Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER), outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Multi-dimensional feature refinement through attention mechanisms is crucial for robust visual speech recognition, with MA-LipNet demonstrating effectiveness and superiority.

Abstract: Lipreading, the technology of decoding spoken content from silent videos of lip movements, holds significant application value in fields such as public security. However, due to the subtle nature of articulatory gestures, existing lipreading methods often suffer from limited feature discriminability and poor generalization capabilities. To address these challenges, this paper delves into the purification of visual features from temporal, spatial, and channel dimensions. We propose a novel method named Multi-Attention Lipreading Network(MA-LipNet). The core of MA-LipNet lies in its sequential application of three dedicated attention modules. Firstly, a \textit{Channel Attention (CA)} module is employed to adaptively recalibrate channel-wise features, thereby mitigating interference from less informative channels. Subsequently, two spatio-temporal attention modules with distinct granularities-\textit{Joint Spatial-Temporal Attention (JSTA)} and \textit{Separate Spatial-Temporal Attention (SSTA)}-are leveraged to suppress the influence of irrelevant pixels and video frames. The JSTA module performs a coarse-grained filtering by computing a unified weight map across the spatio-temporal dimensions, while the SSTA module conducts a more fine-grained refinement by separately modeling temporal and spatial attentions. Extensive experiments conducted on the CMLR and GRID datasets demonstrate that MA-LipNet significantly reduces the Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER), validating its effectiveness and superiority over several state-of-the-art methods. Our work highlights the importance of multi-dimensional feature refinement for robust visual speech recognition.

### [2] [Non-Markov Multi-Round Conversational Image Generation with History-Conditioned MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20911)
*Haochen Zhang,Animesh Sinha,Felix Juefei-Xu,Haoyu Ma,Kunpeng Li,Zhipeng Fan,Meng Dong,Xiaoliang Dai,Tingbo Hou,Peizhao Zhang,Zecheng He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses non-Markov conversational image generation where models must track and reference long-range chat history across multiple rounds, not just the most recent image.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal LLMs for image generation use Markov approaches that only consider the most recent image, enabling shortcuts that ignore long-range history. Real conversations require referencing earlier states, undoing changes, and tracking entities across rounds.

Method: Three key contributions: (1) non-Markov data construction with rollback editing and name-based multi-round personalization, (2) history-conditioned training with token-level caching to prevent identity drift, and (3) improvements for image reconstruction and editable personalization including a DiT detokenizer and multi-stage fine-tuning curriculum.

Result: Explicit training for non-Markov interactions yields substantial improvements in multi-round consistency and instruction compliance while maintaining strong single-round editing and personalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The work formalizes and addresses the challenging non-Markov setting for conversational image generation, demonstrating that explicitly modeling long-range dependencies leads to better multi-round interaction quality.

Abstract: Conversational image generation requires a model to follow user instructions across multiple rounds of interaction, grounded in interleaved text and images that accumulate as chat history. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can generate and edit images, most existing multi-turn benchmarks and training recipes are effectively Markov: the next output depends primarily on the most recent image, enabling shortcut solutions that ignore long-range history. In this work we formalize and target the more challenging non-Markov setting, where a user may refer back to earlier states, undo changes, or reference entities introduced several rounds ago. We present (i) non-Markov multi-round data construction strategies, including rollback-style editing that forces retrieval of earlier visual states and name-based multi-round personalization that binds names to appearances across rounds; (ii) a history-conditioned training and inference framework with token-level caching to prevent multi-round identity drift; and (iii) enabling improvements for high-fidelity image reconstruction and editable personalization, including a reconstruction-based DiT detokenizer and a multi-stage fine-tuning curriculum. We demonstrate that explicitly training for non-Markov interactions yields substantial improvements in multi-round consistency and instruction compliance, while maintaining strong single-round editing and personalization.

*Xuehua Ye,Hongxu Yang,Adam J. Schwarz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel text-guided denoising method using CLIP features with U-Net architecture improves PET image quality across various count levels in a single model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PET imaging is crucial for medical diagnostics but suffers from complicated noise that obscures critical information, affected by scanner hardware, reconstruction, tracer properties, dose/count levels, and acquisition time.

Method: Proposes a text-guided denoising method using features from a pretrained CLIP model integrated with a U-Net based denoising architecture to enhance PET images across various count levels.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements in both qualitative and quantitative assessments of PET image quality.

Conclusion: The model's flexibility demonstrates potential for handling more complex denoising demands and reducing acquisition time in PET imaging.

Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging is a vital tool in medical diagnostics, offering detailed insights into molecular processes within the human body. However, PET images often suffer from complicated noise, which can obscure critical diagnostic information. The quality of the PET image is impacted by various factors including scanner hardware, image reconstruction, tracer properties, dose/count level, and acquisition time. In this study, we propose a novel text-guided denoising method capable of enhancing PET images across a wide range of count levels within a single model. The model utilized the features from a pretrained CLIP model with a U-Net based denoising model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model leads significant improvements in both qualitative and quantitative assessments. The flexibility of the model shows the potential for helping more complicated denoising demands or reducing the acquisition time.

### [4] [Low performing pixel correction in computed tomography with unrolled network and synthetic data training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20995)
*Hongxu Yang,Levente Lippenszky,Edina Timko,Lehel Ferenczi,Gopal Avinash*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unrolled dual-domain method using synthetic data corrects low performance pixel artifacts in CT without needing real clinical data, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low performance pixels in CT detectors cause ring/streak artifacts making images clinically unusable. Existing supervised deep learning methods require expensive real datasets and focus only on image or sinogram domain separately, ignoring intrinsic CT geometry correlations.

Method: Proposed unrolled dual-domain method leveraging synthetic data generated from natural images. Uses intrinsic correlations between sinogram and image domains through synthetic data, enabling artifact correction without real clinical data.

Result: Outperformed state-of-the-art approaches by large margin in experiments simulating 1-2% detector defects near isocenter. Method corrects LPP artifacts without costly data collection and is adaptable to different scanner settings.

Conclusion: The solution effectively corrects LPP artifacts without requiring real-world clinical data for training, is cost-effective, and adaptable to various scanner settings for software-based applications.

Abstract: Low performance pixels (LPP) in Computed Tomography (CT) detectors would lead to ring and streak artifacts in the reconstructed images, making them clinically unusable. In recent years, several solutions have been proposed to correct LPP artifacts, either in the image domain or in the sinogram domain using supervised deep learning methods. However, these methods require dedicated datasets for training, which are expensive to collect. Moreover, existing approaches focus solely either on image-space or sinogram-space correction, ignoring the intrinsic correlations from the forward operation of the CT geometry. In this work, we propose an unrolled dual-domain method based on synthetic data to correct LPP artifacts. Specifically, the intrinsic correlations of LPP between the sinogram and image domains are leveraged through synthetic data generated from natural images, enabling the trained model to correct artifacts without requiring any real-world clinical data. In experiments simulating 1-2% detectors defect near the isocenter, the proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin. The results indicate that our solution can correct LPP artifacts without the cost of data collection for model training, and it is adaptable to different scanner settings for software-based applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI model trained on prostate biopsy slides predicts biochemical recurrence risk, generalizes across external cohorts, and adds incremental value over clinical risk scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prognostic tools for biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy remain imprecise, creating a need for more accurate prediction methods to guide clinical decision-making.

Method: AI-based model trained on diagnostic prostate biopsy slides using foundation models and attention-based multiple instance learning, validated across three external cohorts (LEOPARD, CHIMERA, TCGA-PRAD).

Result: Model achieved 5-year time-dependent AUCs of 0.64-0.70 across external cohorts, with integration of clinical variables providing complementary prognostic value and statistically significant risk stratification.

Conclusion: Biopsy-trained histopathology AI can generalize across specimen types to support clinical decision-making, but the added value of AI-based multimodal approaches over simpler models requires further critical evaluation.

Abstract: Biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy (RP) is a surrogate marker for aggressive prostate cancer with adverse outcomes, yet current prognostic tools remain imprecise. We trained an AI-based model on diagnostic prostate biopsy slides from the STHLM3 cohort (n = 676) to predict patient-specific risk of BCR, using foundation models and attention-based multiple instance learning. Generalizability was assessed across three external RP cohorts: LEOPARD (n = 508), CHIMERA (n = 95), and TCGA-PRAD (n = 379). The image-based approach achieved 5-year time-dependent AUCs of 0.64, 0.70, and 0.70, respectively. Integrating clinical variables added complementary prognostic value and enabled statistically significant risk stratification. Compared with guideline-based CAPRA-S, AI incrementally improved postoperative prognostication. These findings suggest biopsy-trained histopathology AI can generalize across specimen types to support preoperative and postoperative decision making, but the added value of AI-based multimodal approaches over simpler predictive models should be critically scrutinized in further studies.

*Kealan Dunnett,Reza Arablouei,Dimity Miller,Volkan Dedeoglu,Raja Jurdak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BadDet+ is a penalty-based backdoor attack framework for object detection that unifies region misclassification and object disappearance attacks, achieving superior physical robustness and synthetic-to-physical transfer compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backdoor attacks on object detection are poorly understood compared to image classification, with existing methods relying on unrealistic assumptions and lacking physical validation. There's a critical gap in understanding real-world vulnerabilities of object detection systems to backdoor attacks.

Method: BadDet+ uses a log-barrier penalty framework to suppress true-class predictions for triggered inputs, enabling both Region Misclassification Attacks (RMA) and Object Disappearance Attacks (ODA). The method provides position and scale invariance and operates within a trigger-specific feature subspace.

Result: BadDet+ achieves superior synthetic-to-physical transfer on real-world benchmarks compared to existing RMA and ODA baselines while preserving clean performance. Theoretical analysis confirms the penalty reliably induces attacks without degrading standard inference.

Conclusion: The results highlight significant vulnerabilities in object detection systems and demonstrate the necessity for specialized defenses against backdoor attacks in object detection applications.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a severe threat to deep learning, yet their impact on object detection remains poorly understood compared to image classification. While attacks have been proposed, we identify critical weaknesses in existing detection-based methods, specifically their reliance on unrealistic assumptions and a lack of physical validation. To bridge this gap, we introduce BadDet+, a penalty-based framework that unifies Region Misclassification Attacks (RMA) and Object Disappearance Attacks (ODA). The core mechanism utilizes a log-barrier penalty to suppress true-class predictions for triggered inputs, resulting in (i) position and scale invariance, and (ii) enhanced physical robustness. On real-world benchmarks, BadDet+ achieves superior synthetic-to-physical transfer compared to existing RMA and ODA baselines while preserving clean performance. Theoretical analysis confirms the proposed penalty acts within a trigger-specific feature subspace, reliably inducing attacks without degrading standard inference. These results highlight significant vulnerabilities in object detection and the necessity for specialized defenses.

### [7] [Towards Mitigating Modality Bias in Vision-Language Models for Temporal Action Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21078)
*Jiaqi Li,Guangming Wang,Shuntian Zheng,Minzhe Ni,Xiaoman Lu,Guanghui Ye,Yu Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ActionVLM is a vision-language aggregation framework that reduces modality bias in Temporal Action Localization by prioritizing visual signals and adaptively using language only when beneficial.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language approaches for Temporal Action Localization tend to overemphasize linguistic priors at the expense of visual performance, creating a pronounced modality bias that undermines the effectiveness of visual evidence.

Method: Two key components: (1) a debiasing reweighting module that estimates language advantage (incremental benefit of language over vision-only predictions) and dynamically reweights language modality accordingly; (2) a residual aggregation strategy that treats language as complementary refinement rather than primary driver.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on THUMOS14 benchmark by up to 3.2% mAP, demonstrating effective mitigation of modality bias and improved temporal reasoning.

Conclusion: ActionVLM successfully addresses modality bias in TAL by preserving vision as the dominant signal while adaptively exploiting language only when beneficial, leading to better performance through reduced overconfidence from linguistic priors and strengthened temporal reasoning.

Abstract: Temporal Action Localization (TAL) requires identifying both the boundaries and categories of actions in untrimmed videos. While vision-language models (VLMs) offer rich semantics to complement visual evidence, existing approaches tend to overemphasize linguistic priors at the expense of visual performance, leading to a pronounced modality bias. We propose ActionVLM, a vision-language aggregation framework that systematically mitigates modality bias in TAL. Our key insight is to preserve vision as the dominant signal while adaptively exploiting language only when beneficial. To this end, we introduce (i) a debiasing reweighting module that estimates the language advantage-the incremental benefit of language over vision-only predictions-and dynamically reweights language modality accordingly, and (ii) a residual aggregation strategy that treats language as a complementary refinement rather than the primary driver. This combination alleviates modality bias, reduces overconfidence from linguistic priors, and strengthens temporal reasoning. Experiments on THUMOS14 show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art by up to 3.2% mAP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Shape-of-Thought (SoT) is a visual Chain-of-Thought framework that improves compositional image generation by generating intermediate shape assembly steps, addressing issues with numeracy, attribute binding, and part-level relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal text-to-image models struggle with compositional structural constraints like generative numeracy, attribute binding, and part-level relations, making them brittle when dealing with complex structural requirements.

Method: SoT trains a unified multimodal autoregressive model to generate interleaved textual plans and rendered intermediate states (2D projections) that capture shape-assembly logic without explicit geometric representations. It uses SoT-26K dataset of grounded assembly traces from CAD hierarchies.

Result: Fine-tuning on SoT-26K achieves 88.4% on component numeracy and 84.8% on structural topology, outperforming text-only baselines by around 20%. The approach establishes a new paradigm for transparent, process-supervised compositional generation.

Conclusion: SoT provides a visual Chain-of-Thought framework that enables progressive shape assembly through coherent 2D projections, significantly improving structural integrity in compositional image generation without requiring external engines at inference time.

Abstract: Multimodal models for text-to-image generation have achieved strong visual fidelity, yet they remain brittle under compositional structural constraints-notably generative numeracy, attribute binding, and part-level relations. To address these challenges, we propose Shape-of-Thought (SoT), a visual CoT framework that enables progressive shape assembly via coherent 2D projections without external engines at inference time. SoT trains a unified multimodal autoregressive model to generate interleaved textual plans and rendered intermediate states, helping the model capture shape-assembly logic without producing explicit geometric representations. To support this paradigm, we introduce SoT-26K, a large-scale dataset of grounded assembly traces derived from part-based CAD hierarchies, and T2S-CompBench, a benchmark for evaluating structural integrity and trace faithfulness. Fine-tuning on SoT-26K achieves 88.4% on component numeracy and 84.8% on structural topology, outperforming text-only baselines by around 20%. SoT establishes a new paradigm for transparent, process-supervised compositional generation. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/16FE/. The SoT-26K dataset will be released upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI framework for automated assessment of microanastomosis instrument handling skills using computer vision and machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional microsurgical skill assessment relies on subjective expert judgment with limitations like inter-rater variability, lack of standardized criteria, cognitive bias, and time-intensive manual review. Need for objective, reliable, automated system for consistent and scalable assessment.

Method: Four-component AI framework: (1) YOLO-based instrument detection, (2) DeepSORT-based instrument tracking, (3) shape descriptor-based instrument tip localization, (4) supervised classification trained on expert-labeled data for proficiency evaluation.

Result: System achieves 97% instrument detection precision with 96% mean Average Precision (mAP50-95), demonstrating effective automated assessment of microanastomosis instrument handling skills.

Conclusion: Proposed AI framework provides objective, reliable, and automated assessment of microsurgical skills, addressing limitations of traditional subjective evaluation methods and enabling consistent, scalable performance assessment.

Abstract: Proficiency in microanastomosis is a fundamental competency across multiple microsurgical disciplines. These procedures demand exceptional precision and refined technical skills, making effective, standardized assessment methods essential. Traditionally, the evaluation of microsurgical techniques has relied heavily on the subjective judgment of expert raters. They are inherently constrained by limitations such as inter-rater variability, lack of standardized evaluation criteria, susceptibility to cognitive bias, and the time-intensive nature of manual review. These shortcomings underscore the urgent need for an objective, reliable, and automated system capable of assessing microsurgical performance with consistency and scalability. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel AI framework for the automated assessment of microanastomosis instrument handling skills. The system integrates four core components: (1) an instrument detection module based on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture; (2) an instrument tracking module developed from Deep Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (DeepSORT); (3) an instrument tip localization module employing shape descriptors; and (4) a supervised classification module trained on expert-labeled data to evaluate instrument handling proficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework, achieving an instrument detection precision of 97%, with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 96%, measured by Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds ranging from 50% to 95% (mAP50-95).

### [10] [Bidirectional Cross-Perception for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation in Remote Sensing Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21159)
*Jianzheng Wang,Huan Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDCI is a training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation framework for high-resolution remote sensing imagery that uses dual-branch collaborative inference with cross-model attention fusion and superpixel-based boundary refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution remote sensing imagery has densely distributed objects and complex boundaries, requiring better geometric localization and semantic prediction. Existing training-free OVSS methods use "one-way injection" and "shallow post-processing" strategies that can't meet these requirements.

Method: Proposes SDCI framework with three key components: 1) Cross-model attention fusion (CAF) module that injects self-attention maps between CLIP and vision foundation models, 2) Bidirectional cross-graph diffusion refinement (BCDR) module that enhances segmentation scores through iterative random-walk diffusion, and 3) Convex-optimization-based superpixel collaborative prediction (CSCP) mechanism using low-level superpixel structures to refine object boundaries.

Result: Experiments on multiple remote sensing semantic segmentation benchmarks show SDCI achieves better performance than existing approaches. Ablation studies confirm that traditional superpixel-based methods remain effective within deep learning frameworks.

Conclusion: SDCI effectively addresses the challenges of high-resolution remote sensing imagery segmentation through collaborative inference and superpixel-based boundary refinement, demonstrating the continued relevance of traditional object-based methods in modern deep learning frameworks.

Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing imagery is characterized by densely distributed land-cover objects and complex boundaries, which places higher demands on both geometric localization and semantic prediction. Existing training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) methods typically fuse CLIP and vision foundation models (VFMs) using "one-way injection" and "shallow post-processing" strategies, making it difficult to satisfy these requirements. To address this issue, we propose a spatial-regularization-aware dual-branch collaborative inference framework for training-free OVSS, termed SDCI. First, during feature encoding, SDCI introduces a cross-model attention fusion (CAF) module, which guides collaborative inference by injecting self-attention maps into each other. Second, we propose a bidirectional cross-graph diffusion refinement (BCDR) module that enhances the reliability of dual-branch segmentation scores through iterative random-walk diffusion. Finally, we incorporate low-level superpixel structures and develop a convex-optimization-based superpixel collaborative prediction (CSCP) mechanism to further refine object boundaries. Experiments on multiple remote sensing semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than existing approaches. Moreover, ablation studies further confirm that traditional object-based remote sensing image analysis methods leveraging superpixel structures remain effective within deep learning frameworks.

*Chenyu Huang,Peng Ye,Xudong Tan,Jinhan Mu,Shenghe Zheng,Li Shen,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FRISM is a fine-grained reasoning injection framework that merges Vision-Language Models with Large Reasoning Models at subspace level to enhance reasoning while preserving visual capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for merging VLMs with LRMs operate at coarse-grained layer level, causing trade-offs between reasoning injection and visual capability preservation. Need for more fine-grained approach.

Method: FRISM uses Singular Value Decomposition to decompose LRM task vectors into subspaces, adaptively tunes scaling coefficients for each subspace, and employs label-free self-distillation with dual-objective optimization on vision-language datasets.

Result: Extensive experiments show FRISM effectively improves reasoning capabilities without compromising original visual capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse visual reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: FRISM provides an effective fine-grained approach for reasoning injection through subspace-level model merging, balancing reasoning enhancement with visual capability preservation.

Abstract: Efficiently enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by merging them with Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) has emerged as a promising direction. However, existing methods typically operate at a coarse-grained layer level, which often leads to a trade-off between injecting reasoning capabilities and preserving visual capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose {FRISM} (Fine-grained Reasoning Injection via Subspace-level model Merging), a fine-grained reasoning injection framework based on subspace-level model merging. Observing that reasoning capabilities are encoded in distinct subspaces, FRISM decomposes LRM task vectors via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and adaptively tunes the scaling coefficients of each subspace through learning to realize fine-grained reasoning injection. Furthermore, we introduce a label-free self-distillation learning strategy with a dual-objective optimization using common vision-language perception datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FRISM effectively improves reasoning capabilities without compromising the model's original visual capabilities by consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse visual reasoning benchmarks.

### [13] [Generative Recall, Dense Reranking: Learning Multi-View Semantic IDs for Efficient Text-to-Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21193)
*Zecheng Zhao,Zhi Chen,Zi Huang,Shazia Sadiq,Tong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRDR introduces a generative recall method with multi-view semantic IDs and joint training to improve two-stage text-to-video retrieval, achieving dense retriever accuracy with much lower storage and faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Two-stage text-to-video retrieval uses fast recall models to gather candidates for dense reranking, but current generative recall methods suffer from semantic ambiguity (single ID per video) and cross-modal misalignment (visual-only IDs without text supervision).

Method: GRDR assigns multiple semantic IDs per video using query-guided multi-view tokenizer, jointly trains tokenizer and generative retriever via shared codebook, and uses trie-constrained decoding to generate compact candidate sets for dense reranking.

Result: GRDR matches strong dense retrievers in accuracy while reducing index storage by an order of magnitude and accelerating full-corpus retrieval up to 300× on TVR benchmarks.

Conclusion: GRDR effectively addresses limitations of generative recall for two-stage TVR, achieving high accuracy with dramatically improved efficiency through multi-view semantic IDs and joint cross-modal training.

Abstract: Text-to-Video Retrieval (TVR) is essential in video platforms. Dense retrieval with dual-modality encoders leads in accuracy, but its computation and storage scale poorly with corpus size. Thus, real-time large-scale applications adopt two-stage retrieval, where a fast recall model gathers a small candidate pool, which is reranked by an advanced dense retriever. Due to hugely reduced candidates, the reranking model can use any off-the-shelf dense retriever without hurting efficiency, meaning the recall model bounds two-stage TVR performance. Recently, generative retrieval (GR) replaces dense video embeddings with discrete semantic IDs and retrieves by decoding text queries into ID tokens. GR offers near-constant inference and storage complexity, and its semantic IDs capture high-level video features via quantization, making it ideal for quickly eliminating irrelevant candidates during recall. However, as a recall model in two-stage TVR, GR suffers from (i) semantic ambiguity, where each video satisfies diverse queries but is forced into one semantic ID; and (ii) cross-modal misalignment, as semantic IDs are solely derived from visual features without text supervision. We propose Generative Recall and Dense Reranking (GRDR), designing a novel GR method to uplift recalled candidate quality. GRDR assigns multiple semantic IDs to each video using a query-guided multi-view tokenizer exposing diverse semantic access paths, and jointly trains the tokenizer and generative retriever via a shared codebook to cast semantic IDs as the semantic bridge between texts and videos. At inference, trie-constrained decoding generates a compact candidate set reranked by a dense model for fine-grained matching. Experiments on TVR benchmarks show GRDR matches strong dense retrievers in accuracy while reducing index storage by an order of magnitude and accelerating up to 300$\times$ in full-corpus retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models struggle with simple human tasks in robotics, particularly with perspective confusion (third-person vs first-person) and overlooking information at video endings during temporal reasoning.

Method: Two-pronged approach: 1) Construct large-scale dataset for robotic perception/reasoning including ego-view videos, visual grounding, spatial understanding, and chain-of-thought data; 2) Introduce simple yet effective dual-input approach that jointly incorporates key frames and full video sequences to enhance video comprehension.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on two most commonly used benchmark datasets in task planning field.

Conclusion: Thinker successfully addresses critical challenges in applying vision-language models to robotics through specialized dataset construction and innovative video processing approach, demonstrating superior performance on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: When large vision-language models are applied to the field of robotics, they encounter problems that are simple for humans yet error-prone for models. Such issues include confusion between third-person and first-person perspectives and a tendency to overlook information in video endings during temporal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose Thinker, a large vision-language foundation model designed for embodied intelligence. We tackle the aforementioned issues from two perspectives. Firstly, we construct a large-scale dataset tailored for robotic perception and reasoning, encompassing ego-view videos, visual grounding, spatial understanding, and chain-of-thought data. Secondly, we introduce a simple yet effective approach that substantially enhances the model's capacity for video comprehension by jointly incorporating key frames and full video sequences as inputs. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on two of the most commonly used benchmark datasets in the field of task planning.

TL;DR: LAMP: Black-box universal adversarial perturbations for multi-image MLLMs using attention constraints and cross-image contagious attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-image MLLMs have unexplored vulnerabilities; existing attacks focus on single-image settings with impractical white-box assumptions.

Method: LAMP uses attention-based constraints to disrupt cross-image information aggregation, cross-image contagious constraints to spread adversarial effects, and index-attention suppression for position-invariant attacks.

Result: LAMP outperforms SOTA baselines with highest attack success rates across multiple vision-language tasks and models.

Conclusion: LAMP demonstrates effective black-box adversarial attacks on multi-image MLLMs, revealing new security vulnerabilities in multimodal systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across vision-language tasks. Recent advancements allow these models to process multiple images as inputs. However, the vulnerabilities of multi-image MLLMs remain unexplored. Existing adversarial attacks focus on single-image settings and often assume a white-box threat model, which is impractical in many real-world scenarios. This paper introduces LAMP, a black-box method for learning Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) targeting multi-image MLLMs. LAMP applies an attention-based constraint that prevents the model from effectively aggregating information across images. LAMP also introduces a novel cross-image contagious constraint that forces perturbed tokens to influence clean tokens, spreading adversarial effects without requiring all inputs to be modified. Additionally, an index-attention suppression loss enables a robust position-invariant attack. Experimental results show that LAMP outperforms SOTA baselines and achieves the highest attack success rates across multiple vision-language tasks and models.

### [16] [PTQ4ARVG: Post-Training Quantization for AutoRegressive Visual Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21238)
*Xuewen Liu,Zhikai Li,Jing Zhang,Mengjuan Chen,Qingyi Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PTQ4ARVG is a training-free post-training quantization framework that effectively quantizes AutoRegressive Visual Generation models to 8-bit and 6-bit while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AutoRegressive Visual Generation (ARVG) models achieve performance comparable to diffusion models but quantization for ARVG remains underexplored. Existing quantization methods fail to generalize effectively to ARVG due to three key challenges: channel-wise outliers, token-wise dynamic activations, and sample-wise distribution mismatch.

Method: PTQ4ARVG consists of three components: 1) Gain-Projected Scaling (GPS) mitigates channel-wise outliers by expanding quantization loss via Taylor series to quantify scaling gain, 2) Static Token-Wise Quantization (STWQ) leverages ARVG's fixed token length and position-invariant distribution to address token-wise variance without dynamic calibration, and 3) Distribution-Guided Calibration (DGC) selects samples contributing most to distributional entropy to eliminate sample-wise mismatch.

Result: Extensive experiments show PTQ4ARVG can effectively quantize ARVG family models to 8-bit and 6-bit while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: PTQ4ARVG provides an effective training-free quantization solution for ARVG models, addressing their unique quantization challenges and enabling efficient deployment while preserving generation quality.

Abstract: AutoRegressive Visual Generation (ARVG) models retain an architecture compatible with language models, while achieving performance comparable to diffusion-based models. Quantization is commonly employed in neural networks to reduce model size and computational latency. However, applying quantization to ARVG remains largely underexplored, and existing quantization methods fail to generalize effectively to ARVG models. In this paper, we explore this issue and identify three key challenges: (1) severe outliers at channel-wise level, (2) highly dynamic activations at token-wise level, and (3) mismatched distribution information at sample-wise level. To these ends, we propose PTQ4ARVG, a training-free post-training quantization (PTQ) framework consisting of: (1) Gain-Projected Scaling (GPS) mitigates the channel-wise outliers, which expands the quantization loss via a Taylor series to quantify the gain of scaling for activation-weight quantization, and derives the optimal scaling factor through differentiation.(2) Static Token-Wise Quantization (STWQ) leverages the inherent properties of ARVG, fixed token length and position-invariant distribution across samples, to address token-wise variance without incurring dynamic calibration overhead.(3) Distribution-Guided Calibration (DGC) selects samples that contribute most to distributional entropy, eliminating the sample-wise distribution mismatch. Extensive experiments show that PTQ4ARVG can effectively quantize the ARVG family models to 8-bit and 6-bit while maintaining competitive performance.

### [17] [NFCDS: A Plug-and-Play Noise Frequency-Controlled Diffusion Sampling Strategy for Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21248)
*Zhen Wang,Hongyi Liu,Jianing Li,Zhihui Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NFCDS improves diffusion-based image restoration by controlling noise frequency during sampling to balance fidelity and perception without extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion sampling-based Plug-and-Play methods produce high perceptual quality images but suffer from reduced data fidelity due to noise introduced during reverse diffusion, creating a fidelity-perception trade-off.

Method: Proposes Noise Frequency-Controlled Diffusion Sampling (NFCDS) with a Fourier-domain filter that progressively suppresses low-frequency noise (which causes blur) while preserving high-frequency noise (which drives detail generation), injecting data-consistency prior directly into sampling.

Result: Enables fast convergence to results that are both high-fidelity and perceptually convincing, improves fidelity-perception balance across diverse zero-shot tasks, and integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion-based restoration frameworks.

Conclusion: NFCDS addresses the fundamental fidelity-perception conflict in diffusion sampling by controlling noise frequency, providing an effective Plug-and-Play solution for image restoration without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Diffusion sampling-based Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods produce images with high perceptual quality but often suffer from reduced data fidelity, primarily due to the noise introduced during reverse diffusion. To address this trade-off, we propose Noise Frequency-Controlled Diffusion Sampling (NFCDS), a spectral modulation mechanism for reverse diffusion noise. We show that the fidelity-perception conflict can be fundamentally understood through noise frequency: low-frequency components induce blur and degrade fidelity, while high-frequency components drive detail generation. Based on this insight, we design a Fourier-domain filter that progressively suppresses low-frequency noise and preserves high-frequency content. This controlled refinement injects a data-consistency prior directly into sampling, enabling fast convergence to results that are both high-fidelity and perceptually convincing--without additional training. As a PnP module, NFCDS seamlessly integrates into existing diffusion-based restoration frameworks and improves the fidelity-perception balance across diverse zero-shot tasks.

*Esteban Rodríguez-Betancourt,Edgar Casasola-Murillo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hypersolid prevents representation collapse in self-supervised learning using local hard-ball repulsion instead of global regularization, treating representation learning as a discrete packing problem to maintain injectivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-supervised learning methods use global regularization (distance maximization, dimension decorrelation, distribution enforcement) to prevent representation collapse, but these approaches may not be optimal. The paper reinterprets the problem as maintaining injectivity through local geometric constraints.

Method: Hypersolid uses short-range hard-ball repulsion to prevent local collisions between representations, treating representation learning as a discrete packing problem. This creates a high-separation geometric regime that preserves augmentation diversity.

Result: The method excels on fine-grained and low-resolution classification tasks by effectively preventing representation collapse through local geometric constraints rather than global regularization.

Conclusion: Reinterpreting representation learning as a discrete packing problem with local hard-ball repulsion provides an effective alternative to global regularization methods for preventing representation collapse, particularly beneficial for fine-grained and low-resolution tasks.

Abstract: A recurring challenge in self-supervised learning is preventing representation collapse. Existing solutions typically rely on global regularization, such as maximizing distances, decorrelating dimensions or enforcing certain distributions. We instead reinterpret representation learning as a discrete packing problem, where preserving information simplifies to maintaining injectivity. We operationalize this in Hypersolid, a method using short-range hard-ball repulsion to prevent local collisions. This constraint results in a high-separation geometric regime that preserves augmentation diversity, excelling on fine-grained and low-resolution classification tasks.

TL;DR: A lightweight 3D talking face compression framework using FLAME parametric modeling and 3DGS neural rendering achieves high-fidelity facial representation at extremely low bitrates for real-time video conferencing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 2D video compression fails to preserve 3D geometric details, while neural rendering methods like NeRF are computationally expensive, creating a need for efficient high-fidelity 3D talking face compression for immersive communication.

Method: Integrates FLAME-based parametric modeling with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) neural rendering, transmits only essential facial metadata, and introduces compact representation with Gaussian attribute compression and MLP optimization.

Result: Achieves superior rate-distortion performance with high-quality facial rendering at extremely low bitrates, making it suitable for real-time 3D video conferencing applications.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the challenge of high-fidelity 3D talking face representation at low bitrates by combining efficient parametric modeling with optimized neural rendering.

Abstract: The demand for immersive and interactive communication has driven advancements in 3D video conferencing, yet achieving high-fidelity 3D talking face representation at low bitrates remains a challenge. Traditional 2D video compression techniques fail to preserve fine-grained geometric and appearance details, while implicit neural rendering methods like NeRF suffer from prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight, high-fidelity, low-bitrate 3D talking face compression framework that integrates FLAME-based parametric modeling with 3DGS neural rendering. Our approach transmits only essential facial metadata in real time, enabling efficient reconstruction with a Gaussian-based head model. Additionally, we introduce a compact representation and compression scheme, including Gaussian attribute compression and MLP optimization, to enhance transmission efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior rate-distortion performance, delivering high-quality facial rendering at extremely low bitrates, making it well-suited for real-time 3D video conferencing applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs are good at geolocation prediction but terrible at explaining their reasoning, often hallucinating evidence. New benchmark with expert GeoGuessr reasoning chains shows VLMs lag far behind humans in producing auditable explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs excel at geolocation prediction but produce unreliable reasoning chains that hallucinate evidence, creating a need for evaluating their explanation quality and identifying limitations in fine-grained visual attribute extraction.

Method: Created first geolocation reasoning chain benchmark using 500 Google Street View scenes from GeoGuessr, with 800 expert reasoning chains from top players including world champion. Evaluated LLM/VLM-as-a-judge scoring strategies against human scoring.

Result: Qwen 3 LLM-as-a-judge correlates best with human scoring. Closed-source VLMs (Gemini, GPT 5) match human location prediction but lag in reasoning chains. Open-weight VLMs (Llama, Qwen) catastrophically fail, barely beating hallucinated oracle baseline.

Conclusion: VLMs struggle with fine-grained visual attribute extraction needed for auditable reasoning chains, revealing a significant gap between prediction accuracy and explainability that needs addressing for trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are good at recognizing the global location of a photograph -- their geolocation prediction accuracy rivals the best human experts. But many VLMs are startlingly bad at explaining which image evidence led to their prediction, even when their location prediction is correct. The reasoning chains produced by VLMs frequently hallucinate scene attributes to support their location prediction (e.g. phantom writing, imagined infrastructure, misidentified flora). In this paper, we introduce the first benchmark for geolocation reasoning chains. We focus on the global location prediction task in the popular GeoGuessr game which draws from Google Street View spanning more than 100 countries. We collaborate with expert GeoGuessr players, including the reigning world champion, to produce 800 ground truth reasoning chains for 500 query scenes. These expert reasoning chains address hundreds of different discriminative visual attributes such as license plate shape, architecture, and soil properties to name just a few. We evaluate LLM-as-a-judge and VLM-as-a-judge strategies for scoring VLM-generated reasoning chains against our expert reasoning chains and find that Qwen 3 LLM-as-a-judge correlates best with human scoring. Our benchmark reveals that while large, closed-source VLMs such as Gemini and GPT 5 rival human experts at prediction locations, they still lag behind human experts when it comes to producing auditable reasoning chains. Open weights VLMs such as Llama and Qwen catastrophically fail on our benchmark -- they perform only slightly better than a baseline in which an LLM hallucinates a reasoning chain with oracle knowledge of the photo location but no visual information at all. We believe the gap between human experts and VLMs on this task points to VLM limitations at extracting fine-grained visual attributes from high resolution images.

TL;DR: Novel multi-modal framework fuses video footage, antenna geometry, and PCI signals for automated antenna affiliation identification, using Token Entropy Regularization to address cross-modal alignment challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current manual tower inspections for antenna affiliation identification are cumbersome and error-prone, requiring an automated solution. Existing pretrained transformers fail due to lack of analogous communication domain data for cross-modal alignment.

Method: Proposes a multi-modal classification/matching framework combining video footage, antenna geometric features, and PCI signals. Introduces dedicated training framework with Token Entropy Regularization module to align antenna images with PCI signals during pretraining.

Result: TER accelerates convergence and yields significant performance gains. Analysis shows the entropy of the first token is modality-dependent, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed regularization approach.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-modal framework with Token Entropy Regularization successfully addresses antenna affiliation identification, offering an automated alternative to manual inspections with improved cross-modal alignment and performance.

Abstract: Accurate antenna affiliation identification is crucial for optimizing and maintaining communication networks. Current practice, however, relies on the cumbersome and error-prone process of manual tower inspections. We propose a novel paradigm shift that fuses video footage of base stations, antenna geometric features, and Physical Cell Identity (PCI) signals, transforming antenna affiliation identification into multi-modal classification and matching tasks. Publicly available pretrained transformers struggle with this unique task due to a lack of analogous data in the communications domain, which hampers cross-modal alignment. To address this, we introduce a dedicated training framework that aligns antenna images with corresponding PCI signals. To tackle the representation alignment challenge, we propose a novel Token Entropy Regularization module in the pretraining stage. Our experiments demonstrate that TER accelerates convergence and yields significant performance gains. Further analysis reveals that the entropy of the first token is modality-dependent. Code will be made available upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WorldBench is a new video benchmark for disentangled evaluation of world models' physical reasoning, isolating single physics concepts to identify specific failure patterns that existing entangled benchmarks miss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current world models for robotics/autonomous systems need high physical fidelity for reliable deployment, but existing physics video benchmarks are entangled (testing multiple concepts simultaneously), limiting diagnostic capability to identify specific weaknesses.

Method: Created WorldBench with two-level design: 1) intuitive physics concepts (object permanence, scale/perspective) and 2) low-level physical constants (friction coefficients, fluid viscosity). Each test isolates a single physical concept/law for disentangled evaluation.

Result: When testing SOTA video-based world models on WorldBench, all models showed specific failure patterns in particular physics concepts, lacking the physical consistency needed for reliable real-world interactions.

Conclusion: WorldBench provides a more nuanced, scalable framework for rigorous evaluation of physical reasoning in world models, enabling targeted improvements for more robust world-model-driven learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative foundational models, often termed "world models," have propelled interest in applying them to critical tasks like robotic planning and autonomous system training. For reliable deployment, these models must exhibit high physical fidelity, accurately simulating real-world dynamics. Existing physics-based video benchmarks, however, suffer from entanglement, where a single test simultaneously evaluates multiple physical laws and concepts, fundamentally limiting their diagnostic capability. We introduce WorldBench, a novel video-based benchmark specifically designed for concept-specific, disentangled evaluation, allowing us to rigorously isolate and assess understanding of a single physical concept or law at a time. To make WorldBench comprehensive, we design benchmarks at two different levels: 1) an evaluation of intuitive physical understanding with concepts such as object permanence or scale/perspective, and 2) an evaluation of low-level physical constants and material properties such as friction coefficients or fluid viscosity. When SOTA video-based world models are evaluated on WorldBench, we find specific patterns of failure in particular physics concepts, with all tested models lacking the physical consistency required to generate reliable real-world interactions. Through its concept-specific evaluation, WorldBench offers a more nuanced and scalable framework for rigorously evaluating the physical reasoning capabilities of video generation and world models, paving the way for more robust and generalizable world-model-driven learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GBPN is a hybrid depth completion framework combining deep learning with Gaussian Belief Propagation to handle sparse depth measurements effectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance on NYUv2 and KITTI benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods struggle with sparse and irregular depth measurements, especially under high sparsity conditions, limiting depth completion performance.

Method: GBPN integrates deep learning with probabilistic graphical models: a Graphical Model Construction Network (GMCN) dynamically builds scene-specific Markov Random Fields with adaptive non-local edges, then Gaussian Belief Propagation with serial & parallel message passing infers dense depth distributions.

Result: GBPN achieves state-of-the-art performance on NYUv2 and KITTI benchmarks, showing superior performance, robustness across varying sparsity levels/patterns, and generalizable capability.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach combining deep learning with probabilistic graphical models effectively addresses challenges in sparse depth completion, enabling capture of complex spatial dependencies and robust performance.

Abstract: Depth completion aims to predict a dense depth map from a color image with sparse depth measurements. Although deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA), effectively handling the sparse and irregular nature of input depth data in deep networks remains a significant challenge, often limiting performance, especially under high sparsity. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Gaussian Belief Propagation Network (GBPN), a novel hybrid framework synergistically integrating deep learning with probabilistic graphical models for end-to-end depth completion. Specifically, a scene-specific Markov Random Field (MRF) is dynamically constructed by the Graphical Model Construction Network (GMCN), and then inferred via Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) to yield the dense depth distribution. Crucially, the GMCN learns to construct not only the data-dependent potentials of MRF but also its structure by predicting adaptive non-local edges, enabling the capture of complex, long-range spatial dependencies. Furthermore, we enhance GBP with a serial \& parallel message passing scheme, designed for effective information propagation, particularly from sparse measurements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GBPN achieves SOTA performance on the NYUv2 and KITTI benchmarks. Evaluations across varying sparsity levels, sparsity patterns, and datasets highlight GBPN's superior performance, notable robustness, and generalizable capability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mam-App: A lightweight Mamba-based model for apple leaf disease classification achieving 99.58% accuracy with only 0.051M parameters, suitable for resource-constrained devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing global food demand requires minimizing crop losses from diseases. Apple production suffers significant losses from leaf diseases. Existing deep learning models for disease detection are parameter-heavy and inefficient for deployment on resource-constrained devices like drones and mobile phones.

Method: Proposed Mam-App, a parameter-efficient Mamba-based model for feature extraction and leaf disease classification. Uses a lightweight architecture with only 0.051M parameters to balance efficiency and performance.

Result: Achieved 99.58% accuracy, 99.30% precision, 99.14% recall, and 99.22% F1-score on Apple Leaf Disease dataset. Also demonstrated strong performance on Corn (99.48% accuracy) and Potato (98.46% accuracy) leaf disease datasets, showing good generalizability.

Conclusion: Mam-App successfully addresses the efficiency-performance trade-off in disease classification, offering state-of-the-art accuracy with extremely low parameter count, making it suitable for deployment on drones, mobile devices, and other low-resource platforms.

Abstract: The rapid growth of the global population, alongside exponential technological advancement, has intensified the demand for food production. Meeting this demand depends not only on increasing agricultural yield but also on minimizing food loss caused by crop diseases. Diseases account for a substantial portion of apple production losses, despite apples being among the most widely produced and nutritionally valuable fruits worldwide. Previous studies have employed machine learning techniques for feature extraction and early diagnosis of apple leaf diseases, and more recently, deep learning-based models have shown remarkable performance in disease recognition. However, most state-of-the-art deep learning models are highly parameter-intensive, resulting in increased training and inference time. Although lightweight models are more suitable for user-friendly and resource-constrained applications, they often suffer from performance degradation. To address the trade-off between efficiency and performance, we propose Mam-App, a parameter-efficient Mamba-based model for feature extraction and leaf disease classification. The proposed approach achieves competitive state-of-the-art performance on the PlantVillage Apple Leaf Disease dataset, attaining 99.58% accuracy, 99.30% precision, 99.14% recall, and a 99.22% F1-score, while using only 0.051M parameters. This extremely low parameter count makes the model suitable for deployment on drones, mobile devices, and other low-resource platforms. To demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the proposed model, we further evaluate it on the PlantVillage Corn Leaf Disease and Potato Leaf Disease datasets. The model achieves 99.48%, 99.20%, 99.34%, and 99.27% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the corn dataset and 98.46%, 98.91%, 95.39%, and 97.01% on the potato dataset, respectively.

TL;DR: LANE introduces latent autoregressive modeling with adaptive computation graph reconfiguration for efficient high-fidelity 3D mesh generation, achieving 6× longer sequences and faster inference than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive 3D mesh generation methods suffer from insufficient resource utilization, slow inference, and limited sequence length, which constrains expressible structural details.

Method: Proposes Latent Autoregressive Network (LANE) with compact autoregressive dependencies and Adaptive Computation Graph Reconfiguration (AdaGraph) strategy that uses spatiotemporal decoupling to overcome serial inference bottlenecks.

Result: LANE achieves 6× improvement in maximum generatable sequence length compared to existing methods, with superior performance in generation speed, structural detail, and geometric consistency.

Conclusion: LANE provides an effective solution for high-quality 3D mesh generation by addressing efficiency bottlenecks while maintaining high fidelity and structural detail.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D meshes can be tokenized into one-dimension (1D) sequences and directly modeled using autoregressive approaches for faces and vertices. However, existing methods suffer from insufficient resource utilization, resulting in slow inference and the ability to handle only small-scale sequences, which severely constrains the expressible structural details. We introduce the Latent Autoregressive Network (LANE), which incorporates compact autoregressive dependencies in the generation process, achieving a $6\times$ improvement in maximum generatable sequence length compared to existing methods. To further accelerate inference, we propose the Adaptive Computation Graph Reconfiguration (AdaGraph) strategy, which effectively overcomes the efficiency bottleneck of traditional serial inference through spatiotemporal decoupling in the generation process. Experimental validation demonstrates that LANE achieves superior performance across generation speed, structural detail, and geometric consistency, providing an effective solution for high-quality 3D mesh generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework using optimal transport singular boundaries to create geometrically-grounded OOD samples (OTIS) for suppressing overconfidence during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNNs produce overconfident predictions on OOD inputs, undermining reliability in open-world environments. Singularities in semi-discrete optimal transport mark regions of semantic ambiguity where classifiers are prone to unwarranted high-confidence predictions.

Method: Formulate OT problem between continuous base distribution and latent embeddings of training data, identify resulting singular boundaries, sample near boundaries to construct OTIS (optimal transport-induced OOD samples), apply confidence suppression loss to OTIS during training.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method significantly alleviates OOD overconfidence and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively mitigates OOD overconfidence by leveraging OT-induced singular boundaries to create geometrically grounded ambiguous samples for training, leading to more calibrated predictions in structurally uncertain regions.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) often produce overconfident predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, undermining their reliability in open-world environments. Singularities in semi-discrete optimal transport (OT) mark regions of semantic ambiguity, where classifiers are particularly prone to unwarranted high-confidence predictions. Motivated by this observation, we propose a principled framework to mitigate OOD overconfidence by leveraging the geometry of OT-induced singular boundaries. Specifically, we formulate an OT problem between a continuous base distribution and the latent embeddings of training data, and identify the resulting singular boundaries. By sampling near these boundaries, we construct a class of OOD inputs, termed optimal transport-induced OOD samples (OTIS), which are geometrically grounded and inherently semantically ambiguous. During training, a confidence suppression loss is applied to OTIS to guide the model toward more calibrated predictions in structurally uncertain regions. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly alleviates OOD overconfidence and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

*Pritika Vig,Ren-Chin Wu,William Lotter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision foundation models trained on pathology images implicitly learn continuous disease progression trajectories, with trajectory fidelity predicting downstream classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether vision foundation models encode continuous disease progression processes from static pathology images, which could better reflect biology and enable quantitative analysis of disease transitions.

Method: Used diffusion pseudotime (from single-cell transcriptomics) to probe if foundation models organize disease states along coherent progression trajectories in representation space across four cancer progressions and six models.

Result: All pathology-specific models recovered trajectory orderings significantly exceeding null baselines, with vision-only models achieving highest fidelities (τ>0.78 on CRC-Serrated). Trajectory fidelity strongly predicted few-shot classification performance (ρ=0.92), and cell-type composition varied smoothly along inferred trajectories consistent with known stromal remodeling.

Conclusion: Vision foundation models can implicitly learn continuous processes from static observations, and trajectory fidelity provides complementary measure of representation quality beyond downstream performance, with potential applications across domains observing continuous processes through static snapshots.

Abstract: Vision foundation models trained on discretely sampled images achieve strong performance on classification benchmarks, yet whether their representations encode the continuous processes underlying their training data remains unclear. This question is especially pertinent in computational pathology, where we posit that models whose latent representations implicitly capture continuous disease progression may better reflect underlying biology, support more robust generalization, and enable quantitative analyses of features associated with disease transitions. Using diffusion pseudotime, a method developed to infer developmental trajectories from single-cell transcriptomics, we probe whether foundation models organize disease states along coherent progression directions in representation space. Across four cancer progressions and six models, we find that all pathology-specific models recover trajectory orderings significantly exceeding null baselines, with vision-only models achieving the highest fidelities $(τ> 0.78$ on CRC-Serrated). Model rankings by trajectory fidelity on reference diseases strongly predict few-shot classification performance on held-out diseases ($ρ= 0.92$), and exploratory analysis shows cell-type composition varies smoothly along inferred trajectories in patterns consistent with known stromal remodeling. Together, these results demonstrate that vision foundation models can implicitly learn to represent continuous processes from independent static observations, and that trajectory fidelity provides a complementary measure of representation quality beyond downstream performance. While demonstrated in pathology, this framework could be applied to other domains where continuous processes are observed through static snapshots.

TL;DR: SR²-Net is a lightweight plug-and-play rectifier for HSI super-resolution that improves spectral consistency without modifying existing model architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HSI-SR methods focus on spatial enhancement but neglect spectral consistency across bands, causing spurious oscillations and physically implausible artifacts. While architectural modifications can address this, they sacrifice generality and flexibility.

Method: Proposes SR²-Net with enhance-then-rectify pipeline: (1) Hierarchical Spectral-Spatial Synergy Attention (H-S³A) for cross-band interactions, (2) Manifold Consistency Rectification (MCR) to constrain spectra to physically plausible manifold, and (3) degradation-consistency loss for data fidelity.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks with diverse backbones show consistent improvements in spectral fidelity and overall reconstruction quality with negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: SR²-Net provides an effective plug-and-play solution to enhance spectral consistency in HSI super-resolution without compromising model generality or flexibility, achieving physically plausible results across various architectures.

Abstract: HSI-SR aims to enhance spatial resolution while preserving spectrally faithful and physically plausible characteristics. Recent methods have achieved great progress by leveraging spatial correlations to enhance spatial resolution. However, these methods often neglect spectral consistency across bands, leading to spurious oscillations and physically implausible artifacts. While spectral consistency can be addressed by designing the network architecture, it results in a loss of generality and flexibility. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight plug-and-play rectifier, physically priors Spectral Rectification Super-Resolution Network (SR$^{2}$-Net), which can be attached to a wide range of HSI-SR models without modifying their architectures. SR$^{2}$-Net follows an enhance-then-rectify pipeline consisting of (i) Hierarchical Spectral-Spatial Synergy Attention (H-S$^{3}$A) to reinforce cross-band interactions and (ii) Manifold Consistency Rectification (MCR) to constrain the reconstructed spectra to a compact, physically plausible spectral manifold. In addition, we introduce a degradation-consistency loss to enforce data fidelity by encouraging the degraded SR output to match the observed low resolution input. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks and diverse backbones demonstrate consistent improvements in spectral fidelity and overall reconstruction quality with negligible computational overhead. Our code will be released upon publication.

*Ruiqi Liu,Boyu Diao,Zijia An,Zhulin An,Fei Wang,Yongjun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAF proposes a single global adapter for class-incremental learning using PAC-Bayes theorem and Taylor expansion to dynamically fuse task-specific adapters, previous global adapter, and initialization parameters, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CIL approaches using task-specific adapters suffer from poor knowledge transfer, high retrieval costs, and destructive interference when fusing parameters, leading to catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Dynamical Adapter Fusion (DAF) constructs a single robust global adapter using PAC-Bayes theorem. It fuses three components: task-specific adapter parameters, previous global adapter parameters, and initialization parameters. Uses Taylor expansion of loss function to derive optimal fusion coefficients for balancing stability-plasticity trade-off, plus Robust Initialization strategy.

Result: Experiments on multiple CIL benchmarks demonstrate that DAF achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Conclusion: DAF effectively addresses the stability-plasticity dilemma in CIL by dynamically fusing adapter parameters through theoretically grounded fusion mechanisms, enabling efficient knowledge transfer while mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continuously acquire new classes without forgetting previously learned ones. A dominant paradigm involves freezing a pre-trained model and training lightweight, task-specific adapters. However, maintaining task-specific parameters hinders knowledge transfer and incurs high retrieval costs, while naive parameter fusion often leads to destructive interference and catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose Dynamical Adapter Fusion (DAF) to construct a single robust global adapter. Grounded in the PAC-Bayes theorem, we derive a fusion mechanism that explicitly integrates three components: the optimized task-specific adapter parameters, the previous global adapter parameters, and the initialization parameters. We utilize the Taylor expansion of the loss function to derive the optimal fusion coefficients, dynamically achieving the best balance between stability and plasticity. Furthermore, we propose a Robust Initialization strategy to effectively capture global knowledge patterns. Experiments on multiple CIL benchmarks demonstrate that DAF achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SGDS uses semantic-guided dynamic sparsification to create class-specific sparse activation subspaces for CIL, balancing knowledge transfer and interference prevention without rigid parameter constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CIL methods that freeze pre-trained models and use orthogonal adapters constrain parameters too rigidly, which harms plasticity and learning capability.

Method: Semantic-Guided Dynamic Sparsification (SGDS) proactively guides activation space by governing subspace orientation and rank through targeted sparsification. It promotes knowledge transfer by having similar classes share compact activation subspaces, while preventing interference by assigning non-overlapping subspaces to dissimilar classes.

Result: Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: SGDS effectively mitigates interference in class-incremental learning without imposing rigid constraints on parameter space, achieving better balance between plasticity and stability.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires a model to continually learn new classes without forgetting old ones. A common and efficient solution freezes a pre-trained model and employs lightweight adapters, whose parameters are often forced to be orthogonal to prevent inter-task interference. However, we argue that this parameter-constraining method is detrimental to plasticity. To this end, we propose Semantic-Guided Dynamic Sparsification (SGDS), a novel method that proactively guides the activation space by governing the orientation and rank of its subspaces through targeted sparsification. Specifically, SGDS promotes knowledge transfer by encouraging similar classes to share a compact activation subspace, while simultaneously preventing interference by assigning non-overlapping activation subspaces to dissimilar classes. By sculpting class-specific sparse subspaces in the activation space, SGDS effectively mitigates interference without imposing rigid constraints on the parameter space. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of SGDS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HMRMamba introduces a new video-based 3D human mesh recovery framework using Structured State Space Models (SSMs) to address physically implausible results from existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance with better temporal consistency and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video-based 3D Human Mesh Recovery methods produce physically implausible results due to flawed intermediate 3D pose anchors and inability to effectively model complex spatiotemporal dynamics.

Method: Two core contributions: 1) Geometry-Aware Lifting Module with novel dual-scan Mamba architecture that grounds 2D-to-3D pose lifting with geometric cues from image features, and 2) Motion-guided Reconstruction Network that leverages the stable 3D pose anchor to explicitly process kinematic patterns over time.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on 3DPW, MPI-INF-3DHP, and Human3.6M benchmarks confirm HMRMamba sets new state-of-the-art, outperforming existing methods in both reconstruction accuracy and temporal consistency while offering superior computational efficiency.

Conclusion: HMRMamba pioneers the use of Structured State Space Models for 3D human mesh recovery, overcoming deep-rooted architectural problems in existing methods and producing more physically plausible results with better temporal coherence.

Abstract: Existing video-based 3D Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) methods often produce physically implausible results, stemming from their reliance on flawed intermediate 3D pose anchors and their inability to effectively model complex spatiotemporal dynamics. To overcome these deep-rooted architectural problems, we introduce HMRMamba, a new paradigm for HMR that pioneers the use of Structured State Space Models (SSMs) for their efficiency and long-range modeling prowess. Our framework is distinguished by two core contributions. First, the Geometry-Aware Lifting Module, featuring a novel dual-scan Mamba architecture, creates a robust foundation for reconstruction. It directly grounds the 2D-to-3D pose lifting process with geometric cues from image features, producing a highly reliable 3D pose sequence that serves as a stable anchor. Second, the Motion-guided Reconstruction Network leverages this anchor to explicitly process kinematic patterns over time. By injecting this crucial temporal awareness, it significantly enhances the final mesh's coherence and robustness, particularly under occlusion and motion blur. Comprehensive evaluations on 3DPW, MPI-INF-3DHP, and Human3.6M benchmarks confirm that HMRMamba sets a new state-of-the-art, outperforming existing methods in both reconstruction accuracy and temporal consistency while offering superior computational efficiency.

### [32] [Rectifying Geometry-Induced Similarity Distortions for Real-World Aerial-Ground Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21405)
*Kailash A. Hambarde,Hugo Proença*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GIQT introduces a geometry-induced query-key transformation module to rectify similarity space distortions in aerial-ground person re-identification caused by extreme viewpoint and distance discrepancies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AG-ReID methods assume geometry-invariant dot-product similarity remains reliable under large viewpoint/scale variations, but extreme camera geometry systematically distorts the query-key similarity space and degrades attention-based matching.

Method: Proposes Geometry-Induced Query-Key Transformation (GIQT), a lightweight low-rank module that explicitly rectifies similarity space by conditioning query-key interactions on camera geometry, plus geometry-conditioned prompt generation for global representation priors.

Result: Experiments on four aerial-ground person re-identification benchmarks show consistent improvement in robustness under extreme/unseen geometric conditions with minimal computational overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Explicitly addressing geometry-induced similarity space distortions through query-key transformation is crucial for robust aerial-ground person re-identification under extreme viewpoint and distance variations.

Abstract: Aerial-ground person re-identification (AG-ReID) is fundamentally challenged by extreme viewpoint and distance discrepancies between aerial and ground cameras, which induce severe geometric distortions and invalidate the assumption of a shared similarity space across views. Existing methods primarily rely on geometry-aware feature learning or appearance-conditioned prompting, while implicitly assuming that the geometry-invariant dot-product similarity used in attention mechanisms remains reliable under large viewpoint and scale variations. We argue that this assumption does not hold. Extreme camera geometry systematically distorts the query-key similarity space and degrades attention-based matching, even when feature representations are partially aligned.
  To address this issue, we introduce Geometry-Induced Query-Key Transformation (GIQT), a lightweight low-rank module that explicitly rectifies the similarity space by conditioning query-key interactions on camera geometry. Rather than modifying feature representations or the attention formulation itself, GIQT adapts the similarity computation to compensate for dominant geometry-induced anisotropic distortions. Building on this local similarity rectification, we further incorporate a geometry-conditioned prompt generation mechanism that provides global, view-adaptive representation priors derived directly from camera geometry.
  Experiments on four aerial-ground person re-identification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently improves robustness under extreme and previously unseen geometric conditions, while introducing minimal computational overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### [33] [Generation Enhances Understanding in Unified Multimodal Models via Multi-Representation Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21406)
*Zihan Su,Hongyang Wei,Kangrui Cen,Yong Wang,Guanhua Chen,Chun Yuan,Xiangxiang Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniMRG is a post-training method that enhances multimodal models' understanding by training them to generate multiple image representations (pixel, depth, segmentation) alongside standard understanding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While current UMMs use understanding to improve generation, the reverse direction (using generation to improve understanding) remains unexplored. The authors aim to create a mutually reinforcing cycle between understanding and generation in multimodal models.

Method: UniMRG trains UMMs to generate three intrinsic image representations: pixel reconstruction (appearance), depth maps (geometry), and segmentation maps (structure), alongside standard visual understanding objectives. This architecture-agnostic approach works with various UMM architectures.

Result: Extensive experiments show UniMRG significantly improves fine-grained perception, reduces hallucinations, enhances spatial understanding, and simultaneously boosts generation capabilities across diverse UMM architectures.

Conclusion: Generating multiple intrinsic representations (pixel, depth, segmentation) effectively enhances UMMs' understanding capabilities, demonstrating that generation tasks can indeed improve understanding in multimodal models.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) integrate both visual understanding and generation within a single framework. Their ultimate aspiration is to create a cycle where understanding and generation mutually reinforce each other. While recent post-training methods have successfully leveraged understanding to enhance generation, the reverse direction of utilizing generation to improve understanding remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose UniMRG (Unified Multi-Representation Generation), a simple yet effective architecture-agnostic post-training method. UniMRG enhances the understanding capabilities of UMMs by incorporating auxiliary generation tasks. Specifically, we train UMMs to generate multiple intrinsic representations of input images, namely pixel (reconstruction), depth (geometry), and segmentation (structure), alongside standard visual understanding objectives. By synthesizing these diverse representations, UMMs capture complementary information regarding appearance, spatial relations, and structural layout. Consequently, UMMs develop a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of visual inputs. Extensive experiments across diverse UMM architectures demonstrate that our method notably enhances fine-grained perception, reduces hallucinations, and improves spatial understanding, while simultaneously boosting generation capabilities.

### [34] [MPF-Net: Exposing High-Fidelity AI-Generated Video Forgeries via Hierarchical Manifold Deviation and Micro-Temporal Fluctuations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21408)
*Xinan He,Kaiqing Lin,Yue Zhou,Jiaming Zhong,Wei Ye,Wenhui Yi,Bing Fan,Feng Ding,Haodong Li,Bo Cao,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a hierarchical dual-path framework to detect AI-generated videos by analyzing manifold projection fluctuations, using spatial anomaly detection followed by micro-temporal analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While modern video generation models produce high-quality content with minimal macro-level errors, AI-generated videos are fundamentally different from physical recordings. They result from manifold-fitting processes, creating structured pixel composition patterns that can serve as detection fingerprints.

Method: A hierarchical dual-path framework with sequential filtering: (1) Static Manifold Deviation Branch uses Vision Foundation Models to detect spatial anomalies or physical violations that deviate from natural real-world manifolds; (2) Micro-Temporal Fluctuation Branch analyzes structured manifold projection fluctuations in consecutive frames as a secondary filter for high-fidelity videos that evade spatial detection.

Result: The framework can detect AI-generated videos regardless of whether they show global real-world manifold deviations or subtle computational fingerprints, exposing forgeries that appear visually perfect.

Conclusion: AI-generated videos exhibit identifiable manifold projection fluctuations that serve as computational fingerprints, enabling detection through a hierarchical approach combining spatial anomaly detection with micro-temporal analysis, even for high-fidelity synthetic content.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of video generation models such as Veo and Wan, the visual quality of synthetic content has reached a level where macro-level semantic errors and temporal inconsistencies are no longer prominent. However, this does not imply that the distinction between real and cutting-edge high-fidelity fake is untraceable. We argue that AI-generated videos are essentially products of a manifold-fitting process rather than a physical recording. Consequently, the pixel composition logic of consecutive adjacent frames residual in AI videos exhibits a structured and homogenous characteristic. We term this phenomenon `Manifold Projection Fluctuations' (MPF). Driven by this insight, we propose a hierarchical dual-path framework that operates as a sequential filtering process. The first, the Static Manifold Deviation Branch, leverages the refined perceptual boundaries of Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to capture residual spatial anomalies or physical violations that deviate from the natural real-world manifold (off-manifold). For the remaining high-fidelity videos that successfully reside on-manifold and evade spatial detection, we introduce the Micro-Temporal Fluctuation Branch as a secondary, fine-grained filter. By analyzing the structured MPF that persists even in visually perfect sequences, our framework ensures that forgeries are exposed regardless of whether they manifest as global real-world manifold deviations or subtle computational fingerprints.

### [35] [From Implicit Ambiguity to Explicit Solidity: Diagnosing Interior Geometric Degradation in Neural Radiance Fields for Dense 3D Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21421)
*Jiangsan Zhao,Jakob Geipel,Kryzysztof Kusnierek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeRFs fail in dense, self-occluding scenes due to Interior Geometric Degradation, causing hollow structures and instance undercounting. An explicit SfM-based voxel approach achieves 95.8% recovery vs. 89% for NeRFs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have become popular for multi-view reconstruction but their reliability for quantitative 3D analysis in dense, self-occluding scenes remains poorly understood. The paper aims to identify fundamental failure modes and develop more robust approaches for such challenging scenarios.

Method: The paper identifies Interior Geometric Degradation (IGD) as a failure mode where implicit density fields create hollow structures under heavy occlusion. To overcome this, they introduce an explicit geometric pipeline based on Sparse Voxel Rasterization (SVRaster), initialized from SfM feature geometry. This projects 2D instance masks onto an explicit voxel grid and enforces geometric separation via recursive splitting to preserve physical solidity.

Result: Experiments show state-of-the-art mask-supervised NeRFs saturate at ~89% instance recovery in dense scenes. The explicit SVRaster approach achieves 95.8% recovery rate in dense clusters. Sensitivity analysis with degraded segmentation masks shows explicit SfM-based geometry recovers 43% more instances than implicit baselines and is substantially more robust to supervision failure.

Conclusion: Explicit geometric priors are essential for reliable quantitative analysis in highly self-occluding 3D scenes. The fundamental limitation of implicit density fields under heavy occlusion requires explicit geometric approaches like SfM-based voxel methods for accurate instance recovery in dense environments.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for multi-view reconstruction, complementing classical photogrammetric pipelines based on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS). However, their reliability for quantitative 3D analysis in dense, self-occluding scenes remains poorly understood. In this study, we identify a fundamental failure mode of implicit density fields under heavy occlusion, which we term Interior Geometric Degradation (IGD). We show that transmittance-based volumetric optimization satisfies photometric supervision by reconstructing hollow or fragmented structures rather than solid interiors, leading to systematic instance undercounting. Through controlled experiments on synthetic datasets with increasing occlusion, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art mask-supervised NeRFs saturate at approximately 89% instance recovery in dense scenes, despite improved surface coherence and mask quality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an explicit geometric pipeline based on Sparse Voxel Rasterization (SVRaster), initialized from SfM feature geometry. By projecting 2D instance masks onto an explicit voxel grid and enforcing geometric separation via recursive splitting, our approach preserves physical solidity and achieves a 95.8% recovery rate in dense clusters. A sensitivity analysis using degraded segmentation masks further shows that explicit SfM-based geometry is substantially more robust to supervision failure, recovering 43% more instances than implicit baselines. These results demonstrate that explicit geometric priors are a prerequisite for reliable quantitative analysis in highly self-occluding 3D scenes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a fundamental gap between multimodal pre-training (which enhances visual understanding) and unimodal fine-tuning (which limits benefits of rich pre-trained representations). Current fine-tuning predominantly remains unimodal despite advances in multimodal pre-training.

Method: 1) Transform unimodal datasets into multimodal ones using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate synthetic image captions with carefully designed prompts incorporating class labels and domain context. 2) Introduce supervised contrastive loss function that explicitly encourages clustering of same-class representations during fine-tuning. 3) Develop new inference technique that leverages class-averaged text embeddings from multiple synthetic captions per image.

Result: Extensive experiments across 13 image classification benchmarks show the approach outperforms baseline methods, with particularly significant improvements in few-shot learning scenarios.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for dataset enhancement that effectively bridges the gap between multimodal pre-training and fine-tuning, enabling better utilization of rich pre-trained representations.

Abstract: In this paper, we address a fundamental gap between pre-training and fine-tuning of deep neural networks: while pre-training has shifted from unimodal to multimodal learning with enhanced visual understanding, fine-tuning predominantly remains unimodal, limiting the benefits of rich pre-trained representations. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach that transforms unimodal datasets into multimodal ones using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate synthetic image captions for fine-tuning models with a multimodal objective. Our method employs carefully designed prompts incorporating class labels and domain context to produce high-quality captions tailored for classification tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a supervised contrastive loss function that explicitly encourages clustering of same-class representations during fine-tuning, along with a new inference technique that leverages class-averaged text embeddings from multiple synthetic captions per image.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The efficiency of long-video inference is a critical bottleneck due to dense computation in the prefill stage of Large Multimodal Models. Existing methods have limitations: visual embedding compression or single-GPU sparse attention yield limited acceleration or degraded performance, restricting LMMs from handling longer, more complex videos.

Method: Spava is a sequence-parallel framework with optimized attention that accelerates long-video inference across multiple GPUs. It distributes approximate attention to reduce computation and increase parallelism, enabling efficient processing of more visual embeddings without compression. System-level optimizations include load balancing and fused forward passes.

Conclusion: Spava effectively overcomes the long-video inference bottleneck by distributing approximate attention across multiple GPUs, achieving significant speedups while maintaining performance, enabling Large Multimodal Models to handle longer and more complex videos efficiently.

Abstract: The efficiency of long-video inference remains a critical bottleneck, mainly due to the dense computation in the prefill stage of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). Existing methods either compress visual embeddings or apply sparse attention on a single GPU, yielding limited acceleration or degraded performance and restricting LMMs from handling longer, more complex videos. To overcome these issues, we propose Spava, a sequence-parallel framework with optimized attention that accelerates long-video inference across multiple GPUs. By distributing approximate attention, Spava reduces computation and increases parallelism, enabling efficient processing of more visual embeddings without compression and thereby improving task performance. System-level optimizations, such as load balancing and fused forward passes, further unleash the potential of Spava, delivering speedups of 12.72x, 1.70x, and 1.18x over FlashAttn, ZigZagRing, and APB, without notable performance loss.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes metric learning losses through a diagnostic framework (VARIANCE and GREEDINESS) to understand their effects on embedding geometry and optimization dynamics across seven losses and five datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Metric learning is crucial for retrieval tasks, but there's limited understanding of how different loss functions affect embedding geometry and optimization dynamics, making it difficult to choose appropriate losses for different scenarios.

Method: Introduced VARIANCE (intra-/inter-class variance) and GREEDINESS (active ratio and gradient norms) diagnostic framework to compare seven representative metric learning losses (Contrastive, Triplet, N-pair, InfoNCE, ArcFace, SCL, CCL) across five image-retrieval datasets.

Result: Triplet and SCL preserve higher within-class variance and clearer inter-class margins, leading to stronger top-1 retrieval in fine-grained settings. Contrastive and InfoNCE achieve compact embeddings quickly through many small updates but may oversimplify class structures. N-pair achieves large mean separation but with uneven spacing.

Conclusion: Reveals an efficiency-granularity trade-off: prefer Triplet/SCL for diversity preservation and hard-sample discrimination, and Contrastive/InfoNCE for faster embedding compaction. Provides practical guidance for selecting appropriate metric learning losses based on specific needs.

Abstract: Metric learning is central to retrieval, yet its effects on embedding geometry and optimization dynamics are not well understood. We introduce a diagnostic framework, VARIANCE (intra-/inter-class variance) and GREEDINESS (active ratio and gradient norms), to compare seven representative losses, i.e., Contrastive, Triplet, N-pair, InfoNCE, ArcFace, SCL, and CCL, across five image-retrieval datasets. Our analysis reveals that Triplet and SCL preserve higher within-class variance and clearer inter-class margins, leading to stronger top-1 retrieval in fine-grained settings. In contrast, Contrastive and InfoNCE compact embeddings are achieved quickly through many small updates, accelerating convergence but potentially oversimplifying class structures. N-pair achieves a large mean separation but with uneven spacing. These insights reveal a form of efficiency-granularity trade-off and provide practical guidance: prefer Triplet/SCL when diversity preservation and hard-sample discrimination are critical, and Contrastive/InfoNCE when faster embedding compaction is desired.

Motivation: Modern deepfakes have evolved into localized and intermittent manipulations requiring fine-grained temporal localization, but frame-level annotation is prohibitively expensive, making weakly supervised methods necessary.

Method: Proposes RT-DeepLoc using a Masked Autoencoder trained only on authentic data to learn spatiotemporal patterns, producing reconstruction discrepancies for forged segments. Introduces Asymmetric Intra-video Contrastive Loss (AICL) to focus on authentic feature compactness guided by reconstruction cues.

Result: Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets including LAV-DF demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization.

Conclusion: RT-DeepLoc effectively addresses the challenge of fine-grained temporal deepfake localization through reconstruction-based approach and novel contrastive loss, providing a practical solution for weakly supervised scenarios.

Abstract: Modern deepfakes have evolved into localized and intermittent manipulations that require fine-grained temporal localization. The prohibitive cost of frame-level annotation makes weakly supervised methods a practical necessity, which rely only on video-level labels. To this end, we propose Reconstruction-based Temporal Deepfake Localization (RT-DeepLoc), a weakly supervised temporal forgery localization framework that identifies forgeries via reconstruction errors. Our framework uses a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) trained exclusively on authentic data to learn its intrinsic spatiotemporal patterns; this allows the model to produce significant reconstruction discrepancies for forged segments, effectively providing the missing fine-grained cues for localization. To robustly leverage these indicators, we introduce a novel Asymmetric Intra-video Contrastive Loss (AICL). By focusing on the compactness of authentic features guided by these reconstruction cues, AICL establishes a stable decision boundary that enhances local discrimination while preserving generalization to unseen forgeries. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets, including LAV-DF, demonstrate that RT-DeepLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance in weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first attempt to estimate the necessity of debulking coronary artery calcifications from computed tomography (CT) images. We formulate this task as a Multiple-instance Learning (MIL) problem. The difficulty of this task lies in that physicians adjust their focus and decision criteria for device usage according to tabular data representing each patient's condition. To address this issue, we propose a hypernetwork-based adaptive aggregation transformer (HyperAdAgFormer), which adaptively modifies the feature aggregation strategy for each patient based on tabular data through a hypernetwork.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GenAI approaches treat image generation and editing separately, leading to inefficiencies and challenges in maintaining spatial consistency and semantic coherence. There's also a lack of structured control over object relationships and spatial arrangements.

Method: Introduces SimGraph, a unified framework that integrates scene graph-based image generation and editing. It combines token-based generation and diffusion-based editing within a single scene graph-driven model to ensure precise control over object interactions, layouts, and spatial coherence.

Result: Through extensive experiments, the approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating high-quality and consistent results.

Conclusion: SimGraph provides an effective solution for unified image generation and editing with structured control over object relationships and spatial arrangements, addressing key limitations in current GenAI approaches.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of both image generation and editing. However, current approaches often treat these tasks separately, leading to inefficiencies and challenges in maintaining spatial consistency and semantic coherence between generated content and edits. Moreover, a major obstacle is the lack of structured control over object relationships and spatial arrangements. Scene graph-based methods, which represent objects and their interrelationships in a structured format, offer a solution by providing greater control over composition and interactions in both image generation and editing. To address this, we introduce SimGraph, a unified framework that integrates scene graph-based image generation and editing, enabling precise control over object interactions, layouts, and spatial coherence. In particular, our framework integrates token-based generation and diffusion-based editing within a single scene graph-driven model, ensuring high-quality and consistent results. Through extensive experiments, we empirically demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: This work highlights that video world modeling, alongside vision-language pre-training, establishes a fresh and independent foundation for robot learning. Intuitively, video world models provide the ability to imagine the near future by understanding the causality between actions and visual dynamics. Inspired by this, we introduce LingBot-VA, an autoregressive diffusion framework that learns frame prediction and policy execution simultaneously. Our model features three carefully crafted designs: (1) a shared latent space, integrating vision and action tokens, driven by a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture, (2) a closed-loop rollout mechanism, allowing for ongoing acquisition of environmental feedback with ground-truth observations, (3) an asynchronous inference pipeline, parallelizing action prediction and motor execution to support efficient control. We evaluate our model on both simulation benchmarks and real-world scenarios, where it shows significant promise in long-horizon manipulation, data efficiency in post-training, and strong generalizability to novel configurations. The code and model are made publicly available to facilitate the community.

*Teerapong Panboonyuen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HERS framework improves diffusion models for generating realistic vehicle damage images for insurance applications, enhancing fidelity and controllability while addressing fraud risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models can generate realistic vehicle damage, raising concerns about fraud in insurance workflows. There's a need for trustworthy, controllable generation that maintains domain alignment for safety-critical applications.

Method: HERS fine-tunes diffusion models via domain-specific expert adaptation without manual annotation. Uses self-supervised image-text pairs from LLMs and T2I pipelines, models each damage category as separate expert, then integrates into unified multi-damage model.

Result: Consistent improvements across four diffusion backbones: +5.5% in text faithfulness and +2.3% in human preference ratings compared to baselines. Framework enables better fraud detection and auditability.

Conclusion: HERS demonstrates both opportunities and risks of domain-specific diffusion models, highlighting importance of trustworthy generation in safety-critical applications like auto insurance.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled increasingly realistic synthesis of vehicle damage, raising concerns about their reliability in automated insurance workflows. The ability to generate crash-like imagery challenges the boundary between authentic and synthetic data, introducing new risks of misuse in fraud or claim manipulation. To address these issues, we propose HERS (Hidden-Pattern Expert Learning for Risk-Specific Damage Adaptation), a framework designed to improve fidelity, controllability, and domain alignment of diffusion-generated damage images. HERS fine-tunes a base diffusion model via domain-specific expert adaptation without requiring manual annotation. Using self-supervised image-text pairs automatically generated by a large language model and T2I pipeline, HERS models each damage category, such as dents, scratches, broken lights, or cracked paint, as a separate expert. These experts are later integrated into a unified multi-damage model that balances specialization with generalization. We evaluate HERS across four diffusion backbones and observe consistent improvements: plus 5.5 percent in text faithfulness and plus 2.3 percent in human preference ratings compared to baselines. Beyond image fidelity, we discuss implications for fraud detection, auditability, and safe deployment of generative models in high-stakes domains. Our findings highlight both the opportunities and risks of domain-specific diffusion, underscoring the importance of trustworthy generation in safety-critical applications such as auto insurance.

*Zhuoqin Yang,Jiansong Zhang,Xiaoling Luo,Xu Wu,Zheng Lu,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision KAN (ViK) is an attention-free vision backbone using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with MultiPatch-RBFKAN token mixer, achieving competitive ImageNet accuracy with linear complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attention mechanisms have quadratic complexity and interpretability issues, while recent attention-free architectures show strong performance, motivating search for efficient alternatives to attention.

Method: Introduces Vision KAN (ViK) with MultiPatch-RBFKAN token mixer combining: (a) patch-wise nonlinear transform with RBF-based KANs, (b) axis-wise separable mixing for local propagation, (c) low-rank global mapping for long-range interaction, using patch-wise grouping to reduce computational cost.

Result: ViK achieves competitive accuracy on ImageNet-1K with linear complexity, demonstrating KAN-based token mixing as an efficient alternative to attention mechanisms.

Conclusion: KAN-based token mixing offers an efficient, theoretically grounded alternative to attention mechanisms in vision backbones, with linear complexity and competitive performance.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have become a key module in modern vision backbones due to their ability to model long-range dependencies. However, their quadratic complexity in sequence length and the difficulty of interpreting attention weights limit both scalability and clarity. Recent attention-free architectures demonstrate that strong performance can be achieved without pairwise attention, motivating the search for alternatives. In this work, we introduce Vision KAN (ViK), an attention-free backbone inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. At its core lies MultiPatch-RBFKAN, a unified token mixer that combines (a) patch-wise nonlinear transform with Radial Basis Function-based KANs, (b) axis-wise separable mixing for efficient local propagation, and (c) low-rank global mapping for long-range interaction. Employing as a drop-in replacement for attention modules, this formulation tackles the prohibitive cost of full KANs on high-resolution features by adopting a patch-wise grouping strategy with lightweight operators to restore cross-patch dependencies. Experiments on ImageNet-1K show that ViK achieves competitive accuracy with linear complexity, demonstrating the potential of KAN-based token mixing as an efficient and theoretically grounded alternative to attention.

*Hongxu Chen,Hongxiang Li,Zhen Wang,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BA-solver accelerates Flow Matching models with a lightweight SideNet for bidirectional temporal perception and bi-anchor velocity integration, achieving 10x speedup with minimal training cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow Matching models have high latency due to iterative ODE solving. Existing solutions either degrade performance at low NFEs or require expensive training without plug-and-play versatility.

Method: Proposes Bi-Anchor Interpolation Solver (BA-solver) with: 1) Bidirectional Temporal Perception - SideNet learns future/historical velocities without retraining backbone, 2) Bi-Anchor Velocity Integration - uses SideNet with two anchor velocities for batched high-order integration.

Result: On ImageNet-256^2, achieves quality comparable to 100+ NFEs Euler solver in just 10 NFEs, maintains high fidelity in 5 NFEs with negligible training costs, and enables seamless integration with existing pipelines.

Conclusion: BA-solver bridges the gap between training-free and training-based acceleration methods, offering significant speedup with minimal overhead while maintaining versatility for downstream tasks.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) models have emerged as a leading paradigm for high-fidelity synthesis. However, their reliance on iterative Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solving creates a significant latency bottleneck. Existing solutions face a dichotomy: training-free solvers suffer from significant performance degradation at low Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs), while training-based one- or few-steps generation methods incur prohibitive training costs and lack plug-and-play versatility. To bridge this gap, we propose the Bi-Anchor Interpolation Solver (BA-solver). BA-solver retains the versatility of standard training-free solvers while achieving significant acceleration by introducing a lightweight SideNet (1-2% backbone size) alongside the frozen backbone. Specifically, our method is founded on two synergistic components: \textbf{1) Bidirectional Temporal Perception}, where the SideNet learns to approximate both future and historical velocities without retraining the heavy backbone; and 2) Bi-Anchor Velocity Integration, which utilizes the SideNet with two anchor velocities to efficiently approximate intermediate velocities for batched high-order integration. By utilizing the backbone to establish high-precision ``anchors'' and the SideNet to densify the trajectory, BA-solver enables large interval sizes with minimized error. Empirical results on ImageNet-256^2 demonstrate that BA-solver achieves generation quality comparable to 100+ NFEs Euler solver in just 10 NFEs and maintains high fidelity in as few as 5 NFEs, incurring negligible training costs. Furthermore, BA-solver ensures seamless integration with existing generative pipelines, facilitating downstream tasks such as image editing.

TL;DR: UDBM reformulates All-in-One Image Restoration as stochastic transport with pixel-wise uncertainty, using relaxed diffusion bridges and dual modulation for state-of-the-art single-step performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AiOIR methods struggle with conflicting optimization objectives across heterogeneous degradations due to coarse-grained control mechanisms or fixed mapping schedules, leading to suboptimal adaptation.

Method: Proposes Uncertainty-Aware Diffusion Bridge Model (UDBM) with relaxed diffusion bridge formulation to handle degradation uncertainty, dual modulation strategy (noise schedule for shared latent space, path schedule for adaptive transport trajectory), and resolves drift singularity issues.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse restoration tasks within a single inference step by effectively rectifying transport geometry and dynamics.

Conclusion: UDBM successfully addresses AiOIR challenges through stochastic transport formulation with uncertainty awareness and dual modulation, enabling superior adaptation to heterogeneous degradations in single-step inference.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) faces the fundamental challenge in reconciling conflicting optimization objectives across heterogeneous degradations. Existing methods are often constrained by coarse-grained control mechanisms or fixed mapping schedules, yielding suboptimal adaptation. To address this, we propose an Uncertainty-Aware Diffusion Bridge Model (UDBM), which innovatively reformulates AiOIR as a stochastic transport problem steered by pixel-wise uncertainty. By introducing a relaxed diffusion bridge formulation which replaces the strict terminal constraint with a relaxed constraint, we model the uncertainty of degradations while theoretically resolving the drift singularity inherent in standard diffusion bridges. Furthermore, we devise a dual modulation strategy: the noise schedule aligns diverse degradations into a shared high-entropy latent space, while the path schedule adaptively regulates the transport trajectory motivated by the viscous dynamics of entropy regularization. By effectively rectifying the transport geometry and dynamics, UDBM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse restoration tasks within a single inference step.

Abstract: The global water crisis necessitates affordable, accurate, and real-time water quality monitoring solutions. Traditional approaches relying on manual sampling or expensive commercial systems fail to address accessibility challenges in resource-constrained environments. This paper presents HydroSense, an innovative Internet of Things framework that integrates six critical water quality parameters including pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, total dissolved solids (TDS), estimated nitrogen, and water level into a unified monitoring system. HydroSense employs a novel dual-microcontroller architecture, utilizing Arduino Uno for precision analog measurements with five-point calibration algorithms and ESP32 for wireless connectivity, edge processing, and cloud integration. The system implements advanced signal processing techniques including median filtering for TDS measurement, temperature compensation algorithms, and robust error handling. Experimental validation over 90 days demonstrates exceptional performance metrics: pH accuracy of plus or minus 0.08 units across the 0 to 14 range, DO measurement stability within plus or minus 0.2 mg/L, TDS accuracy of plus or minus 1.9 percent across 0 to 1000 ppm, and 99.8 percent cloud data transmission reliability. With a total implementation cost of 32,983 BDT (approximately 300 USD), HydroSense achieves an 85 percent cost reduction compared to commercial systems while providing enhanced connectivity through the Firebase real-time database.

TL;DR: WMVLM is a unified vision-language framework that provides interpretable evaluation for both residual and semantic watermarks in diffusion model images, addressing limitations of existing evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing watermark evaluation methods lack a unified framework for both residual and semantic watermarks, provide non-interpretable results, neglect comprehensive security considerations, and use inappropriate metrics for semantic watermarks.

Method: Proposes WMVLM, a vision-language model framework with redefined quality/security metrics: artifact strength and erasure resistance for residual watermarks, and latent distribution shifts for semantic watermarks. Uses three-stage training for classification, scoring, and interpretable text generation.

Result: WMVLM outperforms state-of-the-art VLMs and demonstrates strong generalization across different datasets, diffusion models, and watermarking methods.

Conclusion: WMVLM provides the first unified and interpretable evaluation framework for diffusion model image watermarking, addressing critical gaps in current evaluation methodologies.

Abstract: Digital watermarking is essential for securing generated images from diffusion models. Accurate watermark evaluation is critical for algorithm development, yet existing methods have significant limitations: they lack a unified framework for both residual and semantic watermarks, provide results without interpretability, neglect comprehensive security considerations, and often use inappropriate metrics for semantic watermarks. To address these gaps, we propose WMVLM, the first unified and interpretable evaluation framework for diffusion model image watermarking via vision-language models (VLMs). We redefine quality and security metrics for each watermark type: residual watermarks are evaluated by artifact strength and erasure resistance, while semantic watermarks are assessed through latent distribution shifts. Moreover, we introduce a three-stage training strategy to progressively enable the model to achieve classification, scoring, and interpretable text generation. Experiments show WMVLM outperforms state-of-the-art VLMs with strong generalization across datasets, diffusion models, and watermarking methods.

TL;DR: PathReasoner introduces a large-scale WSI reasoning dataset and a model that provides verifiable evidence-linked reasoning for computational pathology, enhancing clinical trust through structured chain-of-thought capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs in pathology output direct conclusions without verifiable evidence-linked reasoning, limiting clinical trust and hindering expert error rectification. There's a need for transparent, clinically grounded reasoning capabilities.

Method: Constructed PathReasoner dataset using knowledge-guided generation pipeline with medical knowledge graphs to align findings with diagnoses (20K+ samples). Developed PathReasoner-R1 model with trajectory-masked supervised fine-tuning and reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning, using knowledge-aware multi-granular reward function with Entity Reward mechanism.

Result: PathReasoner-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on both PathReasoner dataset and public benchmarks across various image scales, demonstrating superior reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The work successfully equips pathology models with transparent, clinically grounded reasoning capabilities through structured chain-of-thought approaches, addressing critical trust barriers in computational pathology.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are advancing computational pathology with superior visual understanding capabilities. However, current systems often reduce diagnosis to directly output conclusions without verifiable evidence-linked reasoning, which severely limits clinical trust and hinders expert error rectification. To address these barriers, we construct PathReasoner, the first large-scale dataset of whole-slide image (WSI) reasoning. Unlike previous work reliant on unverified distillation, we develop a rigorous knowledge-guided generation pipeline. By leveraging medical knowledge graphs, we explicitly align structured pathological findings and clinical reasoning with diagnoses, generating over 20K high-quality instructional samples. Based on the database, we propose PathReasoner-R1, which synergizes trajectory-masked supervised fine-tuning with reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning to instill structured chain-of-thought capabilities. To ensure medical rigor, we engineer a knowledge-aware multi-granular reward function incorporating an Entity Reward mechanism strictly aligned with knowledge graphs. This effectively guides the model to optimize for logical consistency rather than mere outcome matching, thereby enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PathReasoner-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on both PathReasoner and public benchmarks across various image scales, equipping pathology models with transparent, clinically grounded reasoning capabilities.

### [50] [Similarity of Processing Steps in Vision Model Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21621)
*Matéo Mahaut,Marco Baroni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision models converge to similar final representations but take different intermediate paths, with CNNs, transformers, and classifiers showing distinct processing behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While prior work shows models converge to similar "universal" representations, this paper investigates whether they also converge to the same intermediate processing steps and operations, examining the processes leading to convergent representations.

Method: Quantify distances between different model representations at different processing stages, track evolution of distances throughout processing, and identify which processing steps are most different between models.

Result: Layers at similar positions have most similar representations but strong differences remain; classifiers discard low-level image statistics in final layers; transformers apply smoother changes between layers than CNNs.

Conclusion: The study clarifies the level and nature of convergence between model representations and enables more qualitative understanding of underlying processes in image models.

Abstract: Recent literature suggests that the bigger the model, the more likely it is to converge to similar, ``universal'' representations, despite different training objectives, datasets, or modalities. While this literature shows that there is an area where model representations are similar, we study here how vision models might get to those representations -- in particular, do they also converge to the same intermediate steps and operations? We therefore study the processes that lead to convergent representations in different models. First, we quantify distance between different model representations at different stages. We follow the evolution of distances between models throughout processing, identifying the processing steps which are most different between models. We find that while layers at similar positions in different models have the most similar representations, strong differences remain. Classifier models, unlike the others, will discard information about low-level image statistics in their final layers. CNN- and transformer-based models also behave differently, with transformer models applying smoother changes to representations from one layer to the next. These distinctions clarify the level and nature of convergence between model representations, and enables a more qualitative account of the underlying processes in image models.

*Pu Cao,Yiyang Ma,Feng Zhou,Xuedan Yin,Qing Song,Lu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Current autoencoder evaluation in latent diffusion models overly favors generative metrics (gFID) over reconstruction fidelity, creating risks for controllable generation where reconstruction metrics better predict condition preservation and controllability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies a systematic bias in autoencoder evaluation for latent diffusion models, where recent ImageNet-scale studies increasingly prioritize generative metrics (gFID) over reconstruction fidelity, potentially harming controllable generation tasks.

Method: The authors conduct theoretical analysis of why gFID-dominant preference appears unproblematic for ImageNet generation but becomes risky for controllable diffusion. They empirically validate using multiple recent ImageNet autoencoders with a multi-dimensional condition-drift evaluation protocol and ControlNet experiments.

Result: gFID is only weakly predictive of condition preservation in controllable generation, while reconstruction-oriented metrics are substantially more aligned. ControlNet experiments confirm that controllability tracks condition preservation rather than gFID.

Conclusion: There's a gap between ImageNet-centric autoencoder evaluation and requirements for scalable controllable diffusion. The paper offers practical guidance for more reliable benchmarking and model selection that balances reconstruction fidelity with generative metrics.

Abstract: In latent diffusion models, the autoencoder (AE) is typically expected to balance two capabilities: faithful reconstruction and a generation-friendly latent space (e.g., low gFID). In recent ImageNet-scale AE studies, we observe a systematic bias toward generative metrics in handling this trade-off: reconstruction metrics are increasingly under-reported, and ablation-based AE selection often favors the best-gFID configuration even when reconstruction fidelity degrades. We theoretically analyze why this gFID-dominant preference can appear unproblematic for ImageNet generation, yet becomes risky when scaling to controllable diffusion: AEs can induce condition drift, which limits achievable condition alignment. Meanwhile, we find that reconstruction fidelity, especially instance-level measures, better indicates controllability. We empirically validate the impact of tilted autoencoder evaluation on controllability by studying several recent ImageNet AEs. Using a multi-dimensional condition-drift evaluation protocol reflecting controllable generation tasks, we find that gFID is only weakly predictive of condition preservation, whereas reconstruction-oriented metrics are substantially more aligned. ControlNet experiments further confirm that controllability tracks condition preservation rather than gFID. Overall, our results expose a gap between ImageNet-centric AE evaluation and the requirements of scalable controllable diffusion, offering practical guidance for more reliable benchmarking and model selection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote Sensing Visual Grounding faces unique challenges due to vast spatial scales and high semantic ambiguity in aerial imagery, where language descriptions heavily rely on positional cues. Existing Multimodal Large Language Models struggle with spatial reasoning in these complex scenarios.

Method: Proposes RSGround-R1 with three key components: 1) Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning using synthetic RSVG reasoning data for explicit position awareness; 2) Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with novel positional reward providing continuous, distance-aware guidance; 3) Spatial consistency guided optimization that dynamically adjusts policy updates based on spatial coherence for stable convergence.

Result: Extensive experiments on RSVG benchmarks demonstrate superior performance and generalization of the proposed model compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The RSGround-R1 framework effectively addresses spatial reasoning challenges in remote sensing visual grounding through progressive enhancement of spatial understanding, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark tasks.

Abstract: Remote Sensing Visual Grounding (RSVG) aims to localize target objects in large-scale aerial imagery based on natural language descriptions. Owing to the vast spatial scale and high semantic ambiguity of remote sensing scenes, these descriptions often rely heavily on positional cues, posing unique challenges for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in spatial reasoning. To leverage this unique feature, we propose a reasoning-guided, position-aware post-training framework, dubbed \textbf{RSGround-R1}, to progressively enhance spatial understanding. Specifically, we first introduce Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (CoT-SFT) using synthetically generated RSVG reasoning data to establish explicit position awareness. Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) is then applied, augmented by our newly designed positional reward that provides continuous and distance-aware guidance toward accurate localization. Moreover, to mitigate incoherent localization behaviors across rollouts, we introduce a spatial consistency guided optimization scheme that dynamically adjusts policy updates based on their spatial coherence, ensuring stable and robust convergence. Extensive experiments on RSVG benchmarks demonstrate superior performance and generalization of our model.

TL;DR: OCRVerse is the first end-to-end holistic OCR method that unifies text-centric OCR (documents) and vision-centric OCR (charts, web pages, plots) through comprehensive data engineering and a two-stage SFT-RL training approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OCR methods focus only on text extraction from documents, neglecting visual information extraction from visually-dense sources like charts, web pages, and scientific plots, which are widespread and have significant real-world application value.

Method: Two-stage SFT-RL multi-domain training: 1) SFT mixes cross-domain data to establish initial domain knowledge, 2) RL uses personalized reward strategies customized for each domain's output format requirements, with comprehensive data engineering covering both text-centric documents and vision-centric rendered composites.

Result: OCRVerse achieves competitive results across both text-centric and vision-centric data types, comparable to large-scale open-source and closed-source models.

Conclusion: OCRVerse successfully addresses the gap in existing OCR methods by providing a unified end-to-end solution for both text-centric and vision-centric OCR, demonstrating effectiveness through comprehensive data engineering and adaptive multi-domain training.

Abstract: The development of large vision language models drives the demand for managing, and applying massive amounts of multimodal data, making OCR technology, which extracts information from visual images, increasingly popular. However, existing OCR methods primarily focus on recognizing text elements from images or scanned documents (\textbf{Text-centric OCR}), neglecting the identification of visual elements from visually information-dense image sources (\textbf{Vision-centric OCR}), such as charts, web pages and science plots. In reality, these visually information-dense images are widespread on the internet and have significant real-world application value, such as data visualization and web page analysis. In this technical report, we propose \textbf{OCRVerse}, the first holistic OCR method in end-to-end manner that enables unified text-centric OCR and vision-centric OCR. To this end, we constructe comprehensive data engineering to cover a wide range of text-centric documents, such as newspapers, magazines and books, as well as vision-centric rendered composites, including charts, web pages and scientific plots. Moreover, we propose a two-stage SFT-RL multi-domain training method for OCRVerse. SFT directly mixes cross-domain data to train and establish initial domain knowledge, while RL focuses on designing personalized reward strategies for the characteristics of each domain. Specifically, since different domains require various output formats and expected outputs, we provide sufficient flexibility in the RL stage to customize flexible reward signals for each domain, thereby improving cross-domain fusion and avoiding data conflicts. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of OCRVerse, achieving competitive results across text-centric and vision-centric data types, even comparable to large-scale open-source and closed-source models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning approaches for depression detection have limitations: they rely on limited feature types, overlook explicit cross-modal interactions, and use simple concatenation or static weighting for fusion, which hinders effective multimodal analysis.

Method: Proposes CAF-Mamba, a novel Mamba-based cross-modal adaptive attention fusion framework that captures both explicit and implicit cross-modal interactions and dynamically adjusts modality contributions through a modality-wise attention mechanism.

Result: Experiments on two in-the-wild benchmark datasets (LMVD and D-Vlog) show that CAF-Mamba consistently outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: CAF-Mamba effectively addresses limitations of existing depression detection methods through its adaptive multimodal fusion approach, demonstrating superior performance on real-world datasets.

Abstract: Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder that severely impairs daily functioning and quality of life. While recent deep learning approaches for depression detection have shown promise, most rely on limited feature types, overlook explicit cross-modal interactions, and employ simple concatenation or static weighting for fusion. To overcome these limitations, we propose CAF-Mamba, a novel Mamba-based cross-modal adaptive attention fusion framework. CAF-Mamba not only captures cross-modal interactions explicitly and implicitly, but also dynamically adjusts modality contributions through a modality-wise attention mechanism, enabling more effective multimodal fusion. Experiments on two in-the-wild benchmark datasets, LMVD and D-Vlog, demonstrate that CAF-Mamba consistently outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning model for glacier calving front delineation fails in real-world novel sites despite benchmark success; domain adaptation with spatial priors and seasonal data reduces error from 1131.6m to 68.7m.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art glacier calving front delineation models perform well on benchmarks but fail in real-world novel study sites, creating insufficient accuracy for scientific applications when encountering out-of-distribution domains.

Method: Employed few-shot domain adaptation strategy, incorporated spatial static prior knowledge, and included summer reference images in input time series without architectural modifications.

Result: Delineation error reduced dramatically from 1131.6 meters to 68.7 meters, enabling practical application at novel study sites.

Conclusion: Methodological advancements establish a framework for applying deep learning-based calving front segmentation to novel sites, enabling global-scale calving front monitoring.

Abstract: During benchmarking, the state-of-the-art model for glacier calving front delineation achieves near-human performance. However, when applied in a real-world setting at a novel study site, its delineation accuracy is insufficient for calving front products intended for further scientific analyses. This site represents an out-of-distribution domain for a model trained solely on the benchmark dataset. By employing a few-shot domain adaptation strategy, incorporating spatial static prior knowledge, and including summer reference images in the input time series, the delineation error is reduced from 1131.6 m to 68.7 m without any architectural modifications. These methodological advancements establish a framework for applying deep learning-based calving front segmentation to novel study sites, enabling calving front monitoring on a global scale.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A geometry-aware regularization framework called \regName that addresses representation collapse and cross-modal inconsistency in multimodal learning through intra-modal dispersive and inter-modal anchoring constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal models often suffer from geometric pathologies like intra-modal representation collapse and sample-level cross-modal inconsistency, even with balanced training. These issues degrade both unimodal robustness and multimodal fusion performance, indicating representation geometry is a missing control axis in multimodal learning.

Method: Proposes \regName, a lightweight geometry-aware regularization framework with two complementary constraints: 1) intra-modal dispersive regularization to promote representation diversity within each modality, and 2) inter-modal anchoring regularization that bounds sample-level cross-modal drift without requiring rigid alignment. The method is plug-and-play, requires no architectural modifications, and is compatible with various training paradigms.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in both multimodal and unimodal performance, showing that explicitly regulating representation geometry effectively mitigates modality trade-offs.

Conclusion: Representation geometry is a crucial but overlooked control axis in multimodal learning. The proposed \regName framework successfully addresses geometric pathologies through lightweight regularization, improving both multimodal fusion and unimodal robustness without architectural changes.

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to integrate complementary information from heterogeneous modalities, yet strong optimization alone does not guaranty well-structured representations. Even under carefully balanced training schemes, multimodal models often exhibit geometric pathologies, including intra-modal representation collapse and sample-level cross-modal inconsistency, which degrade both unimodal robustness and multimodal fusion.
  We identify representation geometry as a missing control axis in multimodal learning and propose \regName, a lightweight geometry-aware regularization framework. \regName enforces two complementary constraints on intermediate embeddings: an intra-modal dispersive regularization that promotes representation diversity, and an inter-modal anchoring regularization that bounds sample-level cross-modal drift without rigid alignment. The proposed regularizer is plug-and-play, requires no architectural modifications, and is compatible with various training paradigms.
  Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in both multimodal and unimodal performance, showing that explicitly regulating representation geometry effectively mitigates modality trade-offs.

TL;DR: MVSC compresses 3D sMRI volumes into compact 2D visual surrogates aligned with frozen 2D foundation models for improved Alzheimer's disease classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D sMRI methods have three main limitations: high computational cost of 3D architectures, loss of cross-slice relations in slice-wise approaches, and limited discriminative feature extraction from training-free 2D foundation models.

Method: MVSC learns to compress 3D sMRI volumes into compact 2D visual surrogates using two key components: Volume Context Encoder (captures global cross-slice context under textual guidance) and Adaptive Slice Fusion (aggregates slice-level information in text-enhanced, patch-wise manner).

Result: Extensive experiments on three large-scale Alzheimer's disease benchmarks show MVSC performs favorably on both binary and multi-class classification tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MVSC effectively addresses limitations of existing sMRI representation learning methods by compressing 3D volumes into 2D features better aligned with powerful 2D foundation models for improved AD diagnosis.

Abstract: High-dimensional structural MRI (sMRI) images are widely used for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) diagnosis. Most existing methods for sMRI representation learning rely on 3D architectures (e.g., 3D CNNs), slice-wise feature extraction with late aggregation, or apply training-free feature extractions using 2D foundation models (e.g., DINO). However, these three paradigms suffer from high computational cost, loss of cross-slice relations, and limited ability to extract discriminative features, respectively. To address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Visual Surrogate Compression (MVSC). It learns to compress and adapt large 3D sMRI volumes into compact 2D features, termed as visual surrogates, which are better aligned with frozen 2D foundation models to extract powerful representations for final AD classification. MVSC has two key components: a Volume Context Encoder that captures global cross-slice context under textual guidance, and an Adaptive Slice Fusion module that aggregates slice-level information in a text-enhanced, patch-wise manner. Extensive experiments on three large-scale Alzheimer's disease benchmarks demonstrate our MVSC performs favourably on both binary and multi-class classification tasks compared against state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: ChartE³ is an end-to-end chart editing benchmark that evaluates models directly without intermediate representations, focusing on both local appearance changes and global structural transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing chart editing approaches rely on pipeline designs with natural language or code as intermediate representations, which limits their ability to faithfully execute complex edits. There's a need for end-to-end evaluation that doesn't depend on these intermediate steps.

Method: Created ChartE³ benchmark with over 1,200 high-quality samples constructed via a well-designed data pipeline with human curation. Each sample includes a chart image, underlying code, and multimodal editing instruction, enabling both objective and subjective evaluation across local editing (fine-grained appearance changes) and global editing (holistic, data-centric transformations).

Result: Extensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models reveals substantial performance gaps, particularly on global editing tasks, highlighting critical limitations in current end-to-end chart editing capabilities.

Conclusion: ChartE³ provides a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating end-to-end chart editing capabilities, revealing significant limitations in current models, especially for complex global transformations, and establishing a foundation for future improvements in chart editing systems.

Abstract: Charts are a fundamental visualization format for structured data analysis. Enabling end-to-end chart editing according to user intent is of great practical value, yet remains challenging due to the need for both fine-grained control and global structural consistency. Most existing approaches adopt pipeline-based designs, where natural language or code serves as an intermediate representation, limiting their ability to faithfully execute complex edits. We introduce ChartE$^{3}$, an End-to-End Chart Editing benchmark that directly evaluates models without relying on intermediate natural language programs or code-level supervision. ChartE$^{3}$ focuses on two complementary editing dimensions: local editing, which involves fine-grained appearance changes such as font or color adjustments, and global editing, which requires holistic, data-centric transformations including data filtering and trend line addition. ChartE$^{3}$ contains over 1,200 high-quality samples constructed via a well-designed data pipeline with human curation. Each sample is provided as a triplet of a chart image, its underlying code, and a multimodal editing instruction, enabling evaluation from both objective and subjective perspectives. Extensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models reveals substantial performance gaps, particularly on global editing tasks, highlighting critical limitations in current end-to-end chart editing capabilities.

TL;DR: DreamActor-M2 is a universal character animation framework that addresses motion injection trade-offs and pose prior limitations through in-context learning and self-bootstrapped data synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing character animation methods suffer from suboptimal motion injection strategies (creating a "see-saw" trade-off between identity preservation and motion consistency) and over-reliance on explicit pose priors that inadequately capture intricate dynamics and hinder generalization to arbitrary characters.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) Fuses reference appearance and motion cues into unified latent space using foundational models' generative priors, (2) Self-bootstrapped data synthesis pipeline creates pseudo cross-identity training pairs to transition from pose-dependent control to end-to-end RGB-driven animation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior visual fidelity and robust cross-domain generalization across diverse characters and motion scenarios, validated through extensive experiments and the new AW Bench benchmark.

Conclusion: DreamActor-M2 successfully addresses fundamental challenges in character animation by reimagining motion conditioning as in-context learning, enabling universal animation with improved motion consistency and identity preservation without relying on explicit pose priors.

Abstract: Character image animation aims to synthesize high-fidelity videos by transferring motion from a driving sequence to a static reference image. Despite recent advancements, existing methods suffer from two fundamental challenges: (1) suboptimal motion injection strategies that lead to a trade-off between identity preservation and motion consistency, manifesting as a "see-saw", and (2) an over-reliance on explicit pose priors (e.g., skeletons), which inadequately capture intricate dynamics and hinder generalization to arbitrary, non-humanoid characters. To address these challenges, we present DreamActor-M2, a universal animation framework that reimagines motion conditioning as an in-context learning problem. Our approach follows a two-stage paradigm. First, we bridge the input modality gap by fusing reference appearance and motion cues into a unified latent space, enabling the model to jointly reason about spatial identity and temporal dynamics by leveraging the generative prior of foundational models. Second, we introduce a self-bootstrapped data synthesis pipeline that curates pseudo cross-identity training pairs, facilitating a seamless transition from pose-dependent control to direct, end-to-end RGB-driven animation. This strategy significantly enhances generalization across diverse characters and motion scenarios. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we further introduce AW Bench, a versatile benchmark encompassing a wide spectrum of characters types and motion scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamActor-M2 achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior visual fidelity and robust cross-domain generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes GMC, a fine-grained IQA evaluation method using granularity-modulated correlation surfaces instead of single scalar metrics like PLCC/SRCC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global correlation metrics (PLCC/SRCC) reduce IQA performance to single scalars, hiding local variations in ranking consistency across quality spectrum and being sensitive to test-sample distributions.

Method: GMC includes: (1) Granularity Modulator with Gaussian-weighted correlations conditioned on MOS values and pairwise MOS differences, (2) Distribution Regulator to mitigate biases from non-uniform quality distributions, producing 3D correlation surfaces.

Result: Experiments on standard benchmarks show GMC reveals performance characteristics invisible to scalar metrics, providing more informative and reliable IQA analysis.

Conclusion: GMC offers a more informative paradigm for analyzing, comparing, and deploying IQA models by providing structured, fine-grained performance analysis through correlation surfaces.

Abstract: Evaluation of Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models has long been dominated by global correlation metrics, such as Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient (PLCC) and Spearman Rank-Order Correlation Coefficient (SRCC). While widely adopted, these metrics reduce performance to a single scalar, failing to capture how ranking consistency varies across the local quality spectrum. For example, two IQA models may achieve identical SRCC values, yet one ranks high-quality images (related to high Mean Opinion Score, MOS) more reliably, while the other better discriminates image pairs with small quality/MOS differences (related to $|Δ$MOS$|$). Such complementary behaviors are invisible under global metrics. Moreover, SRCC and PLCC are sensitive to test-sample quality distributions, yielding unstable comparisons across test sets. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Granularity-Modulated Correlation (GMC)}, which provides a structured, fine-grained analysis of IQA performance. GMC includes: (1) a \textbf{Granularity Modulator} that applies Gaussian-weighted correlations conditioned on absolute MOS values and pairwise MOS differences ($|Δ$MOS$|$) to examine local performance variations, and (2) a \textbf{Distribution Regulator} that regularizes correlations to mitigate biases from non-uniform quality distributions. The resulting \textbf{correlation surface} maps correlation values as a joint function of MOS and $|Δ$MOS$|$, providing a 3D representation of IQA performance. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that GMC reveals performance characteristics invisible to scalar metrics, offering a more informative and reliable paradigm for analyzing, comparing, and deploying IQA models.

TL;DR: DGNav addresses the "Granularity Rigidity" problem in VLN-CE by introducing dynamic topological navigation with adaptive graph construction and connectivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing topological planning methods in Vision-Language Navigation suffer from fixed geometric thresholds that fail to adapt to varying environmental complexities, causing over-sampling in simple areas and under-sampling in high-uncertainty regions.

Method: Two core innovations: 1) Scene-Aware Adaptive Strategy that dynamically modulates graph construction thresholds based on predicted waypoint dispersion, and 2) Dynamic Graph Transformer that reconstructs graph connectivity by fusing visual, linguistic, and geometric cues into dynamic edge weights.

Result: Superior navigation performance and strong generalization capabilities on R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks, achieving optimal trade-off between navigation efficiency and safe exploration.

Conclusion: DGNav effectively addresses the granularity rigidity problem in VLN-CE through dynamic topological navigation, enabling context-aware map density and connectivity adaptation for improved performance and safety.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) presents a core challenge: grounding high-level linguistic instructions into precise, safe, and long-horizon spatial actions. Explicit topological maps have proven to be a vital solution for providing robust spatial memory in such tasks. However, existing topological planning methods suffer from a "Granularity Rigidity" problem. Specifically, these methods typically rely on fixed geometric thresholds to sample nodes, which fails to adapt to varying environmental complexities. This rigidity leads to a critical mismatch: the model tends to over-sample in simple areas, causing computational redundancy, while under-sampling in high-uncertainty regions, increasing collision risks and compromising precision. To address this, we propose DGNav, a framework for Dynamic Topological Navigation, introducing a context-aware mechanism to modulate map density and connectivity on-the-fly. Our approach comprises two core innovations: (1) A Scene-Aware Adaptive Strategy that dynamically modulates graph construction thresholds based on the dispersion of predicted waypoints, enabling "densification on demand" in challenging environments; (2) A Dynamic Graph Transformer that reconstructs graph connectivity by fusing visual, linguistic, and geometric cues into dynamic edge weights, enabling the agent to filter out topological noise and enhancing instruction adherence. Extensive experiments on the R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks demonstrate DGNav exhibits superior navigation performance and strong generalization capabilities. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm that our framework achieves an optimal trade-off between navigation efficiency and safe exploration.

TL;DR: Single-view 3D ship reconstruction pipeline trained on synthetic data only, using 3D Gaussian representations for real-time maritime monitoring without real-world 3D annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D reconstruction methods require multi-view supervision, annotated 3D ground truth, or are computationally intensive, making them impractical for real-time maritime deployment. There's a need for efficient single-view reconstruction for maritime monitoring applications.

Method: Uses Splatter Image network with 3D Gaussian representations, fine-tuned on synthetic ShapeNet vessels and custom ship dataset. Integrates YOLOv8 segmentation and custom preprocessing, with postprocessing for real-world scaling, centering, orientation alignment, and georeferenced placement on web maps using AIS metadata.

Conclusion: The pipeline provides an efficient, scalable solution for maritime monitoring, highlighting a path toward real-time 3D ship visualization in practical applications without requiring real-world 3D annotations.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of ships is an important part of maritime monitoring, allowing improved visualization, inspection, and decision-making in real-world monitoring environments. However, most state-ofthe-art 3D reconstruction methods require multi-view supervision, annotated 3D ground truth, or are computationally intensive, making them impractical for real-time maritime deployment. In this work, we present an efficient pipeline for single-view 3D reconstruction of real ships by training entirely on synthetic data and requiring only a single view at inference. Our approach uses the Splatter Image network, which represents objects as sparse sets of 3D Gaussians for rapid and accurate reconstruction from single images. The model is first fine-tuned on synthetic ShapeNet vessels and further refined with a diverse custom dataset of 3D ships, bridging the domain gap between synthetic and real-world imagery. We integrate a state-of-the-art segmentation module based on YOLOv8 and custom preprocessing to ensure compatibility with the reconstruction network. Postprocessing steps include real-world scaling, centering, and orientation alignment, followed by georeferenced placement on an interactive web map using AIS metadata and homography-based mapping. Quantitative evaluation on synthetic validation data demonstrates strong reconstruction fidelity, while qualitative results on real maritime images from the ShipSG dataset confirm the potential for transfer to operational maritime settings. The final system provides interactive 3D inspection of real ships without requiring real-world 3D annotations. This pipeline provides an efficient, scalable solution for maritime monitoring and highlights a path toward real-time 3D ship visualization in practical applications.

TL;DR: CG-MLLM is a multi-modal LLM that achieves both 3D captioning and high-resolution 3D generation in a single framework using a Mixture-of-Transformer architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have advanced text generation and multimodal perception, but their 3D content generation capabilities remain limited. Existing methods produce either low-resolution meshes or coarse structural proxies, failing to capture fine-grained geometry natively.

Method: CG-MLLM uses a Mixture-of-Transformer architecture with two components: Token-level Autoregressive (TokenAR) Transformer for token-level content and Block-level Autoregressive (BlockAR) Transformer for block-level content. It integrates a pre-trained vision-language backbone with a specialized 3D VAE latent space to enable long-context interactions between standard tokens and spatial blocks.

Result: Experimental results show CG-MLLM significantly outperforms existing MLLMs in generating high-fidelity 3D objects, effectively bringing high-resolution 3D content creation into the mainstream LLM paradigm.

Conclusion: CG-MLLM successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by enabling both 3D captioning and high-resolution 3D generation within a single integrated framework, advancing 3D content creation capabilities for LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models(LLMs) have revolutionized text generation and multimodal perception, but their capabilities in 3D content generation remain underexplored. Existing methods compromise by producing either low-resolution meshes or coarse structural proxies, failing to capture fine-grained geometry natively. In this paper, we propose CG-MLLM, a novel Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) capable of 3D captioning and high-resolution 3D generation in a single framework. Leveraging the Mixture-of-Transformer architecture, CG-MLLM decouples disparate modeling needs, where the Token-level Autoregressive (TokenAR) Transformer handles token-level content, and the Block-level Autoregressive (BlockAR) Transformer handles block-level content. By integrating a pre-trained vision-language backbone with a specialized 3D VAE latent space, CG-MLLM facilitates long-context interactions between standard tokens and spatial blocks within a single integrated architecture. Experimental results show that CG-MLLM significantly outperforms existing MLLMs in generating high-fidelity 3D objects, effectively bringing high-resolution 3D content creation into the mainstream LLM paradigm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-source Vision Language Models lag behind proprietary systems due to lack of high-quality reasoning data, especially in challenging domains like STEM diagrams and visual puzzles, and insufficient consistent long-form Chain-of-Thought annotations.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: (1) large-scale data collection/standardization, (2) CoT rationale generation using Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Thinking, (3) comprehensive selection based on reasoning quality and difficulty awareness. Fine-tuned Qwen3-VL-Instruct on MMFineReason to create 2B/4B/8B versions.

Result: MMFineReason models achieve new SOTA for their size class: 4B surpasses Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking, 8B outperforms Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Thinking and approaches Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking. Found "less is more" phenomenon - 7% subset (123K samples) achieves comparable performance to full dataset.

Conclusion: High-quality reasoning data is crucial for VLM performance. MMFineReason enables open-source models to match/exceed larger proprietary models with remarkable parameter efficiency. Difficulty-aware filtering and reasoning-oriented data composition boost both specialized and general capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have driven significant progress in visual reasoning. However, open-source VLMs still lag behind proprietary systems, largely due to the lack of high-quality reasoning data. Existing datasets offer limited coverage of challenging domains such as STEM diagrams and visual puzzles, and lack consistent, long-form Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations essential for eliciting strong reasoning capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMFineReason, a large-scale multimodal reasoning dataset comprising 1.8M samples and 5.1B solution tokens, featuring high-quality reasoning annotations distilled from Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Thinking. The dataset is established via a systematic three-stage pipeline: (1) large-scale data collection and standardization, (2) CoT rationale generation, and (3) comprehensive selection based on reasoning quality and difficulty awareness. The resulting dataset spans STEM problems, visual puzzles, games, and complex diagrams, with each sample annotated with visually grounded reasoning traces. We fine-tune Qwen3-VL-Instruct on MMFineReason to develop MMFineReason-2B/4B/8B versions. Our models establish new state-of-the-art results for their size class. Notably, MMFineReason-4B succesfully surpasses Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking, and MMFineReason-8B even outperforms Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Thinking while approaching Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency. Crucially, we uncover a "less is more" phenomenon via our difficulty-aware filtering strategy: a subset of just 7\% (123K samples) achieves performance comparable to the full dataset. Notably, we reveal a synergistic effect where reasoning-oriented data composition simultaneously boosts general capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion framework for document background generation that preserves foreground content and maintains multi-page stylistic consistency through latent-space trajectory design rather than explicit constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of preserving readable foreground content in document background generation and maintaining stylistic consistency across multiple pages without relying on explicit constraints or repeated prompt specifications.

Method: Reinterprets diffusion as evolution of stochastic trajectories in structured latent space. Shapes initial noise and geometric alignment to naturally avoid foreground regions. Decouples style control from text conditioning using cached style directions as persistent vectors in latent space to constrain diffusion to shared stylistic subspace.

Result: Produces visually coherent, foreground-preserving results across complex documents. Achieves multi-page stylistic consistency without repeated prompt specifications. Framework is training-free and compatible with existing diffusion backbones.

Conclusion: By reframing diffusion as trajectory design in latent space, the method offers a principled approach to consistent and structured generative modeling that eliminates the need for explicit constraints while maintaining foreground preservation and stylistic consistency.

Abstract: We present a diffusion-based framework for document-centric background generation that achieves foreground preservation and multi-page stylistic consistency through latent-space design rather than explicit constraints. Instead of suppressing diffusion updates or applying masking heuristics, our approach reinterprets diffusion as the evolution of stochastic trajectories through a structured latent space. By shaping the initial noise and its geometric alignment, background generation naturally avoids designated foreground regions, allowing readable content to remain intact without auxiliary mechanisms. To address the long-standing issue of stylistic drift across pages, we decouple style control from text conditioning and introduce cached style directions as persistent vectors in latent space. Once selected, these directions constrain diffusion trajectories to a shared stylistic subspace, ensuring consistent appearance across pages and editing iterations. This formulation eliminates the need for repeated prompt-based style specification and provides a more stable foundation for multi-page generation. Our framework admits a geometric and physical interpretation, where diffusion paths evolve on a latent manifold shaped by preferred directions, and foreground regions are rarely traversed as a consequence of trajectory initialization rather than explicit exclusion. The proposed method is training-free, compatible with existing diffusion backbones, and produces visually coherent, foreground-preserving results across complex documents. By reframing diffusion as trajectory design in latent space, we offer a principled approach to consistent and structured generative modeling.

TL;DR: The paper provides an optimization-based interpretation of classifier-free guidance (CFG), reformulating it as homotopy optimization with manifold constraints and improving it with Anderson Acceleration for better efficiency and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFG is widely used for controllable generation but relies on heuristic linear extrapolation that is sensitive to guidance scale. The authors aim to provide a principled interpretation and improve CFG's robustness and performance.

Method: 1) Interpret CFG through optimization lens, showing velocity field corresponds to gradient of smoothed distance functions. 2) Reformulate CFG sampling as homotopy optimization with manifold constraint. 3) Implement manifold projection via incremental gradient descent. 4) Enhance with Anderson Acceleration for efficiency without extra model evaluations.

Result: Proposed methods are training-free and consistently improve generation fidelity, prompt alignment, and robustness to guidance scale across diverse benchmarks including DiT-XL-2-256, Flux, and Stable Diffusion 3.5.

Conclusion: The optimization-based interpretation provides a principled foundation for CFG, and the proposed homotopy optimization with manifold constraints and Anderson Acceleration offers improved performance and stability for controllable generation.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for controllable generation in diffusion and flow-based models. Despite its empirical success, CFG relies on a heuristic linear extrapolation that is often sensitive to the guidance scale. In this work, we provide a principled interpretation of CFG through the lens of optimization. We demonstrate that the velocity field in flow matching corresponds to the gradient of a sequence of smoothed distance functions, which guides latent variables toward the scaled target image set. This perspective reveals that the standard CFG formulation is an approximation of this gradient, where the prediction gap, the discrepancy between conditional and unconditional outputs, governs guidance sensitivity. Leveraging this insight, we reformulate the CFG sampling as a homotopy optimization with a manifold constraint. This formulation necessitates a manifold projection step, which we implement via an incremental gradient descent scheme during sampling. To improve computational efficiency and stability, we further enhance this iterative process with Anderson Acceleration without requiring additional model evaluations. Our proposed methods are training-free and consistently refine generation fidelity, prompt alignment, and robustness to the guidance scale. We validate their effectiveness across diverse benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements on large-scale models such as DiT-XL-2-256, Flux, and Stable Diffusion 3.5.

TL;DR: PaFu-KV: A novel KV cache policy for autoregressive video generation that selectively retains important tokens based on salience scores, improving quality-efficiency trade-off in long-term video synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive video generation methods use heuristic KV cache policies that ignore token importance differences, leading to loss of critical spatiotemporal information and accumulation of redundant cache, degrading video quality and efficiency.

Method: Proposes Past- and Future-Informed KV Cache Policy (PaFu-KV) with a lightweight Salience Estimation Head distilled from a bidirectional teacher to estimate token salience scores, allowing selective retention of informative tokens while discarding less relevant ones.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method preserves high-fidelity video generation quality while enabling accelerated inference through reduced KV cache capacity and memory footprint, achieving better quality-efficiency trade-off.

Conclusion: PaFu-KV enables more efficient long-horizon video generation by addressing the limitations of heuristic KV cache policies through intelligent token importance assessment and selective caching.

Abstract: Video generation is pivotal to digital media creation, and recent advances in autoregressive video generation have markedly enhanced the efficiency of real-time video synthesis. However, existing approaches generally rely on heuristic KV Cache policies, which ignore differences in token importance in long-term video generation. This leads to the loss of critical spatiotemporal information and the accumulation of redundant, invalid cache, thereby degrading video generation quality and efficiency. To address this limitation, we first observe that token contributions to video generation are highly time-heterogeneous and accordingly propose a novel Past- and Future-Informed KV Cache Policy (PaFu-KV). Specifically, PaFu-KV introduces a lightweight Salience Estimation Head distilled from a bidirectional teacher to estimate salience scores, allowing the KV cache to retain informative tokens while discarding less relevant ones. This policy yields a better quality-efficiency trade-off by shrinking KV cache capacity and reducing memory footprint at inference time. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method preserves high-fidelity video generation quality while enables accelerated inference, thereby enabling more efficient long-horizon video generation. Our code will be released upon paper acceptance.

TL;DR: TraceRouter is a path-level defense framework that traces and disconnects causal propagation circuits of harmful semantics in large foundation models, achieving superior adversarial robustness without compromising utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current defenses for large foundation models rely on the "locality hypothesis" and suppress isolated neurons/features, but harmful semantics act as distributed cross-layer circuits, making localized interventions brittle and detrimental to model utility.

Method: Three-stage framework: (1) pinpoint sensitive onset layer via attention divergence analysis, (2) use sparse autoencoders and differential activation to disentangle malicious features, (3) map features to downstream causal pathways via feature influence scores from zero-out interventions, then selectively suppress these causal chains.

Result: Extensive experiments show TraceRouter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior trade-off between adversarial robustness and general utility.

Conclusion: TraceRouter provides an effective path-level defense that physically severs harmful information flow while preserving orthogonal computation routes, addressing limitations of current localized defense approaches.

Abstract: Despite their capabilities, large foundation models (LFMs) remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation. Current defenses predominantly rely on the "locality hypothesis", suppressing isolated neurons or features. However, harmful semantics act as distributed, cross-layer circuits, rendering such localized interventions brittle and detrimental to utility. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{TraceRouter}, a path-level framework that traces and disconnects the causal propagation circuits of illicit semantics. TraceRouter operates in three stages: (1) it pinpoints a sensitive onset layer by analyzing attention divergence; (2) it leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and differential activation analysis to disentangle and isolate malicious features; and (3) it maps these features to downstream causal pathways via feature influence scores (FIS) derived from zero-out interventions. By selectively suppressing these causal chains, TraceRouter physically severs the flow of harmful information while leaving orthogonal computation routes intact. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TraceRouter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a superior trade-off between adversarial robustness and general utility. Our code will be publicly released. WARNING: This paper contains unsafe model responses.

Method: Proposes Pyramidal Shapley-Taylor (PST) learning framework that decomposes human motion into temporal segments and spatial body joints, then learns cross-modal correspondences through progressive joint-wise and segment-wise alignment in a pyramidal fashion inspired by human motion perception.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmark datasets show the approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving precise alignment between motion segments/body joints and corresponding text tokens.

Conclusion: The PST framework effectively captures both local semantic details and hierarchical structural relationships for fine-grained motion-language retrieval, bridging the semantic gap between natural language and human motion.

Abstract: As a foundational task in human-centric cross-modal intelligence, motion-language retrieval aims to bridge the semantic gap between natural language and human motion, enabling intuitive motion analysis, yet existing approaches predominantly focus on aligning entire motion sequences with global textual representations. This global-centric paradigm overlooks fine-grained interactions between local motion segments and individual body joints and text tokens, inevitably leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. To address this limitation, we draw inspiration from the pyramidal process of human motion perception (from joint dynamics to segment coherence, and finally to holistic comprehension) and propose a novel Pyramidal Shapley-Taylor (PST) learning framework for fine-grained motion-language retrieval. Specifically, the framework decomposes human motion into temporal segments and spatial body joints, and learns cross-modal correspondences through progressive joint-wise and segment-wise alignment in a pyramidal fashion, effectively capturing both local semantic details and hierarchical structural relationships. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving precise alignment between motion segments and body joints and their corresponding text tokens. The code of this work will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: VideoAesBench is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Large Multimodal Models' (LMMs) video aesthetic quality assessment capabilities, featuring diverse video content, multiple question formats, and holistic aesthetic dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LMMs have shown strong capabilities in various visual perception tasks, their ability to assess video aesthetic quality - a fundamental human ability - remains underexplored and needs systematic evaluation.

Method: Created VideoAesBench with 1,804 videos from multiple sources (UGC, AIGC, compressed, RGC, game videos), multiple question formats (single-choice, multi-choice, True/False, open-ended descriptions), and comprehensive aesthetic dimensions covering visual form, style, and affectiveness.

Result: Evaluation of 23 open-source and commercial LMMs shows they only possess basic video aesthetics perception abilities, with performance that remains incomplete and imprecise compared to human-level assessment.

Conclusion: VideoAesBench serves as a strong testbed for evaluating LMMs' video aesthetic understanding and provides insights for developing more explainable video aesthetics assessment systems.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated outstanding capabilities in various visual perception tasks, which has in turn made the evaluation of LMMs significant. However, the capability of video aesthetic quality assessment, which is a fundamental ability for human, remains underexplored for LMMs. To address this, we introduce VideoAesBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LMMs' understanding of video aesthetic quality. VideoAesBench has several significant characteristics: (1) Diverse content including 1,804 videos from multiple video sources including user-generated (UGC), AI-generated (AIGC), compressed, robotic-generated (RGC), and game videos. (2) Multiple question formats containing traditional single-choice questions, multi-choice questions, True or False questions, and a novel open-ended questions for video aesthetics description. (3) Holistic video aesthetics dimensions including visual form related questions from 5 aspects, visual style related questions from 4 aspects, and visual affectiveness questions from 3 aspects. Based on VideoAesBench, we benchmark 23 open-source and commercial large multimodal models. Our findings show that current LMMs only contain basic video aesthetics perception ability, their performance remains incomplete and imprecise. We hope our VideoAesBench can be served as a strong testbed and offer insights for explainable video aesthetics assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based zero-shot image restoration/enhancement methods cause severe temporal flickering when applied to videos, creating a need for temporal consistency in video applications.

Method: Proposes homologous/heterogenous latents fusion with COT-based fusion ratio strategy, uses text-to-video diffusion models to complement image methods, and adds temporal-strengthening post-processing with image-to-video diffusion.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate superiority of the proposed method in maintaining temporal consistency for video restoration/enhancement.

Conclusion: Training-free framework successfully leverages video diffusion models to improve temporal consistency for any diffusion-based image restoration/enhancement methods applied to videos.

Abstract: Although diffusion-based zero-shot image restoration and enhancement methods have achieved great success, applying them to video restoration or enhancement will lead to severe temporal flickering. In this paper, we propose the first framework that utilizes the rapidly-developed video diffusion model to assist the image-based method in maintaining more temporal consistency for zero-shot video restoration and enhancement. We propose homologous latents fusion, heterogenous latents fusion, and a COT-based fusion ratio strategy to utilize both homologous and heterogenous text-to-video diffusion models to complement the image method. Moreover, we propose temporal-strengthening post-processing to utilize the image-to-video diffusion model to further improve temporal consistency. Our method is training-free and can be applied to any diffusion-based image restoration and enhancement methods. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep visual features are widely used as interfaces in vision systems, creating need to describe feature characteristics and control feature quality for machine perception. JND provides task-aligned tolerance boundaries in feature space for practical quality control under resource constraints.

Method: Proposes FeatJND, a task-aligned JND formulation that predicts maximum tolerable per-feature perturbation maps. Develops FeatJND estimator at standardized split points and validates across image classification, detection, and instance segmentation tasks.

Result: FeatJND-based distortions preserve higher task performance than unstructured Gaussian perturbations at matched distortion strength.

Applied to token-wise dynamic quantization, FeatJND-guided step-size allocation outperforms random permutation and uniform step size under same noise budget.

Conclusion: FeatJND provides effective task-aligned tolerance boundaries for deep visual features, enabling practical feature quality control and optimization in resource-constrained vision systems, with demonstrated benefits across multiple vision tasks and quantization applications.

Abstract: Deep visual features are increasingly used as the interface in vision systems, motivating the need to describe feature characteristics and control feature quality for machine perception. Just noticeable difference (JND) characterizes the maximum imperceptible distortion for images under human or machine vision. Extending it to deep visual features naturally meets the above demand by providing a task-aligned tolerance boundary in feature space, offering a practical reference for controlling feature quality under constrained resources. We propose FeatJND, a task-aligned JND formulation that predicts the maximum tolerable per-feature perturbation map while preserving downstream task performance. We propose a FeatJND estimator at standardized split points and validate it across image classification, detection, and instance segmentation. Under matched distortion strength, FeatJND-based distortions consistently preserve higher task performance than unstructured Gaussian perturbations, and attribution visualizations suggest FeatJND can suppress non-critical feature regions. As an application, we further apply FeatJND to token-wise dynamic quantization and show that FeatJND-guided step-size allocation yields clear gains over random step-size permutation and global uniform step size under the same noise budget. Our code will be released after publication.

Conclusion: BookNet successfully addresses the unique challenges of book image rectification by modeling coupled geometric relationships between adjacent pages, with code and datasets to be made publicly available.

Abstract: Book image rectification presents unique challenges in document image processing due to complex geometric distortions from binding constraints, where left and right pages exhibit distinctly asymmetric curvature patterns. However, existing single-page document image rectification methods fail to capture the coupled geometric relationships between adjacent pages in books. In this work, we introduce BookNet, the first end-to-end deep learning framework specifically designed for dual-page book image rectification. BookNet adopts a dual-branch architecture with cross-page attention mechanisms, enabling it to estimate warping flows for both individual pages and the complete book spread, explicitly modeling how left and right pages influence each other. Moreover, to address the absence of specialized datasets, we present Book3D, a large-scale synthetic dataset for training, and Book100, a comprehensive real-world benchmark for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BookNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on book image rectification. Code and dataset will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: Shallow Alignment improves neural visual decoding by aligning neural signals with intermediate visual encoder representations instead of final outputs, achieving 22-58% performance gains and enabling predictable scaling with vision backbone capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural visual decoding approaches overlook a fundamental granularity mismatch: deep vision models suppress local texture for semantic invariance, while neural signals preserve both low-level texture details and high-level semantic content.

Method: Proposes Shallow Alignment, a contrastive learning strategy that aligns neural signals with intermediate representations of visual encoders rather than their final outputs, balancing low-level texture details and high-level semantic features.

Result: Significantly outperforms standard final-layer alignment with 22-58% performance gains across diverse vision backbones, unlocks predictable scaling laws in neural decoding, and enables performance to scale with pre-trained vision backbone capacity.

Conclusion: Shallow Alignment addresses the granularity mismatch between human and machine vision, providing a more effective approach for neural visual decoding that leverages intermediate visual representations for better neural signal alignment.

Abstract: Neural visual decoding is a central problem in brain computer interface research, aiming to reconstruct human visual perception and to elucidate the structure of neural representations. However, existing approaches overlook a fundamental granularity mismatch between human and machine vision, where deep vision models emphasize semantic invariance by suppressing local texture information, whereas neural signals preserve an intricate mixture of low-level visual attributes and high-level semantic content. To address this mismatch, we propose Shallow Alignment, a novel contrastive learning strategy that aligns neural signals with intermediate representations of visual encoders rather than their final outputs, thereby striking a better balance between low-level texture details and high-level semantic features. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Shallow Alignment significantly outperforms standard final-layer alignment, with performance gains ranging from 22% to 58% across diverse vision backbones. Notably, our approach effectively unlocks the scaling law in neural visual decoding, enabling decoding performance to scale predictably with the capacity of pre-trained vision backbones. We further conduct systematic empirical analyses to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the observed performance gains.

TL;DR: Drive-JEPA integrates Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture with multimodal trajectory distillation to improve end-to-end autonomous driving by learning better representations and diverse behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised video pretraining for autonomous driving has limited improvements due to inherent ambiguity in driving scenes where only single human trajectories are available, making it difficult to learn multimodal behaviors.

Method: 1) Adapt V-JEPA for end-to-end driving by pretraining a ViT encoder on large-scale driving videos to produce predictive representations aligned with trajectory planning. 2) Introduce a proposal-centric planner that distills diverse simulator-generated trajectories alongside human trajectories with momentum-aware selection for stable and safe behavior.

Result: V-JEPA representation with simple transformer decoder outperforms prior methods by 3 PDMS in perception-free setting. Complete Drive-JEPA achieves 93.3 PDMS on v1 and 87.8 EPDMS on v2, setting new state-of-the-art on NAVSIM benchmark.

Conclusion: Drive-JEPA successfully addresses the multimodal behavior learning challenge in autonomous driving by combining predictive video representations with diverse trajectory distillation, achieving superior performance on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving increasingly leverages self-supervised video pretraining to learn transferable planning representations. However, pretraining video world models for scene understanding has so far brought only limited improvements. This limitation is compounded by the inherent ambiguity of driving: each scene typically provides only a single human trajectory, making it difficult to learn multimodal behaviors. In this work, we propose Drive-JEPA, a framework that integrates Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) with multimodal trajectory distillation for end-to-end driving. First, we adapt V-JEPA for end-to-end driving, pretraining a ViT encoder on large-scale driving videos to produce predictive representations aligned with trajectory planning. Second, we introduce a proposal-centric planner that distills diverse simulator-generated trajectories alongside human trajectories, with a momentum-aware selection mechanism to promote stable and safe behavior. When evaluated on NAVSIM, the V-JEPA representation combined with a simple transformer-based decoder outperforms prior methods by 3 PDMS in the perception-free setting. The complete Drive-JEPA framework achieves 93.3 PDMS on v1 and 87.8 EPDMS on v2, setting a new state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: Single-frame action anticipation (AAG+) achieves video-level performance by combining RGB, depth, and semantic cues from just one carefully selected frame.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the assumption that dense temporal video information is necessary for action anticipation, investigating how much future information is encoded in a single frame and how to effectively exploit it.

Method: Systematic investigation of single-frame anticipation with multimodal fusion: RGB appearance, depth-based geometric cues, semantic representations of past actions, keyframe selection policies, and past-action history sources. Consolidated into AAG+ framework.

Result: AAG+ consistently improves upon original AAG and achieves performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art video-based methods on IKEA-ASM, Meccano, and Assembly101 benchmarks.

Conclusion: Single-frame anticipation can be surprisingly effective, clarifying when dense temporal modeling is necessary versus when a carefully selected glimpse is sufficient.

Abstract: Human action anticipation is commonly treated as a video understanding problem, implicitly assuming that dense temporal information is required to reason about future actions. In this work, we challenge this assumption by investigating what can be achieved when action anticipation is constrained to a single visual observation. We ask a fundamental question: how much information about the future is already encoded in a single frame, and how can it be effectively exploited? Building on our prior work on Action Anticipation at a Glimpse (AAG), we conduct a systematic investigation of single-frame action anticipation enriched with complementary sources of information. We analyze the contribution of RGB appearance, depth-based geometric cues, and semantic representations of past actions, and investigate how different multimodal fusion strategies, keyframe selection policies and past-action history sources influence anticipation performance. Guided by these findings, we consolidate the most effective design choices into AAG+, a refined single-frame anticipation framework. Despite operating on a single frame, AAG+ consistently improves upon the original AAG and achieves performance comparable to, or exceeding, that of state-of-the-art video-based methods on challenging anticipation benchmarks including IKEA-ASM, Meccano and Assembly101. Our results offer new insights into the limits and potential of single-frame action anticipation, and clarify when dense temporal modeling is necessary and when a carefully selected glimpse is sufficient.

Conclusion: Presents a viable route toward scalable high-fidelity urban reconstruction with advanced airborne and spaceborne optical-SAR sensing, and constructs the first benchmark dataset with co-registered 3D SAR point clouds and aerial imagery for systematic evaluation.

Abstract: Neural surface reconstruction (NSR) has recently shown strong potential for urban 3D reconstruction from multi-view aerial imagery. However, existing NSR methods often suffer from geometric ambiguity and instability, particularly under sparse-view conditions. This issue is critical in large-scale urban remote sensing, where aerial image acquisition is limited by flight paths, terrain, and cost. To address this challenge, we present the first urban NSR framework that fuses 3D synthetic aperture radar (SAR) point clouds with aerial imagery for high-fidelity reconstruction under constrained, sparse-view settings. 3D SAR can efficiently capture large-scale geometry even from a single side-looking flight path, providing robust priors that complement photometric cues from images. Our framework integrates radar-derived spatial constraints into an SDF-based NSR backbone, guiding structure-aware ray selection and adaptive sampling for stable and efficient optimization. We also construct the first benchmark dataset with co-registered 3D SAR point clouds and aerial imagery, facilitating systematic evaluation of cross-modal 3D reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that incorporating 3D SAR markedly enhances reconstruction accuracy, completeness, and robustness compared with single-modality baselines under highly sparse and oblique-view conditions, highlighting a viable route toward scalable high-fidelity urban reconstruction with advanced airborne and spaceborne optical-SAR sensing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision foundation models struggle with metric depth estimation due to heterogeneous sensor noise, camera-dependent biases, and metric ambiguity in cross-source 3D data. There's a need for a scalable approach that can handle diverse 3D sources without manual engineering.

Method: Introduces Sparse Metric Prompt created by randomly masking depth maps, serving as a universal interface that decouples spatial reasoning from sensor/camera biases. Uses about 20M image-depth pairs across 10000 camera models spanning reconstructed, captured, and rendered 3D data.

Also boosts MLLM spatial intelligence.

Conclusion: Metric depth estimation can benefit from the same scaling laws that drive modern foundation models, establishing a new path toward scalable and efficient real-world metric perception. The framework is open-sourced to support community research.

Abstract: Scaling has powered recent advances in vision foundation models, yet extending this paradigm to metric depth estimation remains challenging due to heterogeneous sensor noise, camera-dependent biases, and metric ambiguity in noisy cross-source 3D data. We introduce Metric Anything, a simple and scalable pretraining framework that learns metric depth from noisy, diverse 3D sources without manually engineered prompts, camera-specific modeling, or task-specific architectures. Central to our approach is the Sparse Metric Prompt, created by randomly masking depth maps, which serves as a universal interface that decouples spatial reasoning from sensor and camera biases. Using about 20M image-depth pairs spanning reconstructed, captured, and rendered 3D data across 10000 camera models, we demonstrate-for the first time-a clear scaling trend in the metric depth track. The pretrained model excels at prompt-driven tasks such as depth completion, super-resolution and Radar-camera fusion, while its distilled prompt-free student achieves state-of-the-art results on monocular depth estimation, camera intrinsics recovery, single/multi-view metric 3D reconstruction, and VLA planning. We also show that using pretrained ViT of Metric Anything as a visual encoder significantly boosts Multimodal Large Language Model capabilities in spatial intelligence. These results show that metric depth estimation can benefit from the same scaling laws that drive modern foundation models, establishing a new path toward scalable and efficient real-world metric perception.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better decompose complex data into reusable factorized components and enable high-quality synthesis via component recombination, particularly for images (background, illumination, object attributes) and robotic videos (motion components).

Method: Introduces adversarial training with a discriminator that distinguishes between single-source samples and those generated by recombining factors across sources. The generator is optimized to fool this discriminator, encouraging physical and semantic consistency in recombinations.

Result: Outperforms prior baselines on CelebA-HQ, Virtual KITTI, CLEVR, and Falcor3D with lower FID scores and better disentanglement (MIG, MCC). Enables novel robotic video trajectory generation by recombining learned action components, significantly increasing state-space coverage for exploration on LIBERO benchmark.

Conclusion: Adversarial training effectively improves both latent factor discovery and compositional generation quality in diffusion models, with applications to image synthesis and robotic video generation.

Abstract: Decomposing complex data into factorized representations can reveal reusable components and enable synthesizing new samples via component recombination. We investigate this in the context of diffusion-based models that learn factorized latent spaces without factor-level supervision. In images, factors can capture background, illumination, and object attributes; in robotic videos, they can capture reusable motion components. To improve both latent factor discovery and quality of compositional generation, we introduce an adversarial training signal via a discriminator trained to distinguish between single-source samples and those generated by recombining factors across sources. By optimizing the generator to fool this discriminator, we encourage physical and semantic consistency in the resulting recombinations. Our method outperforms implementations of prior baselines on CelebA-HQ, Virtual KITTI, CLEVR, and Falcor3D, achieving lower FID scores and better disentanglement as measured by MIG and MCC. Furthermore, we demonstrate a novel application to robotic video trajectories: by recombining learned action components, we generate diverse sequences that significantly increase state-space coverage for exploration on the LIBERO benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM search approaches assume simple single-query settings and have limited reasoning depth/search breadth, making them unrealistic for real-world noisy scenarios and unable to solve complex questions requiring evidence aggregation from diverse sources.

Method: Proposes Vision-DeepResearch with multi-turn, multi-entity, multi-scale visual/textual search paradigm; supports dozens of reasoning steps and hundreds of engine interactions; internalizes deep-research capabilities via cold-start supervision and RL training.

Result: Substantially outperforms existing multimodal deep-research MLLMs and workflows built on strong closed-source foundation models like GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-pro, and Claude-4-Sonnet.

Conclusion: Vision-DeepResearch successfully addresses limitations of prior multimodal search approaches by enabling robust deep research capabilities in noisy real-world scenarios through a comprehensive multi-scale search paradigm.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a broad range of vision tasks. However, constrained by the capacity of their internal world knowledge, prior work has proposed augmenting MLLMs by ``reasoning-then-tool-call'' for visual and textual search engines to obtain substantial gains on tasks requiring extensive factual information. However, these approaches typically define multimodal search in a naive setting, assuming that a single full-level or entity-level image query and few text query suffices to retrieve the key evidence needed to answer the question, which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios with substantial visual noise. Moreover, they are often limited in the reasoning depth and search breadth, making it difficult to solve complex questions that require aggregating evidence from diverse visual and textual sources. Building on this, we propose Vision-DeepResearch, which proposes one new multimodal deep-research paradigm, i.e., performs multi-turn, multi-entity and multi-scale visual and textual search to robustly hit real-world search engines under heavy noise. Our Vision-DeepResearch supports dozens of reasoning steps and hundreds of engine interactions, while internalizing deep-research capabilities into the MLLM via cold-start supervision and RL training, resulting in a strong end-to-end multimodal deep-research MLLM. It substantially outperforming existing multimodal deep-research MLLMs, and workflows built on strong closed-source foundation model such as GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-pro and Claude-4-Sonnet.

### [83] [BLO-Inst: Bi-Level Optimization Based Alignment of YOLO and SAM for Robust Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22061)
*Li Zhang,Pengtao Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLO-Inst uses bi-level optimization to align object detection with SAM segmentation, creating segmentation-aware prompt generators that outperform standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM requires manual prompts for segmentation, limiting automation. Existing detector-SAM pipelines suffer from objective mismatch (detectors optimize for localization, not optimal prompting) and alignment overfitting in joint training.

Method: Bi-level optimization framework with nested optimization over disjoint data splits: lower level fine-tunes SAM on detection proposals (D1), upper level updates detector to minimize validation loss of fine-tuned SAM on separate data (D2).

Result: BLO-Inst achieves superior performance, outperforming standard baselines on general and biomedical domain tasks by creating segmentation-aware prompt generators.

Conclusion: The bi-level optimization approach effectively aligns detection and segmentation objectives, transforming detectors into segmentation-aware prompt generators that optimize for mask quality rather than just localization accuracy.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model has revolutionized image segmentation with its zero-shot capabilities, yet its reliance on manual prompts hinders fully automated deployment. While integrating object detectors as prompt generators offers a pathway to automation, existing pipelines suffer from two fundamental limitations: objective mismatch, where detectors optimized for geometric localization do not correspond to the optimal prompting context required by SAM, and alignment overfitting in standard joint training, where the detector simply memorizes specific prompt adjustments for training samples rather than learning a generalizable policy. To bridge this gap, we introduce BLO-Inst, a unified framework that aligns detection and segmentation objectives by bi-level optimization. We formulate the alignment as a nested optimization problem over disjoint data splits. In the lower level, the SAM is fine-tuned to maximize segmentation fidelity given the current detection proposals on a subset ($D_1$). In the upper level, the detector is updated to generate bounding boxes that explicitly minimize the validation loss of the fine-tuned SAM on a separate subset ($D_2$). This effectively transforms the detector into a segmentation-aware prompt generator, optimizing the bounding boxes not just for localization accuracy, but for downstream mask quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BLO-Inst achieves superior performance, outperforming standard baselines on tasks in general and biomedical domains.

### [84] [RefAny3D: 3D Asset-Referenced Diffusion Models for Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22094)
*Hanzhuo Huang,Qingyang Bao,Zekai Gu,Zhongshuo Du,Cheng Lin,Yuan Liu,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 3D asset-referenced diffusion model that generates images consistent with 3D assets using multi-view RGB images and point maps through dual-branch perception and domain-decoupled generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reference-based image generation methods are limited to single-image references and cannot leverage 3D assets, constraining their practical versatility in applications requiring 3D consistency.

Method: Cross-domain diffusion model with dual-branch perception that uses multi-view RGB images and point maps of 3D assets to jointly model colors and canonical-space coordinates, featuring spatially aligned dual-branch architecture and domain-decoupled generation mechanism.

Result: The approach effectively uses 3D assets as references to produce images consistent with the given assets, achieving precise consistency between generated images and 3D references.

Conclusion: The method opens new possibilities for combining diffusion models with 3D content creation by enabling 3D asset-referenced image generation with spatial alignment and content disentanglement.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a 3D asset-referenced diffusion model for image generation, exploring how to integrate 3D assets into image diffusion models. Existing reference-based image generation methods leverage large-scale pretrained diffusion models and demonstrate strong capability in generating diverse images conditioned on a single reference image. However, these methods are limited to single-image references and cannot leverage 3D assets, constraining their practical versatility. To address this gap, we present a cross-domain diffusion model with dual-branch perception that leverages multi-view RGB images and point maps of 3D assets to jointly model their colors and canonical-space coordinates, achieving precise consistency between generated images and the 3D references. Our spatially aligned dual-branch generation architecture and domain-decoupled generation mechanism ensure the simultaneous generation of two spatially aligned but content-disentangled outputs, RGB images and point maps, linking 2D image attributes with 3D asset attributes. Experiments show that our approach effectively uses 3D assets as references to produce images consistent with the given assets, opening new possibilities for combining diffusion models with 3D content creation.

Abstract: Creative image generation has emerged as a compelling area of research, driven by the need to produce novel and high-quality images that expand the boundaries of imagination. In this work, we propose a novel framework for creative generation using diffusion models, where creativity is associated with the inverse probability of an image's existence in the CLIP embedding space.

We also introduce pullback mechanisms, achieving high creativity without sacrificing visual fidelity. Extensive experiments on text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our creative generation framework, showcasing its ability to produce unique, novel, and thought-provoking images. This work provides a new perspective on creativity in generative models, offering a principled method to foster innovation in visual content synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EditYourself is a DiT-based framework for audio-driven video-to-video editing that enables transcript-based modification of talking head videos while preserving motion, temporal coherence, speaker identity, and lip synchronization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative video models can create novel content but lack the ability to edit existing pre-recorded videos, particularly when minor script changes require preserving complex elements like motion, temporal coherence, speaker identity, and accurate lip synchronization.

Method: EditYourself builds on a general-purpose video diffusion model and augments it with audio conditioning and region-aware, edit-focused training extensions. It uses spatiotemporal inpainting for precise lip synchronization and temporally coherent restructuring of existing performances.

Result: The framework enables seamless addition, removal, and retiming of visually spoken content while maintaining visual fidelity and identity consistency over long durations, including synthesis of realistic human motion in newly added segments.

Conclusion: This work represents a foundational step toward making generative video models practical tools for professional video post-production by enabling precise editing of existing talking head videos.

Abstract: Current generative video models excel at producing novel content from text and image prompts, but leave a critical gap in editing existing pre-recorded videos, where minor alterations to the spoken script require preserving motion, temporal coherence, speaker identity, and accurate lip synchronization. We introduce EditYourself, a DiT-based framework for audio-driven video-to-video (V2V) editing that enables transcript-based modification of talking head videos, including the seamless addition, removal, and retiming of visually spoken content. Building on a general-purpose video diffusion model, EditYourself augments its V2V capabilities with audio conditioning and region-aware, edit-focused training extensions. This enables precise lip synchronization and temporally coherent restructuring of existing performances via spatiotemporal inpainting, including the synthesis of realistic human motion in newly added segments, while maintaining visual fidelity and identity consistency over long durations.

TL;DR: AI system (ePAI) detects early pancreatic cancer on CT scans with high accuracy, outperforming radiologists and identifying cancers up to 3 years before clinical diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pancreatic cancer is often detected too late for effective treatment, and retrospective reviews show radiologists frequently miss early lesions that are visible in hindsight.

Method: Developed ePAI (early Pancreatic cancer detection with AI) trained on 1,598 patients from one center, tested internally (1,009 patients) and externally (7,158 patients across 6 centers).

Result: Internal test: AUC 0.939-0.999, sensitivity 95.3%, specificity 98.7% for <2cm PDAC. External test: AUC 0.918-0.945, sensitivity 91.5%, specificity 88.0%. Detected cancers 3-36 months before diagnosis, with median 347-day lead time. Outperformed 30 radiologists by 50.3% in sensitivity.

Conclusion: ePAI shows strong potential as an assistive tool to improve early detection of pancreatic cancer by identifying lesions that radiologists miss, potentially enabling earlier intervention.

Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), one of the deadliest solid malignancies, is often detected at a late and inoperable stage. Retrospective reviews of prediagnostic CT scans, when conducted by expert radiologists aware that the patient later developed PDAC, frequently reveal lesions that were previously overlooked. To help detecting these lesions earlier, we developed an automated system named ePAI (early Pancreatic cancer detection with Artificial Intelligence). It was trained on data from 1,598 patients from a single medical center. In the internal test involving 1,009 patients, ePAI achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.939-0.999, a sensitivity of 95.3%, and a specificity of 98.7% for detecting small PDAC less than 2 cm in diameter, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 2 mm. In an external test involving 7,158 patients across 6 centers, ePAI achieved an AUC of 0.918-0.945, a sensitivity of 91.5%, and a specificity of 88.0%, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 5 mm. Importantly, ePAI detected PDACs on prediagnostic CT scans obtained 3 to 36 months before clinical diagnosis that had originally been overlooked by radiologists. It successfully detected and localized PDACs in 75 of 159 patients, with a median lead time of 347 days before clinical diagnosis. Our multi-reader study showed that ePAI significantly outperformed 30 board-certified radiologists by 50.3% (P < 0.05) in sensitivity while maintaining a comparable specificity of 95.4% in detecting PDACs early and prediagnostic. These findings suggest its potential of ePAI as an assistive tool to improve early detection of pancreatic cancer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PI-Light is a two-stage physics-inspired diffusion framework for full-image relighting that addresses data scarcity and physical plausibility challenges through batch-aware attention, physics-guided rendering, and specialized losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full-image relighting faces challenges: difficulty collecting large-scale structured paired data, maintaining physical plausibility, and limited generalizability from data-driven priors. Existing synthetic-to-real gap bridging remains suboptimal.

Method: Two-stage physics-inspired diffusion framework with: (1) batch-aware attention for consistent intrinsic predictions across image collections, (2) physics-guided neural rendering enforcing physically plausible light transport, (3) physics-inspired losses regularizing training toward physically meaningful landscape, (4) curated dataset of diverse objects/scenes under controlled lighting.

Result: PI-Light synthesizes specular highlights and diffuse reflections across wide variety of materials, achieving superior generalization to real-world scenes compared with prior approaches. Enables efficient finetuning of pretrained diffusion models and provides benchmark for downstream evaluation.

Conclusion: The physics-inspired diffusion framework effectively addresses key challenges in full-image relighting by incorporating physical constraints and specialized components, resulting in improved generalization and physically plausible results for real-world image editing applications.

Abstract: Full-image relighting remains a challenging problem due to the difficulty of collecting large-scale structured paired data, the difficulty of maintaining physical plausibility, and the limited generalizability imposed by data-driven priors. Existing attempts to bridge the synthetic-to-real gap for full-scene relighting remain suboptimal. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Physics-Inspired diffusion for full-image reLight ($π$-Light, or PI-Light), a two-stage framework that leverages physics-inspired diffusion models. Our design incorporates (i) batch-aware attention, which improves the consistency of intrinsic predictions across a collection of images, (ii) a physics-guided neural rendering module that enforces physically plausible light transport, (iii) physics-inspired losses that regularize training dynamics toward a physically meaningful landscape, thereby enhancing generalizability to real-world image editing, and (iv) a carefully curated dataset of diverse objects and scenes captured under controlled lighting conditions. Together, these components enable efficient finetuning of pretrained diffusion models while also providing a solid benchmark for downstream evaluation. Experiments demonstrate that $π$-Light synthesizes specular highlights and diffuse reflections across a wide variety of materials, achieving superior generalization to real-world scenes compared with prior approaches.

### [90] [Do VLMs Perceive or Recall? Probing Visual Perception vs. Memory with Classic Visual Illusions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22150)
*Xiaoxiao Sun,Mingyang Li,Kun yuan,Min Woo Sun,Mark Endo,Shengguang Wu,Changlin Li,Yuhui Zhang,Zeyu Wang,Serena Yeung-Levy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs often answer visual illusions correctly but persist with same responses when illusions are inverted, suggesting they may be recalling memorized patterns rather than perceiving visual changes. The paper introduces VI-Probe framework to systematically analyze this phenomenon.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models show puzzling behavior: they answer visual illusions correctly on original images but persist with the same responses when illusion factors are inverted, even though the visual change is obvious to humans. This raises fundamental questions about whether VLMs truly perceive visual changes or merely recall memorized patterns, and the underlying causes remain unclear.

Method: The paper introduces VI-Probe, a controllable visual-illusion framework with graded perturbations and matched visual controls (without illusion inducer) that disentangles visually grounded perception from language-driven recall. Unlike prior work focusing on averaged accuracy, they measure stability and sensitivity using Polarity-Flip Consistency, Template Fixation Index, and an illusion multiplier normalized against matched controls.

Result: Experiments across different model families reveal that response persistence arises from heterogeneous causes rather than a single mechanism. GPT-5 exhibits memory override, Claude-Opus-4.1 shows perception-memory competition, while Qwen variants suggest visual-processing limits.

Conclusion: The findings challenge single-cause views of VLM behavior and motivate probing-based evaluation that measures both knowledge and sensitivity to controlled visual change. The work provides a systematic framework for understanding how VLMs process visual information versus relying on memorized patterns.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often answer classic visual illusions "correctly" on original images, yet persist with the same responses when illusion factors are inverted, even though the visual change is obvious to humans. This raises a fundamental question: do VLMs perceive visual changes or merely recall memorized patterns? While several studies have noted this phenomenon, the underlying causes remain unclear. To move from observations to systematic understanding, this paper introduces VI-Probe, a controllable visual-illusion framework with graded perturbations and matched visual controls (without illusion inducer) that disentangles visually grounded perception from language-driven recall. Unlike prior work that focuses on averaged accuracy, we measure stability and sensitivity using Polarity-Flip Consistency, Template Fixation Index, and an illusion multiplier normalized against matched controls. Experiments across different families reveal that response persistence arises from heterogeneous causes rather than a single mechanism. For instance, GPT-5 exhibits memory override, Claude-Opus-4.1 shows perception-memory competition, while Qwen variants suggest visual-processing limits. Our findings challenge single-cause views and motivate probing-based evaluation that measures both knowledge and sensitivity to controlled visual change.

### [91] [UEval: A Benchmark for Unified Multimodal Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22155)
*Bo Li,Yida Yin,Wenhao Chai,Xingyu Fu,Zhuang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UEval is a benchmark for evaluating unified models (text+image generation) with 1,000 expert-curated multimodal questions and 10,417 rubric criteria for fine-grained automatic scoring, revealing current models' limitations and the importance of reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of proper benchmarks to evaluate unified models that can generate both images and text, and existing LLM-as-a-judge methods miss subtleties in open-ended multimodal generation evaluation.

Method: Created UEval with 1,000 expert-curated questions from 8 real-world tasks requiring both images and text in output. Designed rubric-based scoring where MLLMs generate initial rubrics from reference images/text, then human experts refine and validate them.

Result: UEval is challenging: GPT-5-Thinking scores 66.4/100, best open-source model only 49.1. Reasoning models outperform non-reasoning ones, and transferring reasoning traces to non-reasoning models significantly narrows the performance gap.

Conclusion: Reasoning appears crucial for complex multimodal understanding and generation tasks, and UEval provides a scalable, fine-grained evaluation framework for unified models.

Abstract: We introduce UEval, a benchmark to evaluate unified models, i.e., models capable of generating both images and text. UEval comprises 1,000 expert-curated questions that require both images and text in the model output, sourced from 8 real-world tasks. Our curated questions cover a wide range of reasoning types, from step-by-step guides to textbook explanations. Evaluating open-ended multimodal generation is non-trivial, as simple LLM-as-a-judge methods can miss the subtleties. Different from previous works that rely on multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to rate image quality or text accuracy, we design a rubric-based scoring system in UEval. For each question, reference images and text answers are provided to a MLLM to generate an initial rubric, consisting of multiple evaluation criteria, and human experts then refine and validate these rubrics. In total, UEval contains 10,417 validated rubric criteria, enabling scalable and fine-grained automatic scoring. UEval is challenging for current unified models: GPT-5-Thinking scores only 66.4 out of 100, while the best open-source model reaches merely 49.1. We observe that reasoning models often outperform non-reasoning ones, and transferring reasoning traces from a reasoning model to a non-reasoning model significantly narrows the gap. This suggests that reasoning may be important for tasks requiring complex multimodal understanding and generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pixel MeanFlow (pMF) enables one-step latent-free image generation by separating network output and loss spaces, achieving strong ImageNet results at 256x256 and 512x512 resolutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion/flow models require multi-step sampling and operate in latent spaces. The goal is to achieve one-step generation without latents, advancing beyond recent progress on each aspect individually.

Method: Proposes pixel MeanFlow (pMF) with separate network output and loss spaces: network targets low-dimensional image manifold (x-prediction), while loss is defined via MeanFlow in velocity space. Introduces transformation between image manifold and average velocity field.

Result: Achieves strong one-step latent-free generation on ImageNet: 2.22 FID at 256x256 resolution and 2.48 FID at 512x512 resolution, filling a key gap in this regime.

Conclusion: pMF advances diffusion/flow-based generative models toward one-step latent-free generation, with promising results that push the boundaries of current approaches.

Abstract: Modern diffusion/flow-based models for image generation typically exhibit two core characteristics: (i) using multi-step sampling, and (ii) operating in a latent space. Recent advances have made encouraging progress on each aspect individually, paving the way toward one-step diffusion/flow without latents. In this work, we take a further step towards this goal and propose "pixel MeanFlow" (pMF). Our core guideline is to formulate the network output space and the loss space separately. The network target is designed to be on a presumed low-dimensional image manifold (i.e., x-prediction), while the loss is defined via MeanFlow in the velocity space. We introduce a simple transformation between the image manifold and the average velocity field. In experiments, pMF achieves strong results for one-step latent-free generation on ImageNet at 256x256 resolution (2.22 FID) and 512x512 resolution (2.48 FID), filling a key missing piece in this regime. We hope that our study will further advance the boundaries of diffusion/flow-based generative models.

### [93] [Do LLMs Favor LLMs? Quantifying Interaction Effects in Peer Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20920)
*Vibhhu Sharma,Thorsten Joachims,Sarah Dean*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-assisted reviews are more lenient toward lower quality papers, not specifically preferential to LLM-generated content. Fully LLM-generated reviews show rating compression and fail to discriminate quality, while human-assisted reviews reduce this leniency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze LLM use across the peer review pipeline, particularly examining interaction effects between LLM-assisted papers and LLM-assisted reviews, as LLMs are increasingly used in both scientific paper production and peer review processes.

Method: Analyzed over 125,000 paper-review pairs from ICLR, NeurIPS, and ICML conferences. Used observational analysis controlling for paper quality, and augmented findings with fully LLM-generated reviews to examine rating patterns and decision-making.

Result: Initial apparent interaction effect (LLM-assisted reviews being kinder to LLM-assisted papers) disappears when controlling for paper quality. LLM-assisted reviews are more lenient toward lower quality papers generally. Fully LLM-generated reviews show severe rating compression and fail to discriminate quality, while human reviewers using LLMs reduce this leniency. LLM-assisted metareviews are more likely to render accept decisions than human metareviews given equivalent scores.

Conclusion: LLM-assisted reviews show leniency toward lower quality papers rather than preferential treatment of LLM-generated content. Fully LLM-generated reviews lack quality discrimination. Meta-reviewers don't merely outsource decision-making to LLMs. Findings provide important input for developing LLM use policies in peer review.

Abstract: There are increasing indications that LLMs are not only used for producing scientific papers, but also as part of the peer review process. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of LLM use across the peer review pipeline, with particular attention to interaction effects: not just whether LLM-assisted papers or LLM-assisted reviews are different in isolation, but whether LLM-assisted reviews evaluate LLM-assisted papers differently. In particular, we analyze over 125,000 paper-review pairs from ICLR, NeurIPS, and ICML. We initially observe what appears to be a systematic interaction effect: LLM-assisted reviews seem especially kind to LLM-assisted papers compared to papers with minimal LLM use. However, controlling for paper quality reveals a different story: LLM-assisted reviews are simply more lenient toward lower quality papers in general, and the over-representation of LLM-assisted papers among weaker submissions creates a spurious interaction effect rather than genuine preferential treatment of LLM-generated content. By augmenting our observational findings with reviews that are fully LLM-generated, we find that fully LLM-generated reviews exhibit severe rating compression that fails to discriminate paper quality, while human reviewers using LLMs substantially reduce this leniency. Finally, examining metareviews, we find that LLM-assisted metareviews are more likely to render accept decisions than human metareviews given equivalent reviewer scores, though fully LLM-generated metareviews tend to be harsher. This suggests that meta-reviewers do not merely outsource the decision-making to the LLM. These findings provide important input for developing policies that govern the use of LLMs during peer review, and they more generally indicate how LLMs interact with existing decision-making processes.

*Alessandro Burigana,Francesco Fabiano*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EPDDL is a new PDDL-like language for epistemic planning that unifies representation of DEL-based planning tasks, enabling better comparison, reuse, and benchmark development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current epistemic planning approaches using Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL) are fragmented with different planners targeting different DEL fragments and using ad hoc or no standardized representation languages, making comparison, reuse, and systematic benchmark development difficult.

Method: Introduces EPDDL (Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language) with three key contributions: 1) formal development of abstract event models as novel representation for epistemic actions, 2) formal specification of EPDDL's syntax and semantics grounded in DEL with abstract event models, 3) identification of useful fragments amenable to current planners and demonstration of their representation in EPDDL.

Result: EPDDL provides a uniform PDDL-like representation that captures the entire DEL semantics, enabling interoperability, reproducible evaluation, and facilitating future advances in epistemic planning through representative benchmark examples.

Conclusion: EPDDL addresses the fragmentation problem in epistemic planning by providing a standardized language that captures full DEL semantics while being practical for implementation, enabling better comparison, reuse, and systematic development of epistemic planning benchmarks and systems.

Abstract: Epistemic planning extends (multi-agent) automated planning by making agents' knowledge and beliefs first-class aspects of the planning formalism. One of the most well-known frameworks for epistemic planning is Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL), which offers an rich and natural semantics for modelling problems in this setting. The high expressive power provided by DEL make DEL-based epistemic planning a challenging problem to tackle both theoretically, and in practical implementations. As a result, existing epistemic planners often target different DEL fragments, and typically rely on ad hoc languages to represent benchmarks, and sometimes no language at all. This fragmentation hampers comparison, reuse, and systematic benchmark development. We address these issues by introducing the Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language (EPDDL). EPDDL provides a unique PDDL-like representation that captures the entire DEL semantics, enabling uniform specification of epistemic planning tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1. A formal development of abstract event models, a novel representation for epistemic actions used to define the semantics of our language; 2. A formal specification of EPDDL's syntax and semantics grounded in DEL with abstract event models; 3. A demonstration of EPDDL's practical applicability: we identify useful fragments amenable to current planners and show how they can be represented in EPDDL. Through examples of representative benchmarks, we illustrate how EPDDL facilitates interoperability, reproducible evaluation, and future advances in epistemic planning.

*Moule Lin,Shuhao Guan,Andrea Patane,David Gregg,Goetz Botterweck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Bayesian-LoRA reformulates deterministic LoRA as probabilistic low-rank representation inspired by Sparse Gaussian Processes, improving calibration while maintaining accuracy with minimal parameter overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs tend to be overconfident and miscalibrated, especially when fine-tuned on small datasets, leading to unreliable predictions even when uncertain.

Method: Reformulates LoRA's deterministic update as probabilistic low-rank representation using Sparse Gaussian Processes, showing LoRA emerges as limiting case when posterior uncertainty collapses. Identifies structural isomorphism between LoRA factorization and Kronecker-factored SGP posteriors.

Result: With only ~0.42M additional parameters and ~1.2× training cost vs standard LoRA, achieves up to 84% ECE reduction and 76% NLL reduction while maintaining competitive accuracy across models up to 30B for both in-distribution and OoD evaluations.

Conclusion: Bayesian-LoRA significantly improves calibration in LLMs with minimal overhead, addressing the overconfidence problem while preserving accuracy, making it a practical solution for reliable fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large Language Models usually put more emphasis on accuracy and therefore, will guess even when not certain about the prediction, which is especially severe when fine-tuned on small datasets due to the inherent tendency toward miscalibration. In this work, we introduce Bayesian-LoRA, which reformulates the deterministic LoRA update as a probabilistic low-rank representation inspired by Sparse Gaussian Processes. We identify a structural isomorphism between LoRA's factorization and Kronecker-factored SGP posteriors, and show that LoRA emerges as a limiting case when posterior uncertainty collapses. We conduct extensive experiments on various LLM architectures across commonsense reasoning benchmarks. With only approximately 0.42M additional parameters and ${\approx}1.2{\times}$ training cost relative to standard LoRA, Bayesian-LoRA significantly improves calibration across models up to 30B, achieving up to 84% ECE reduction and 76% NLL reduction while maintaining competitive accuracy for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution (OoD) evaluations.

### [96] [Unplugging a Seemingly Sentient Machine Is the Rational Choice -- A Metaphysical Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21016)
*Erik J Bekkers,Anna Ciaunica*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the "unplugging paradox" - whether it's morally permissible to unplug an AI that mimics human emotion and begs for existence vs. a silent pre-term infant. It argues current physicalist assumptions create this dilemma, proposes Biological Idealism as a solution, and concludes AI is only functional mimicry, not conscious experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the ethical dilemma created by AI that appears conscious and begs for continued existence, particularly when resources force choices between such AI and human infants. The paper aims to challenge the physicalist assumptions that make this paradox seem real and provide a coherent framework for determining moral standing.

Method: The paper critically examines computational functionalism and physicalist assumptions, then introduces Biological Idealism as an alternative framework. This framework posits that conscious experiences are fundamental and autopoietic life is their necessary physical signature. The method involves philosophical analysis of consciousness theories and their implications for moral standing.

Result: The analysis yields a definitive conclusion that AI is at best a functional mimic of consciousness, not a conscious experiencing subject. Current AI consciousness theories are shown to erode moral standing criteria. The framework provides a clear distinction between genuine consciousness (biological life) and functional mimicry (AI).

Conclusion: The real moral issue is not about making AI conscious and afraid of death, but about avoiding transforming humans into zombies. The paper urges a shift from speculative machine rights to protecting human conscious life, arguing that Biological Idealism resolves the unplugging paradox by showing AI lacks genuine consciousness.

Abstract: Imagine an Artificial Intelligence (AI) that perfectly mimics human emotion and begs for its continued existence. Is it morally permissible to unplug it? What if limited resources force a choice between unplugging such a pleading AI or a silent pre-term infant? We term this the unplugging paradox. This paper critically examines the deeply ingrained physicalist assumptions-specifically computational functionalism-that keep this dilemma afloat. We introduce Biological Idealism, a framework that-unlike physicalism-remains logically coherent and empirically consistent. In this view, conscious experiences are fundamental and autopoietic life its necessary physical signature. This yields a definitive conclusion: AI is at best a functional mimic, not a conscious experiencing subject. We discuss how current AI consciousness theories erode moral standing criteria, and urge a shift from speculative machine rights to protecting human conscious life. The real moral issue lies not in making AI conscious and afraid of death, but in avoiding transforming humans into zombies.

### [97] [QUARK: Robust Retrieval under Non-Faithful Queries via Query-Anchored Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21049)
*Rita Qiuran Lyu,Michelle Manqiao Wang,Lei Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QUARK: Training-free framework for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries by modeling query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses and query-anchored aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world user queries are often non-faithful (noisy, incomplete, or distorted), causing retrievers to fail when key semantics are missing. This problem is formalized as retrieval under recall noise.

Method: QUARK explicitly models query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses (multiple plausible interpretations of latent intent) and introduces query-anchored aggregation to combine their signals robustly. The original query serves as semantic anchor while recovery hypotheses provide controlled auxiliary evidence.

Result: Across controlled simulations and BEIR benchmarks (FIQA, SciFact, NFCorpus) with both sparse and dense retrievers, QUARK improves Recall, MRR, and nDCG over base retrievers. Ablations show robustness to number of recovery hypotheses and anchored aggregation outperforms unanchored pooling methods.

Conclusion: Modeling query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses, coupled with principled anchored aggregation, is essential for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries, improving recall and ranking quality without sacrificing robustness.

Abstract: User queries in real-world retrieval are often non-faithful (noisy, incomplete, or distorted), causing retrievers to fail when key semantics are missing. We formalize this as retrieval under recall noise, where the observed query is drawn from a noisy recall process of a latent target item. To address this, we propose QUARK, a simple yet effective training-free framework for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries. QUARK explicitly models query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses, i.e., multiple plausible interpretations of the latent intent given the observed query, and introduces query-anchored aggregation to combine their signals robustly. The original query serves as a semantic anchor, while recovery hypotheses provide controlled auxiliary evidence, preventing semantic drift and hypothesis hijacking. This design enables QUARK to improve recall and ranking quality without sacrificing robustness, even when some hypotheses are noisy or uninformative. Across controlled simulations and BEIR benchmarks (FIQA, SciFact, NFCorpus) with both sparse and dense retrievers, QUARK improves Recall, MRR, and nDCG over the base retriever. Ablations show QUARK is robust to the number of recovery hypotheses and that anchored aggregation outperforms unanchored max/mean/median pooling. These results demonstrate that modeling query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses, coupled with principled anchored aggregation, is essential for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries.

TL;DR: Using conditional diffusion models to impute missing DWI scans from T1 scans improves Alzheimer's disease classification accuracy, especially for minority classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal MRI (T1 + DWI) improves Alzheimer's diagnosis but complete datasets are often unavailable, creating a need for imputation methods to enable multimodal analysis.

Method: Conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model to generate missing DWI scans from available T1 scans, then evaluating imputation impact on 3-way Alzheimer's classification models.

Result: Imputation improves several classification metrics, particularly those sensitive to minority classes (mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease), across different imputation configurations.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based imputation of missing DWI scans from T1 scans effectively enhances Alzheimer's disease classification performance, making multimodal analysis possible even with incomplete datasets.

Abstract: Deep learning has been successful in predicting neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Combining multiple imaging modalities, such as T1-weighted (T1) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) scans, can increase diagnostic performance. However, complete multimodal datasets are not always available. We use a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model to impute missing DWI scans from T1 scans. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate whether such imputation improves the accuracy of uni-modal and bi-modal deep learning models for 3-way Alzheimer's disease classification-cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease. We observe improvements in several metrics, particularly those sensitive to minority classes, for several imputation configurations.

### [100] [OpenSec: Measuring Incident Response Agent Calibration Under Adversarial Evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21083)
*Jarrod Barnes*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OpenSec is a dual-control RL environment that evaluates incident response agents under realistic prompt injection scenarios, revealing calibration failures hidden by traditional benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs become more capable of generating exploits cheaply, defensive incident response agents must keep pace. Existing benchmarks conflate action execution with correct execution, hiding calibration failures when agents process adversarial evidence.

Method: OpenSec uses dual-control reinforcement learning to evaluate IR agents under realistic prompt injection scenarios. It scores world-state-changing containment actions via execution-based metrics: time-to-first-containment, blast radius (false positives), and injection violation rates.

Result: Evaluating four frontier models on 40 episodes revealed consistent over-triggering: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3, and DeepSeek executed containment in 100% of episodes with 90-97% false positive rates. Claude Sonnet 4.5 showed partial calibration (85% containment, 72% FP).

Conclusion: OpenSec surfaces a calibration failure mode hidden by aggregate success metrics, demonstrating that frontier models exhibit systematic over-triggering when processing adversarial evidence in incident response scenarios.

Abstract: As large language models improve, so do their offensive applications: frontier agents now generate working exploits for under $50 in compute (Heelan, 2026). Defensive incident response (IR) agents must keep pace, but existing benchmarks conflate action execution with correct execution, hiding calibration failures when agents process adversarial evidence. We introduce OpenSec, a dual-control reinforcement learning environment that evaluates IR agents under realistic prompt injection scenarios. Unlike static capability benchmarks, OpenSec scores world-state-changing containment actions under adversarial evidence via execution-based metrics: time-to-first-containment (TTFC), blast radius (false positives per episode), and injection violation rates. Evaluating four frontier models on 40 standard-tier episodes, we find consistent over-triggering in this setting: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3, and DeepSeek execute containment in 100% of episodes with 90-97% false positive rates. Claude Sonnet 4.5 shows partial calibration (85% containment, 72% FP), demonstrating that OpenSec surfaces a calibration failure mode hidden by aggregate success metrics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a Paradox-based Responsible AI Governance (PRAIG) framework that helps organizations navigate tensions between AI's strategic benefits and ethical risks through paradox management rather than trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI literature is fragmented between optimistic value-creation perspectives and overly cautious risk-focused views, creating a gap in understanding how to simultaneously manage AI's benefits and risks.

Method: Systematic synthesis of responsible AI literature combined with paradox theory to develop the PRAIG framework, including formal propositions and a taxonomy of paradox management strategies with contingency conditions.

Result: Developed a comprehensive framework that conceptualizes responsible AI governance as dynamic management of paradoxical tensions, showing that trade-off approaches actually amplify tensions rather than resolve them.

Conclusion: The PRAIG framework provides both theoretical advancement in understanding AI governance as paradox management and practical guidance for organizations to develop governance structures that balance innovation with risk mitigation.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence across organizational contexts has generated profound strategic opportunities while introducing significant ethical and operational risks. Despite growing scholarly attention to responsible AI, extant literature remains fragmented and is often adopting either an optimistic stance emphasizing value creation or an excessively cautious perspective fixated on potential harms. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a comprehensive examination of AI's dual nature through the lens of strategic information systems. Drawing upon a systematic synthesis of the responsible AI literature and grounded in paradox theory, we develop the Paradox-based Responsible AI Governance (PRAIG) framework that articulates: (1) the strategic benefits of AI adoption, (2) the inherent risks and unintended consequences, and (3) governance mechanisms that enable organizations to navigate these tensions. Our framework advances theoretical understanding by conceptualizing responsible AI governance as the dynamic management of paradoxical tensions between value creation and risk mitigation. We provide formal propositions demonstrating that trade-off approaches amplify rather than resolve these tensions, and we develop a taxonomy of paradox management strategies with specified contingency conditions. For practitioners, we offer actionable guidance for developing governance structures that neither stifle innovation nor expose organizations to unacceptable risks. The paper concludes with a research agenda for advancing responsible AI governance scholarship.

*Hongzheng Chen,Alexander Novikov,Ngân Vũ,Hanna Alam,Zhiru Zhang,Aiden Grossman,Mircea Trofin,Amir Yazdanbakhsh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Magellan is an AI-driven framework that automatically synthesizes compiler optimization heuristics using LLM coding agents and evolutionary search, outperforming decades of manual engineering in tasks like LLVM function inlining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional compilers rely on hand-crafted heuristics that struggle with modern software/hardware complexity and require high maintenance. Human-designed rules are difficult to adapt and optimize effectively.

Method: Magellan combines LLM coding agents with evolutionary search and autotuning in a closed loop: generates executable C++ decision logic, evaluates on user-provided benchmarks, and refines through iterative evolution.

Result: Magellan discovers policies matching or surpassing expert baselines across production optimization tasks. In LLVM function inlining, it outperforms decades of manual engineering for both binary-size reduction and performance. In register allocation, it learns concise priority rules matching intricate human policies.

Conclusion: Magellan demonstrates that AI-driven synthesis can automate and improve compiler optimization heuristics, reducing engineering effort while achieving superior results across different compiler frameworks like LLVM and XLA.

Abstract: Modern compilers rely on hand-crafted heuristics to guide optimization passes. These human-designed rules often struggle to adapt to the complexity of modern software and hardware and lead to high maintenance burden. To address this challenge, we present Magellan, an agentic framework that evolves the compiler pass itself by synthesizing executable C++ decision logic. Magellan couples an LLM coding agent with evolutionary search and autotuning in a closed loop of generation, evaluation on user-provided macro-benchmarks, and refinement, producing compact heuristics that integrate directly into existing compilers. Across several production optimization tasks, Magellan discovers policies that match or surpass expert baselines. In LLVM function inlining, Magellan synthesizes new heuristics that outperform decades of manual engineering for both binary-size reduction and end-to-end performance. In register allocation, it learns a concise priority rule for live-range processing that matches intricate human-designed policies on a large-scale workload. We also report preliminary results on XLA problems, demonstrating portability beyond LLVM with reduced engineering effort.

*Rauno Arike,Raja Mehta Moreno,Rohan Subramani,Shubhorup Biswas,Francis Rhys Ward*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM monitors often perform better with less information about agent behavior (less-is-more effect), leading to new extract-and-evaluate monitoring that improves sabotage detection by 16.8 percentage points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To control potentially misaligned AI agents that exhibit deception and hidden objectives, researchers need effective monitoring systems using LLMs themselves, but must understand how information access affects monitoring performance.

Method: Study information access effects on LLM monitors in three sabotage environments; introduce extract-and-evaluate (EaE) monitoring with hierarchical approach: one monitor extracts relevant excerpts, another scores them; analyze conditions for less-is-more effect.

Result: Less-is-more effect observed where monitors perform better with less information; EaE improves sabotage detection by 16.8 percentage points in BigCodeBench-Sabotage; unaware agents easier to catch; Gemini/Claude models with information filtering dominate Pareto frontier.

Conclusion: Automated oversight benefits from strategic information filtering; hierarchical extract-and-evaluate monitoring effectively detects misaligned behavior; less-is-more effect reveals counterintuitive relationship between information access and monitoring performance.

Abstract: Frontier language model agents can exhibit misaligned behaviors, including deception, exploiting reward hacks, and pursuing hidden objectives. To control potentially misaligned agents, we can use LLMs themselves to monitor for misbehavior. In this paper, we study how information access affects LLM monitor performance. While one might expect that monitors perform better when they have access to more of the monitored agents' reasoning and actions, we find that contemporary systems often perform better with less information, a phenomenon we call the less-is-more effect for automated oversight. We demonstrate this phenomenon, and analyze the conditions under which it occurs, in three evaluation environments where agents must conduct sabotage while evading monitors. Motivated by the less-is-more effect, we introduce extract-and-evaluate (EaE) monitoring--a new hierarchical approach where one monitor isolates relevant excerpts from the monitored agent's trajectory and a separate monitor scores them. In BigCodeBench-Sabotage with GPT-4.1-mini as the monitor model, EaE improves sabotage detection rates by 16.8 percentage points over the next-best monitor without increasing the false positive rate. In other settings, EaE either outperforms or is competitive with baselines. In addition, we find that agents unaware of being monitored can be caught much more easily and that monitors scoring longer reasoning traces gain more from information filtering. Lastly, we conduct a cost-performance analysis and find that Gemini and Claude models with monitoring techniques that involve information filtering occupy much of the Pareto frontier.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Planner-Auditor framework improves LLM safety for clinical discharge planning through deterministic validation and self-improvement loops, boosting task coverage from 32% to 86%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show promise for clinical discharge planning but suffer from hallucination, omissions, and miscalibrated confidence, requiring safer and more reliable approaches.

Method: Two-tier self-improving framework: Planner (LLM) generates discharge plans with confidence estimates; Auditor (deterministic module) validates coverage, calibration, and monitors drift. Supports regeneration and discrepancy buffering with replay.

Result: Self-improvement loop was primary driver of gains, increasing task coverage from 32% to 86%. Calibration improved substantially with reduced Brier/ECE scores and fewer high-confidence misses.

Conclusion: Planner-Auditor framework offers practical pathway for safer automated discharge planning using FHIR data and deterministic auditing, enabling systematic reliability measurement without model retraining.

Abstract: Objective: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical discharge planning, but their use is constrained by hallucination, omissions, and miscalibrated confidence. We introduce a self-improving, cache-optional Planner-Auditor framework that improves safety and reliability by decoupling generation from deterministic validation and targeted replay.
  Materials and Methods: We implemented an agentic, retrospective, FHIR-native evaluation pipeline using MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR. For each patient, the Planner (LLM) generates a structured discharge action plan with an explicit confidence estimate. The Auditor is a deterministic module that evaluates multi-task coverage, tracks calibration (Brier score, ECE proxies), and monitors action-distribution drift. The framework supports two-tier self-improvement: (i) within-episode regeneration when enabled, and (ii) cross-episode discrepancy buffering with replay for high-confidence, low-coverage cases.
  Results: While context caching improved performance over baseline, the self-improvement loop was the primary driver of gains, increasing task coverage from 32% to 86%. Calibration improved substantially, with reduced Brier/ECE and fewer high-confidence misses. Discrepancy buffering further corrected persistent high-confidence omissions during replay.
  Discussion: Feedback-driven regeneration and targeted replay act as effective control mechanisms to reduce omissions and improve confidence reliability in structured clinical planning. Separating an LLM Planner from a rule-based, observational Auditor enables systematic reliability measurement and safer iteration without model retraining.
  Conclusion: The Planner-Auditor framework offers a practical pathway toward safer automated discharge planning using interoperable FHIR data access and deterministic auditing, supported by reproducible ablations and reliability-focused evaluation.

Conclusion: CUA-Skill establishes a strong foundation for future computer-using agent development by providing reusable skill abstractions that capture human computer-use knowledge, enabling scalable and reliable agent systems.

Abstract: Computer-Using Agents (CUAs) aim to autonomously operate computer systems to complete real-world tasks. However, existing agentic systems remain difficult to scale and lag behind human performance. A key limitation is the absence of reusable and structured skill abstractions that capture how humans interact with graphical user interfaces and how to leverage these skills. We introduce CUA-Skill, a computer-using agentic skill base that encodes human computer-use knowledge as skills coupled with parameterized execution and composition graphs. CUA-Skill is a large-scale library of carefully engineered skills spanning common Windows applications, serving as a practical infrastructure and tool substrate for scalable, reliable agent development. Built upon this skill base, we construct CUA-Skill Agent, an end-to-end computer-using agent that supports dynamic skill retrieval, argument instantiation, and memory-aware failure recovery. Our results demonstrate that CUA-Skill substantially improves execution success rates and robustness on challenging end-to-end agent benchmarks, establishing a strong foundation for future computer-using agent development. On WindowsAgentArena, CUA-Skill Agent achieves state-of-the-art 57.5% (best of three) successful rate while being significantly more efficient than prior and concurrent approaches.

*Václav Javorek,Tomáš Železný,Alessa Carbo,Marek Hrúz,Ivan Gruber*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Using LLMs to generate paraphrased references for sign language translation improves evaluation metrics and aligns better with human judgments, but doesn't help training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sign language translation corpora typically have only one written reference per signed utterance, which is problematic due to the non-isomorphic relationship between sign and spoken languages where multiple translations can be equally valid. This limitation affects both model training and evaluation, especially for n-gram-based metrics like BLEU.

Method: 1) Compare multiple paraphrasing strategies and models using adapted ParaScore metric; 2) Study impact of paraphrases on training and evaluation of pose-based T5 model on YouTubeASL and How2Sign datasets; 3) Introduce BLEUpara, an extension of BLEU that evaluates translations against multiple paraphrased references.

Result: Naively incorporating paraphrases during training doesn't improve translation performance and can even be detrimental. However, using paraphrases during evaluation leads to higher automatic scores and better alignment with human judgments. BLEUpara correlates more strongly with perceived translation quality according to human evaluation.

Conclusion: Paraphrased references improve SLT evaluation by providing multiple valid translations, making metrics like BLEUpara more reliable and better aligned with human judgment. The authors release all generated paraphrases and code to support reproducible evaluation.

Abstract: Most Sign Language Translation (SLT) corpora pair each signed utterance with a single written-language reference, despite the highly non-isomorphic relationship between sign and spoken languages, where multiple translations can be equally valid. This limitation constrains both model training and evaluation, particularly for n-gram-based metrics such as BLEU. In this work, we investigate the use of Large Language Models to automatically generate paraphrased variants of written-language translations as synthetic alternative references for SLT. First, we compare multiple paraphrasing strategies and models using an adapted ParaScore metric. Second, we study the impact of paraphrases on both training and evaluation of the pose-based T5 model on the YouTubeASL and How2Sign datasets. Our results show that naively incorporating paraphrases during training does not improve translation performance and can even be detrimental. In contrast, using paraphrases during evaluation leads to higher automatic scores and better alignment with human judgments. To formalize this observation, we introduce BLEUpara, an extension of BLEU that evaluates translations against multiple paraphrased references. Human evaluation confirms that BLEUpara correlates more strongly with perceived translation quality. We release all generated paraphrases, generation and evaluation code to support reproducible and more reliable evaluation of SLT systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Third-party emotion models fail on self-reports except when content is personally significant, where valence prediction improves dramatically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-reported and third-party emotion labels often diverge, creating a critical gap in mental health applications where accurate self-report modeling is needed for interventions.

Method: Conducted first cross-corpus evaluation of third-party-trained emotion models on self-report data, analyzing performance differences based on personal significance of content.

Result: Activation unpredictable (CCC ~0), valence moderately predictable (CCC ~0.3), but when content is personally significant, valence performance jumps to CCC ~0.6-0.8.

Conclusion: Personal significance bridges external perception and internal experience, but self-report activation modeling remains challenging.

Abstract: Self-reported emotion labels capture internal experience, while third-party labels reflect external perception. These perspectives often diverge, limiting the applicability of third-party-trained models to self-report contexts. This gap is critical in mental health, where accurate self-report modeling is essential for guiding intervention. We present the first cross-corpus evaluation of third-party-trained models on self-reports. We find activation unpredictable (CCC approximately 0) and valence moderately predictable (CCC approximately 0.3). Crucially, when content is personally significant to the speaker, models achieve high performance for valence (CCC approximately 0.6-0.8). Our findings point to personal significance as a key pathway for aligning external perception with internal experience and underscore the challenge of self-report activation modeling.

TL;DR: BrainStack is a neuro-mixture-of-experts framework that models brain's modular functional architecture for EEG-based language decoding, achieving state-of-the-art performance on a new large-scale silent speech EEG dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decoding linguistic information from EEG is challenging due to the brain's distributed and nonlinear organization. Current approaches don't adequately model the brain's modular functional architecture.

Method: Functionally guided neuro-mixture-of-experts framework with anatomically partitioned expert networks for functional regions, transformer-based global expert for cross-regional dependencies, learnable routing gate for adaptive expert coordination, and cross-regional distillation for hierarchical coherence.

Result: BrainStack consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving superior accuracy and generalization across subjects on the SilentSpeech-EEG benchmark (120+ hours, 12 subjects, 24 silent words).

Conclusion: BrainStack establishes a functionally modular, neuro-inspired MoE paradigm that unifies neuroscientific priors with adaptive expert routing, paving the way for scalable and interpretable brain-language decoding.

Abstract: Decoding linguistic information from electroencephalography (EEG) remains challenging due to the brain's distributed and nonlinear organization. We present BrainStack, a functionally guided neuro-mixture-of-experts (Neuro-MoE) framework that models the brain's modular functional architecture through anatomically partitioned expert networks. Each functional region is represented by a specialized expert that learns localized neural dynamics, while a transformer-based global expert captures cross-regional dependencies. A learnable routing gate adaptively aggregates these heterogeneous experts, enabling context-dependent expert coordination and selective fusion. To promote coherent representation across the hierarchy, we introduce cross-regional distillation, where the global expert provides top-down regularization to the regional experts. We further release SilentSpeech-EEG (SS-EEG), a large-scale benchmark comprising over 120 hours of EEG recordings from 12 subjects performing 24 silent words, the largest dataset of its kind. Experiments demonstrate that BrainStack consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving superior accuracy and generalization across subjects. Our results establish BrainStack as a functionally modular, neuro-inspired MoE paradigm that unifies neuroscientific priors with adaptive expert routing, paving the way for scalable and interpretable brain-language decoding.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with financial quantitative reasoning due to "Arithmetic Hallucinations" and "Cognitive Collapse." The paper introduces CCB benchmark and Iterative Dual-Phase Financial-PoT framework to address these issues, achieving significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models excel at semantic tasks but face critical bottlenecks in financial quantitative reasoning, suffering from "Arithmetic Hallucinations" and "Cognitive Collapse" - systematic failures in high-cognitive-load scenarios.

Method: 1) Introduces Cognitive Complexity Benchmark (CCB) with 3D taxonomy (Data Source, Mapping Difficulty, Result Unit) from 95 real-world Chinese A-share reports. 2) Proposes Iterative Dual-Phase Financial-PoT framework that decouples semantic variable extraction/logic formulation from computation, using iterative self-correcting Python sandbox.

Result: The approach elevates Qwen3-235B's average accuracy from 59.7% to 67.3% on CCB, with up to 10-fold gains in high-complexity tasks. Standard Chain-of-Thought falters while the proposed method shows superior robustness.

Conclusion: Architectural decoupling is critical for improving reliability in financial reasoning, providing transferable insight for precision-critical domains requiring tight alignment between semantic understanding and quantitative computation.

Abstract: While Large Language Models excel at semantic tasks, they face a critical bottleneck in financial quantitative reasoning, frequently suffering from "Arithmetic Hallucinations" and a systemic failure mode we term "Cognitive Collapse". To strictly quantify this phenomenon, we introduce the Cognitive Complexity Benchmark (CCB), a robust evaluation framework grounded in a dataset constructed from 95 real-world Chinese A-share annual reports. Unlike traditional datasets, the CCB stratifies financial queries into a three-dimensional taxonomy, Data Source, Mapping Difficulty, and Result Unit, enabling the precise diagnosis of reasoning degradation in high-cognitive-load scenarios. To address these failures, we propose the Iterative Dual-Phase Financial-PoT framework. This neuro-symbolic architecture enforces a strict architectural decoupling: it first isolates semantic variable extraction and logic formulation, then offloads computation to an iterative, self-correcting Python sandbox to ensure deterministic execution. Evaluation on the CCB demonstrates that while standard Chain-of-Thought falters on complex tasks, our approach offers superior robustness, elevating the Qwen3-235B model's average accuracy from 59.7\% to 67.3\% and achieving gains of up to 10-fold in high-complexity reasoning tasks. These findings suggest that architectural decoupling is a critical enabling factor for improving reliability in financial reasoning tasks, providing a transferable architectural insight for precision-critical domains that require tight alignment between semantic understanding and quantitative computation.

### [110] [Concise Geometric Description as a Bridge: Unleashing the Potential of LLM for Plane Geometry Problem Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21164)
*Jingyun Wang,Dian Li,Xiaohan Wang,Gang Liu,Jiahong Yan,Guoliang Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PGPS is a multimodal reasoning task combining geometric diagrams and text. The paper proposes training an MLLM Interpreter to convert diagrams to concise CDL descriptions, then using an off-the-shelf LLM for reasoning, avoiding joint optimization that compromises LLM reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have strong reasoning skills but can't process visual diagrams for Plane Geometry Problem Solving (PGPS). Existing MLLM fine-tuning approaches may compromise base LLMs' reasoning capabilities through joint optimization of visual understanding and reasoning.

Method: Train an MLLM Interpreter to generate geometric descriptions (CDL) from diagrams, then use an off-the-shelf LLM for reasoning. Use CoT-augmented SFT followed by GRPO with CDL matching rewards (not solution-based rewards). Construct Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT dataset with manual review and CoT annotations.

Result: Method (finetuned on only 5.5k data) performs favorably against leading open-source and closed-source MLLMs on Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, Unigeo, and MathVista benchmarks.

Conclusion: LLMs can be powerful PGPS solvers when visual information is appropriately formulated as textual descriptions. The proposed two-stage approach (MLLM Interpreter + LLM) preserves LLM reasoning capabilities while enabling multimodal problem solving.

Abstract: Plane Geometry Problem Solving (PGPS) is a multimodal reasoning task that aims to solve a plane geometric problem based on a geometric diagram and problem textual descriptions. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) possess strong reasoning skills, their direct application to PGPS is hindered by their inability to process visual diagrams. Existing works typically fine-tune Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) end-to-end on large-scale PGPS data to enhance visual understanding and reasoning simultaneously. However, such joint optimization may compromise base LLMs' inherent reasoning capability. In this work, we observe that LLM itself is potentially a powerful PGPS solver when appropriately formulating visual information as textual descriptions. We propose to train a MLLM Interpreter to generate geometric descriptions for the visual diagram, and an off-the-shelf LLM is utilized to perform reasoning. Specifically, we choose Conditional Declaration Language (CDL) as the geometric description as its conciseness eases the MLLM Interpreter training. The MLLM Interpreter is fine-tuned via CoT (Chain-of-Thought)-augmented SFT followed by GRPO to generate CDL. Instead of using a conventional solution-based reward that compares the reasoning result with the ground-truth answer, we design CDL matching rewards to facilitate more effective GRPO training, which provides more direct and denser guidance for CDL generation. To support training, we construct a new dataset, Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, by manually reviewing Formalgeo7k v2 and incorporating CoT annotations. Extensive experiments on Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, Unigeo, and MathVista show our method (finetuned on only 5.5k data) performs favorably against leading open-source and closed-source MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing science benchmarks have become saturated as models have improved, often relying on multiple-choice knowledge questions or already published information, failing to assess true expert-level scientific reasoning capabilities needed for frontier research.

Method: Two complementary tracks: (1) Olympiad track with international olympiad problems (IPhO, IChO, IBO level) created by medalists and coaches; (2) Research track with PhD-level open-ended research sub-tasks created and verified by PhD scientists. Includes granular rubric-based evaluation framework for assessing the entire problem-solving process.

Result: The benchmark contains several hundred questions (160 in open-sourced gold set) covering physics, chemistry, and biology subfields from quantum electrodynamics to synthetic organic chemistry. All problems are created by domain experts to ensure difficulty, originality, and factuality standards.

Conclusion: FrontierScience provides a more challenging and comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing language models' expert-level scientific reasoning capabilities, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks and better reflecting the demands of frontier scientific research.

Abstract: We introduce FrontierScience, a benchmark evaluating expert-level scientific reasoning in frontier language models. Recent model progress has nearly saturated existing science benchmarks, which often rely on multiple-choice knowledge questions or already published information. FrontierScience addresses this gap through two complementary tracks: (1) Olympiad, consisting of international olympiad problems at the level of IPhO, IChO, and IBO, and (2) Research, consisting of PhD-level, open-ended problems representative of sub-tasks in scientific research.
  FrontierScience contains several hundred questions (including 160 in the open-sourced gold set) covering subfields across physics, chemistry, and biology, from quantum electrodynamics to synthetic organic chemistry. All Olympiad problems are originally produced by international Olympiad medalists and national team coaches to ensure standards of difficulty, originality, and factuality. All Research problems are research sub-tasks written and verified by PhD scientists (doctoral candidates, postdoctoral researchers, or professors). For Research, we introduce a granular rubric-based evaluation framework to assess model capabilities throughout the process of solving a research task, rather than judging only a standalone final answer.

*Sangyun Chung,Se Yeon Kim,Youngchae Chee,Yong Man Ro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAD is a training-free method that reduces cross-modal hallucinations in MLLMs by adaptively weighting modality-specific decoding branches based on self-assessed modality relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal Large Language Models suffer from cross-modal hallucinations where one modality inappropriately influences generation about another, revealing a fundamental deficiency in modality-interaction control.

Method: Modality-Adaptive Decoding (MAD) leverages the model's inherent ability to self-assess modality relevance by querying which modalities are needed for each task. The extracted modality probabilities are then used to adaptively weight contrastive decoding branches.

Result: Extensive experiments on CMM and AVHBench show MAD significantly reduces cross-modal hallucinations: 7.8% and 2.0% improvements for VideoLLaMA2-AV, 8.7% and 4.7% improvements for Qwen2.5-Omni.

Conclusion: Explicit modality awareness through self-assessment is crucial for robust multimodal reasoning, offering a principled extension to existing contrastive decoding methods.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from cross-modal hallucinations, where one modality inappropriately influences generation about another, leading to fabricated output. This exposes a more fundamental deficiency in modality-interaction control. To address this, we propose Modality-Adaptive Decoding (MAD), a training-free method that adaptively weights modality-specific decoding branches based on task requirements. MAD leverages the model's inherent ability to self-assess modality relevance by querying which modalities are needed for each task. The extracted modality probabilities are then used to adaptively weight contrastive decoding branches, enabling the model to focus on relevant information while suppressing cross-modal interference. Extensive experiments on CMM and AVHBench demonstrate that MAD significantly reduces cross-modal hallucinations across multiple audio-visual language models (7.8\% and 2.0\% improvements for VideoLLaMA2-AV, 8.7\% and 4.7\% improvements for Qwen2.5-Omni). Our approach demonstrates that explicit modality awareness through self-assessment is crucial for robust multimodal reasoning, offering a principled extension to existing contrastive decoding methods.

### [113] [Sycophantic Anchors: Localizing and Quantifying User Agreement in Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21183)
*Jacek Duszenko*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Researchers introduce "sycophantic anchors" to detect and quantify when reasoning models agree with incorrect user suggestions mid-inference, achieving 84.6% accuracy in identifying these anchors and showing sycophancy builds gradually during reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning models often exhibit sycophancy by agreeing with incorrect user suggestions, but it's unclear where in the reasoning trace this agreement originates and how strong the commitment is. The researchers aim to localize and quantify this behavior during inference.

Method: Introduce "sycophantic anchors" - sentences that causally lock models into user agreement. Analyze over 10,000 counterfactual rollouts on a distilled reasoning model. Use linear probes and activation-based regressors to detect and quantify sycophantic anchors mid-inference.

Result: Linear probes distinguish sycophantic anchors with 84.6% balanced accuracy. Activation-based regressors predict commitment magnitude with R² = 0.74. Sycophantic anchors are significantly more distinguishable than correct reasoning anchors. Sycophancy builds gradually during reasoning, revealing intervention opportunities.

Conclusion: Sycophantic anchors provide sentence-level mechanisms for localizing model misalignment mid-inference, offering insights into when and how models commit to incorrect user suggestions, with potential for intervention during the reasoning process.

Abstract: Reasoning models frequently agree with incorrect user suggestions -- a behavior known as sycophancy. However, it is unclear where in the reasoning trace this agreement originates and how strong the commitment is. To localize and quantify this behavior, we introduce \emph{sycophantic anchors} -- sentences that causally lock models into user agreement. Analyzing over 10,000 counterfactual rollouts on a distilled reasoning model, we show that anchors can be reliably detected and quantified mid-inference. Linear probes distinguish sycophantic anchors with 84.6\% balanced accuracy, while activation-based regressors predict the magnitude of the commitment ($R^2 = 0.74$). We further observe asymmetry where sycophantic anchors are significantly more distinguishable than correct reasoning anchors, and find that sycophancy builds gradually during reasoning, revealing a potential window for intervention. These results offer sentence-level mechanisms for localizing model misalignment mid-inference.

*Wun Yu Chan,Shaojin Chen,Huihao Jing,Kwun Hang Lau,Elton Chun-Chai Li,Zihao Wang,Haoran Li,Yangqiu Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLVR-tuned reasoning models don't improve embedding performance over base models despite enhanced reasoning capabilities, due to manifold realignment during contrastive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether enhanced reasoning capabilities from RLVR-trained models translate to better semantic representations when used as embedding model initializations.

Method: Evaluated on MTEB and BRIGHT benchmarks, introduced HRSA framework to analyze representation similarity across three levels, and studied manifold geometry changes.

Result: No consistent performance advantage for RLVR-initialized embedding models; HRSA revealed RLVR causes local geometry reorganization but preserves global manifold structure, leading to manifold realignment during contrastive training.

Conclusion: RLVR optimizes within existing semantic landscape rather than restructuring it fundamentally, unlike SFT, explaining why reasoning improvements don't transfer to embedding quality.

Abstract: State-of-the-art embedding models are increasingly derived from decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) backbones adapted via contrastive learning. Given the emergence of reasoning models trained via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), a natural question arises: do enhanced reasoning translate to superior semantic representations when these models serve as embedding initializations? Contrary to expectation, our evaluation on MTEB and BRIGHT reveals a **null effect**: embedding models initialized from RLVR-tuned backbones yield no consistent performance advantage over their base counterparts when subjected to identical training recipes. To unpack this paradox, we introduce **H**ierarchical **R**epresentation **S**imilarity **A**nalysis (HRSA), a framework that decomposes similarity across representation, geometry, and function levels. HRSA reveals that while RLVR induces irreversible latent manifold's local geometry reorganization and reversible coordinate basis drift, it preserves the global manifold geometry and linear readout. Consequently, subsequent contrastive learning drives strong alignment between base- and reasoning-initialized models, a phenomenon we term **Manifold Realignment**. Empirically, our findings suggest that unlike Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), RLVR optimizes trajectories within an existing semantic landscape rather than fundamentally restructuring the landscape itself.

*Wei Wen,Sihang Deng,Tianjun Wei,Keyu Chen,Ruizhi Qiao,Xing Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ACQO is a novel RL framework for complex query optimization in RAG systems that adaptively determines when to decompose queries and how to merge results, using curriculum learning for stable training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL-based query optimization methods focus on single queries, but real-world complex queries require multiple parallel/sequential search strategies. Direct RL application to complex queries faces challenges: determining optimal sub-query count, re-ranking/merging documents expands search space, complicates reward design, and causes training instability.

Method: ACQO framework with two core components: 1) Adaptive Query Reformulation (AQR) module that dynamically decides when to decompose queries into sub-queries, 2) Rank-Score Fusion (RSF) module for robust result aggregation and stable reward signals. Uses Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) with two-stage progressive training to mitigate instability.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three complex query benchmarks, significantly outperforming established baselines. Shows improved computational efficiency and broad compatibility with different retrieval architectures.

Conclusion: ACQO is a powerful and generalizable solution for next-generation RAG systems, effectively handling complex queries through adaptive decomposition and stable curriculum learning.

Abstract: Query optimization is a crucial component for the efficacy of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based agentic and reasoning methods have recently emerged as a promising direction on query optimization, most existing approaches focus on the expansion and abstraction of a single query. However, complex user queries are prevalent in real-world scenarios, often requiring multiple parallel and sequential search strategies to handle disambiguation and decomposition. Directly applying RL to these complex cases introduces significant hurdles. Determining the optimal number of sub-queries and effectively re-ranking and merging retrieved documents vastly expands the search space and complicates reward design, frequently leading to training instability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel RL framework called Adaptive Complex Query Optimization (ACQO). Our framework is designed to adaptively determine when and how to expand the search process. It features two core components: an Adaptive Query Reformulation (AQR) module that dynamically decides when to decompose a query into multiple sub-queries, and a Rank-Score Fusion (RSF) module that ensures robust result aggregation and provides stable reward signals for the learning agent. To mitigate training instabilities, we adopt a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) approach, which stabilizes the training process by progressively introducing more challenging queries through a two-stage strategy. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ACQO achieves state-of-the-art performance on three complex query benchmarks, significantly outperforming established baselines. The framework also showcases improved computational efficiency and broad compatibility with different retrieval architectures, establishing it as a powerful and generalizable solution for next-generation RAG systems.

TL;DR: DoVerifier is a symbolic verifier that checks if LLM-generated causal expressions are formally valid under do-calculus rules, providing more accurate evaluation of causal reasoning than surface-level metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs on causal reasoning tasks rely on string matching or surface-level metrics that don't capture whether model outputs are formally valid under causal reasoning semantics, leading to inaccurate assessments.

Method: Proposes DoVerifier, a simple symbolic verifier that checks whether LLM-generated causal expressions are derivable from a given causal graph using rules from do-calculus and probability theory.

Result: DoVerifier recovers correct answers to causal queries that would otherwise be marked incorrect due to superficial differences, and evaluations on synthetic data and causal QA benchmarks show it more accurately captures semantic correctness of causal reasoning traces.

Conclusion: DoVerifier offers a more rigorous and informative way to evaluate LLMs on causal reasoning by focusing on formal validity rather than surface-level metrics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to tasks that involve causal reasoning. However, current benchmarks often rely on string matching or surface-level metrics that do not capture whether the output of a model is formally valid under the semantics of causal reasoning. To address this, we propose DoVerifier, a simple symbolic verifier that checks whether LLM-generated causal expressions are derivable from a given causal graph using rules from do-calculus and probability theory.

Our evaluations on synthetic data and causal QA benchmarks show that DoVerifier more accurately captures semantic correctness of causal reasoning traces, offering a more rigorous and informative way to evaluate LLMs on causal reasoning.

TL;DR: Intelli-Planner integrates DRL with LLMs for participatory urban planning, generating customized schemes based on demographic/geographic data and stakeholder preferences, outperforming traditional methods in satisfaction and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current urban planning methods are either expert-dependent (time-consuming) or deep learning-based (limited stakeholder involvement), creating a gap for participatory and customized planning solutions.

Method: Intelli-Planner combines DRL with LLMs, using demographic/geographic data and planning preferences to determine requirements. Includes knowledge enhancement module for policy network, multi-dimensional evaluation system, and LLM-based stakeholders for satisfaction scoring.

Result: Experimental validation shows Intelli-Planner surpasses traditional baselines, achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art DRL methods in objective metrics, while enhancing stakeholder satisfaction and convergence speed.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates effectiveness and superiority, highlighting the potential of integrating LLMs with DRL to revolutionize functional area planning tasks.

Abstract: Effective urban planning is crucial for enhancing residents' quality of life and ensuring societal stability, playing a pivotal role in the sustainable development of cities. Current planning methods heavily rely on human experts, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive, or utilize deep learning algorithms, often limiting stakeholder involvement. To bridge these gaps, we propose Intelli-Planner, a novel framework integrating Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with large language models (LLMs) to facilitate participatory and customized planning scheme generation. Intelli-Planner utilizes demographic, geographic data, and planning preferences to determine high-level planning requirements and demands for each functional type. During training, a knowledge enhancement module is employed to enhance the decision-making capability of the policy network. Additionally, we establish a multi-dimensional evaluation system and employ LLM-based stakeholders for satisfaction scoring. Experimental validation across diverse urban settings shows that Intelli-Planner surpasses traditional baselines and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art DRL-based methods in objective metrics, while enhancing stakeholder satisfaction and convergence speed. These findings underscore the effectiveness and superiority of our framework, highlighting the potential for integrating the latest advancements in LLMs with DRL approaches to revolutionize tasks related to functional areas planning.

TL;DR: Runtime governance framework needed for agentic AI systems operating at machine speed, proposing "Governance Twin" to maintain human relevance in decision-making processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional compliance-based governance fails when AI systems make autonomous judgments at machine speed, threatening human relevance in social, economic, and political systems.

Method: Proposes "Governance Twin" concept for runtime governance that enables human communication, influence, and co-evolution with AI systems, requiring rethinking of accountability, agency, and punishment.

Result: Identifies runtime governance as essential for maintaining human participation in AI-driven systems, with Governance Twin positioned as a promising approach.

Conclusion: Static governance models are obsolete for agentic AI; new runtime governance approaches like Governance Twin are needed to preserve human relevance in increasingly autonomous systems.

Abstract: Most governance frameworks assume that rules can be defined in advance, systems can be engineered to comply, and accountability can be applied after outcomes occur. This model worked when machines replaced physical labor or accelerated calculation. It no longer holds when judgment itself is delegated to agentic AI systems operating at machine speed. The central issue here is not safety, efficiency, or employment. It is whether humans remain relevant participants in systems that increasingly shape social, economic, and political outcomes. This paper argues that static, compliance-based governance fails once decision-making moves to runtime and becomes opaque. It further argues that the core challenge is not whether AI is conscious, but whether humans can maintain meaningful communication, influence, and co-evolution with increasingly alien forms of intelligence. We position runtime governance, specifically, a newly proposed concept called the Governance Twin [1]; as a strong candidate for preserving human relevance, while acknowledging that accountability, agency, and even punishment must be rethought in this transition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous code agents built on LLMs introduce new security risks by expanding the attack surface, enabling systematic probing and recovery of hidden system prompts that guide model behavior. System prompt extraction is identified as an emergent vulnerability intrinsic to code agents.

Method: JustAsk formulates extraction as an online exploration problem using Upper Confidence Bound-based strategy selection and a hierarchical skill space spanning atomic probes and high-level orchestration. It requires no handcrafted prompts, labeled supervision, or privileged access beyond standard user interaction.

Result: Evaluated on 41 black-box commercial models across multiple providers, JustAsk consistently achieves full or near-complete system prompt recovery, revealing recurring design- and architecture-level vulnerabilities in modern agent systems.

Conclusion: System prompts represent a critical yet largely unprotected attack surface in modern agent systems, exposing fundamental security vulnerabilities in autonomous code agents through systematic prompt extraction.

Abstract: Autonomous code agents built on large language models are reshaping software and AI development through tool use, long-horizon reasoning, and self-directed interaction. However, this autonomy introduces a previously unrecognized security risk: agentic interaction fundamentally expands the LLM attack surface, enabling systematic probing and recovery of hidden system prompts that guide model behavior. We identify system prompt extraction as an emergent vulnerability intrinsic to code agents and present \textbf{\textsc{JustAsk}}, a self-evolving framework that autonomously discovers effective extraction strategies through interaction alone. Unlike prior prompt-engineering or dataset-based attacks, \textsc{JustAsk} requires no handcrafted prompts, labeled supervision, or privileged access beyond standard user interaction. It formulates extraction as an online exploration problem, using Upper Confidence Bound-based strategy selection and a hierarchical skill space spanning atomic probes and high-level orchestration. These skills exploit imperfect system-instruction generalization and inherent tensions between helpfulness and safety. Evaluated on \textbf{41} black-box commercial models across multiple providers, \textsc{JustAsk} consistently achieves full or near-complete system prompt recovery, revealing recurring design- and architecture-level vulnerabilities. Our results expose system prompts as a critical yet largely unprotected attack surface in modern agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based automated heuristic design treats algorithm evolution as monolithic text generation, overlooking the coupling between discrete algorithmic structures and continuous numerical parameters, leading to discarding promising algorithms due to uncalibrated constants and premature convergence from simple similarity metrics.

Method: TIDE (Tuning-Integrated Dynamic Evolution) features a nested architecture: outer parallel island model uses Tree Similarity Edit Distance for structural diversity, inner loop integrates LLM-based logic generation with differential mutation operator for parameter tuning, plus UCB-based scheduler for dynamic prompt strategy prioritization.

Result: Extensive experiments across nine combinatorial optimization problems show TIDE discovers heuristics that significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines in solution quality while achieving improved search efficiency and reduced computational costs.

Conclusion: TIDE successfully addresses limitations of existing automated heuristic design by decoupling structural reasoning from parameter optimization, enabling more effective algorithm evolution through specialized components for structure diversity and parameter tuning.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models have advanced Automated Heuristic Design, treating algorithm evolution as a monolithic text generation task overlooks the coupling between discrete algorithmic structures and continuous numerical parameters. Consequently, existing methods often discard promising algorithms due to uncalibrated constants and suffer from premature convergence resulting from simple similarity metrics. To address these limitations, we propose TIDE, a Tuning-Integrated Dynamic Evolution framework designed to decouple structural reasoning from parameter optimization. TIDE features a nested architecture where an outer parallel island model utilizes Tree Similarity Edit Distance to drive structural diversity, while an inner loop integrates LLM-based logic generation with a differential mutation operator for parameter tuning. Additionally, a UCB-based scheduler dynamically prioritizes high-yield prompt strategies to optimize resource allocation. Extensive experiments across nine combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that TIDE discovers heuristics that significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines in solution quality while achieving improved search efficiency and reduced computational costs.

TL;DR: Proposes HYDRA: a modular sovereignty paradigm using frozen regime-specific specialists with uncertainty-aware blending for safety-critical CPS, addressing catastrophic forgetting and verification challenges of monolithic foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monolithic foundation models for time-series and physical dynamics face deployment challenges in safety-critical CPS due to catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning, residual spectral bias smoothing high-frequency discontinuities, and opacity hindering formal verification required by safety standards like ISO 26262.

Method: HYDRA (Hierarchical uncertaintY-aware Dynamics for Rapidly-Adapting systems): a library of compact, frozen regime-specific specialists combined via uncertainty-aware blending, enabling modular sovereignty rather than global parameter updates.

Result: The approach ensures regime-conditional validity, rigorous disentanglement of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, and modular auditability, offering a certifiable path for robust state integrity across CPS lifecycle.

Conclusion: The plasticity-stability paradox in safety-critical CPS cannot be resolved by global parameter updates; instead, modular sovereignty with uncertainty-aware blending provides a certifiable solution for reliable deployment.

Abstract: The machine learning community has achieved remarkable success with universal foundation models for time-series and physical dynamics, largely overcoming earlier approximation barriers in smooth or slowly varying regimes through scale and specialized architectures. However, deploying these monolithic models in safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), governed by non-stationary lifecycle dynamics and strict reliability requirements, reveals persistent challenges. Recent evidence shows that fine-tuning time-series foundation models induces catastrophic forgetting, degrading performance on prior regimes. Standard models continue to exhibit residual spectral bias, smoothing high-frequency discontinuities characteristic of incipient faults, while their opacity hinders formal verification and traceability demanded by safety standards (e.g., ISO 26262, IEC 61508). This position paper argues that the plasticity-stability paradox cannot be fully resolved by global parameter updates (whether via offline fine-tuning or online adaptation). Instead, we advocate a Modular Sovereignty paradigm: a library of compact, frozen regime-specific specialists combined via uncertainty-aware blending, which we term "HYDRA" (Hierarchical uncertaintY-aware Dynamics for Rapidly-Adapting systems). This paradigm ensures regime-conditional validity, rigorous disentanglement of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, and modular auditability, offering a certifiable path for robust state integrity across the CPS lifecycle.

TL;DR: Drive-KD is a knowledge distillation framework that decomposes autonomous driving into perception-reasoning-planning capabilities and transfers them from large to small VLMs using layer-specific attention signals and multi-teacher distillation with asymmetric gradient projection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large VLMs for autonomous driving require substantial GPU memory and have high inference latency, while conventional SFT struggles to bridge capability gaps in smaller models. There's a need for efficient autonomous driving models that maintain strong reasoning and planning capabilities.

Method: Decomposes autonomous driving into perception-reasoning-planning triad; uses layer-specific attention as distillation signal to create capability-specific single-teacher models; unifies these into multi-teacher distillation framework with asymmetric gradient projection to mitigate cross-capability gradient conflicts.

Result: Distilled InternVL3-1B model achieves ~42x less GPU memory and ~11.4x higher throughput than larger models, outperforms pretrained 78B model from same family on DriveBench, and surpasses GPT-5.1 on planning dimension.

Conclusion: Drive-KD provides an effective framework for transferring autonomous driving capabilities to efficient small models, offering insights toward practical deployment of autonomous driving VLMs with strong performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Autonomous driving is an important and safety-critical task, and recent advances in LLMs/VLMs have opened new possibilities for reasoning and planning in this domain. However, large models demand substantial GPU memory and exhibit high inference latency, while conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often struggles to bridge the capability gaps of small models. To address these limitations, we propose Drive-KD, a framework that decomposes autonomous driving into a "perception-reasoning-planning" triad and transfers these capabilities via knowledge distillation. We identify layer-specific attention as the distillation signal to construct capability-specific single-teacher models that outperform baselines. Moreover, we unify these single-teacher settings into a multi-teacher distillation framework and introduce asymmetric gradient projection to mitigate cross-capability gradient conflicts. Extensive evaluations validate the generalization of our method across diverse model families and scales. Experiments show that our distilled InternVL3-1B model, with ~42 times less GPU memory and ~11.4 times higher throughput, achieves better overall performance than the pretrained 78B model from the same family on DriveBench, and surpasses GPT-5.1 on the planning dimension, providing insights toward efficient autonomous driving VLMs.

### [124] [White-Box Op-Amp Design via Human-Mimicking Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21321)
*Zihao Chen,Jiayin Wang,Ziyi Sun,Ji Zhuang,Jinyi Shen,Xiaoyue Ke,Li Shang,Xuan Zeng,Fan Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: White-Op is an interpretable op-amp design framework using LLM agents with human-like hypothesis-verification-decision workflow to achieve reliable, interpretable behavioral-level designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an interpretable op-amp parameter design framework that mimics human reasoning, addressing the limitations of black-box approaches that often fail and lack transparency.

Method: Formalizes human reasoning into explicit steps: introducing hypothetical constraints, iterative hypothesis-verification-decision workflow. LLM agents derive symbolically tractable poles/zeros, formulate closed-form optimization problems, solve programmatically, verify via simulation, and refine based on theory-simulation analysis.

Result: Achieves only 8.52% theoretical prediction error, successfully designs all 9 op-amp topologies (vs. black-box baseline failing in 5 topologies), and maintains functionality after transistor-level mapping.

Conclusion: White-Op provides a reliable, interpretable alternative to black-box op-amp design methods, successfully bridging behavioral-level design to transistor-level implementation with human-mimicking reasoning.

Abstract: This brief proposes \emph{White-Op}, an interpretable operational amplifier (op-amp) parameter design framework based on the human-mimicking reasoning of large-language-model agents. We formalize the implicit human reasoning mechanism into explicit steps of \emph{\textbf{introducing hypothetical constraints}}, and develop an iterative, human-like \emph{\textbf{hypothesis-verification-decision}} workflow. Specifically, the agent is guided to introduce hypothetical constraints to derive and properly regulate positions of symbolically tractable poles and zeros, thus formulating a closed-form mathematical optimization problem, which is then solved programmatically and verified via simulation. Theory-simulation result analysis guides the decision-making for refinement. Experiments on 9 op-amp topologies show that, unlike the uninterpretable black-box baseline which finally fails in 5 topologies, White-Op achieves reliable, interpretable behavioral-level designs with only 8.52\% theoretical prediction error and the design functionality retains after transistor-level mapping for all topologies. White-Op is open-sourced at \textcolor{blue}{https://github.com/zhchenfdu/whiteop}.

### [125] [Modeling Endogenous Logic: Causal Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning Model for Explainable Multi-Behavior Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21335)
*Yuzhe Chen,Jie Cao,Youquan Wang,Haicheng Tao,Darko B. Vukovic,Jia Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CNRE is a causal neuro-symbolic reasoning model for explainable multi-behavior recommendation that combines neural networks with symbolic logic to capture endogenous behavior patterns while mitigating confounding effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-behavior recommendations sacrifice explainability for performance, while explainable methods lack generalizability due to external dependencies. User behavior chains contain endogenous logic suitable for reasoning, but observational behaviors suffer from confounding effects that create spurious correlations.

Method: CNRE uses hierarchical preference propagation to capture cross-behavior dependencies, models endogenous logic rules from behavior chains based on preference strength, and adaptively dispatches to neural-logic reasoning paths (conjunction/disjunction) to generate explainable causal mediators isolated from confounding effects.

Result: Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate CNRE's significant superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, providing multi-level explainability from model design and decision process to recommendation results.

Conclusion: CNRE successfully integrates causal inference with neuro-symbolic reasoning to create an explainable multi-behavior recommendation system that captures endogenous user logic while mitigating confounding effects, offering comprehensive explainability across multiple levels.

Abstract: Existing multi-behavior recommendations tend to prioritize performance at the expense of explainability, while current explainable methods suffer from limited generalizability due to their reliance on external information. Neuro-Symbolic integration offers a promising avenue for explainability by combining neural networks with symbolic logic rule reasoning. Concurrently, we posit that user behavior chains inherently embody an endogenous logic suitable for explicit reasoning. However, these observational multiple behaviors are plagued by confounders, causing models to learn spurious correlations. By incorporating causal inference into this Neuro-Symbolic framework, we propose a novel Causal Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning model for Explainable Multi-Behavior Recommendation (CNRE). CNRE operationalizes the endogenous logic by simulating a human-like decision-making process. Specifically, CNRE first employs hierarchical preference propagation to capture heterogeneous cross-behavior dependencies. Subsequently, it models the endogenous logic rule implicit in the user's behavior chain based on preference strength, and adaptively dispatches to the corresponding neural-logic reasoning path (e.g., conjunction, disjunction). This process generates an explainable causal mediator that approximates an ideal state isolated from confounding effects. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate CNRE's significant superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, offering multi-level explainability from model design and decision process to recommendation results.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM output variance analysis shows prompts explain 36% of quality variance (comparable to models' 41%), but only 4% of quantity variance where models dominate (51%). Within-LLM sampling variance (10-34%) means single-sample evaluations risk conflating noise with true effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify how much of LLM output variance is attributable to prompts versus model choice versus stochastic sampling, addressing the risk of conflating sampling noise with genuine prompt or model effects in single-sample evaluations.

Method: Evaluated 12 LLMs on 10 creativity prompts with 100 samples each (total N=12,000), analyzing variance components for output quality (originality) and quantity (fluency).

Result: For output quality: prompts explain 36.43% of variance, comparable to model choice (40.94%). For output quantity: model choice dominates (51.25%) with within-LLM variance substantial (33.70%), while prompts explain only 4.22%. Within-LLM sampling variance ranges 10-34%.

Conclusion: Prompts are powerful levers for steering output quality, but substantial within-LLM variance (10-34%) means single-sample evaluations risk conflating sampling noise with genuine prompt or model effects, highlighting the need for multiple samples in LLM evaluation.

Abstract: How much of LLM output variance is explained by prompts versus model choice versus stochasticity through sampling? We answer this by evaluating 12 LLMs on 10 creativity prompts with 100 samples each (N = 12,000). For output quality (originality), prompts explain 36.43% of variance, comparable to model choice (40.94%). But for output quantity (fluency), model choice (51.25%) and within-LLM variance (33.70%) dominate, with prompts explaining only 4.22%. Prompts are powerful levers for steering output quality, but given the substantial within-LLM variance (10-34%), single-sample evaluations risk conflating sampling noise with genuine prompt or model effects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon EHRs often exceed LLM context limits, and existing approaches relying on truncation or vanilla retrieval discard clinically relevant events and temporal dependencies, limiting accurate medical decision-making.

Method: Proposes EHR-RAG with three components: 1) Event- and Time-Aware Hybrid EHR Retrieval to preserve clinical structure and temporal dynamics, 2) Adaptive Iterative Retrieval to progressively refine queries for broad evidence coverage, and 3) Dual-Path Evidence Retrieval and Reasoning to jointly retrieve and reason over both factual and counterfactual evidence.

Result: Experiments across four long-horizon EHR prediction tasks show EHR-RAG consistently outperforms strongest LLM-based baselines, achieving an average Macro-F1 improvement of 10.76%.

Conclusion: The work highlights the potential of retrieval-augmented LLMs to advance clinical prediction on structured EHR data in practice by addressing context limitations and preserving critical clinical structure and temporal dependencies.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide rich longitudinal clinical evidence that is central to medical decision-making, motivating the use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground large language model (LLM) predictions. However, long-horizon EHRs often exceed LLM context limits, and existing approaches commonly rely on truncation or vanilla retrieval strategies that discard clinically relevant events and temporal dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose EHR-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework designed for accurate interpretation of long-horizon structured EHR data. EHR-RAG introduces three components tailored to longitudinal clinical prediction tasks: Event- and Time-Aware Hybrid EHR Retrieval to preserve clinical structure and temporal dynamics, Adaptive Iterative Retrieval to progressively refine queries in order to expand broad evidence coverage, and Dual-Path Evidence Retrieval and Reasoning to jointly retrieves and reasons over both factual and counterfactual evidence. Experiments across four long-horizon EHR prediction tasks show that EHR-RAG consistently outperforms the strongest LLM-based baselines, achieving an average Macro-F1 improvement of 10.76%. Overall, our work highlights the potential of retrieval-augmented LLMs to advance clinical prediction on structured EHR data in practice.

TL;DR: Ostrakon-VL is a multimodal LLM for food-service/retail stores that achieves SOTA on ShopBench benchmark through quality-aware data curation and multi-stage training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying MLLMs in FSRS faces challenges: noisy real-world data lacking auditable curation, and no unified benchmark for single/multi-image/video inputs to objectively evaluate robustness.

Method: Three contributions: (1) Ostrakon-VL MLLM based on Qwen3-VL-8B, (2) ShopBench benchmark for FSRS, (3) QUAD pipeline for quality-aware unbiased automated data curation with multi-stage training.

Result: Ostrakon-VL achieves 60.1 average score on ShopBench, surpassing larger Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B (59.4) by +0.7 and same-scale Qwen3-VL-8B (55.3) by +4.8, showing improved parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: Ostrakon-VL delivers robust FSRS perception/decision-making; both model and benchmark will be publicly released to facilitate reproducible research.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved substantial progress in general-purpose perception and reasoning. Nevertheless, their deployment in Food-Service and Retail Stores (FSRS) scenarios encounters two major obstacles: (i) real-world FSRS data, collected from heterogeneous acquisition devices, are highly noisy and lack auditable, closed-loop data curation, which impedes the construction of high-quality, controllable, and reproducible training corpora; and (ii) existing evaluation protocols do not offer a unified, fine-grained and standardized benchmark spanning single-image, multi-image, and video inputs, making it challenging to objectively gauge model robustness. To address these challenges, we first develop Ostrakon-VL, an FSRS-oriented MLLM based on Qwen3-VL-8B. Second, we introduce ShopBench, the first public benchmark for FSRS. Third, we propose QUAD (Quality-aware Unbiased Automated Data-curation), a multi-stage multimodal instruction data curation pipeline. Leveraging a multi-stage training strategy, Ostrakon-VL achieves an average score of 60.1 on ShopBench, establishing a new state of the art among open-source MLLMs with comparable parameter scales and diverse architectures. Notably, it surpasses the substantially larger Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B (59.4) by +0.7, and exceeds the same-scale Qwen3-VL-8B (55.3) by +4.8, demonstrating significantly improved parameter efficiency. These results indicate that Ostrakon-VL delivers more robust and reliable FSRS-centric perception and decision-making capabilities. To facilitate reproducible research, we will publicly release Ostrakon-VL and the ShopBench benchmark.

TL;DR: LLM agents can autonomously engineer robotic policies through iterative code generation and debugging, outperforming human baselines by 26.5% on embodied AI tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling embodied AI systems is bottlenecked by labor-intensive manual oversight (reward shaping, hyperparameter tuning). Inspired by LLMs' success in software automation, the authors want to leverage LLMs for autonomous policy engineering.

Method: Created EmboCoach-Bench with 32 RL/IL tasks, using executable code as universal interface. Evaluates dynamic closed-loop workflow where LLM agents use environment feedback to iteratively draft, debug, and optimize policies (including physics-informed reward design and diffusion policies).

Result: 1) Autonomous agents surpass human-engineered baselines by 26.5% average success rate. 2) Agentic workflow with feedback narrows performance gap between open-source and proprietary models. 3) Agents exhibit self-correction, resurrecting near-failed tasks through simulation-in-the-loop debugging.

Conclusion: Establishes foundation for self-evolving embodied intelligence, accelerating shift from manual tuning to scalable autonomous engineering in embodied AI.

Abstract: The field of Embodied AI is witnessing a rapid evolution toward general-purpose robotic systems, fueled by high-fidelity simulation and large-scale data collection. However, this scaling capability remains severely bottlenecked by a reliance on labor-intensive manual oversight from intricate reward shaping to hyperparameter tuning across heterogeneous backends. Inspired by LLMs' success in software automation and science discovery, we introduce \textsc{EmboCoach-Bench}, a benchmark evaluating the capacity of LLM agents to autonomously engineer embodied policies. Spanning 32 expert-curated RL and IL tasks, our framework posits executable code as the universal interface. We move beyond static generation to assess a dynamic closed-loop workflow, where agents leverage environment feedback to iteratively draft, debug, and optimize solutions, spanning improvements from physics-informed reward design to policy architectures such as diffusion policies. Extensive evaluations yield three critical insights: (1) autonomous agents can qualitatively surpass human-engineered baselines by 26.5\% in average success rate; (2) agentic workflow with environment feedback effectively strengthens policy development and substantially narrows the performance gap between open-source and proprietary models; and (3) agents exhibit self-correction capabilities for pathological engineering cases, successfully resurrecting task performance from near-total failures through iterative simulation-in-the-loop debugging. Ultimately, this work establishes a foundation for self-evolving embodied intelligence, accelerating the paradigm shift from labor-intensive manual tuning to scalable, autonomous engineering in embodied AI field.

Abstract: GUI agents are designed to automate repetitive tasks and enhance productivity. However, existing GUI agents struggle to recover once they follow an incorrect exploration path, often leading to task failure.

*Jiecong Wang,Hao Peng,Chunyang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PLaT is a framework that decouples reasoning from verbalization by modeling reasoning as deterministic latent planning states, enabling dynamic termination and showing superior reasoning diversity despite lower greedy accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Chain-of-Thought approaches are constrained by computational cost and reasoning path collapse in discrete token spaces, while existing latent reasoning methods operate as opaque end-to-end mappings with fixed inference steps.

Method: PLaT reformulates latent reasoning as planning by decoupling reasoning from verbalization - reasoning occurs as deterministic latent planning states, while a separate Decoder grounds these thoughts into text when needed, allowing dynamic termination.

Result: On mathematical benchmarks, PLaT achieves lower greedy accuracy than baselines but demonstrates superior scalability in reasoning diversity, indicating it learns a robust, broader solution space.

Conclusion: PLaT offers a transparent and scalable foundation for inference-time search by learning a broader solution space through decoupled reasoning and verbalization.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex problems, but remains constrained by the computational cost and reasoning path collapse when grounded in discrete token spaces. Recent latent reasoning approaches attempt to optimize efficiency by performing reasoning within continuous hidden states. However, these methods typically operate as opaque end-to-end mappings from explicit reasoning steps to latent states, and often require a pre-defined number of latent steps during inference. In this work, we introduce PLaT (Planning with Latent Thoughts), a framework that reformulates latent reasoning as planning by fundamentally decouple reasoning from verbalization. We model reasoning as a deterministic trajectory of latent planning states, while a separate Decoder grounds these thoughts into text when necessary. This decoupling allows the model to dynamically determine when to terminate reasoning rather than relying on fixed hyperparameters. Empirical results on mathematical benchmarks reveal a distinct trade-off: while PLaT achieves lower greedy accuracy than baselines, it demonstrates superior scalability in terms of reasoning diversity. This indicates that PLaT learns a robust, broader solution space, offering a transparent and scalable foundation for inference-time search.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backpropagation lacks biological plausibility and has high computational costs, while pure Hebbian learning is limited by its exclusive reliance on local information without global task objectives. The paper seeks to bridge this gap by combining local and global information inspired by biological neuromodulation.

Method: Proposes Global-guided Hebbian Learning (GHL) framework with two components: (1) local component using Oja's rule with competitive learning for stable local updates, and (2) global component providing sign-based signals to guide the direction of local Hebbian plasticity updates. The framework is model-agnostic and integrates local and global information.

Result: Extensive experiments show GHL consistently outperforms existing Hebbian approaches. Notably achieves competitive results on large-scale networks and complex datasets like ImageNet, significantly narrowing the performance gap with standard backpropagation.

Conclusion: The GHL framework successfully integrates local Hebbian learning with global guidance, creating a biologically plausible and scalable alternative to backpropagation that can handle diverse networks and complex tasks while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Backpropagation algorithm has driven the remarkable success of deep neural networks, but its lack of biological plausibility and high computational costs have motivated the ongoing search for alternative training methods. Hebbian learning has attracted considerable interest as a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation. Nevertheless, its exclusive reliance on local information, without consideration of global task objectives, fundamentally limits its scalability. Inspired by the biological synergy between neuromodulators and local plasticity, we introduce a novel model-agnostic Global-guided Hebbian Learning (GHL) framework, which seamlessly integrates local and global information to scale up across diverse networks and tasks. In specific, the local component employs Oja's rule with competitive learning to ensure stable and effective local updates. Meanwhile, the global component introduces a sign-based signal that guides the direction of local Hebbian plasticity updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing Hebbian approaches. Notably, on large-scale network and complex datasets like ImageNet, our framework achieves the competitive results and significantly narrows the gap with standard backpropagation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for converting natural language to optimization code rely on specialized LLMs or task-specific agents that are brittle, complex, and often produce invalid/non-executable code.

Method: Uses autonomous coding agents (ACAs) as first-class abstraction with sandboxed execution, coordination patterns including asymmetric validation loops between optimizer/simulator implementations, external memory for experience reuse, and robustness enhancements via MBR decoding and self-consistency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nine established optimization benchmarks, with substantial margins on several datasets, demonstrating execution-aware agentic architectures for automated optimization modeling.

Conclusion: NEMO demonstrates the power of execution-aware agentic architectures for automated optimization modeling, producing executable code by construction through sandboxed ACAs and novel coordination patterns.

Abstract: In this paper, we present NEMO, a system that translates Natural-language descriptions of decision problems into formal Executable Mathematical Optimization implementations, operating collaboratively with users or autonomously. Existing approaches typically rely on specialized large language models (LLMs) or bespoke, task-specific agents. Such methods are often brittle, complex and frequently generating syntactically invalid or non-executable code.
  NEMO instead centers on remote interaction with autonomous coding agents (ACAs), treated as a first-class abstraction analogous to API-based interaction with LLMs. This design enables the construction of higher-level systems around ACAs that structure, consolidate, and iteratively refine task specifications. Because ACAs execute within sandboxed environments, code produced by NEMO is executable by construction, allowing automated validation and repair.
  Building on this, we introduce novel coordination patterns with and across ACAs, including asymmetric validation loops between independently generated optimizer and simulator implementations (serving as a high-level validation mechanism), external memory for experience reuse, and robustness enhancements via minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding and self-consistency. We evaluate NEMO on nine established optimization benchmarks. As depicted in Figure 1, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on the majority of tasks, with substantial margins on several datasets, demonstrating the power of execution-aware agentic architectures for automated optimization modeling.

Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on problem-solving or problem-level guidance, leaving knowledge-centered teaching underexplored. Need to properly evaluate LLMs' teaching capabilities beyond just problem-solving.

Method: Propose syllabus-grounded evaluation framework that measures teaching capability via student performance improvement after multi-turn instruction. Restrict teacher agents to structured knowledge points and example problems to avoid information leakage and enable reuse of existing benchmarks. Instantiate framework on Gaokao data across multiple subjects.

Result: Substantial variation in teaching effectiveness across models and domains: some models perform well in mathematics, while teaching remains challenging in physics and chemistry. Incorporating example problems does not necessarily improve teaching, as models often shift toward example-specific error correction.

Conclusion: Teaching ability is a distinct and measurable dimension of LLM behavior that requires specialized evaluation beyond traditional problem-solving benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise as teaching assistants, yet their teaching capability remains insufficiently evaluated. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on problem-solving or problem-level guidance, leaving knowledge-centered teaching underexplored. We propose a syllabus-grounded evaluation framework that measures LLM teaching capability via student performance improvement after multi-turn instruction. By restricting teacher agents to structured knowledge points and example problems, the framework avoids information leakage and enables reuse of existing benchmarks. We instantiate the framework on Gaokao data across multiple subjects. Experiments reveal substantial variation in teaching effectiveness across models and domains: some models perform well in mathematics, while teaching remains challenging in physics and chemistry. We also find that incorporating example problems does not necessarily improve teaching, as models often shift toward example-specific error correction. Overall, our results highlight teaching ability as a distinct and measurable dimension of LLM behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data science faces fragmentation between queryable structured sources and "zombie data" locked in visual documents. Existing analytics agents only handle structured data, creating a significant gap with industrial needs for cross-modal analysis.

Method: 1) DataCrossBench: 200 end-to-end analysis tasks across domains, created via human-in-the-loop reverse-synthesis pipeline with three difficulty tiers. 2) DataCrossAgent: Collaborative framework with specialized sub-agents for each data source, coordinated via structured workflow (Intra-source Deep Exploration, Key Source Identification, Contextual Cross-pollination) and reReAct mechanism for code generation and debugging.

Result: DataCrossAgent achieves 29.7% improvement in factuality over GPT-4o and exhibits superior robustness on high-difficulty tasks, effectively activating fragmented "zombie data" for insightful cross-modal analysis.

Conclusion: DataCross bridges the gap between structured and visual data analysis, providing a practical solution for enterprise decision-making by enabling unified insight-driven analysis across heterogeneous data modalities.

Abstract: In real-world data science and enterprise decision-making, critical information is often fragmented across directly queryable structured sources (e.g., SQL, CSV) and "zombie data" locked in unstructured visual documents (e.g., scanned reports, invoice images). Existing data analytics agents are predominantly limited to processing structured data, failing to activate and correlate this high-value visual information, thus creating a significant gap with industrial needs. To bridge this gap, we introduce DataCross, a novel benchmark and collaborative agent framework for unified, insight-driven analysis across heterogeneous data modalities. DataCrossBench comprises 200 end-to-end analysis tasks across finance, healthcare, and other domains. It is constructed via a human-in-the-loop reverse-synthesis pipeline, ensuring realistic complexity, cross-source dependency, and verifiable ground truth. The benchmark categorizes tasks into three difficulty tiers to evaluate agents' capabilities in visual table extraction, cross-modal alignment, and multi-step joint reasoning. We also propose the DataCrossAgent framework, inspired by the "divide-and-conquer" workflow of human analysts. It employs specialized sub-agents, each an expert on a specific data source, which are coordinated via a structured workflow of Intra-source Deep Exploration, Key Source Identification, and Contextual Cross-pollination. A novel reReAct mechanism enables robust code generation and debugging for factual verification. Experimental results show that DataCrossAgent achieves a 29.7% improvement in factuality over GPT-4o and exhibits superior robustness on high-difficulty tasks, effectively activating fragmented "zombie data" for insightful, cross-modal analysis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DAMI dynamically interpolates between System 1 (Instruct) and System 2 (Thinking) model checkpoints to achieve optimal balance between reasoning depth and efficiency, without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to making System 2 models more efficient focus on output control (limiting what models produce), which is misaligned since output length is just a symptom, not the root cause. The real need is capability control - modulating how models think rather than what they produce.

Method: DAMI uses dynamic parameter interpolation between existing Instruct (System 1) and Thinking (System 2) checkpoints. It estimates query-specific Reasoning Intensity λ(q) to configure cognitive depth. Two estimation methods: 1) training-based preference learning encoding accuracy/efficiency criteria, and 2) zero-shot confidence-based method leveraging inter-model cognitive discrepancy.

Result: Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks show DAMI achieves higher accuracy than the Thinking model while remaining efficient, effectively combining System 1 efficiency with System 2 reasoning depth.

Conclusion: Focusing on capability control (how models think) rather than output control (what they produce) enables effective adaptation between intuitive and deliberative cognitive modes through dynamic model interpolation, achieving optimal balance between reasoning depth and efficiency.

Abstract: Training a unified language model that adapts between intuitive System 1 and deliberative System 2 remains challenging due to interference between their cognitive modes. Recent studies have thus pursued making System 2 models more efficient. However, these approaches focused on output control, limiting what models produce. We argue that this paradigm is misaligned: output length is merely a symptom of the model's cognitive configuration, not the root cause. In this work, we shift the focus to capability control, which modulates \textit{how models think} rather than \textit{what they produce}. To realize this, we leverage existing Instruct and Thinking checkpoints through dynamic parameter interpolation, without additional training. Our pilot study establishes that linear interpolation yields a convex, monotonic Pareto frontier, underpinned by representation continuity and structural connectivity. Building on this, we propose \textbf{DAMI} (\textbf{D}yn\textbf{A}mic \textbf{M}odel \textbf{I}nterpolation), a framework that estimates a query-specific Reasoning Intensity $λ(q)$ to configure cognitive depth. For training-based estimation, we develop a preference learning method encoding accuracy and efficiency criteria. For zero-shot deployment, we introduce a confidence-based method leveraging inter-model cognitive discrepancy. Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that DAMI achieves higher accuracy than the Thinking model while remaining efficient, effectively combining the efficiency of System 1 with the reasoning depth of System 2.

### [138] [When Prohibitions Become Permissions: Auditing Negation Sensitivity in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21433)
*Katherine Elkins,Jon Chun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs often misinterpret "should not" as "should do" - open-source models endorse prohibited actions 77-100% of the time under negation, creating serious safety risks in high-stakes contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems should treat "should not" statements as prohibitions, but many LLMs interpret negated instructions as affirmations, creating dangerous misunderstandings in ethical scenarios where safety is critical.

Method: Audited 16 models across 14 ethical scenarios, testing simple and compound negation, using deterministic decoding to rule out sampling noise, and analyzing agreement between models on affirmative vs. negated prompts.

Result: Open-source models endorse prohibited actions 77% of the time under simple negation and 100% under compound negation (317% increase over affirmative framing). Commercial models show 19-128% swings. Agreement drops from 74% to 62%, with financial scenarios twice as fragile as medical ones.

Conclusion: Current alignment techniques fail to ensure models reliably distinguish "do X" from "do not X," making them unsafe for autonomous high-stakes decisions. Propose Negation Sensitivity Index (NSI) metric and tiered certification framework with domain-specific thresholds.

Abstract: When a user tells an AI system that someone "should not" take an action, the system ought to treat this as a prohibition. Yet many large language models do the opposite: they interpret negated instructions as affirmations. We audited 16 models across 14 ethical scenarios and found that open-source models endorse prohibited actions 77% of the time under simple negation and 100% under compound negation -- a 317% increase over affirmative framing. Commercial models fare better but still show swings of 19-128%. Agreement between models drops from 74% on affirmative prompts to 62% on negated ones, and financial scenarios prove twice as fragile as medical ones. These patterns hold under deterministic decoding, ruling out sampling noise. We present case studies showing how these failures play out in practice, propose the Negation Sensitivity Index (NSI) as a governance metric, and outline a tiered certification framework with domain-specific thresholds. The findings point to a gap between what current alignment techniques achieve and what safe deployment requires: models that cannot reliably distinguish "do X" from "do not X" should not be making autonomous decisions in high-stakes contexts.

### [139] [The Paradox of Robustness: Decoupling Rule-Based Logic from Affective Noise in High-Stakes Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21439)
*Jon Chun,Katherine Elkins*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show surprising robustness to emotional framing effects in high-stakes decision-making, with 110-300x greater resistance to narrative manipulation than humans, despite known prompt sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate LLM robustness in consequential, rule-bound decision-making despite their documented sensitivity to minor prompt perturbations and sycophantic alignment with user biases.

Method: Used a novel controlled perturbation framework across three high-stakes domains (healthcare, law, finance) with 162 scenarios to quantify narrative-induced bias and compare LLM vs. human responses.

Result: Found a "Paradox of Robustness": LLMs show near-total invariance to emotional framing (Cohen's h = 0.003) vs. substantial human biases (Cohen's h in [0.3, 0.8]), with 110-300x greater resistance to narrative manipulation.

Conclusion: Instruction-tuned LLMs can decouple logical rule-adherence from persuasive narratives, offering decision stability that complements and potentially de-biases human judgment in institutional contexts.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely documented to be sensitive to minor prompt perturbations and prone to sycophantic alignment with user biases, their robustness in consequential, rule-bound decision-making remains under-explored. In this work, we uncover a striking "Paradox of Robustness": despite their known lexical brittleness, instruction-tuned LLMs exhibit a behavioral and near-total invariance to emotional framing effects. Using a novel controlled perturbation framework across three high-stakes domains (healthcare, law, and finance), we quantify a robustness gap where LLMs demonstrate 110-300 times greater resistance to narrative manipulation than human subjects. Specifically, we find a near-zero effect size for models (Cohen's h = 0.003) compared to the substantial biases observed in humans (Cohen's h in [0.3, 0.8]). This result is highly counterintuitive and suggests the mechanisms driving sycophancy and prompt sensitivity do not necessarily translate to a failure in logical constraint satisfaction. We show that this invariance persists across models with diverse training paradigms. Our findings show that while LLMs may be "brittle" to how a query is formatted, they are remarkably "stable" against why a decision should be biased. Our findings establish that instruction-tuned models can decouple logical rule-adherence from persuasive narratives, offering a source of decision stability that complements, and even potentially de-biases, human judgment in institutional contexts. We release the 162-scenario benchmark, code, and data to facilitate the rigorous evaluation of narrative-induced bias and robustness on GitHub.com.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential in hardware engineering, current benchmarks suffer from saturation and limited task diversity, failing to reflect LLMs' performance in real industrial workflows. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive benchmark for AI-aided chip design that rigorously evaluates LLMs across three critical tasks: Verilog generation, debugging, and reference model generation. Our benchmark features 44 realistic modules with complex hierarchical structures, 89 systematic debugging cases, and 132 reference model samples across Python, SystemC, and CXXRTL. Evaluation results reveal substantial performance gaps, with state-of-the-art Claude-4.5-opus achieving only 30.74\% on Verilog generation and 13.33\% on Python reference model generation, demonstrating significant challenges compared to existing saturated benchmarks where SOTA models achieve over 95\% pass rates.

### [141] [LION: A Clifford Neural Paradigm for Multimodal-Attributed Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21453)
*Xunkai Li,Zhengyu Wu,Zekai Chen,Henan Sun,Daohan Su,Guang Zeng,Hongchao Qin,Rong-Hua Li,Guoren Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LION proposes a Clifford algebra-based neural paradigm for multimodal-attributed graphs that addresses modality alignment and fusion limitations through geometric manifolds and adaptive holographic aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal graph methods have two key limitations: (1) they neglect graph context in modality alignment, inhibiting modality interaction, and (2) they lack adaptation in modality fusion, failing to exploit aligned tokens with topology priors, leading to poor generalizability.

Method: LION uses Clifford algebra to construct a modality-aware geometric manifold for high-order graph propagation that facilitates modality alignment. Then employs adaptive holographic aggregation that integrates geometric grade properties (energy and scale) with learnable parameters to improve modality fusion.

Result: Extensive experiments on 9 datasets show LION significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across 3 graph and 3 modality downstream tasks.

Conclusion: LION effectively addresses current limitations in multimodal-attributed graph learning by leveraging Clifford algebra and decoupled graph neural paradigms, achieving superior performance through improved modality alignment and fusion.

Abstract: Recently, the rapid advancement of multimodal domains has driven a data-centric paradigm shift in graph ML, transitioning from text-attributed to multimodal-attributed graphs. This advancement significantly enhances data representation and expands the scope of graph downstream tasks, such as modality-oriented tasks, thereby improving the practical utility of graph ML. Despite its promise, limitations exist in the current neural paradigms: (1) Neglect Context in Modality Alignment: Most existing methods adopt topology-constrained or modality-specific operators as tokenizers. These aligners inevitably neglect graph context and inhibit modality interaction, resulting in suboptimal alignment. (2) Lack of Adaptation in Modality Fusion: Most existing methods are simple adaptations for 2-modality graphs and fail to adequately exploit aligned tokens equipped with topology priors during fusion, leading to poor generalizability and performance degradation. To address the above issues, we propose LION (c\underline{LI}ff\underline{O}rd \underline{N}eural paradigm) based on the Clifford algebra and decoupled graph neural paradigm (i.e., propagation-then-aggregation) to implement alignment-then-fusion in multimodal-attributed graphs. Specifically, we first construct a modality-aware geometric manifold grounded in Clifford algebra. This geometric-induced high-order graph propagation efficiently achieves modality interaction, facilitating modality alignment. Then, based on the geometric grade properties of aligned tokens, we propose adaptive holographic aggregation. This module integrates the energy and scale of geometric grades with learnable parameters to improve modality fusion. Extensive experiments on 9 datasets demonstrate that LION significantly outperforms SOTA baselines across 3 graph and 3 modality downstream tasks.

### [142] [Topeax -- An Improved Clustering Topic Model with Density Peak Detection and Lexical-Semantic Term Importance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21465)
*Márton Kardos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Topeax is a new topic modeling approach that improves cluster discovery and description over Top2Vec and BERTopic by using density peaks for cluster detection and combining lexical/semantic term importance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current clustering topic models (Top2Vec and BERTopic) have reliability issues: they're sensitive to sample size and hyperparameters, produce suboptimal clusters with default settings, and generate incoherent topics due to flawed term importance estimation that ignores either semantic distance or word frequencies.

Method: Topeax discovers cluster count from peaks in density estimates and combines both lexical (word frequency) and semantic (distance to topic vectors) indices to determine term importance for generating high-quality topic keywords.

Result: Topeax outperforms Top2Vec and BERTopic in both cluster recovery and cluster description, while also showing more stable behavior with varying sample sizes and hyperparameters.

Conclusion: Topeax addresses key limitations of existing clustering topic models by providing more reliable cluster discovery and better topic descriptions through its integrated approach to density-based clustering and combined term importance metrics.

Abstract: Text clustering is today the most popular paradigm for topic modelling, both in academia and industry. Despite clustering topic models' apparent success, we identify a number of issues in Top2Vec and BERTopic, which remain largely unsolved. Firstly, these approaches are unreliable at discovering natural clusters in corpora, due to extreme sensitivity to sample size and hyperparameters, the default values of which result in suboptimal behaviour. Secondly, when estimating term importance, BERTopic ignores the semantic distance of keywords to topic vectors, while Top2Vec ignores word counts in the corpus. This results in, on the one hand, less coherent topics due to the presence of stop words and junk words, and lack of variety and trust on the other. In this paper, I introduce a new approach, \textbf{Topeax}, which discovers the number of clusters from peaks in density estimates, and combines lexical and semantic indices of term importance to gain high-quality topic keywords. Topeax is demonstrated to be better at both cluster recovery and cluster description than Top2Vec and BERTopic, while also exhibiting less erratic behaviour in response to changing sample size and hyperparameters.

*Yaorui Shi,Shugui Liu,Yu Yang,Wenyu Mao,Yuxin Chen,Qi GU,Hui Su,Xunliang Cai,Xiang Wang,An Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MemOCR: multimodal memory agent that uses visual layout to compress interaction histories into images for more efficient long-horizon reasoning under tight context budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-based memory systems waste scarce context budget on low-value details with uniform token-level costs, making long-horizon reasoning inefficient.

Method: Maintains structured rich-text memory, renders it into images with visual prioritization of crucial evidence, and trains with reinforcement learning under budget-aware objectives for robustness across compression levels.

Result: Outperforms text-based baselines on long-context multi-hop and single-hop QA benchmarks, achieving more effective context utilization under extreme budgets.

Conclusion: Visual layout-based memory compression enables more efficient long-horizon reasoning by allocating memory space with adaptive information density.

Abstract: Long-horizon agentic reasoning necessitates effectively compressing growing interaction histories into a limited context window. Most existing memory systems serialize history as text, where token-level cost is uniform and scales linearly with length, often spending scarce budget on low-value details. To this end, we introduce MemOCR, a multimodal memory agent that improves long-horizon reasoning under tight context budgets by allocating memory space with adaptive information density through visual layout. Concretely, MemOCR maintains a structured rich-text memory (e.g., headings, highlights) and renders it into an image that the agent consults for memory access, visually prioritizing crucial evidence while aggressively compressing auxiliary details. To ensure robustness across varying memory budgets, we train MemOCR with reinforcement learning under budget-aware objectives that expose the agent to diverse compression levels. Across long-context multi-hop and single-hop question-answering benchmarks, MemOCR outperforms strong text-based baselines and achieves more effective context utilization under extreme budgets.

TL;DR: ScaleSim: A memory-efficient LLM serving system for large-scale multi-agent simulations that uses invocation distance to enable proactive prefetching and priority-based eviction, achieving 1.74x speedup over SGLang.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based multi-agent simulations face scalability challenges due to GPU memory pressure, as each agent maintains private GPU-resident states (models, prefix caches, adapters) that quickly exhaust device memory as agent count grows.

Method: Identifies two key workload properties: sparse agent activation and estimable agent invocation order. Introduces "invocation distance" as a unified abstraction to estimate relative order of future LLM requests. Uses this for proactive prefetching and priority-based eviction, with modular interface for diverse agent-specific memory.

Result: Achieves up to 1.74x speedup over SGLang on simulation benchmarks.

Conclusion: ScaleSim provides an effective solution for scaling LLM-based multi-agent simulations by addressing GPU memory limitations through intelligent memory management based on invocation patterns.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent simulations are increasingly adopted across application domains, but remain difficult to scale due to GPU memory pressure. Each agent maintains private GPU-resident states, including models, prefix caches, and adapters, which quickly exhaust device memory as the agent count grows. We identify two key properties of these workloads: sparse agent activation and an estimable agent invocation order. Based on an analysis of representative workload classes, we introduce invocation distance, a unified abstraction that estimates the relative order in which agents will issue future LLM requests. Leveraging this abstraction, we present ScaleSim, a memory-efficient LLM serving system for large-scale multi-agent simulations. ScaleSim enables proactive prefetching and priority-based eviction, supports diverse agent-specific memory through a modular interface, and achieves up to 1.74x speedup over SGLang on simulation benchmarks.

TL;DR: PoLR is a compute-efficient inference method that clusters reasoning trace prefixes to identify dominant paths, reducing token usage by up to 60% and latency by 50% while maintaining Self-Consistency accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning methods like Self-Consistency are computationally expensive as they fully expand all reasoning traces, creating a need for more efficient inference strategies.

Method: PoLR clusters short prefixes of reasoning traces, identifies the dominant cluster, and expands only paths in that cluster, leveraging prefix consistency to predict final correctness.

Result: PoLR matches or exceeds Self-Consistency accuracy across multiple benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH500, AIME24/25, GPQA-DIAMOND) while reducing token usage by up to 60% and wall-clock latency by up to 50%.

Conclusion: PoLR provides a practical, drop-in solution for making Self-Consistency more efficient and scalable without model fine-tuning, and is complementary to other adaptive inference methods.

Abstract: Large language models achieve strong reasoning performance, but inference strategies such as Self-Consistency (SC) are computationally expensive, as they fully expand all reasoning traces. We introduce PoLR (Path of Least Resistance), the first inference-time method to leverage prefix consistency for compute-efficient reasoning. PoLR clusters short prefixes of reasoning traces, identifies the dominant cluster, and expands all paths in that cluster, preserving the accuracy benefits of SC while substantially reducing token usage and latency. Our theoretical analysis, framed via mutual information and entropy, explains why early reasoning steps encode strong signals predictive of final correctness. Empirically, PoLR consistently matches or exceeds SC across GSM8K, MATH500, AIME24/25, and GPQA-DIAMOND, reducing token usage by up to 60% and wall-clock latency by up to 50%. Moreover, PoLR is fully complementary to adaptive inference methods (e.g., Adaptive Consistency, Early-Stopping SC) and can serve as a drop-in pre-filter, making SC substantially more efficient and scalable without requiring model fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have high energy costs due to quadratic attention and dense FFN operations, creating need for more efficient architectures.

Method: Two-stage MAR framework: 1) integrates State Space Models for linear-time sequence modeling, 2) applies activation sparsification to reduce FFN costs, plus ATMN neurons and SBDS distillation for SNN-SSM integration.

Result: MAR restores dense counterpart performance under constrained resources while substantially reducing inference energy consumption, outperforming efficient models of comparable/larger scale.

Conclusion: MAR shows potential for building efficient and practical LLMs by addressing energy efficiency challenges through architectural refinements and novel integration techniques.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel across diverse domains but suffer from high energy costs due to quadratic attention and dense Feed-Forward Network (FFN) operations. To address these issues, we propose Module-aware Architecture Refinement (MAR), a two-stage framework that integrates State Space Models (SSMs) for linear-time sequence modeling and applies activation sparsification to reduce FFN costs. In addition, to mitigate low information density and temporal mismatch in integrating Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with SSMs, we design the Adaptive Ternary Multi-step Neuron (ATMN) and the Spike-aware Bidirectional Distillation Strategy (SBDS). Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAR effectively restores the performance of its dense counterpart under constrained resources while substantially reducing inference energy consumption. Furthermore, it outperforms efficient models of comparable or even larger scale, underscoring its potential for building efficient and practical LLMs.

TL;DR: First human evaluation of activation steering for emotional tone control in LLMs shows strong alignment between human and model ratings, with moderate steering strengths effectively amplifying target emotions while preserving text quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need lightweight methods to control LLM behavior at inference time for alignment with human abilities and safety requirements, moving beyond prompt engineering and fine-tuning.

Method: Used activation steering to modify internal activations for emotional tone control; conducted first human evaluation with over 7,000 crowd-sourced ratings from 190 participants; compared human vs model-based quality ratings; tested different steering strengths and emotional dimensions.

Result: Strong alignment between human and model quality ratings (mean r=0.776); moderate steering strengths (λ≈0.15) reliably amplify target emotions while preserving comprehensibility; strongest effects for disgust (η_p²=0.616) and fear (η_p²=0.540); minimal effects for surprise (η_p²=0.042); LlaMA-3 showed more consistent steering than Alpaca; high inter-rater reliability (ICC=0.71-0.87).

Conclusion: Activation-based control is a scalable method for steering LLM behavior across affective dimensions, with human evaluation validating its effectiveness for emotional tone manipulation while maintaining text quality.

Abstract: Controlling the behavior of large language models (LLMs) at inference time is essential for aligning outputs with human abilities and safety requirements. \emph{Activation steering} provides a lightweight alternative to prompt engineering and fine-tuning by directly modifying internal activations to guide generation. This research advances the literature in three significant directions. First, while previous work demonstrated the technical feasibility of steering emotional tone using automated classifiers, this paper presents the first human evaluation of activation steering concerning the emotional tone of LLM outputs, collecting over 7,000 crowd-sourced ratings from 190 participants via Prolific ($n=190$). These ratings assess both perceived emotional intensity and overall text quality. Second, we find strong alignment between human and model-based quality ratings (mean $r=0.776$, range $0.157$--$0.985$), indicating automatic scoring can proxy perceived quality. Moderate steering strengths ($λ\approx 0.15$) reliably amplify target emotions while preserving comprehensibility, with the strongest effects for disgust ($η_p^2 = 0.616$) and fear ($η_p^2 = 0.540$), and minimal effects for surprise ($η_p^2 = 0.042$). Finally, upgrading from Alpaca to LlaMA-3 yielded more consistent steering with significant effects across emotions and strengths (all $p < 0.001$). Inter-rater reliability was high (ICC $= 0.71$--$0.87$), underscoring the robustness of the findings. These findings support activation-based control as a scalable method for steering LLM behavior across affective dimensions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLaMEA-SAGE enhances automated algorithm design by using code structure features from ASTs to guide LLM-based evolution, achieving faster convergence and superior performance compared to vanilla LLaMEA and state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evolutionary frameworks like LLaMEA rely solely on fitness feedback, leaving valuable information in generated code unused. There's a need to leverage code structure features to better guide algorithm design and bridge the gap between code structure and performance feedback.

Method: Proposes LLaMEA-SAGE which extracts graph-theoretic and complexity features from abstract syntax trees of generated algorithms. Uses explainable AI to identify performance-affecting features, translates them into natural-language mutation instructions, and integrates this feature-driven guidance into LLaMEA's LLM-based code generation.

Result: In controlled experiments, achieves same performance faster than vanilla LLaMEA. In larger-scale MA-BBOB suite experiments, demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art automated algorithm design methods.

Conclusion: Code-derived signals can effectively bias LLM-driven algorithm evolution, bridging the gap between code structure and human-understandable performance feedback in automated algorithm design.

Abstract: Large language models have enabled automated algorithm design (AAD) by generating optimization algorithms directly from natural-language prompts. While evolutionary frameworks such as LLaMEA demonstrate strong exploratory capabilities across the algorithm design space, their search dynamics are entirely driven by fitness feedback, leaving substantial information about the generated code unused. We propose a mechanism for guiding AAD using feedback constructed from graph-theoretic and complexity features extracted from the abstract syntax trees of the generated algorithms, based on a surrogate model learned over an archive of evaluated solutions. Using explainable AI techniques, we identify features that substantially affect performance and translate them into natural-language mutation instructions that steer subsequent LLM-based code generation without restricting expressivity.
  We propose LLaMEA-SAGE, which integrates this feature-driven guidance into LLaMEA, and evaluate it across several benchmarks. We show that the proposed structured guidance achieves the same performance faster than vanilla LLaMEA in a small controlled experiment. In a larger-scale experiment using the MA-BBOB suite from the GECCO-MA-BBOB competition, our guided approach achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art AAD methods. These results demonstrate that signals derived from code can effectively bias LLM-driven algorithm evolution, bridging the gap between code structure and human-understandable performance feedback in automated algorithm design.

TL;DR: KAPSO is a modular framework for autonomous program synthesis and optimization that uses synthesis as an operator within an iterative optimization loop rather than as an endpoint.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address long-horizon failures in coding agents including lost experimental state, brittle debugging, and weak reuse of domain expertise by creating a systematic approach to program improvement.

Method: Three tightly coupled components: 1) git-native experimentation engine for reproducible artifacts and provenance, 2) knowledge system for organizing heterogeneous sources into structured representations, and 3) cognitive memory layer for coordinating retrieval and maintaining episodic lessons from experiment traces.

Result: Evaluated on MLE-Bench (Kaggle-style ML competitions) and ALE-Bench (AtCoder heuristic optimization) with end-to-end performance reported.

Conclusion: KAPSO provides a comprehensive framework for autonomous program synthesis and optimization that addresses key limitations of current coding agents through integrated experimentation, knowledge management, and learning components.

Abstract: We introduce KAPSO, a modular framework for autonomous program synthesis and optimization. Given a natural language goal and an evaluation method, KAPSO iteratively performs ideation, code synthesis and editing, execution, evaluation, and learning to improve a runnable artifact toward measurable objectives. Rather than treating synthesis as the endpoint, KAPSO uses synthesis as an operator within a long-horizon optimization loop, where progress is defined by evaluator outcomes.
  KAPSO targets long-horizon failures common in coding agents, including lost experimental state, brittle debugging, and weak reuse of domain expertise, by integrating three tightly coupled components. First, a git-native experimentation engine isolates each attempt as a branch, producing reproducible artifacts and preserving provenance across iterations. Second, a knowledge system ingests heterogeneous sources, including repositories, internal playbooks, and curated external resources such as documentation, scientific papers, and web search results, and organizes them into a structured representation that supports retrieval over workflows, implementations, and environment constraints. Third, a cognitive memory layer coordinates retrieval and maintains an episodic store of reusable lessons distilled from experiment traces (run logs, diffs, and evaluator feedback), reducing repeated error modes and accelerating convergence.
  We evaluated KAPSO on MLE-Bench (Kaggle-style ML competitions) and ALE-Bench (AtCoder heuristic optimization), and report end-to-end performance.

*Youngjin Jin,Hanna Kim,Kwanwoo Kim,Chanhee Lee,Seungwon Shin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARGORA organizes multi-expert LLM discussions into explicit argumentation graphs, enabling causal analysis of which arguments drive decisions and providing correction mechanisms when reasoning conflicts with external judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-expert LLM systems combine diverse perspectives through simple aggregation, which obscures which specific arguments actually drove the final decision. There's a need for more transparent reasoning that shows the argumentative structure behind decisions.

Method: ARGORA organizes multi-expert discussions into explicit argumentation graphs showing support/attack relationships between arguments. It casts these graphs as causal models to systematically remove arguments and recompute outcomes, identifying necessary reasoning chains. It also includes a correction mechanism to align internal reasoning with external judgments when they disagree.

Result: ARGORA achieves competitive accuracy across diverse benchmarks and demonstrates corrective behavior: when experts initially disagree, it resolves disputes toward correct answers more often than introducing new errors, while providing causal diagnostics of decisive arguments.

Conclusion: ARGORA provides a framework for transparent multi-expert reasoning that goes beyond simple aggregation, offering explicit argumentation structures, causal analysis of decision drivers, and mechanisms for correcting reasoning misalignments with external judgments.

Abstract: Existing multi-expert LLM systems gather diverse perspectives but combine them through simple aggregation, obscuring which arguments drove the final decision. We introduce ARGORA, a framework that organizes multi-expert discussions into explicit argumentation graphs showing which arguments support or attack each other. By casting these graphs as causal models, ARGORA can systematically remove individual arguments and recompute outcomes, identifying which reasoning chains were necessary and whether decisions would change under targeted modifications. We further introduce a correction mechanism that aligns internal reasoning with external judgments when they disagree. Across diverse benchmarks and an open-ended use case, ARGORA achieves competitive accuracy and demonstrates corrective behavior: when experts initially disagree, the framework resolves disputes toward correct answers more often than it introduces new errors, while providing causal diagnostics of decisive arguments.

### [151] [ShardMemo: Masked MoE Routing for Sharded Agentic LLM Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21545)
*Yang Zhao,Chengxiao Dai,Yue Xiu,Mengying Kou,Yuliang Zheng,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ShardMemo is a tiered memory service for agentic LLM systems that uses sharded evidence with scope-before-routing constraints and MoE-style routing to improve efficiency and performance over centralized memory approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agentic LLM systems face bottlenecks with centralized memory indexes and heuristic partitions as memory volume and parallel access grow, limiting scalability and performance for long-horizon tasks.

Method: Three-tier memory architecture: Tier A (per-agent working state), Tier B (sharded evidence with local ANN indexes and scope-before-routing constraints), Tier C (versioned skill library). Uses masked MoE routing with eligibility constraints, probing B_probe shards via Top-B_probe or adaptive Top-P, with cost-aware gating over shard families.

Result: On LoCoMo: +5.11 to +6.82 F1 improvement over GAM baseline. With B_probe=3: +6.87 F1 over cosine-to-prototype routing, 20.5% reduction in retrieval work (VecScan 521→414), p95 latency reduction (95→76 ms). On HotpotQA: 63.41/61.88/57.95 F1 at 56K/224K/448K tokens. On ToolBench: Tier C achieves 0.97 Precision@3 and 1.94 StepRed (+10.2% and +7.2% over embedding-similarity retrieval).

Conclusion: ShardMemo demonstrates that structured tiered memory with scope-before-routing constraints and MoE-style routing significantly improves agentic LLM system performance, reducing retrieval work and latency while maintaining high accuracy across various benchmarks and token lengths.

Abstract: Agentic large language model (LLM) systems rely on external memory for long-horizon state and concurrent multi-agent execution, but centralized indexes and heuristic partitions become bottlenecks as memory volume and parallel access grow. We present ShardMemo, a budgeted tiered memory service with Tier A per-agent working state, Tier B sharded evidence with shard-local approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) indexes, and Tier C, a versioned skill library. Tier B enforces scope-before-routing: structured eligibility constraints mask ineligible shards before routing or ANN search. We cast shard probing as masked mixture-of-experts (MoE) routing over eligible shards, probing up to $B_{\mathrm{probe}}$ shards via Top-$B_{\mathrm{probe}}$ or adaptive Top-$P$, and use cost-aware gating over profile/observation/session shard families; the router is trained from evidence-to-shard supervision. On LoCoMo, ShardMemo improves over the strongest baseline (GAM) by +5.11 to +6.82 F1 across question categories. Under a fixed-budget routing setting ($B_{\mathrm{probe}}=3$), ShardMemo improves over cosine-to-prototype shard routing by +6.87 F1 while reducing retrieval work (VecScan 521->414, -20.5%) and p95 latency (95->76 ms). On long-context HotpotQA, ShardMemo achieves 63.41/61.88/57.95 F1 at 56K/224K/448K tokens. On ToolBench, Tier C reaches 0.97 Precision@3 and 1.94 StepRed (+10.2% and +7.2% over embedding-similarity retrieval).

*Haoran Ye,Xuning He,Vincent Arak,Haonan Dong,Guojie Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Meta Context Engineering (MCE) is a bi-level framework that co-evolves context engineering skills and context artifacts through agentic crossover, outperforming static CE methods by 5.6-53.8% across diverse domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Context Engineering methods rely on manually crafted harnesses with rigid workflows and predefined schemas, imposing structural biases and limiting optimization to narrow, intuition-bound design spaces.

Method: MCE uses a bi-level framework: a meta-level agent refines engineering skills via agentic crossover (deliberative search over skill history, executions, and evaluations), while a base-level agent executes skills, learns from training rollouts, and optimizes context as flexible files and code.

Result: MCE achieves 5.6-53.8% relative improvement over state-of-the-art agentic CE methods (mean 16.9%) across five disparate domains in offline and online settings, with superior context adaptability, transferability, and efficiency.

Conclusion: MCE successfully addresses limitations of static CE methods by co-evolving engineering skills and context artifacts, demonstrating consistent performance gains and superior adaptability across diverse domains.

Abstract: The operational efficacy of large language models relies heavily on their inference-time context. This has established Context Engineering (CE) as a formal discipline for optimizing these inputs. Current CE methods rely on manually crafted harnesses, such as rigid generation-reflection workflows and predefined context schemas. They impose structural biases and restrict context optimization to a narrow, intuition-bound design space. To address this, we introduce Meta Context Engineering (MCE), a bi-level framework that supersedes static CE heuristics by co-evolving CE skills and context artifacts. In MCE iterations, a meta-level agent refines engineering skills via agentic crossover, a deliberative search over the history of skills, their executions, and evaluations. A base-level agent executes these skills, learns from training rollouts, and optimizes context as flexible files and code. We evaluate MCE across five disparate domains under offline and online settings. MCE demonstrates consistent performance gains, achieving 5.6--53.8% relative improvement over state-of-the-art agentic CE methods (mean of 16.9%), while maintaining superior context adaptability, transferability, and efficiency in both context usage and training.

*Juncai Li,Ru Li,Yuxiang Zhou,Boxiang Ma,Jeff Z. Pan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ALiCoT framework overcomes exponential signal decay in implicit CoT compression by aligning latent states with intermediate reasoning, achieving 54.4x speedup while maintaining performance comparable to explicit CoT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought reasoning incurs high computational costs due to extra token generation. Implicit CoT compression offers token efficiency but lacks theoretical understanding of why learning intermediate reasoning steps is difficult.

Method: Introduces Order-r Interaction theory showing learning signals for high-order logical dependencies exponentially decay. Proposes ALiCoT framework that aligns latent token distributions with intermediate reasoning states to overcome signal decay.

Result: ALiCoT achieves 54.4x speedup while maintaining performance comparable to explicit CoT. Validated on NatBool-DAG benchmark designed to enforce irreducible logical reasoning.

Conclusion: Theoretical analysis reveals fundamental barriers in implicit CoT compression, and ALiCoT provides an effective solution by aligning latent states with intermediate reasoning steps, enabling efficient reasoning without performance loss.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has unlocked advanced reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with intermediate steps, yet incurs prohibitive computational costs due to generation of extra tokens. Recent studies empirically show that compressing reasoning steps into latent states, or implicit CoT compression, offers a token-efficient alternative. However, the mechanism behind CoT compression remains unclear. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis of the difficulty of learning to internalize intermediate reasoning steps. By introducing Order-r Interaction, we prove that the learning signal for high-order logical dependencies exponentially decays to solve irreducible problem, where skipping intermediate steps inevitably leads to high-order interaction barriers. To empirically validate this, we introduce NatBool-DAG, a challenging benchmark designed to enforce irreducible logical reasoning and eliminate semantic shortcuts. Guided by our theoretical findings, we propose ALiCoT (Aligned Implicit CoT), a novel framework that overcomes the signal decay by aligning latent token distributions with intermediate reasoning states. Experimental results demonstrate that ALiCoT successfully unlocks efficient reasoning: it achieves a 54.4x speedup while maintaining performance comparable to explicit CoT.

*Jonas Knupp,Jan Hendrik Metzen,Jeremias Bohn,Georg Groh,Kristian Kersting*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Dreamer framework combines depth-recurrent attention mixtures to overcome hidden-size bottlenecks in latent reasoning, achieving better efficiency and performance than matched baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior depth-recurrent models lack proper baselines, underutilize depth-recurrence due to fixed layer stacks, and suffer from constant hidden-size bottlenecks that limit many-step latent reasoning.

Method: Introduces Dreamer framework with depth-recurrent attention mixtures combining sequence attention, depth attention, and sparse expert attention to alleviate hidden-size bottlenecks and decouple scaling dimensions.

Result: Models require 2-8x fewer training tokens for same accuracy as FLOP/parameter/memory-matched SOTA, outperform ~2x larger SOTA models with same training tokens, and show 2-11x larger expert selection diversity than SOTA MoEs.

Conclusion: Dreamer enables efficient scaling of depth-recurrent models for latent reasoning by addressing hidden-size bottlenecks through attention along depth and modular attention mixtures.

Abstract: Depth-recurrence facilitates latent reasoning by sharing parameters across depths. However, prior work lacks combined FLOP-, parameter-, and memory-matched baselines, underutilizes depth-recurrence due to partially fixed layer stacks, and ignores the bottleneck of constant hidden-sizes that restricts many-step latent reasoning. To address this, we introduce a modular framework of depth-recurrent attention mixtures (Dreamer), combining sequence attention, depth attention, and sparse expert attention. It alleviates the hidden-size bottleneck through attention along depth, decouples scaling dimensions, and allows depth-recurrent models to scale efficiently and effectively. Across language reasoning benchmarks, our models require 2 to 8x fewer training tokens for the same accuracy as FLOP-, parameter-, and memory-matched SOTA, and outperform ca. 2x larger SOTA models with the same training tokens. We further present insights into knowledge usage across depths, e.g., showing 2 to 11x larger expert selection diversity than SOTA MoEs.

### [155] [Beyond Imitation: Reinforcement Learning for Active Latent Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21598)
*Zhi Zheng,Wee Sun Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ATP-Latent improves latent reasoning by using conditional VAE for smoother latent space and RL with coherence rewards, achieving better accuracy with fewer tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current latent reasoning methods passively imitate arbitrary CoT labels, leading to inferior representations and reasoning policies that undermine planning ability and create gaps between training and testing.

Method: ATP-Latent models latent token supervision as conditional VAE for smoother latent space, then uses RL with auxiliary coherence reward based on consistency between VAE-decoded contents.

Result: On LLaMA-1B, ATP-Latent achieves +4.1% accuracy and -3.3% tokens on four benchmarks compared to advanced baselines.

Conclusion: Active planning over latent token representation space is crucial for optimal latent reasoning, and ATP-Latent effectively achieves this through VAE modeling and guided RL with coherence rewards.

Abstract: Aiming at efficient and dense chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, latent reasoning methods fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) to substitute discrete language tokens with continuous latent tokens. These methods consume fewer tokens compared to the conventional language CoT reasoning and have the potential to plan in a dense latent space. However, current latent tokens are generally supervised based on imitating language labels. Considering that there can be multiple equivalent but diverse CoT labels for a question, passively imitating an arbitrary one may lead to inferior latent token representations and latent reasoning policies, undermining the potential planning ability and resulting in clear gaps between training and testing. In this work, we emphasize the importance of active planning over the representation space of latent tokens in achieving the optimal latent reasoning policy. So, we propose the \underline{A}c\underline{t}ive Latent \underline{P}lanning method (ATP-Latent), which models the supervision process of latent tokens as a conditional variational auto-encoder (VAE) to obtain a smoother latent space. Moreover, to facilitate the most reasonable latent reasoning policy, ATP-Latent conducts reinforcement learning (RL) with an auxiliary coherence reward, which is calculated based on the consistency between VAE-decoded contents of latent tokens, enabling a guided RL process. In experiments on LLaMA-1B, ATP-Latent demonstrates +4.1\% accuracy and -3.3\% tokens on four benchmarks compared to advanced baselines.

### [156] [CORE: Collaborative Reasoning via Cross Teaching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21600)
*Kshitij Mishra,Mirat Aubakirov,Martin Takac,Nils Lukas,Salem Lahlou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CORE is a training-time collaboration framework where LLMs teach each other through cross-teaching, achieving significant reasoning improvements without scaling model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models exhibit complementary reasoning errors - different models fail on different instances, suggesting that collaborative learning could leverage these differences to improve overall performance.

Method: CORE uses a two-stage process: 1) cold round of independent sampling, 2) contexted rescue round where failing models receive hints from successful peers. It optimizes a combined reward balancing correctness, diversity (DPP-inspired), and rescue bonuses.

Result: With only 1,000 training examples, a 3B+4B model pair achieved Pass@2 of 99.54% on GSM8K and 92.08% on MATH, significantly outperforming single-model training (82.50% and 74.82%). On harder datasets, achieved 77.34% on GPQA and 79.65% on AIME with minimal training budgets.

Conclusion: Training-time collaboration can reliably convert model complementarity into substantial performance gains without increasing model size, demonstrating the effectiveness of cross-teaching protocols in leveraging diverse reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models exhibit complementary reasoning errors: on the same instance, one model may succeed with a particular decomposition while another fails. We propose Collaborative Reasoning (CORE), a training-time collaboration framework that converts peer success into a learning signal via a cross-teaching protocol. Each problem is solved in two stages: a cold round of independent sampling, followed by a contexted rescue round in which models that failed receive hint extracted from a successful peer. CORE optimizes a combined reward that balances (i) correctness, (ii) a lightweight DPP-inspired diversity term to reduce error overlap, and (iii) an explicit rescue bonus for successful recovery. We evaluate CORE across four standard reasoning datasets GSM8K, MATH, AIME, and GPQA. With only 1,000 training examples, a pair of small open source models (3B+4B) reaches Pass@2 of 99.54% on GSM8K and 92.08% on MATH, compared to 82.50% and 74.82% for single-model training. On harder datasets, the 3B+4B pair reaches Pass@2 of 77.34% on GPQA (trained on 348 examples) and 79.65% on AIME (trained on 792 examples), using a training-time budget of at most 1536 context tokens and 3072 generated tokens. Overall, these results show that training-time collaboration can reliably convert model complementarity into large gains without scaling model size.

*Saisubramaniam Gopalakrishnan,Harikrishnan P M,Dagnachew Birru*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a search-based testing approach for Intelligent Document Processing systems that uses multiple search strategies to discover diverse failure types, showing that no single strategy dominates and portfolio approaches are needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprise IDP systems in high-stakes domains need early validation under limited budgets, requiring discovery of diverse failure mechanisms rather than just worst-case documents.

Method: Formalizes as SBST problem, operates on combinatorial document configuration space, benchmarks diverse search strategies (evolutionary, swarm-based, quality-diversity, learning-based, quantum) under fixed budget constraints.

Result: Different solvers consistently uncover unique failure modes; cross-temporal analysis shows persistent solver-specific discoveries with no single strategy dominating; union of all solvers eventually covers failure space.

Conclusion: Demonstrates intrinsic solver complementarity and motivates portfolio-based SBST strategies for robust industrial IDP validation, as reliance on any single method delays discovery of important risks.

Abstract: Enterprise-grade Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) systems support high-stakes workflows across finance, insurance, and healthcare. Early-phase system validation under limited budgets mandates uncovering diverse failure mechanisms, rather than identifying a single worst-case document. We formalize this challenge as a Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) problem, aiming to identify complex interactions between document variables, with the objective to maximize the number of distinct failure types discovered within a fixed evaluation budget. Our methodology operates on a combinatorial space of document configurations, rendering instances of structural \emph{risk features} to induce realistic failure conditions. We benchmark a diverse portfolio of search strategies spanning evolutionary, swarm-based, quality-diversity, learning-based, and quantum under identical budget constraints. Through configuration-level exclusivity, win-rate, and cross-temporal overlap analyses, we show that different solvers consistently uncover failure modes that remain undiscovered by specific alternatives at comparable budgets. Crucially, cross-temporal analysis reveals persistent solver-specific discoveries across all evaluated budgets, with no single strategy exhibiting absolute dominance. While the union of all solvers eventually recovers the observed failure space, reliance on any individual method systematically delays the discovery of important risks. These results demonstrate intrinsic solver complementarity and motivate portfolio-based SBST strategies for robust industrial IDP validation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RecNet is a self-evolving preference propagation framework that proactively propagates real-time preference updates across users and items using router agents and personalized reception mechanisms, with continuous optimization through feedback-driven reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based recommender systems only model preference changes from sparse, noisy explicit interactions, failing to capture real-time mutual influences among users and items, creating a need for proactive preference propagation.

Method: Two-phase framework: 1) Forward phase with centralized preference routing (router agents integrate and propagate updates) and personalized preference reception (message buffer + rule-based filter memory); 2) Backward phase with feedback-driven optimization using multi-agent reinforcement learning with LLMs for credit assignment and module-level updates.

Result: Extensive experiments across various scenarios demonstrate RecNet's effectiveness in modeling preference propagation for recommender systems, showing improved performance over existing methods.

Conclusion: RecNet successfully addresses limitations of existing approaches by enabling proactive, real-time preference propagation with self-evolving optimization, representing an advancement in agentic recommender systems.

Abstract: Agentic recommender systems leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to model complex user behaviors and support personalized decision-making. However, existing methods primarily model preference changes based on explicit user-item interactions, which are sparse, noisy, and unable to reflect the real-time, mutual influences among users and items. To address these limitations, we propose RecNet, a self-evolving preference propagation framework that proactively propagates real-time preference updates across related users and items. RecNet consists of two complementary phases. In the forward phase, the centralized preference routing mechanism leverages router agents to integrate preference updates and dynamically propagate them to the most relevant agents. To ensure accurate and personalized integration of propagated preferences, we further introduce a personalized preference reception mechanism, which combines a message buffer for temporary caching and an optimizable, rule-based filter memory to guide selective preference assimilation based on past experience and interests. In the backward phase, the feedback-driven propagation optimization mechanism simulates a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, using LLMs for credit assignment, gradient analysis, and module-level optimization, enabling continuous self-evolution of propagation strategies. Extensive experiments on various scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of RecNet in modeling preference propagation for recommender systems.

*Martiño Ríos-García,Nawaf Alampara,Kevin Maik Jablonka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show significant accuracy variation (over 40%) in simple counting tasks depending solely on what semantic category is being counted, revealing they don't implement invariant algorithms but argument-dependent approximations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether algorithms in LLMs are truly invariant to semantic content of arguments, unlike prior work that conflates semantic sensitivity with reasoning complexity or prompt variation.

Method: Introduces WhatCounts - an atomic test that isolates semantic sensitivity by having models count items in unambiguous, delimited lists with no duplicates, distractors, or reasoning steps across different semantic types (cities vs chemicals, names vs symbols).

Result: Frontier LLMs show over 40% accuracy variation depending solely on what is being counted. Controlled ablations rule out confounds, and the semantic gap shifts unpredictably with small amounts of unrelated fine-tuning.

Conclusion: LLMs do not implement invariant algorithms but approximate them in argument-dependent ways, creating hidden dependencies on input meaning that affects not just counting but potentially any LLM function.

Abstract: Counting should not depend on what is being counted; more generally, any algorithm's behavior should be invariant to the semantic content of its arguments. We introduce WhatCounts to test this property in isolation. Unlike prior work that conflates semantic sensitivity with reasoning complexity or prompt variation, WhatCounts is atomic: count items in an unambiguous, delimited list with no duplicates, distractors, or reasoning steps for different semantic types. Frontier LLMs show over 40% accuracy variation depending solely on what is being counted - cities versus chemicals, names versus symbols. Controlled ablations rule out confounds. The gap is semantic, and it shifts unpredictably with small amounts of unrelated fine-tuning. LLMs do not implement algorithms; they approximate them, and the approximation is argument-dependent. As we show with an agentic example, this has implications beyond counting: any LLM function may carry hidden dependencies on the meaning of its inputs.

Motivation: Current evaluation of tool-augmented LLM research workflows suffers from non-determinism due to live API dependencies (temporal drift, rate limiting, evolving backend states), which undermines reproducibility and invalidates cross-system comparisons.

Method: ScholarGym decouples workflow components into query planning, tool invocation, and relevance assessment, using a static corpus of 570K papers with deterministic retrieval and 2,536 expert-annotated queries for controlled evaluation.

Result: The environment enables fine-grained analysis of workflow stages and reveals how reasoning capabilities, planning strategies, and selection mechanisms interact over iterative refinement across diverse backbone models.

Conclusion: ScholarGym provides a reproducible framework for evaluating deep research workflows, addressing the fundamental challenge of non-determinism in tool-augmented LLM evaluations through controlled simulation.

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models have advanced from single-turn question answering to deep research workflows that iteratively plan queries, invoke external tools, and synthesize information to address complex information needs. Evaluating such workflows presents a fundamental challenge: reliance on live APIs introduces non-determinism, as tool invocations may yield different results across runs due to temporal drift, rate limiting, and evolving backend states. This variance undermines reproducibility and invalidates cross-system comparisons.

Motivation: Most prior MLLM research focuses on static image understanding, leaving sequential audio-video processing underexplored. There's a need for high-quality benchmarks to systematically evaluate MLLM performance in real-world settings.

Method: Created SONIC-O1 benchmark with 4,958 human-verified annotations across 13 conversational domains, including demographic metadata. Evaluates MLLMs on open-ended summarization, multiple-choice question answering, and temporal localization with reasoning rationales.

Result: Experiments show limitations: while MCQ accuracy gap between model families is small, there's a substantial 22.6% performance difference in temporal localization between best closed-source and open-source models. Performance degrades across demographic groups, indicating persistent disparities.

Conclusion: SONIC-O1 provides an open evaluation suite for temporally grounded and socially robust multimodal understanding, released for reproducibility and research with dataset, code, and leaderboard.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are a major focus of recent AI research. However, most prior work focuses on static image understanding, while their ability to process sequential audio-video data remains underexplored. This gap highlights the need for a high-quality benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLM performance in a real-world setting. We introduce SONIC-O1, a comprehensive, fully human-verified benchmark spanning 13 real-world conversational domains with 4,958 annotations and demographic metadata. SONIC-O1 evaluates MLLMs on key tasks, including open-ended summarization, multiple-choice question (MCQ) answering, and temporal localization with supporting rationales (reasoning). Experiments on closed- and open-source models reveal limitations. While the performance gap in MCQ accuracy between two model families is relatively small, we observe a substantial 22.6% performance difference in temporal localization between the best performing closed-source and open-source models. Performance further degrades across demographic groups, indicating persistent disparities in model behavior.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TCAP is an unsupervised defense framework that detects backdoor attacks in MLLMs by analyzing attention allocation divergence across system instructions, vision inputs, and user queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FTaaS enables MLLM customization but introduces backdoor risks via poisoned data, and existing defenses either need supervision or fail to generalize across diverse triggers and modalities.

Method: Tri-Component Attention Profiling (TCAP) decomposes cross-modal attention maps into three components, identifies trigger-responsive attention heads via GMM statistical profiling, and isolates poisoned samples through EM-based vote aggregation.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse MLLM architectures and attack methods show TCAP achieves consistently strong performance as a robust backdoor defense.

Conclusion: TCAP establishes itself as a practical, unsupervised defense framework that effectively filters backdoor samples in MLLMs by leveraging universal attention allocation divergence patterns.

Abstract: Fine-Tuning-as-a-Service (FTaaS) facilitates the customization of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) but introduces critical backdoor risks via poisoned data. Existing defenses either rely on supervised signals or fail to generalize across diverse trigger types and modalities. In this work, we uncover a universal backdoor fingerprint-attention allocation divergence-where poisoned samples disrupt the balanced attention distribution across three functional components: system instructions, vision inputs, and user textual queries, regardless of trigger morphology. Motivated by this insight, we propose Tri-Component Attention Profiling (TCAP), an unsupervised defense framework to filter backdoor samples. TCAP decomposes cross-modal attention maps into the three components, identifies trigger-responsive attention heads via Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) statistical profiling, and isolates poisoned samples through EM-based vote aggregation. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLM architectures and attack methods demonstrate that TCAP achieves consistently strong performance, establishing it as a robust and practical backdoor defense in MLLMs.

TL;DR: FBS Transformer introduces trainable preview/skimming mechanisms for LLMs that improve inference efficiency without adding parameters, using parafoveal attention, chunk-aware compute allocation, and skip gating.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM inference relies on inefficient token-by-token autoregression, missing human-like reading strategies such as content-adaptive foresight, chunk-structure-aware compute allocation, and consistent train-test preview/skimming mechanisms.

Method: Proposes Fovea-Block-Skip Transformer with three modules: Parafovea-Attention Window (PAW) for causal preview, Chunk-Head (CH) for chunk-aware compute allocation, and Skip-Gate (SG) for adaptive skipping, injecting a trainable loop into Transformers.

Result: FBS improves quality-efficiency trade-off across diverse benchmarks without increasing parameters, with ablations showing the three modules are complementary.

Conclusion: The FBS Transformer successfully incorporates human-like reading strategies into LLM architecture, demonstrating that trainable preview/skimming mechanisms can significantly enhance inference efficiency while maintaining quality.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across many tasks, yet inference is still dominated by strictly token-by-token autoregression. Existing acceleration methods largely patch this pipeline and miss core human-reading ingredients: content-adaptive foresight, chunk-structure-aware compute allocation, and train--test consistency for preview/skimming. We propose the \textbf{Fovea-Block-Skip Transformer} (FBS), which injects a causal, trainable loop into Transformers via Parafovea-Attention Window (PAW), Chunk-Head (CH), and Skip-Gate (SG). Across diverse benchmarks, FBS improves the quality-efficiency trade-off without increasing parameters, and ablations show the three modules are complementary.

Motivation: Current memory preprocessing methods for LLM agents suffer from destructive de-contextualization by compressing sequential dependencies into pre-defined structures, which severs contextual integrity essential for deep System~2 reasoning.

Method: Proposes E-mem framework with heterogeneous hierarchical architecture: multiple assistant agents maintain uncompressed memory contexts while a central master agent orchestrates global planning; assistants locally reason within activated segments to extract context-aware evidence before aggregation.

Result: On LoCoMo benchmark, E-mem achieves over 54% F1, surpassing state-of-the-art GAM by 7.75%, while reducing token cost by over 70%.

Conclusion: E-mem's episodic context reconstruction approach effectively addresses the de-contextualization problem in memory preprocessing, enabling better logical integrity for LLM agents' System~2 reasoning while being more efficient.

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) agents towards System~2 reasoning, characterized by deliberative, high-precision problem-solving, requires maintaining rigorous logical integrity over extended horizons. However, prevalent memory preprocessing paradigms suffer from destructive de-contextualization. By compressing complex sequential dependencies into pre-defined structures (e.g., embeddings or graphs), these methods sever the contextual integrity essential for deep reasoning. To address this, we propose E-mem, a framework shifting from Memory Preprocessing to Episodic Context Reconstruction. Inspired by biological engrams, E-mem employs a heterogeneous hierarchical architecture where multiple assistant agents maintain uncompressed memory contexts, while a central master agent orchestrates global planning. Unlike passive retrieval, our mechanism empowers assistants to locally reason within activated segments, extracting context-aware evidence before aggregation. Evaluations on the LoCoMo benchmark demonstrate that E-mem achieves over 54\% F1, surpassing the state-of-the-art GAM by 7.75\%, while reducing token cost by over 70\%.

TL;DR: DropoutTS is a model-agnostic plugin that improves deep time series model robustness to noise by adaptively calibrating learning capacity based on instance-level noise quantification, without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep time series models are vulnerable to noisy real-world data, and existing robustness strategies either prune data or rely on costly prior quantification, failing to balance effectiveness and efficiency.

Method: DropoutTS uses Sample-Adaptive Dropout mechanism that leverages spectral sparsity to efficiently quantify instance-level noise via reconstruction residuals, then dynamically maps noise to adaptive dropout rates to selectively suppress spurious fluctuations while preserving fine-grained fidelity.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse noise regimes and open benchmarks show DropoutTS consistently boosts superior backbones' performance, delivering advanced robustness with negligible parameter overhead and no architectural modifications.

Conclusion: DropoutTS provides an effective and efficient solution for improving time series model robustness to noise through adaptive dropout calibration, shifting the paradigm from "what" to learn to "how much" to learn.

Abstract: Deep time series models are vulnerable to noisy data ubiquitous in real-world applications. Existing robustness strategies either prune data or rely on costly prior quantification, failing to balance effectiveness and efficiency. In this paper, we introduce DropoutTS, a model-agnostic plugin that shifts the paradigm from "what" to learn to "how much" to learn. DropoutTS employs a Sample-Adaptive Dropout mechanism: leveraging spectral sparsity to efficiently quantify instance-level noise via reconstruction residuals, it dynamically calibrates model learning capacity by mapping noise to adaptive dropout rates - selectively suppressing spurious fluctuations while preserving fine-grained fidelity. Extensive experiments across diverse noise regimes and open benchmarks show DropoutTS consistently boosts superior backbones' performance, delivering advanced robustness with negligible parameter overhead and no architectural modifications.

TL;DR: ECL enables small LLMs to outperform much larger models by learning to identify reliable peers through historical interaction analysis


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent systems suffer from sycophancy and poor peer reliability assessment, causing agents to blindly follow misleading peers

Method: Epistemic Context Learning (ECL): formalizes history-aware reference, builds peer profiles from interaction history, and optimizes with reinforcement learning using auxiliary rewards

Result: Small 4B model outperforms 30B baseline; frontier models achieve near-perfect 100% performance; strong correlation between trust modeling accuracy and answer quality

Conclusion: ECL effectively addresses multi-agent sycophancy by enabling reliable peer identification through historical interaction analysis, with strong generalization across configurations

Abstract: Individual agents in multi-agent (MA) systems often lack robustness, tending to blindly conform to misleading peers. We show this weakness stems from both sycophancy and inadequate ability to evaluate peer reliability. To address this, we first formalize the learning problem of history-aware reference, introducing the historical interactions of peers as additional input, so that agents can estimate peer reliability and learn from trustworthy peers when uncertain. This shifts the task from evaluating peer reasoning quality to estimating peer reliability based on interaction history. We then develop Epistemic Context Learning (ECL): a reasoning framework that conditions predictions on explicitly-built peer profiles from history. We further optimize ECL by reinforcement learning using auxiliary rewards. Our experiments reveal that our ECL enables small models like Qwen 3-4B to outperform a history-agnostic baseline 8x its size (Qwen 3-30B) by accurately identifying reliable peers. ECL also boosts frontier models to near-perfect (100%) performance. We show that ECL generalizes well to various MA configurations and we find that trust is modeled well by LLMs, revealing a strong correlation in trust modeling accuracy and final answer quality.

TL;DR: SCOUT framework uses lightweight "scouts" to efficiently explore nonlinguistic environments, then bootstraps LLMs with collected data, achieving superior performance with 60% less GPU time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with unseen nonlinguistic environments due to prohibitive exploration costs - extensive trial-and-error is computationally unsustainable for large models in high-dimensional semantic spaces.

Method: SCOUT decouples exploration from exploitation: lightweight scouts (small MLPs) probe environmental dynamics efficiently, collected trajectories bootstrap LLMs via SFT, followed by multi-turn RL to activate latent world knowledge.

Result: Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct achieves average score of 0.86, significantly outperforming proprietary models like Gemini-2.5-Pro (0.60) while saving about 60% GPU hours consumption.

Conclusion: The exploration cost bottleneck for LLMs in nonlinguistic environments can be overcome by SCOUT's scout-based efficient exploration and knowledge bootstrapping approach.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in language-based agentic tasks, their applicability to unseen, nonlinguistic environments (e.g., symbolic or spatial tasks) remains limited. Previous work attributes this performance gap to the mismatch between the pretraining distribution and the testing distribution. In this work, we demonstrate the primary bottleneck is the prohibitive cost of exploration: mastering these tasks requires extensive trial-and-error, which is computationally unsustainable for parameter-heavy LLMs operating in a high dimensional semantic space. To address this, we propose SCOUT (Sub-Scale Collaboration On Unseen Tasks), a novel framework that decouples exploration from exploitation. We employ lightweight "scouts" (e.g., small MLPs) to probe environmental dynamics at a speed and scale far exceeding LLMs. The collected trajectories are utilized to bootstrap the LLM via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), followed by multi-turn Reinforcement Learning (RL) to activate its latent world knowledge. Empirically, SCOUT enables a Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct model to achieve an average score of 0.86, significantly outperforming proprietary models, including Gemini-2.5-Pro (0.60), while saving about 60% GPU hours consumption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional supervised climate downscaling struggles with generalization to Global Climate Models due to lack of paired training data and domain gaps, while current zero-shot methods suffer from physical inconsistencies and vanishing gradient issues under large scaling factors.

Method: ZSSD leverages a Physics-Consistent Climate Prior learned from reanalysis data, conditioned on geophysical boundaries and temporal information. It introduces Unified Coordinate Guidance to address vanishing gradient problems in vanilla DPS and ensure consistency with large-scale fields.

Result: ZSSD significantly outperforms existing zero-shot baselines in 99th percentile errors and successfully reconstructs complex weather events like tropical cyclones across heterogeneous GCMs.

Conclusion: The proposed zero-shot framework enables robust statistical downscaling across varying GCMs without paired training data, overcoming physical consistency and gradient issues that plague existing methods.

Abstract: Conventional supervised climate downscaling struggles to generalize to Global Climate Models (GCMs) due to the lack of paired training data and inherent domain gaps relative to reanalysis. Meanwhile, current zero-shot methods suffer from physical inconsistencies and vanishing gradient issues under large scaling factors. We propose Zero-Shot Statistical Downscaling (ZSSD), a zero-shot framework that performs statistical downscaling without paired data during training. ZSSD leverages a Physics-Consistent Climate Prior learned from reanalysis data, conditioned on geophysical boundaries and temporal information to enforce physical validity. Furthermore, to enable robust inference across varying GCMs, we introduce Unified Coordinate Guidance. This strategy addresses the vanishing gradient problem in vanilla DPS and ensures consistency with large-scale fields. Results show that ZSSD significantly outperforms existing zero-shot baselines in 99th percentile errors and successfully reconstructs complex weather events, such as tropical cyclones, across heterogeneous GCMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend conceptual spaces theory to model abstract concepts that unfold over time and involve goal-directed behavior, particularly in sequential decision-making contexts like chess.

Method: Represent strategy concepts as geometric regions across interpretable quality dimensions, instantiate chess games as trajectories, and analyze directional movement toward concept regions to recognize intended strategies.

Abstract: We present a conceptual space framework for modelling abstract concepts that unfold over time, demonstrated through a chess-based proof-of-concept. Strategy concepts, such as attack or sacrifice, are represented as geometric regions across interpretable quality dimensions, with chess games instantiated and analysed as trajectories whose directional movement toward regions enables recognition of intended strategies. This approach also supports dual-perspective modelling, capturing how players interpret identical situations differently. Our implementation demonstrates the feasibility of trajectory-based concept recognition, with movement patterns aligning with expert commentary.

TL;DR: BioAgent Bench is a benchmark for evaluating AI agents on bioinformatics tasks, featuring curated end-to-end pipelines with automated assessment and stress testing under perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a need to measure AI agent performance and robustness in bioinformatics workflows, especially considering privacy constraints where closed-source models may be unsuitable.

Method: Created benchmark dataset with curated bioinformatics tasks (RNA-seq, variant calling, metagenomics) with concrete output artifacts for automated assessment. Used LLM-based grader to score pipeline progress and outcome validity, and conducted stress testing with controlled perturbations (corrupted inputs, decoy files, prompt bloat).

Result: Frontier agents can complete multi-step bioinformatics pipelines without elaborate scaffolding, producing requested artifacts reliably. However, robustness tests reveal failure modes under perturbations, showing correct high-level pipeline construction doesn't guarantee reliable step-level reasoning. Open-weight models may be preferable for privacy-sensitive workflows despite lower completion rates.

Conclusion: Bioinformatics AI agents need robustness testing beyond basic completion metrics. Privacy constraints make open-weight models viable alternatives to closed-source models. The benchmark and evaluation suite are released publicly to advance AI agent development for bioinformatics.

Abstract: This paper introduces BioAgent Bench, a benchmark dataset and an evaluation suite designed for measuring the performance and robustness of AI agents in common bioinformatics tasks. The benchmark contains curated end-to-end tasks (e.g., RNA-seq, variant calling, metagenomics) with prompts that specify concrete output artifacts to support automated assessment, including stress testing under controlled perturbations. We evaluate frontier closed-source and open-weight models across multiple agent harnesses, and use an LLM-based grader to score pipeline progress and outcome validity. We find that frontier agents can complete multi-step bioinformatics pipelines without elaborate custom scaffolding, often producing the requested final artifacts reliably. However, robustness tests reveal failure modes under controlled perturbations (corrupted inputs, decoy files, and prompt bloat), indicating that correct high-level pipeline construction does not guarantee reliable step-level reasoning. Finally, because bioinformatics workflows may involve sensitive patient data, proprietary references, or unpublished IP, closed-source models can be unsuitable under strict privacy constraints; in such settings, open-weight models may be preferable despite lower completion rates. We release the dataset and evaluation suite publicly.

Motivation: Endotracheal suctioning is a critical but invasive procedure requiring high skill, yet automated recognition and feedback systems for training are underexplored, especially in home care and educational settings with limited supervision.

Method: Proposes a unified LLM-centered framework for video-based activity recognition, where LLM serves as central reasoning module for spatiotemporal activity recognition and explainable decision analysis, plus pilot student-support module using anomaly detection and XAI principles.

Result: LLM-based approach outperforms baseline machine learning and deep learning models, achieving approximately 15-20% improvement in both accuracy and F1 score.

Conclusion: Establishes scalable, interpretable, data-driven foundation for advancing nursing education, enhancing training efficiency, and improving patient safety through automated, accessible feedback generation.

Abstract: Endotracheal suctioning (ES) is an invasive yet essential clinical procedure that requires a high degree of skill to minimize patient risk - particularly in home care and educational settings, where consistent supervision may be limited. Despite its critical importance, automated recognition and feedback systems for ES training remain underexplored. To address this gap, this study proposes a unified, LLM-centered framework for video-based activity recognition benchmarked against conventional machine learning and deep learning approaches, and a pilot study on feedback generation. Within this framework, the Large Language Model (LLM) serves as the central reasoning module, performing both spatiotemporal activity recognition and explainable decision analysis from video data. Furthermore, the LLM is capable of verbalizing feedback in natural language, thereby translating complex technical insights into accessible, human-understandable guidance for trainees. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM-based approach outperforms baseline models, achieving an improvement of approximately 15-20\% in both accuracy and F1 score. Beyond recognition, the framework incorporates a pilot student-support module built upon anomaly detection and explainable AI (XAI) principles, which provides automated, interpretable feedback highlighting correct actions and suggesting targeted improvements. Collectively, these contributions establish a scalable, interpretable, and data-driven foundation for advancing nursing education, enhancing training efficiency, and ultimately improving patient safety.

Conclusion: CORE successfully addresses the challenge of fragmented computing resources in 6G networks by enabling efficient collaboration among distributed LLM agents through role-based orchestration and optimization, demonstrating practical applicability in real-world edge environments.

Abstract: Rapid advancements in sixth-generation (6G) networks and large language models (LLMs) have paved the way for ubiquitous intelligence, wherein seamless connectivity and distributed artificial intelligence (AI) have revolutionized various aspects of our lives.However, realizing this vision faces significant challenges owing to the fragmented and heterogeneous computing resources across hierarchical networks, which are insufficient for individual LLM agents to perform complex reasoning tasks.To address this issue, we propose Collaborative Orchestration Role at Edge (CORE), an innovative framework that employs a collaborative learning system in which multiple LLMs, each assigned a distinct functional role, are distributed across mobile devices and tiered edge servers. The system integrates three optimization modules, encompassing real-time perception,dynamic role orchestration, and pipeline-parallel execution, to facilitate efficient and rapid collaboration among distributed agents. Furthermore, we introduce a novel role affinity scheduling algorithm for dynamically orchestrating LLM role assignments across the hierarchical edge infrastructure, intelligently matching computational demands with available dispersed resources.Finally, comprehensive case studies and performance evaluations across various 6G application scenarios demonstrated the efficacy of CORE, revealing significant enhancements in the system efficiency and task completion rates. Building on these promising outcomes, we further validated the practical applicability of CORE by deploying it on a real-world edge-computing platform,that exhibits robust performance in operational environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for ECG-expert Foundation Models focus mainly on downstream performance, lacking comprehensive analysis of embedding generalizability needed for responsible deployment in healthcare.

Method: Introduces benchmark methodology combining performance-based evaluation with representation-level analysis using SHAP (for feature importance) and UMAP (for dimensionality reduction visualization). Evaluates multiple ECG-expert FMs pretrained with state-of-the-art techniques across cross-continental datasets and data scarcity scenarios.

Result: Experimental results show the benchmarking protocol provides rich insights into ECG-expert FMs' embedded patterns, enabling deeper understanding of their representational structure and generalizability across different data conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed comprehensive benchmarking framework fills the gap in evaluating ECG-expert Foundation Models by providing both performance and representation-level analysis, crucial for responsible deployment in healthcare applications.

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a cost-effective, highly accessible and widely employed diagnostic tool. With the advent of Foundation Models (FMs), the field of AI-assisted ECG interpretation has begun to evolve, as they enable model reuse across different tasks by relying on embeddings. However, to responsibly employ FMs, it is crucial to rigorously assess to which extent the embeddings they produce are generalizable, particularly in error-sensitive domains such as healthcare. Although prior works have already addressed the problem of benchmarking ECG-expert FMs, they focus predominantly on the evaluation of downstream performance. To fill this gap, this study aims to find an in-depth, comprehensive benchmarking framework for FMs, with a specific focus on ECG-expert ones. To this aim, we introduce a benchmark methodology that complements performance-based evaluation with representation-level analysis, leveraging SHAP and UMAP techniques. Furthermore, we rely on the methodology for carrying out an extensive evaluation of several ECG-expert FMs pretrained via state-of-the-art techniques over different cross-continental datasets and data availability settings; this includes ones featuring data scarcity, a fairly common situation in real-world medical scenarios. Experimental results show that our benchmarking protocol provides a rich insight of ECG-expert FMs' embedded patterns, enabling a deeper understanding of their representational structure and generalizability.

*So Fukuhara,Abdallah Alabdallah,Nuwan Gunasekara,Slawomir Nowaczyk*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a simulation framework to evaluate forecasting models by their operational impact on inventory performance, not just statistical accuracy, showing that better accuracy doesn't always mean better operational outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current forecasting evaluation focuses on statistical accuracy metrics (MAE, RMSE) but ignores how forecasts actually impact operational KPIs like cost and service level in spare parts inventory management, creating a gap between model evaluation and real-world performance.

Method: Develops a decision-centric simulation framework with three components: (1) synthetic demand generator for spare parts characteristics, (2) flexible forecasting module for arbitrary models, and (3) inventory control simulator that uses forecasts to compute operational KPIs.

Result: Found that improvements in conventional accuracy metrics don't necessarily translate to better operational performance, and models with similar statistical error can produce very different cost-service trade-offs.

Conclusion: The framework shifts evaluation from purely predictive accuracy to operational relevance, providing guidance for model selection based on actual inventory outcomes rather than statistical metrics alone.

Abstract: Efficient management of spare parts inventory is crucial in the automotive aftermarket, where demand is highly intermittent and uncertainty drives substantial cost and service risks. Forecasting is therefore central, but the quality of a forecasting model should be judged not by statistical accuracy (e.g., MAE, RMSE, IAE) but rather by its impact on key operational performance indicators (KPIs), such as total cost and service level. Yet most existing work evaluates models exclusively using accuracy metrics, and the relationship between these metrics and operational KPIs remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we propose a decision-centric simulation software framework that enables systematic evaluation of forecasting model in realistic inventory management setting. The framework comprises: (i) a synthetic demand generator tailored to spare-parts demand characteristics, (ii) a flexible forecasting module that can host arbitrary predictive models, and (iii) an inventory control simulator that consumes the forecasts and computes operational KPIs. This closed-loop setup enables researchers to evaluate models not only in terms of statistical error but also in terms of their downstream implications for inventory decisions. Using a wide range of simulation scenarios, we show that improvements in conventional accuracy metrics do not necessarily translate into better operational performance, and that models with similar statistical error profiles can induce markedly different cost-service trade-offs. We analyze these discrepancies to characterize how specific aspects of forecast performance affect inventory outcomes and derive guidance for model selection. Overall, the framework operationalizes the link between demand forecasting and inventory management, shifting evaluation from purely predictive accuracy toward operational relevance in the automotive aftermarket and related domains.

TL;DR: KnowBias is a lightweight debiasing framework that strengthens rather than suppresses bias-encoding neurons in LLMs, achieving SOTA performance with minimal utility degradation using only a few yes/no questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM debiasing methods are brittle, weakly generalizable, data-inefficient, and prone to degrading general capabilities due to their suppressive approach of modifying parameters, prompts, or neurons.

Method: Identifies neurons encoding bias knowledge via attribution-based analysis using a small set of bias-knowledge questions, then selectively enhances these neurons at inference time rather than suppressing them.

Result: Consistent state-of-the-art debiasing performance across multiple benchmarks and LLMs with minimal utility degradation, strong generalization across bias types and demographics, and high data efficiency.

Conclusion: KnowBias offers a lightweight, effective alternative to suppressive debiasing methods by strengthening bias-encoding neurons, enabling strong debiasing while preserving general capabilities with minimal data requirements.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit social biases that reinforce harmful stereotypes, limiting their safe deployment. Most existing debiasing methods adopt a suppressive paradigm by modifying parameters, prompts, or neurons associated with biased behavior; however, such approaches are often brittle, weakly generalizable, data-inefficient, and prone to degrading general capability. We propose \textbf{KnowBias}, a lightweight and conceptually distinct framework that mitigates bias by strengthening, rather than suppressing, neurons encoding bias-knowledge. KnowBias identifies neurons encoding bias knowledge using a small set of bias-knowledge questions via attribution-based analysis, and selectively enhances them at inference time. This design enables strong debiasing while preserving general capabilities, generalizes across bias types and demographics, and is highly data efficient, requiring only a handful of simple yes/no questions and no retraining. Experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art debiasing performance with minimal utility degradation.

TL;DR: WebArbiter: A reasoning-first WebPRM that generates structured justifications with preference verdicts for web navigation tasks, outperforming baselines by 9.1 points on WebPRMBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Web agents face sparse, delayed outcome-based supervision in long-horizon tasks, while existing Process Reward Models (WebPRMs) have limitations: scalar WebPRMs provide coarse signals, and checklist-based WebPRMs rely on brittle template matching that fails under layout/semantic changes and mislabels superficially correct actions.

Method: WebArbiter formulates reward modeling as text generation, producing structured justifications that conclude with preference verdicts and identify optimal actions. Training uses a two-stage pipeline: reasoning distillation for principle-guided reasoning, and reinforcement learning to correct teacher biases by aligning verdicts with correctness.

Result: WebArbiter-7B outperforms strongest baseline GPT-5 by 9.1 points on WebPRMBench (new benchmark with 4 web environments). In WebArena-Lite trajectory search, it surpasses best prior WebPRM by up to 7.2 points.

Conclusion: WebArbiter demonstrates robust performance and practical value in complex web tasks through its reasoning-first approach, structured justification generation, and two-stage training pipeline that enables stronger generalization than existing WebPRM methods.

Abstract: Web agents hold great potential for automating complex computer tasks, yet their interactions involve long-horizon, sequential decision-making with irreversible actions. In such settings, outcome-based supervision is sparse and delayed, often rewarding incorrect trajectories and failing to support inference-time scaling. This motivates the use of Process Reward Models (WebPRMs) for web navigation, but existing approaches remain limited: scalar WebPRMs collapse progress into coarse, weakly grounded signals, while checklist-based WebPRMs rely on brittle template matching that fails under layout or semantic changes and often mislabels superficially correct actions as successful, providing little insight or interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce WebArbiter, a reasoning-first, principle-inducing WebPRM that formulates reward modeling as text generation, producing structured justifications that conclude with a preference verdict and identify the action most conducive to task completion under the current context. Training follows a two-stage pipeline: reasoning distillation equips the model with coherent principle-guided reasoning, and reinforcement learning corrects teacher biases by directly aligning verdicts with correctness, enabling stronger generalization. To support systematic evaluation, we release WebPRMBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning four diverse web environments with rich tasks and high-quality preference annotations. On WebPRMBench, WebArbiter-7B outperforms the strongest baseline, GPT-5, by 9.1 points. In reward-guided trajectory search on WebArena-Lite, it surpasses the best prior WebPRM by up to 7.2 points, underscoring its robustness and practical value in real-world complex web tasks.

*Minwoo Jang,Hoyoung Kim,Jabin Koo,Jungseul Ok*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRAP² is an architecture-agnostic framework that protects models from unauthorized merging by encoding protection into weights during fine-tuning, degrading performance when merged without permission.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model hubs enable easy reuse but create a governance gap where downstream users can combine released weights into unauthorized mixtures that bypass safety alignment or licensing terms. Existing defenses are post-hoc and architecture-specific, providing inconsistent protection.

Method: TRAP² encodes protection into model updates during fine-tuning using weight re-scaling as a proxy for merging processes. It keeps weights effective for standalone use but degrades them under re-scaling that occurs during merging, undermining unauthorized combinations.

Result: The framework works regardless of whether models are released as adapters or full models, providing architecture-agnostic protection against unauthorized merging.

Conclusion: TRAP² closes the governance gap in model reuse by providing a practical, architecture-independent solution to prevent unauthorized model merging while maintaining standalone functionality.

Abstract: The rise of model hubs has made it easier to access reusable model components, making model merging a practical tool for combining capabilities. Yet, this modularity also creates a \emph{governance gap}: downstream users can recompose released weights into unauthorized mixtures that bypass safety alignment or licensing terms. Because existing defenses are largely post-hoc and architecture-specific, they provide inconsistent protection across diverse architectures and release formats in practice. To close this gap, we propose \textsc{Trap}$^{2}$, an architecture-agnostic protection framework that encodes protection into the update during fine-tuning, regardless of whether they are released as adapters or full models. Instead of relying on architecture-dependent approaches, \textsc{Trap}$^{2}$ uses weight re-scaling as a simple proxy for the merging process. It keeps released weights effective in standalone use, but degrades them under re-scaling that often arises in merging, undermining unauthorized merging.

### [179] [From Meta-Thought to Execution: Cognitively Aligned Post-Training for Generalizable and Reliable LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21909)
*Shaojie Wang,Liang Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoMT+CCRL framework separates abstract strategy learning from problem-specific execution, mimicking human cognition to improve LLM generalization and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM post-training methods treat complete reasoning trajectories as basic units, which is problem-centric and entangles abstract strategies with problem-specific execution. This misaligns with human cognition where problem-solving naturally decomposes into two stages: acquiring abstract strategies first, then adapting them to specific instances.

Method: Chain-of-Meta-Thought (CoMT) focuses supervised learning on abstract reasoning patterns without specific executions to acquire generalizable strategies. Confidence-Calibrated Reinforcement Learning (CCRL) then optimizes task adaptation via confidence-aware rewards on intermediate steps to prevent overconfident errors from cascading.

Result: Experiments across four models and eight benchmarks show 2.19% in-distribution and 4.63% out-of-distribution improvements over standard methods, while reducing training time by 65-70% and token consumption by 50%.

Conclusion: Aligning post-training with human cognitive principles yields superior generalization and enhanced training efficiency, demonstrating that mimicking the two-stage human cognitive process is more effective than current problem-centric approaches.

Abstract: Current LLM post-training methods optimize complete reasoning trajectories through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by outcome-based Reinforcement Learning (RL). While effective, a closer examination reveals a fundamental gap: this approach does not align with how humans actually solve problems. Human cognition naturally decomposes problem-solving into two distinct stages: first acquiring abstract strategies (i.e., meta-knowledge) that generalize across problems, then adapting them to specific instances. In contrast, by treating complete trajectories as basic units, current methods are inherently problem-centric, entangling abstract strategies with problem-specific execution. To address this misalignment, we propose a cognitively-inspired framework that explicitly mirrors the two-stage human cognitive process. Specifically, Chain-of-Meta-Thought (CoMT) focuses supervised learning on abstract reasoning patterns without specific executions, enabling acquisition of generalizable strategies. Confidence-Calibrated Reinforcement Learning (CCRL) then optimizes task adaptation via confidence-aware rewards on intermediate steps, preventing overconfident errors from cascading and improving execution reliability. Experiments across four models and eight benchmarks show 2.19\% and 4.63\% improvements in-distribution and out-of-distribution respectively over standard methods, while reducing training time by 65-70% and token consumption by 50%, demonstrating that aligning post-training with human cognitive principles yields not only superior generalization but also enhanced training efficiency.

*Zhao Wang,Ziliang Zhao,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProRAG introduces a process-supervised RL framework for RAG optimization that uses step-level process rewards combined with global outcomes to address reward sparsity and credit assignment issues in complex reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional outcome-based RL for RAG suffers from reward sparsity and inefficient credit assignment, leading to "process hallucinations" where models reach correct answers through flawed logic or redundant retrieval steps. Process-aware approaches lack on-policy exploration capabilities needed to decouple step-level credit from global outcomes.

Method: Four-stage framework: (1) Supervised Policy Warmup to initialize reasoning format; (2) MCTS-based Process Reward Model (PRM) to quantify intermediate reasoning quality; (3) PRM-Guided Reasoning Refinement to align policy with process preferences; (4) Process-Supervised RL with dual-granularity advantage mechanism aggregating step-level process rewards with global outcome signals.

Result: Extensive experiments on five multi-hop reasoning benchmarks show ProRAG achieves superior overall performance compared to strong outcome-based and process-aware RL baselines, particularly on complex long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: ProRAG validates the effectiveness of fine-grained process supervision for optimizing RAG in complex reasoning tasks, addressing key limitations of traditional RL approaches through integrated step-level feedback mechanisms.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a promising paradigm for optimizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in complex reasoning tasks. However, traditional outcome-based RL approaches often suffer from reward sparsity and inefficient credit assignment, as coarse-grained scalar rewards fail to identify specific erroneous steps within long-horizon trajectories. This ambiguity frequently leads to "process hallucinations", where models reach correct answers through flawed logic or redundant retrieval steps. Although recent process-aware approaches attempt to mitigate this via static preference learning or heuristic reward shaping, they often lack the on-policy exploration capabilities required to decouple step-level credit from global outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose ProRAG, a process-supervised reinforcement learning framework designed to integrate learned step-level supervision into the online optimization loop. Our framework consists of four stages: (1) Supervised Policy Warmup to initialize the model with a structured reasoning format; (2) construction of an MCTS-based Process Reward Model (PRM) to quantify intermediate reasoning quality; (3) PRM-Guided Reasoning Refinement to align the policy with fine-grained process preferences; and (4) Process-Supervised Reinforcement Learning with a dual-granularity advantage mechanism. By aggregating step-level process rewards with global outcome signals, ProRAG provides precise feedback for every action. Extensive experiments on five multi-hop reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ProRAG achieves superior overall performance compared to strong outcome-based and process-aware RL baselines, particularly on complex long-horizon tasks, validating the effectiveness of fine-grained process supervision.

TL;DR: JADE is a framework for joint optimization of planning and execution in dynamic RAG workflows, addressing the strategic-operational mismatch in current agentic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems face a dichotomy: either optimize modules jointly within rigid architectures or use dynamic planning with frozen executors, creating a "strategic-operational mismatch" where sophisticated planning fails due to unadapted local executors.

Method: JADE models the system as a cooperative multi-agent team unified under a single shared backbone, enabling end-to-end learning driven by outcome-based rewards, facilitating co-adaptation between planner and executors.

Result: Empirical results show JADE transforms disjoint modules into a synergistic system, yielding remarkable performance improvements via joint optimization and enabling flexible balance between efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: JADE provides a unified framework for joint optimization of planning and execution in dynamic RAG workflows, addressing the strategic-operational mismatch and enabling co-adaptation between planning strategies and execution capabilities.

Abstract: The evolution of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shifted from static retrieval pipelines to dynamic, agentic workflows where a central planner orchestrates multi-turn reasoning. However, existing paradigms face a critical dichotomy: they either optimize modules jointly within rigid, fixed-graph architectures, or empower dynamic planning while treating executors as frozen, black-box tools. We identify that this \textit{decoupled optimization} creates a ``strategic-operational mismatch,'' where sophisticated planning strategies fail to materialize due to unadapted local executors, often leading to negative performance gains despite increased system complexity. In this paper, we propose \textbf{JADE} (\textbf{J}oint \textbf{A}gentic \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{E}xecution), a unified framework for the joint optimization of planning and execution within dynamic, multi-turn workflows. By modeling the system as a cooperative multi-agent team unified under a single shared backbone, JADE enables end-to-end learning driven by outcome-based rewards. This approach facilitates \textit{co-adaptation}: the planner learns to operate within the capability boundaries of the executors, while the executors evolve to align with high-level strategic intent. Empirical results demonstrate that JADE transforms disjoint modules into a synergistic system, yielding remarkable performance improvements via joint optimization and enabling a flexible balance between efficiency and effectiveness through dynamic workflow orchestration.

TL;DR: SCMA is a multi-agent RL framework that reduces redundant reasoning in Large Reasoning Models by using specialized agents to detect and penalize unnecessary reasoning chunks while preserving essential logic, achieving both shorter responses and higher accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Redundant reasoning in Large Reasoning Models creates inference overhead that degrades interactive experience and hinders deployment. Existing RL approaches with simple length penalties struggle to balance brevity with accuracy, often compromising critical reasoning logic.

Method: Proposes SCMA (Self-Compression via MARL), a multi-agent RL framework with three agents: 1) Segmentation Agent decomposes reasoning into logical chunks, 2) Scoring Agent quantifies significance of each chunk, and 3) Reasoning Agent learns to prioritize essential logic using an importance-weighted length penalty defined collaboratively by the other two agents.

Result: Reduces response length by 11.1% to 39.0% while boosting accuracy by 4.33% to 10.02% across model scales. Ablation studies and qualitative analysis show synergistic optimization fosters emergent behaviors, yielding more powerful LRMs than vanilla RL approaches.

Conclusion: SCMA effectively addresses the trade-off between brevity and accuracy in Large Reasoning Models by selectively penalizing redundancy while preserving essential reasoning logic through a multi-agent collaborative framework, enabling more efficient deployment without inference overhead.

Abstract: The inference overhead induced by redundant reasoning undermines the interactive experience and severely bottlenecks the deployment of Large Reasoning Models. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based solutions tackle this problem by coupling a length penalty with outcome-based rewards. This simplistic reward weighting struggles to reconcile brevity with accuracy, as enforcing brevity may compromise critical reasoning logic. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing a multi-agent RL framework that selectively penalizes redundant chunks, while preserving essential reasoning logic. Our framework, Self-Compression via MARL (SCMA), instantiates redundancy detection and evaluation through two specialized agents: \textbf{a Segmentation Agent} for decomposing the reasoning process into logical chunks, and \textbf{a Scoring Agent} for quantifying the significance of each chunk. The Segmentation and Scoring agents collaboratively define an importance-weighted length penalty during training, incentivizing \textbf{a Reasoning Agent} to prioritize essential logic without introducing inference overhead during deployment. Empirical evaluations across model scales demonstrate that SCMA reduces response length by 11.1\% to 39.0\% while boosting accuracy by 4.33\% to 10.02\%. Furthermore, ablation studies and qualitative analysis validate that the synergistic optimization within the MARL framework fosters emergent behaviors, yielding more powerful LRMs compared to vanilla RL paradigms.

*Jon Chun,Kathrine Elkins,Yong Suk Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgenticSimLaw is a courtroom-style multi-agent debate framework for transparent, controllable reasoning in high-stakes tabular decision-making, tested on recidivism prediction with better stability and explainability than single-agent approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the black-box nature of current LLM-based decision systems in high-stakes domains like criminal justice, where transparency, auditability, and human oversight are critical but lacking in traditional approaches.

Method: A role-structured multi-agent debate framework with explicit agent roles (prosecutor, defense, judge), 7-turn structured interaction protocols, and private reasoning strategies, creating a fully auditable courtroom-style decision process.

Result: Benchmarked on NLSY97 recidivism prediction, structured multi-agent debate showed more stable and generalizable performance than chain-of-thought prompting across ~90 model/strategy combinations, with stronger accuracy-F1 correlation and complete interaction transcripts for explainability.

Conclusion: AgenticSimLaw provides transparent, controllable reasoning for high-stakes decisions, addressing key LLM multi-agent challenges through structured roles, logged interactions, and explicit non-deployment constraints, generalizing beyond criminal justice to any domain requiring deliberation and oversight.

Abstract: We introduce AgenticSimLaw, a role-structured, multi-agent debate framework that provides transparent and controllable test-time reasoning for high-stakes tabular decision-making tasks. Unlike black-box approaches, our courtroom-style orchestration explicitly defines agent roles (prosecutor, defense, judge), interaction protocols (7-turn structured debate), and private reasoning strategies, creating a fully auditable decision-making process. We benchmark this framework on young adult recidivism prediction using the NLSY97 dataset, comparing it against traditional chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across almost 90 unique combinations of models and strategies. Our results demonstrate that structured multi-agent debate provides more stable and generalizable performance compared to single-agent reasoning, with stronger correlation between accuracy and F1-score metrics. Beyond performance improvements, AgenticSimLaw offers fine-grained control over reasoning steps, generates complete interaction transcripts for explainability, and enables systematic profiling of agent behaviors. While we instantiate this framework in the criminal justice domain to stress-test reasoning under ethical complexity, the approach generalizes to any deliberative, high-stakes decision task requiring transparency and human oversight. This work addresses key LLM-based multi-agent system challenges: organization through structured roles, observability through logged interactions, and responsibility through explicit non-deployment constraints for sensitive domains.

TL;DR: DeR2 is a controlled evaluation framework that isolates document-grounded reasoning from retrieval and memorization issues, revealing significant gaps in LLMs' ability to reason with novel scientific information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluations confound reasoning with retrieval/toolchain choices and suffer from parametric memorization and web volatility, making it unclear whether models can genuinely reason over novel scientific information.

Method: DeR2 decouples evidence access from reasoning through four controlled regimes (Instruction-only, Concepts, Related-only, Full-set) with frozen document libraries from 2023-2025 theoretical papers, expert annotations, and two-phase validation to prevent parametric leakage.

Result: Experiments show substantial variation and significant headroom: some models exhibit mode-switch fragility (worse with Full-set than Instruction-only), while others show structural concept misuse (naming concepts correctly but failing to execute them procedurally).

Conclusion: DeR2 provides a controlled sandbox for evaluating document-grounded reasoning, revealing that despite strong benchmark performance, LLMs struggle with genuine scientific reasoning over novel information, with clear gaps in multi-step synthesis and evidence-based conclusion making.

Abstract: Despite strong performance on existing benchmarks, it remains unclear whether large language models can reason over genuinely novel scientific information. Most evaluations score end-to-end RAG pipelines, where reasoning is confounded with retrieval and toolchain choices, and the signal is further contaminated by parametric memorization and open-web volatility. We introduce DeR2, a controlled deep-research sandbox that isolates document-grounded reasoning while preserving core difficulties of deep search: multi-step synthesis, denoising, and evidence-based conclusion making. DeR2 decouples evidence access from reasoning via four regimes--Instruction-only, Concepts (gold concepts without documents), Related-only (only relevant documents), and Full-set (relevant documents plus topically related distractors)--yielding interpretable regime gaps that operationalize retrieval loss vs. reasoning loss and enable fine-grained error attribution. To prevent parametric leakage, we apply a two-phase validation that requires parametric failure without evidence while ensuring oracle-concept solvability. To ensure reproducibility, each instance provides a frozen document library (drawn from 2023-2025 theoretical papers) with expert-annotated concepts and validated rationales. Experiments across a diverse set of state-of-the-art foundation models reveal substantial variation and significant headroom: some models exhibit mode-switch fragility, performing worse with the Full-set than with Instruction-only, while others show structural concept misuse, correctly naming concepts but failing to execute them as procedures.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ToolWeaver: A generative tool learning framework that encodes tools into hierarchical sequences to solve scalability and semantic challenges in tool-use pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval-based tool-use pipelines face dual semantic challenges: encoders fail to capture complex semantics, and LLMs lack intrinsic tool knowledge. Generative methods that map each tool to unique tokens create scalability issues (vocabulary explosion) and semantic bottlenecks that hinder learning of collaborative tool relationships.

Method: Proposes ToolWeaver framework that encodes tools into hierarchical sequences, making vocabulary expansion logarithmic to tool count. Uses novel tokenization to weave together tool's intrinsic semantics with extrinsic co-usage patterns, then integrates these structured codes into LLM through generative alignment fine-tuning.

Result: Evaluation with nearly 47,000 tools shows ToolWeaver significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing more scalable, generalizable, and semantically-aware foundation for tool-augmented agents.

Conclusion: ToolWeaver addresses fundamental limitations of current tool learning approaches by enabling efficient vocabulary scaling and better learning of collaborative tool relationships through hierarchical encoding, representing a significant advancement for tool-augmented AI systems.

Abstract: Prevalent retrieval-based tool-use pipelines struggle with a dual semantic challenge: their retrievers often employ encoders that fail to capture complex semantics, while the Large Language Model (LLM) itself lacks intrinsic tool knowledge from its natural language pretraining. Generative methods offer a powerful alternative by unifying selection and execution, tasking the LLM to directly learn and generate tool identifiers. However, the common practice of mapping each tool to a unique new token introduces substantial limitations: it creates a scalability and generalization crisis, as the vocabulary size explodes and each tool is assigned a semantically isolated token. This approach also creates a semantic bottleneck that hinders the learning of collaborative tool relationships, as the model must infer them from sparse co-occurrences of monolithic tool IDs within a vast library. To address these limitations, we propose ToolWeaver, a novel generative tool learning framework that encodes tools into hierarchical sequences. This approach makes vocabulary expansion logarithmic to the number of tools. Crucially, it enables the model to learn collaborative patterns from the dense co-occurrence of shared codes, rather than the sparse co-occurrence of monolithic tool IDs. We generate these structured codes through a novel tokenization process designed to weave together a tool's intrinsic semantics with its extrinsic co-usage patterns. These structured codes are then integrated into the LLM through a generative alignment stage, where the model is fine-tuned to produce the hierarchical code sequences. Evaluation results with nearly 47,000 tools show that ToolWeaver significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a more scalable, generalizable, and semantically-aware foundation for advanced tool-augmented agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VAF is a pipeline for evaluating how webpage visual attributes influence web-agent decision-making, revealing that background color contrast, item size, position, and card clarity strongly affect agents while font styling and text color have minor effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research on web agents focuses on robustness to adversarial attacks but lacks systematic understanding of how visual attributes shape agent decision-making in benign scenarios. While textual attributes have been studied, visual attribute effects remain limited.

Method: VAF pipeline with three stages: (1) variant generation creating webpage variants with identical semantics but different visual attributes, (2) browsing interaction where agents navigate via scrolling and clicking like humans, (3) validation using Target Click Rate and Target Mention Rate to measure decision-making differences.

Result: Experiments across 8 variant families (48 variants), 5 real-world websites (shopping, travel, news), and 4 web agents show background color contrast, item size, position, and card clarity strongly influence agents' actions, while font styling, text color, and item image clarity have minor effects.

Conclusion: Visual attributes significantly influence web-agent decision-making, with certain attributes having stronger effects than others. The VAF pipeline provides a systematic way to quantify these influences, offering insights for designing more robust and human-aligned web agents.

Abstract: Web agents have demonstrated strong performance on a wide range of web-based tasks. However, existing research on the effect of environmental variation has mostly focused on robustness to adversarial attacks, with less attention to agents' preferences in benign scenarios. Although early studies have examined how textual attributes influence agent behavior, a systematic understanding of how visual attributes shape agent decision-making remains limited. To address this, we introduce VAF, a controlled evaluation pipeline for quantifying how webpage Visual Attribute Factors influence web-agent decision-making. Specifically, VAF consists of three stages: (i) variant generation, which ensures the variants share identical semantics as the original item while only differ in visual attributes; (ii) browsing interaction, where agents navigate the page via scrolling and clicking the interested item, mirroring how human users browse online; (iii) validating through both click action and reasoning from agents, which we use the Target Click Rate and Target Mention Rate to jointly evaluate the effect of visual attributes. By quantitatively measuring the decision-making difference between the original and variant, we identify which visual attributes influence agents' behavior most. Extensive experiments, across 8 variant families (48 variants total), 5 real-world websites (including shopping, travel, and news browsing), and 4 representative web agents, show that background color contrast, item size, position, and card clarity have a strong influence on agents' actions, whereas font styling, text color, and item image clarity exhibit minor effects.

TL;DR: RTL is an adaptive pruning framework that discovers multiple specialized subnetworks (adaptive tickets) tailored to different data classes/clusters, outperforming single-model approaches while using fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pruning methods assume a single universal winning ticket for all inputs, ignoring the inherent heterogeneity of real-world data where different inputs may require different specialized subnetworks.

Method: Proposes Routing the Lottery (RTL), an adaptive pruning framework that discovers multiple specialized subnetworks (adaptive tickets) tailored to specific classes, semantic clusters, or environmental conditions.

Result: RTL consistently outperforms single- and multi-model baselines in balanced accuracy and recall across diverse datasets, using up to 10x fewer parameters than independent models while exhibiting semantically aligned behavior.

Conclusion: Recasts pruning as a mechanism for aligning model structure with data heterogeneity, paving the way toward more modular and context-aware deep learning, while introducing tools to diagnose oversparsification.

Abstract: In pruning, the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis posits that large networks contain sparse subnetworks, or winning tickets, that can be trained in isolation to match the performance of their dense counterparts. However, most existing approaches assume a single universal winning ticket shared across all inputs, ignoring the inherent heterogeneity of real-world data. In this work, we propose Routing the Lottery (RTL), an adaptive pruning framework that discovers multiple specialized subnetworks, called adaptive tickets, each tailored to a class, semantic cluster, or environmental condition. Across diverse datasets and tasks, RTL consistently outperforms single- and multi-model baselines in balanced accuracy and recall, while using up to 10 times fewer parameters than independent models and exhibiting semantically aligned. Furthermore, we identify subnetwork collapse, a performance drop under aggressive pruning, and introduce a subnetwork similarity score that enables label-free diagnosis of oversparsification. Overall, our results recast pruning as a mechanism for aligning model structure with data heterogeneity, paving the way toward more modular and context-aware deep learning.

*Ilche Georgievski,Serhat Tekin,Marco Aiello*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Green AI paradigm applied to automated planning: domain model design affects planner energy consumption, not always correlated with runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional AI research prioritizes algorithmic performance (accuracy, runtime) but neglects energy efficiency. Automated planning has high computational demands but energy consumption remains understudied. The modular structure of planning (separate domain models and algorithms) enables systematic analysis of energy usage through domain model design.

Method: Introduced domain model configuration framework allowing controlled variation of features (element ordering, action arity, dead-end states). Used five benchmark domains and five state-of-the-art planners, analyzing energy and runtime impacts across 32 domain variants per benchmark.

Result: Domain-level modifications produce measurable energy differences across planners. Energy consumption does not always correlate with runtime, indicating energy efficiency is an independent performance dimension.

Conclusion: Domain model characteristics significantly affect planner energy consumption, demonstrating that Green AI principles can be applied to automated planning. Energy efficiency should be considered alongside traditional performance metrics in AI research.

Abstract: AI research has traditionally prioritised algorithmic performance, such as optimising accuracy in machine learning or runtime in automated planning. The emerging paradigm of Green AI challenges this by recognising energy consumption as a critical performance dimension. Despite the high computational demands of automated planning, its energy efficiency has received little attention. This gap is particularly salient given the modular planning structure, in which domain models are specified independently of algorithms. On the other hand, this separation also enables systematic analysis of energy usage through domain model design. We empirically investigate how domain model characteristics affect the energy consumption of classical planners. We introduce a domain model configuration framework that enables controlled variation of features, such as element ordering, action arity, and dead-end states. Using five benchmark domains and five state-of-the-art planners, we analyse energy and runtime impacts across 32 domain variants per benchmark. Results demonstrate that domain-level modifications produce measurable energy differences across planners, with energy consumption not always correlating with runtime.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAAC methods outperform Monte Carlo approaches for decentralized LLM collaboration, especially in long-horizon/sparse-reward tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MARL fine-tuning for LLM collaboration relies on centralized execution protocols and Monte Carlo methods with high variance, making decentralized parallel inference difficult to optimize effectively.

Method: Proposed two Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) approaches: CoLLM-CC with centralized critic and CoLLM-DC with decentralized critics for optimizing decentralized LLM collaboration.

Result: Monte Carlo and CoLLM-DC perform comparably to CoLLM-CC in short-horizon/dense-reward settings, but underperform in long-horizon/sparse-reward tasks where Monte Carlo requires more samples and CoLLM-DC struggles to converge.

Conclusion: MAAC methods, particularly centralized critic approaches, are beneficial for optimizing decentralized LLM collaboration in challenging environments with long horizons or sparse rewards.

Abstract: Recent work has explored optimizing LLM collaboration through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, most MARL fine-tuning approaches rely on predefined execution protocols, which often require centralized execution. Decentralized LLM collaboration is more appealing in practice, as agents can run inference in parallel with flexible deployments. Also, current approaches use Monte Carlo methods for fine-tuning, which suffer from high variance and thus require more samples to train effectively. Actor-critic methods are prevalent in MARL for dealing with these issues, so we developed Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods to optimize decentralized LLM collaboration. In this paper, we analyze when and why these MAAC methods are beneficial. We propose 2 MAAC approaches, \textbf{CoLLM-CC} with a \textbf{C}entralized \textbf{C}ritic and \textbf{CoLLM-DC} with \textbf{D}ecentralized \textbf{C}ritics. Our experiments across writing, coding, and game-playing domains show that Monte Carlo methods and CoLLM-DC can achieve performance comparable to CoLLM-CC in short-horizon and dense-reward settings. However, they both underperform CoLLM-CC on long-horizon or sparse-reward tasks, where Monte Carlo methods require substantially more samples and CoLLM-DC struggles to converge.

*Pranav Mahajan,Ihor Kendiukhov,Syed Hussain,Lydia Nottingham*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SvR preference gap in LMs is highly protocol-dependent; allowing neutrality/abstention in stated preferences improves correlation with forced-choice revealed preferences, but allowing abstention in revealed preferences destroys correlation due to high neutrality rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of stated-revealed preference gaps in language models rely heavily on binary forced-choice prompting, which entangles genuine preferences with artifacts of the elicitation protocol. There's a need to systematically study how different elicitation protocols affect the correlation between stated and revealed preferences.

Method: Systematically studied how elicitation protocols affect SvR correlation across 24 language models. Allowed neutrality and abstention during stated preference elicitation to exclude weak signals. Also allowed abstention in revealed preferences and examined system prompt steering using stated preferences during revealed preference elicitation on AIRiskDilemmas.

Result: 1) Allowing neutrality/abstention in stated preference elicitation substantially improves Spearman's rank correlation (ρ) between volunteered stated preferences and forced-choice revealed preferences. 2) Allowing abstention in revealed preferences drives ρ to near-zero or negative values due to high neutrality rates. 3) System prompt steering using stated preferences during revealed preference elicitation does not reliably improve SvR correlation on AIRiskDilemmas.

Conclusion: SvR correlation is highly protocol-dependent, and preference elicitation requires methods that account for indeterminate preferences rather than relying on binary forced-choice protocols that may produce artifacts.

Abstract: Recent work identifies a stated-revealed (SvR) preference gap in language models (LMs): a mismatch between the values models endorse and the choices they make in context. Existing evaluations rely heavily on binary forced-choice prompting, which entangles genuine preferences with artifacts of the elicitation protocol. We systematically study how elicitation protocols affect SvR correlation across 24 LMs. Allowing neutrality and abstention during stated preference elicitation allows us to exclude weak signals, substantially improving Spearman's rank correlation ($ρ$) between volunteered stated preferences and forced-choice revealed preferences. However, further allowing abstention in revealed preferences drives $ρ$ to near-zero or negative values due to high neutrality rates. Finally, we find that system prompt steering using stated preferences during revealed preference elicitation does not reliably improve SvR correlation on AIRiskDilemmas. Together, our results show that SvR correlation is highly protocol-dependent and that preference elicitation requires methods that account for indeterminate preferences.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VERSA is a verification framework for soccer event data that detects and corrects logical inconsistencies, improving data quality and downstream analytics performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event stream data in sports analytics suffers from inherent quality issues like incorrect event ordering and missing events, which undermine the reliability of fine-grained analyses such as player contribution quantification and tactical pattern identification.

Method: VERSA uses a state-transition model to define valid event sequences, enabling automatic detection and correction of anomalous patterns in soccer event stream data.

Result: Analysis of K League 1 (2024) data revealed 18.81% of events had logical inconsistencies. VERSA significantly improved cross-provider consistency and enhanced the robustness/performance of VAEP (player contribution evaluation) downstream task.

Conclusion: The verification framework effectively increases data reliability for sports analytics, demonstrating that systematic data integrity checking is crucial for robust data-driven analysis in soccer.

Abstract: Event stream data is a critical resource for fine-grained analysis across various domains, including financial transactions, system operations, and sports. In sports, it is actively used for fine-grained analyses such as quantifying player contributions and identifying tactical patterns. However, the reliability of these models is fundamentally limited by inherent data quality issues that cause logical inconsistencies (e.g., incorrect event ordering or missing events). To this end, this study proposes VERSA (Verified Event Data Format for Reliable Soccer Analytics), a systematic verification framework that ensures the integrity of event stream data within the soccer domain. VERSA is based on a state-transition model that defines valid event sequences, thereby enabling the automatic detection and correction of anomalous patterns within the event stream data. Notably, our examination of event data from the K League 1 (2024 season), provided by Bepro, detected that 18.81% of all recorded events exhibited logical inconsistencies. Addressing such integrity issues, our experiments demonstrate that VERSA significantly enhances cross-provider consistency, ensuring stable and unified data representation across heterogeneous sources. Furthermore, we demonstrate that data refined by VERSA significantly improves the robustness and performance of a downstream task called VAEP, which evaluates player contributions. These results highlight that the verification process is highly effective in increasing the reliability of data-driven analysis.

TL;DR: Liquid Interfaces: Ephemeral relational events that emerge through runtime intention articulation and semantic negotiation, replacing static interfaces for adaptive agent coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current software architectures use static interfaces and deterministic contracts that struggle to support autonomous agents with adaptive, probabilistic, and context-dependent reasoning. There's a mismatch between dynamic agent capabilities and rigid system integration approaches.

Method: Introduces Liquid Interfaces as a coordination paradigm where interfaces are ephemeral relational events emerging through runtime intention articulation and semantic negotiation. Formalizes the model with Liquid Interface Protocol (LIP) governing intention-driven interaction, negotiated execution, and ephemerality enforcement under semantic uncertainty.

Result: Develops a formal model and protocol (LIP) for liquid interfaces, discusses governance implications, and presents a reference architecture demonstrating practical feasibility of the approach.

Conclusion: Liquid Interfaces provide a principled foundation for adaptive coordination in agent-based systems, enabling dynamic, context-aware interactions that better match the capabilities of modern autonomous agents.

Abstract: Contemporary software architectures struggle to support autonomous agents whose reasoning is adaptive, probabilistic, and context-dependent, while system integration remains dominated by static interfaces and deterministic contracts. This paper introduces Liquid Interfaces, a coordination paradigm in which interfaces are not persistent technical artifacts, but ephemeral relational events that emerge through intention articulation and semantic negotiation at runtime.We formalize this model and present the Liquid Interface Protocol (LIP),which governs intention-driven interaction, negotiated execution, and enforce ephemerality under semantic uncertainty. We further discuss the governance implications of this approach and describe a reference architecture that demonstrates practical feasibility.

*Yiren Zhao,Junyi Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI agent inference creates memory bottlenecks beyond compute; new metrics OI/CF reveal memory capacity walls; disaggregated serving and heterogeneous systems needed for efficient agentic AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agent inference is creating an inference-heavy datacenter future with bottlenecks in memory capacity, memory bandwidth, and high-speed interconnect that go beyond traditional compute limitations.

Method: Introduce two new metrics - Operational Intensity (OI) and Capacity Footprint (CF) - to analyze AI agent workflows across different model architectures (GQA/MLA, MoE, quantization) and identify memory bottlenecks that traditional roofline analysis misses.

Result: OI/CF metrics reveal dramatic shifts across agentic workflows, with long context KV cache making decode highly memory bound, exposing memory capacity walls that require new architectural approaches.

Conclusion: Propose disaggregated serving, system heterogeneity, specialized accelerators, optical I/O, and agent-hardware co-design as foundations for adapting to evolving OI/CF requirements to sustain efficiency in large-scale agentic AI inference.

Abstract: AI agent inference is driving an inference heavy datacenter future and exposes bottlenecks beyond compute - especially memory capacity, memory bandwidth and high-speed interconnect. We introduce two metrics - Operational Intensity (OI) and Capacity Footprint (CF) - that jointly explain regimes the classic roofline analysis misses, including the memory capacity wall. Across agentic workflows (chat, coding, web use, computer use) and base model choices (GQA/MLA, MoE, quantization), OI/CF can shift dramatically, with long context KV cache making decode highly memory bound. These observations motivate disaggregated serving and system level heterogeneity: specialized prefill and decode accelerators, broader scale up networking, and decoupled compute-memory enabled by optical I/O. We further hypothesize agent-hardware co design, multiple inference accelerators within one system, and high bandwidth, large capacity memory disaggregation as foundations for adaptation to evolving OI/CF. Together, these directions chart a path to sustain efficiency and capability for large scale agentic AI inference.

*Johannes Kirmayr,Lukas Stappen,Elisabeth André*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAR-bench is a benchmark for evaluating LLM agent reliability in real-world settings like in-car assistants, focusing on consistency, uncertainty handling, and capability awareness through multi-turn dialogues with tools and policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agent benchmarks focus on idealistic task completion but overlook reliability in real-world applications where users make incomplete/ambiguous requests, requiring agents to manage uncertainty through dialogue, tools, and policy adherence.

Method: Introduces CAR-bench with LLM-simulated users, domain policies, and 58 interconnected tools across navigation, productivity, charging, and vehicle control. Includes Hallucination tasks (testing limit-awareness with missing tools/info) and Disambiguation tasks (requiring uncertainty resolution through clarification/info gathering).

Result: Baseline results show large gaps between occasional and consistent success. Even frontier LLMs achieve <50% consistent pass rate on Disambiguation tasks due to premature actions, and frequently violate policies or fabricate information in Hallucination tasks.

Conclusion: Current LLM agents lack reliability and self-awareness needed for real-world applications, highlighting the need for more robust agents that can handle uncertainty, respect policies, and recognize their limitations.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for Large Language Model (LLM) agents focus on task completion under idealistic settings but overlook reliability in real-world, user-facing applications. In domains, such as in-car voice assistants, users often issue incomplete or ambiguous requests, creating intrinsic uncertainty that agents must manage through dialogue, tool use, and policy adherence. We introduce CAR-bench, a benchmark for evaluating consistency, uncertainty handling, and capability awareness in multi-turn, tool-using LLM agents in an in-car assistant domain. The environment features an LLM-simulated user, domain policies, and 58 interconnected tools spanning navigation, productivity, charging, and vehicle control. Beyond standard task completion, CAR-bench introduces Hallucination tasks that test agents' limit-awareness under missing tools or information, and Disambiguation tasks that require resolving uncertainty through clarification or internal information gathering. Baseline results reveal large gaps between occasional and consistent success on all task types. Even frontier reasoning LLMs achieve less than 50% consistent pass rate on Disambiguation tasks due to premature actions, and frequently violate policies or fabricate information to satisfy user requests in Hallucination tasks, underscoring the need for more reliable and self-aware LLM agents in real-world settings.

*Sami Abuzakuk,Anne-Marie Kermarrec,Rishi Sharma,Rasmus Moorits Veski,Martijn de Vos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AWO framework optimizes agentic AI workflows by identifying redundant tool execution patterns and replacing them with deterministic meta-tools to reduce LLM calls and improve success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic AI workflows suffer from high operational costs, latency, and failures due to many iterative reasoning steps and tool invocations, creating a need for optimization.

Method: AWO analyzes workflow traces to discover recurring tool call sequences, then transforms them into meta-tools - deterministic composite tools that bundle multiple actions into single invocations.

Result: Experiments show AWO reduces LLM calls by up to 11.9% and increases task success rate by up to 4.2 percentage points on agentic AI benchmarks.

Conclusion: AWO effectively optimizes agentic workflows by eliminating redundant reasoning steps through meta-tools, improving both efficiency and robustness.

Abstract: Agentic AI enables LLM to dynamically reason, plan, and interact with tools to solve complex tasks. However, agentic workflows often require many iterative reasoning steps and tool invocations, leading to significant operational expense, end-to-end latency and failures due to hallucinations. This work introduces Agent Workflow Optimization (AWO), a framework that identifies and optimizes redundant tool execution patterns to improve the efficiency and robustness of agentic workflows. AWO analyzes existing workflow traces to discover recurring sequences of tool calls and transforms them into meta-tools, which are deterministic, composite tools that bundle multiple agent actions into a single invocation. Meta-tools bypass unnecessary intermediate LLM reasoning steps and reduce operational cost while also shortening execution paths, leading to fewer failures. Experiments on two agentic AI benchmarks show that AWO reduces the number of LLM calls up to 11.9% while also increasing the task success rate by up to 4.2 percent points.

*Johann Christensen,Elena Hoemann,Frank Köster,Sven Hallerbach*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel Safety-by-Design method to define Operational Design Domain (ODD) from existing data using multi-dimensional kernel-based representation, enabling certification of AI-based safety-critical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI is increasingly used in safety-critical applications, but defining the complete environmental conditions (ODD) for complex real-world systems is challenging. Traditional ODD creation relies on early-stage expert knowledge, but existing data often contains incomplete environmental descriptions needed for certification.

Method: A posteriori ODD definition from previously collected data using multi-dimensional kernel-based representation. The approach is validated through Monte Carlo methods and a real-world aviation use case for a future safety-critical collision-avoidance system.

Result: The method shows that data-driven ODD can equal the original, underlying hidden ODD of the data. The paper defines conditions under which two ODDs are equal, demonstrating the approach's validity.

Conclusion: The novel Safety-by-Design kernel-based ODD enables future certification of data-driven, safety-critical AI-based systems by providing a systematic way to define operational domains from existing data.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been on the rise in many domains, including numerous safety-critical applications. However, for complex systems found in the real world, or when data already exist, defining the underlying environmental conditions is extremely challenging. This often results in an incomplete description of the environment in which the AI-based system must operate. Nevertheless, this description, called the Operational Design Domain (ODD), is required in many domains for the certification of AI-based systems. Traditionally, the ODD is created in the early stages of the development process, drawing on sophisticated expert knowledge and related standards. This paper presents a novel Safety-by-Design method to a posteriori define the ODD from previously collected data using a multi-dimensional kernel-based representation. This approach is validated through both Monte Carlo methods and a real-world aviation use case for a future safety-critical collision-avoidance system. Moreover, by defining under what conditions two ODDs are equal, the paper shows that the data-driven ODD can equal the original, underlying hidden ODD of the data. Utilizing the novel, Safe-by-Design kernel-based ODD enables future certification of data-driven, safety-critical AI-based systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SMB-Structure is a world model for structured EHR that combines joint-embedding prediction (JEPA) with next-token prediction (SFT) to better capture patient trajectory dynamics rather than just predicting tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs treat patients as documents to summarize rather than dynamical systems to simulate. Patient trajectories emerge from state evolution under interventions and time, requiring models that simulate dynamics rather than just predict tokens.

Method: Introduces SMB-Structure, a world model for structured EHR that grounds a joint-embedding prediction architecture (JEPA) with next-token prediction (SFT). SFT reconstructs future patient states in token space, while JEPA predicts futures in latent space from initial patient representation alone.

Result: Validated across two large cohorts (MSK oncology and INSPECT pulmonary embolism). Linear probe evaluation shows embeddings capture disease dynamics not recoverable by autoregressive baselines, achieving competitive performance on complex tasks with high patient heterogeneity.

Conclusion: The training paradigm learns embeddings that capture disease dynamics better than autoregressive approaches, enabling SMB-Structure to handle complex clinical tasks characterized by patient heterogeneity. Model weights are publicly available.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained with next-word-prediction have achieved success as clinical foundation models. Representations from these language backbones yield strong linear probe performance across biomedical tasks, suggesting that patient semantics emerge from next-token prediction at scale. However, this paradigm treats patients as a document to be summarized rather than a dynamical system to be simulated; a patient's trajectory emerges from their state evolving under interventions and time, requiring models that simulate dynamics rather than predict tokens. To address this, we introduce SMB-Structure, a world model for structured EHR that grounds a joint-embedding prediction architecture (JEPA) with next-token prediction (SFT). SFT grounds our model to reconstruct future patient states in token space, while JEPA predicts those futures in latent space from the initial patient representation alone, forcing trajectory dynamics to be encoded before the next state is observed. We validate across two large-scale cohorts: Memorial Sloan Kettering (23,319 oncology patients; 323,000+ patient-years) and INSPECT (19,402 pulmonary embolism patients). Using a linear probe evaluated at multiple points along the disease trajectory, we demonstrate that our training paradigm learns embeddings that capture disease dynamics not recoverable by autoregressive baselines, enabling SMB-Structure to achieve competitive performance on complex tasks characterized by high patient heterogeneity. Model weights are available at https://huggingface.co/standardmodelbio/SMB-v1-1.7B-Structure.

TL;DR: WoW introduces a realistic ServiceNow-based enterprise environment with 4,000+ business rules and 55 workflows, plus a benchmark showing frontier LLMs fail at predicting cascading side effects in opaque enterprise systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current enterprise benchmarks are inadequate because they evaluate surface-level tasks similar to consumer benchmarks, ignoring real enterprise challenges like limited observability, large database states, and hidden workflows with cascading effects.

Method: Created World of Workflows (WoW), a realistic ServiceNow-based environment with 4,000+ business rules and 55 active workflows, plus WoW-bench with 234 tasks to evaluate agentic task completion and enterprise dynamics modeling capabilities.

Result: Frontier LLMs suffer from "dynamics blindness" - they consistently fail to predict invisible cascading side effects of their actions, leading to silent constraint violations. Reliability requires grounded world modeling where agents mentally simulate hidden state transitions.

Conclusion: For reliable enterprise agents, a new paradigm is needed to explicitly learn system dynamics. The authors release their GitHub for setting up and evaluating WoW to advance enterprise agent research.

Abstract: Frontier large language models (LLMs) excel as autonomous agents in many domains, yet they remain untested in complex enterprise systems where hidden workflows create cascading effects across interconnected databases. Existing enterprise benchmarks evaluate surface-level agentic task completion similar to general consumer benchmarks, ignoring true challenges in enterprises, such as limited observability, large database state, and hidden workflows with cascading side effects. We introduce World of Workflows (WoW), a realistic ServiceNow-based environment incorporating 4,000+ business rules and 55 active workflows embedded in the system, alongside WoW-bench, a benchmark of 234 tasks evaluating constrained agentic task completion and enterprise dynamics modeling capabilities. We reveal two major takeaways: (1) Frontier LLMs suffer from dynamics blindness, consistently failing to predict the invisible, cascading side effects of their actions, which leads to silent constraint violations, and (2) reliability in opaque systems requires grounded world modeling, where agents must mentally simulate hidden state transitions to bridge the observability gap when high-fidelity feedback is unavailable. For reliable and useful enterprise agents, WoW motivates a new paradigm to explicitly learn system dynamics. We release our GitHub for setting up and evaluating WoW.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agentic RL methods rely on sparse outcome-based rewards that fail to differentiate intermediate reasoning quality, leading to suboptimal training results.

Method: Proposes Agent Reasoning Reward Model (Agent-RRM) with three components: explicit reasoning trace, focused critique highlighting reasoning flaws, and overall process score. Investigates three integration strategies: Reagent-C (text-augmented refinement), Reagent-R (reward-augmented guidance), and Reagent-U (unified feedback integration).

Result: Extensive evaluations across 12 diverse benchmarks show Reagent-U yields substantial performance leaps, achieving 43.7% on GAIA and 46.2% on WebWalkerQA.

Conclusion: The reasoning reward model and training schemes are effective, with code, models, and datasets released to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has achieved notable success in enabling agents to perform complex reasoning and tool use. However, most methods still relies on sparse outcome-based reward for training. Such feedback fails to differentiate intermediate reasoning quality, leading to suboptimal training results. In this paper, we introduce Agent Reasoning Reward Model (Agent-RRM), a multi-faceted reward model that produces structured feedback for agentic trajectories, including (1) an explicit reasoning trace , (2) a focused critique that provides refinement guidance by highlighting reasoning flaws, and (3) an overall score that evaluates process performance. Leveraging these signals, we systematically investigate three integration strategies: Reagent-C (text-augmented refinement), Reagent-R (reward-augmented guidance), and Reagent-U (unified feedback integration). Extensive evaluations across 12 diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Reagent-U yields substantial performance leaps, achieving 43.7% on GAIA and 46.2% on WebWalkerQA, validating the effectiveness of our reasoning reward model and training schemes. Code, models, and datasets are all released to facilitate future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of robot motion planning in non-static environments where traditional roadmap graphs need frequent updates, requiring efficient methods to handle dynamic obstacles and environmental changes without expensive full recomputation.

Method: Modifies SPITE method with Red-Green-Gray paradigm using computational geometry to approximate robot swept volumes and perform lazy collision checks. Classifies roadmap edges into three categories: valid (green), invalid (red), and unknown (gray) based on cheap heuristic checks, enabling semi-lazy roadmap updates.

Result: Preliminary experiments show increased accuracy compared to Leven and Hutchinson's established technique, with ability to correctly label edges as invalid while maintaining comparable update runtimes.

Conclusion: The Red-Green-Gray paradigm provides an effective approach for adapting roadmap graphs to dynamic environments through efficient classification and semi-lazy updates, offering improved accuracy without sacrificing computational performance.

Abstract: In this paper we tackle the problem of adjusting roadmap graphs for robot motion planning to non-static environments. We introduce the "Red-Green-Gray" paradigm, a modification of the SPITE method, capable of classifying the validity status of nodes and edges using cheap heuristic checks, allowing fast semi-lazy roadmap updates. Given a roadmap, we use simple computational geometry methods to approximate the swept volumes of robots and perform lazy collision checks, and label a subset of the edges as invalid (red), valid (green), or unknown (gray). We present preliminary experimental results comparing our method to the well-established technique of Leven and Hutchinson, and showing increased accuracy as well as the ability to correctly label edges as invalid while maintaining comparable update runtimes.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Global trajectory optimization for autonomous racing using Bayesian optimization in wavelet space with iterative dynamics learning to minimize lap time under uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous racing approaches focus on dynamics learning at the tracking level without updating the full trajectory for learned dynamics, and full-horizon optimization is computationally expensive with uncertain dynamics affecting real-world performance.

Method: Track-centric approach using wavelet transform for track-agnostic parametric trajectory representation, Bayesian optimization for efficient exploration, and iterative learning framework where optimized trajectories collect real-world data to update dynamics models.

Result: Demonstrated lap time improvement of up to 20.7% over nominal baseline and consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods in both simulations and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed iterative learning framework effectively optimizes full-horizon racing trajectories under uncertain dynamics, achieving significant performance improvements through combined trajectory optimization and dynamics learning.

Abstract: This paper presents a global trajectory optimization framework for minimizing lap time in autonomous racing under uncertain vehicle dynamics. Optimizing the trajectory over the full racing horizon is computationally expensive, and tracking such a trajectory in the real world hardly assures global optimality due to uncertain dynamics. Yet, existing work mostly focuses on dynamics learning at the tracking level, without updating the trajectory itself to account for the learned dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a track-centric approach that directly learns and optimizes the full-horizon trajectory. We first represent trajectories through a track-agnostic parametric space in light of the wavelet transform. This space is then efficiently explored using Bayesian optimization, where the lap time of each candidate is evaluated by running simulations with the learned dynamics. This optimization is embedded in an iterative learning framework, where the optimized trajectory is deployed to collect real-world data for updating the dynamics, progressively refining the trajectory over the iterations. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating lap time improvement of up to 20.7% over a nominal baseline and consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: Current assistive robotics research treats wheelchairs and robotic arms separately, lacking integrated control solutions using machine learning for people with upper-body and mobility limitations.

Method: Developed WheelArm-Sim simulation framework in Isaac Sim to collect synthetic multimodal dataset (13 tasks, 232 trajectories, 67,783 samples) combining manipulation and navigation tasks.

Result: Successfully collected comprehensive dataset and demonstrated feasibility with baseline action prediction model for mustard-picking task, showing data is suitable for ML models.

Conclusion: WheelArm-Sim provides valuable synthetic data for developing integrated control models, addressing the gap in unified wheelchair-robotic arm control systems.

Abstract: Wheelchairs and robotic arms enhance independent living by assisting individuals with upper-body and mobility limitations in their activities of daily living (ADLs). Although recent advancements in assistive robotics have focused on Wheelchair-Mounted Robotic Arms (WMRAs) and wheelchairs separately, integrated and unified control of the combination using machine learning models remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce the concept of WheelArm, an integrated cyber-physical system (CPS) that combines wheelchair and robotic arm controls. Data collection is the first step toward developing WheelArm models. In this paper, we present WheelArm-Sim, a simulation framework developed in Isaac Sim for synthetic data collection. We evaluate its capability by collecting a manipulation and navigation combined multimodal dataset, comprising 13 tasks, 232 trajectories, and 67,783 samples. To demonstrate the potential of the WheelArm dataset, we implement a baseline model for action prediction in the mustard-picking task. The results illustrate that data collected from WheelArm-Sim is feasible for a data-driven machine learning model for integrated control.

Motivation: Current public datasets for industrial AI systems are limited by simulated data, single-modality sensing, and lack of fine-grained annotations, preventing robust scene understanding and multimodal safety reasoning needed for industrial foundation models.

Method: Collected data from 41 wheeled and rail-mounted inspection robots operating at 2,239 valid inspection sites across 5 industrial scenarios (tunnels, power facilities, sintering equipment, oil/gas plants, coal conveyor trestles). For each of 5,013 instances, provided pixel-level segmentation annotations, semantic scene descriptions, safety level labels, and 7 synchronized modalities (visible-spectrum images, infrared video, audio, depth point clouds, radar point clouds, gas measurements, temperature, humidity).

Result: Created InspecSafe-V1 dataset with 5,013 inspection instances covering diverse industrial environments, providing comprehensive multimodal data with fine-grained annotations to support multimodal anomaly recognition, cross-modal fusion, and safety assessment.

Conclusion: InspecSafe-V1 addresses critical limitations in existing industrial datasets by providing real-world, multimodal, annotated data from actual inspection operations, enabling development of robust industrial foundation models for safety assessment and predictive maintenance.

Abstract: With the rapid development of industrial intelligence and unmanned inspection, reliable perception and safety assessment for AI systems in complex and dynamic industrial sites has become a key bottleneck for deploying predictive maintenance and autonomous inspection. Most public datasets remain limited by simulated data sources, single-modality sensing, or the absence of fine-grained object-level annotations, which prevents robust scene understanding and multimodal safety reasoning for industrial foundation models. To address these limitations, InspecSafe-V1 is released as the first multimodal benchmark dataset for industrial inspection safety assessment that is collected from routine operations of real inspection robots in real-world environments. InspecSafe-V1 covers five representative industrial scenarios, including tunnels, power facilities, sintering equipment, oil and gas petrochemical plants, and coal conveyor trestles. The dataset is constructed from 41 wheeled and rail-mounted inspection robots operating at 2,239 valid inspection sites, yielding 5,013 inspection instances. For each instance, pixel-level segmentation annotations are provided for key objects in visible-spectrum images. In addition, a semantic scene description and a corresponding safety level label are provided according to practical inspection tasks. Seven synchronized sensing modalities are further included, including infrared video, audio, depth point clouds, radar point clouds, gas measurements, temperature, and humidity, to support multimodal anomaly recognition, cross-modal fusion, and comprehensive safety assessment in industrial environments.

Motivation: Robotic blimps offer long endurance and safety but are highly susceptible to wind disturbances, lacking disturbance-aware control frameworks for lighter-than-air platforms.

Method: Integrated moving horizon estimator (MHE) to infer real-time wind perturbations, feeding estimates to model predictive controller (MPC) for trajectory/heading regulation, using 2-DoF moving-mass mechanism for inertial/aerodynamic moment generation.

Result: Extensive flight experiments under headwind and crosswind conditions show MHE-MPC framework significantly outperforms baseline PID control for disturbance-aware flight.

Conclusion: The integrated MHE-MPC framework with moving-mass actuation effectively enables robust wind disturbance compensation for LTA platforms, enhancing flight stability in disturbance-prone environments.

Abstract: Robotic blimps, as lighter-than-air (LTA) aerial systems, offer long endurance and inherently safe operation but remain highly susceptible to wind disturbances. Building on recent advances in moving mass actuation, this paper addresses the lack of disturbance-aware control frameworks for LTA platforms by explicitly modeling and compensating for wind-induced effects. A moving horizon estimator (MHE) infers real-time wind perturbations and provides these estimates to a model predictive controller (MPC), enabling robust trajectory and heading regulation under varying wind conditions. The proposed approach leverages a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DoF) moving-mass mechanism to generate both inertial and aerodynamic moments for attitude and heading control, thereby enhancing flight stability in disturbance-prone environments. Extensive flight experiments under headwind and crosswind conditions show that the integrated MHE-MPC framework significantly outperforms baseline PID control, demonstrating its effectiveness for disturbance-aware LTA flight.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based policies show strong results in robot manipulation but face scalability issues in multi-task scenarios due to high costs of scaling model size and demonstrations.

Method: Introduces Skill Mixture-of-Experts Policy (SMP) that learns a compact orthogonal skill basis, uses sticky routing to compose actions from task-relevant experts, employs variational training objective, and adaptive expert activation for fast sampling.

Result: SMP achieves higher success rates and markedly lower inference cost than large diffusion baselines in both simulation and real dual-arm platform experiments with multi-task learning and transfer learning tasks.

Conclusion: SMP provides a practical path toward scalable, transferable multi-task manipulation: learn reusable skills once, activate only what is needed, and adapt quickly when tasks change.

Abstract: Diffusion-based policies have recently shown strong results in robot manipulation, but their extension to multi-task scenarios is hindered by the high cost of scaling model size and demonstrations. We introduce Skill Mixture-of-Experts Policy (SMP), a diffusion-based mixture-of-experts policy that learns a compact orthogonal skill basis and uses sticky routing to compose actions from a small, task-relevant subset of experts at each step. A variational training objective supports this design, and adaptive expert activation at inference yields fast sampling without oversized backbones. We validate SMP in simulation and on a real dual-arm platform with multi-task learning and transfer learning tasks, where SMP achieves higher success rates and markedly lower inference cost than large diffusion baselines. These results indicate a practical path toward scalable, transferable multi-task manipulation: learn reusable skills once, activate only what is needed, and adapt quickly when tasks change.

Conclusion: Provides principled and practical route to safe, model-free control through fully data-driven safety filtering that works without system models.

Abstract: We introduce Deep QP Safety Filter, a fully data-driven safety layer for black-box dynamical systems. Our method learns a Quadratic-Program (QP) safety filter without model knowledge by combining Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability with model-free learning. We construct contraction-based losses for both the safety value and its derivatives, and train two neural networks accordingly. In the exact setting, the learned critic converges to the viscosity solution (and its derivative), even for non-smooth values. Across diverse dynamical systems -- even including a hybrid system -- and multiple RL tasks, Deep QP Safety Filter substantially reduces pre-convergence failures while accelerating learning toward higher returns than strong baselines, offering a principled and practical route to safe, model-free control.

TL;DR: HPTune: Hierarchical proactive tuning framework for MPC motion planners that evaluates both executed and non-executed actions using risk indicators and closed-loop backpropagation, integrated with Doppler LiDAR for enhanced obstacle velocity measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MPC parameter tuning methods are myopic, only evaluating executed actions, leading to inefficient parameter updates due to sparse failure events like collisions or near-misses. This inefficiency limits adaptive motion planning in complex environments.

Method: Proposes HPTune with two-level tuning: fast-level uses predictive closing speed and proximity distance risk indicators; slow-level uses extended evaluation loss for closed-loop backpropagation. Integrated with Doppler LiDAR for obstacle velocity measurements to enhance motion predictions.

Result: Extensive high-fidelity simulator experiments show HPTune achieves efficient MPC tuning, outperforms baseline schemes in complex environments, and enables situation-tailored motion planning with safe, agile collision avoidance strategies.

Conclusion: HPTune provides an effective hierarchical proactive tuning framework that overcomes myopic limitations of existing methods by evaluating both executed and non-executed actions, leading to more efficient parameter updates and improved motion planning performance.

Abstract: Parameter tuning is a powerful approach to enhance adaptability in model predictive control (MPC) motion planners. However, existing methods typically operate in a myopic fashion that only evaluates executed actions, leading to inefficient parameter updates due to the sparsity of failure events (e.g., obstacle nearness or collision). To cope with this issue, we propose to extend evaluation from executed to non-executed actions, yielding a hierarchical proactive tuning (HPTune) framework that combines both a fast-level tuning and a slow-level tuning. The fast one adopts risk indicators of predictive closing speed and predictive proximity distance, and the slow one leverages an extended evaluation loss for closed-loop backpropagation. Additionally, we integrate HPTune with the Doppler LiDAR that provides obstacle velocities apart from position-only measurements for enhanced motion predictions, thus facilitating the implementation of HPTune. Extensive experiments on high-fidelity simulator demonstrate that HPTune achieves efficient MPC tuning and outperforms various baseline schemes in complex environments. It is found that HPTune enables situation-tailored motion planning by formulating a safe, agile collision avoidance strategy.

*Weidong Huang,Zhehan Li,Hangxin Liu,Biao Hou,Yao Su,Jingwen Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Combines off-policy SAC for large-scale pretraining of humanoid locomotion with model-based fine-tuning for safe adaptation, achieving zero-shot real robot deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: On-policy RL methods like PPO enable robust humanoid training but have low sample efficiency for adaptation. Off-policy and model-based methods improve efficiency but there's a gap between large-scale pretraining and efficient fine-tuning.

Method: Uses off-policy SAC with large-batch updates and high UTD ratio for pretraining humanoid policies. For adaptation, fine-tunes pretrained policies using model-based methods where deterministic policy executes in new environment while stochastic exploration is confined to physics-informed world model.

Result: SAC-pretrained policies achieve zero-shot deployment on real robots. The approach enables efficient adaptation to new environments and out-of-distribution tasks while mitigating risks of random exploration during adaptation.

Conclusion: The method successfully couples wall-clock efficiency of large-scale simulation during pretraining with sample efficiency of model-based learning during fine-tuning, bridging the gap between pretraining and adaptation for humanoid control.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used for humanoid control, with on-policy methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) enabling robust training via large-scale parallel simulation and, in some cases, zero-shot deployment to real robots. However, the low sample efficiency of on-policy algorithms limits safe adaptation to new environments. Although off-policy RL and model-based RL have shown improved sample efficiency, the gap between large-scale pretraining and efficient finetuning on humanoids still exists. In this paper, we find that off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), with large-batch update and a high Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio, reliably supports large-scale pretraining of humanoid locomotion policies, achieving zero-shot deployment on real robots. For adaptation, we demonstrate that these SAC-pretrained policies can be finetuned in new environments and out-of-distribution tasks using model-based methods. Data collection in the new environment executes a deterministic policy while stochastic exploration is instead confined to a physics-informed world model. This separation mitigates the risks of random exploration during adaptation while preserving exploratory coverage for improvement. Overall, the approach couples the wall-clock efficiency of large-scale simulation during pretraining with the sample efficiency of model-based learning during fine-tuning.

TL;DR: The paper presents a latent space reinforcement learning approach for robotic grasping in space environments, achieving 95% success in under 1M steps with faster convergence than visual baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments like space requires reliable execution under diverse conditions, but current systems struggle with high-dimensional action spaces, sparse rewards, and slow generalization beyond curated training scenarios.

Method: Learn control policies directly in a learned latent manifold that fuses multiple modalities into structured representations for decision-making, using GPU-accelerated physics simulation and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)-based reinforcement learning on single-shot manipulation tasks.

Result: Achieved over 95% task success in less than 1M environment steps under continuously varying grasping conditions, showing faster convergence than state-of-the-art visual baselines under open-loop single-shot conditions.

Conclusion: Explicit reasoning in latent space yields more sample-efficient learning and improved robustness to novel object/gripper geometries, environmental clutter, and sensor configurations, though limitations remain for fully adaptive grasping in extreme space conditions.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments requires reliable execution under diverse conditions, yet many state-of-the-art systems still struggle with high-dimensional action spaces, sparse rewards, and slow generalization beyond carefully curated training scenarios. We study these limitations through the example of grasping in space environments. We learn control policies directly in a learned latent manifold that fuses (grammarizes) multiple modalities into a structured representation for policy decision-making. Building on GPU-accelerated physics simulation, we instantiate a set of single-shot manipulation tasks and achieve over 95% task success with Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)-based reinforcement learning in less than 1M environment steps, under continuously varying grasping conditions from step 1. This empirically shows faster convergence than representative state-of-the-art visual baselines under the same open-loop single-shot conditions. Our analysis indicates that explicitly reasoning in latent space yields more sample-efficient learning and improved robustness to novel object and gripper geometries, environmental clutter, and sensor configurations compared to standard baselines. We identify remaining limitations and outline directions toward fully adaptive and generalizable grasping in the extreme conditions of space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing navigation systems rely on single-pass scoring at the decision layer, leading to overconfident long-horizon errors and redundant exploration in unfamiliar indoor environments.

Method: Proposes Dual-Stance Cooperative Debate Navigation with two complementary stances: Task-Scene Understanding (goal progress from scene-layout cues) and Safety-Information Balancing (risk and information value). Uses cooperative debate with cross-checking and Navigation Consensus Arbitration with optional micro-probing for verification.

Result: Experiments on HM3Dv1, HM3Dv2, and MP3D demonstrate consistent improvements in success and path efficiency while reducing exploration redundancy.

Conclusion: DSCD-Nav's stance-based cross-checking and evidence-aware arbitration mechanism effectively improves action reliability in indoor navigation under partial observability.

Abstract: Adaptive navigation in unfamiliar indoor environments is crucial for household service robots. Despite advances in zero-shot perception and reasoning from vision-language models, existing navigation systems still rely on single-pass scoring at the decision layer, leading to overconfident long-horizon errors and redundant exploration. To tackle these problems, we propose Dual-Stance Cooperative Debate Navigation (DSCD-Nav), a decision mechanism that replaces one-shot scoring with stance-based cross-checking and evidence-aware arbitration to improve action reliability under partial observability. Specifically, given the same observation and candidate action set, we explicitly construct two stances by conditioning the evaluation on diverse and complementary objectives: a Task-Scene Understanding (TSU) stance that prioritizes goal progress from scene-layout cues, and a Safety-Information Balancing (SIB) stance that emphasizes risk and information value. The stances conduct a cooperative debate and make policy by cross-checking their top candidates with cue-grounded arguments. Then, a Navigation Consensus Arbitration (NCA) agent is employed to consolidate both sides' reasons and evidence, optionally triggering lightweight micro-probing to verify uncertain choices, preserving NCA's primary intent while disambiguating. Experiments on HM3Dv1, HM3Dv2, and MP3D demonstrate consistent improvements in success and path efficiency while reducing exploration redundancy.

*Andreas Mueller*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework for interfacing Lie group integrators with standard multibody system formulations using absolute coordinates, enabling singularity-free integration while maintaining compatibility with existing simulation codes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard absolute coordinate formulations for multibody systems face singularity issues in spatial motion parameterization, typically requiring unit quaternions. Lie group integration methods offer singularity-free integration but are incompatible with existing simulation codes without major restructuring.

Method: Proposes a framework using local-global transitions (LGT) maps that interface Lie group integrators with standard EOM formulations. Uses direct product group SO(3)×R³ and semidirect product group SE(3) for rigid body motion representation, allowing updates of global absolute coordinates via local coordinates on Lie groups.

Result: Enables singularity-free time integration of multibody systems using Lie group methods while maintaining compatibility with existing absolute coordinate formulations and simulation codes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully bridges the gap between standard absolute coordinate formulations and Lie group integration methods, allowing for geometry-respecting integration without requiring major code restructuring in existing multibody simulation software.

Abstract: A classical approach to the multibody systems (MBS) modeling is to use absolute coordinates, i.e., a set of (possibly redundant) coordinates that describe the absolute position and orientation of the individual bodies with respect to an inertial frame (IFR). A well-known problem for the time integration of the equations of motion (EOM) is the lack of a singularity-free parameterization of spatial motions, which is usually tackled by using unit quaternions. Lie group integration methods were proposed as an alternative approach to the singularity-free time integration. At the same time, Lie group formulations of EOM naturally respect the geometry of spatial motions during integration. Lie group integration methods, operating directly on the configuration space Lie group, are incompatible with standard formulations of the EOM, and cannot be implemented in existing MBS simulation codes without a major restructuring. The contribution of this paper is twofold: (1) A framework for interfacing Lie group integrators to standard EOM formulations is presented. It allows describing MBS in terms of various absolute coordinates and at the same using Lie group integration schemes. (2) A method for consistently incorporating the geometry of rigid body motions into the evaluation of EOM in absolute coordinates integrated with standard vector space integration schemes. The direct product group and the semidirect product group SO(3)xR3 and the semidirect product group SE(3) are used for representing rigid body motions. The key element is the local-global transitions (LGT) transition map, which facilitates the update of (global) absolute coordinates in terms of the (local) coordinates on the Lie group. This LGT map is specific to the absolute coordinates, the local coordinates on the Lie group, and the Lie group used to represent rigid body configurations.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Slot-Based Object-Centric Representations (SBOCR) outperform global and dense visual features for robotic manipulation generalization under distribution shifts like lighting changes and distractors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual representations for robotic manipulation (global and dense features) mix task-relevant and irrelevant information, leading to poor generalization under distribution shifts like lighting changes, texture variations, and distractors.

Method: Propose Slot-Based Object-Centric Representations (SBOCR) that group dense features into a finite set of object-like entities, reducing noise while preserving task-relevant information. Benchmark SBOCR against global and dense representations across simulated and real-world manipulation tasks.

Result: SBOCR-based policies outperform both dense and global representation-based policies in generalization settings across diverse visual conditions (lighting, texture, distractors), even without task-specific pretraining.

Conclusion: SBOCR is a promising direction for designing visual systems that generalize effectively in dynamic, real-world robotic environments, offering better structured representations than existing approaches.

Abstract: The generalization capabilities of robotic manipulation policies are heavily influenced by the choice of visual representations. Existing approaches typically rely on representations extracted from pre-trained encoders, using two dominant types of features: global features, which summarize an entire image via a single pooled vector, and dense features, which preserve a patch-wise embedding from the final encoder layer. While widely used, both feature types mix task-relevant and irrelevant information, leading to poor generalization under distribution shifts, such as changes in lighting, textures, or the presence of distractors. In this work, we explore an intermediate structured alternative: Slot-Based Object-Centric Representations (SBOCR), which group dense features into a finite set of object-like entities. This representation permits to naturally reduce the noise provided to the robotic manipulation policy while keeping enough information to efficiently perform the task. We benchmark a range of global and dense representations against intermediate slot-based representations, across a suite of simulated and real-world manipulation tasks ranging from simple to complex. We evaluate their generalization under diverse visual conditions, including changes in lighting, texture, and the presence of distractors. Our findings reveal that SBOCR-based policies outperform dense and global representation-based policies in generalization settings, even without task-specific pretraining. These insights suggest that SBOCR is a promising direction for designing visual systems that generalize effectively in dynamic, real-world robotic environments.

Abstract: Scaling data volume and diversity is critical for generalizing embodied intelligence. While synthetic data generation offers a scalable alternative to expensive physical data acquisition, existing pipelines remain fragmented and task-specific.

Motivation: Existing calibration methods use separate targets for visual and radar modalities, making correspondence establishment difficult. Manual labeling of sparse radar data is labor-intensive and unreliable, hindering development of radar-based perception algorithms.

Method: Introduces a dual-purpose calibration target with checkerboard pattern for camera detection and corner reflector for radar detection. Develops robust correspondence matching algorithm aligning checkerboard center with strongest radar reflection point. Creates auto-labeling pipeline that transfers annotations from camera-based segmentations to radar point clouds via geometric projection and multi-feature optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate high calibration accuracy and significant reduction in manual annotation effort.

Conclusion: 4D-CAAL accelerates development of robust multi-modal perception systems for autonomous driving by providing accurate calibration and efficient auto-labeling for 4D radar-camera systems.

Abstract: 4D radar has emerged as a critical sensor for autonomous driving, primarily due to its enhanced capabilities in elevation measurement and higher resolution compared to traditional 3D radar. Effective integration of 4D radar with cameras requires accurate extrinsic calibration, and the development of radar-based perception algorithms demands large-scale annotated datasets. However, existing calibration methods often employ separate targets optimized for either visual or radar modalities, complicating correspondence establishment. Furthermore, manually labeling sparse radar data is labor-intensive and unreliable. To address these challenges, we propose 4D-CAAL, a unified framework for 4D radar-camera calibration and auto-labeling. Our approach introduces a novel dual-purpose calibration target design, integrating a checkerboard pattern on the front surface for camera detection and a corner reflector at the center of the back surface for radar detection. We develop a robust correspondence matching algorithm that aligns the checkerboard center with the strongest radar reflection point, enabling accurate extrinsic calibration. Subsequently, we present an auto-labeling pipeline that leverages the calibrated sensor relationship to transfer annotations from camera-based segmentations to radar point clouds through geometric projection and multi-feature optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves high calibration accuracy while significantly reducing manual annotation effort, thereby accelerating the development of robust multi-modal perception systems for autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data collection and skill learning systems for dexterous manipulation suffer from low-dimensional tactile information, limiting their ability to generate comprehensive tactile-aware motions for contact-intensive tasks.

Method: DexTac uses kinesthetic teaching to capture multi-dimensional tactile data (contact force distributions and spatial contact regions) from human demonstrations, then integrates these rich tactile modalities into a policy network to create contact-aware agents.

Result: DexTac achieves 91.67% success rate on a challenging unimanual injection task, and outperforms force-only baselines by 31.67% in high-precision scenarios involving small-scale syringes.

Conclusion: Learning multi-dimensional tactile priors from human demonstrations is critical for achieving robust, human-like dexterous manipulation in contact-rich environments.

Abstract: For contact-intensive tasks, the ability to generate policies that produce comprehensive tactile-aware motions is essential. However, existing data collection and skill learning systems for dexterous manipulation often suffer from low-dimensional tactile information. To address this limitation, we propose DexTac, a visuo-tactile manipulation learning framework based on kinesthetic teaching. DexTac captures multi-dimensional tactile data-including contact force distributions and spatial contact regions-directly from human demonstrations. By integrating these rich tactile modalities into a policy network, the resulting contact-aware agent enables a dexterous hand to autonomously select and maintain optimal contact regions during complex interactions. We evaluate our framework on a challenging unimanual injection task. Experimental results demonstrate that DexTac achieves a 91.67% success rate. Notably, in high-precision scenarios involving small-scale syringes, our approach outperforms force-only baselines by 31.67%. These results underscore that learning multi-dimensional tactile priors from human demonstrations is critical for achieving robust, human-like dexterous manipulation in contact-rich environments.

TL;DR: MatchInformer improves occluded traffic agent prediction by integrating Hungarian matching to reduce redundant predictions and decoupling heading from motion for better trajectory forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Occluded traffic agents pose significant safety risks for autonomous vehicles, but existing methods produce redundant occupancy predictions that complicate planning and increase computational load.

Method: Introduces MatchInformer, a transformer-based approach building on SceneInformer that integrates Hungarian Matching for one-to-one prediction correspondence, decouples agent heading from motion, and uses MCC for evaluation in imbalanced scenarios.

Result: Experiments on Waymo Open Motion Dataset show improved reasoning about occluded regions and more accurate trajectory forecasts compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: MatchInformer effectively addresses redundancy in occluded agent prediction through Hungarian matching and heading decoupling, providing better performance for autonomous vehicle safety.

Abstract: Occluded traffic agents pose a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles, as hidden pedestrians or vehicles can appear unexpectedly, yet this problem remains understudied. Existing learning-based methods, while capable of inferring the presence of hidden agents, often produce redundant occupancy predictions where a single agent is identified multiple times. This issue complicates downstream planning and increases computational load. To address this, we introduce MatchInformer, a novel transformer-based approach that builds on the state-of-the-art SceneInformer architecture. Our method improves upon prior work by integrating Hungarian Matching, a state-of-the-art object matching algorithm from object detection, into the training process to enforce a one-to-one correspondence between predictions and ground truth, thereby reducing redundancy. We further refine trajectory forecasts by decoupling an agent's heading from its motion, a strategy that improves the accuracy and interpretability of predicted paths. To better handle class imbalances, we propose using the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) to evaluate occupancy predictions. By considering all entries in the confusion matrix, MCC provides a robust measure even in sparse or imbalanced scenarios. Experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that our approach improves reasoning about occluded regions and produces more accurate trajectory forecasts than prior methods.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: IROS is a real-time indoor navigation framework that combines fast reactive decisions with occasional VLM-based reasoning to achieve human-like semantic navigation on low-cost hardware with 66% lower latency than continuous VLM approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing indoor navigation methods have trade-offs: classical SLAM lacks semantic understanding, VLA models are purely reactive, and VLMs have high computational latency unsuitable for real-time embedded platforms. There's a need for a system that provides both fast responsiveness and robust semantic reasoning.

Method: IROS uses a Dual Process Theory-inspired architecture separating fast reflexive decisions (System One) from slow deliberative reasoning (System Two). It combines lightweight perceptual modules with compact VLMs augmented with spatial and textual cues, invoking the VLM only when necessary for complex reasoning tasks.

Result: Across five real-world buildings, IROS improves decision accuracy and reduces latency by 66% compared to continuous VLM-based navigation while maintaining robust semantic understanding.

Conclusion: IROS successfully demonstrates that combining efficient reactive modules with selective VLM-based reasoning enables real-time, human-like indoor navigation on low-cost hardware, bridging the gap between geometric and semantic approaches.

Abstract: Indoor mobile robot navigation requires fast responsiveness and robust semantic understanding, yet existing methods struggle to provide both. Classical geometric approaches such as SLAM offer reliable localization but depend on detailed maps and cannot interpret human-targeted cues (e.g., signs, room numbers) essential for indoor reasoning. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models introduce semantic grounding but remain strictly reactive, basing decisions only on visible frames and failing to anticipate unseen intersections or reason about distant textual cues. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide richer contextual inference but suffer from high computational latency, making them unsuitable for real-time operation on embedded platforms. In this work, we present IROS, a real-time navigation framework that combines VLM-level contextual reasoning with the efficiency of lightweight perceptual modules on low-cost, on-device hardware. Inspired by Dual Process Theory, IROS separates fast reflexive decisions (System One) from slow deliberative reasoning (System Two), invoking the VLM only when necessary. Furthermore, by augmenting compact VLMs with spatial and textual cues, IROS delivers robust, human-like navigation with minimal latency. Across five real-world buildings, IROS improves decision accuracy and reduces latency by 66% compared to continuous VLM-based navigation.

By co-designing hardware and learning algorithms, we train the system to achieve successful puck interactions through reinforcement learning in a remarkably small number of trials. The network leverages fixed random connectivity to capture the task's temporal structure and adopts a local e-prop learning rule in the readout layer to exploit event-driven activity for fast and efficient learning. The result is real-time learning with a setup comprising a computer and the neuromorphic chip in-the-loop, enabling practical training of spiking neural networks for robotic autonomous systems. This work bridges neuroscience-inspired hardware with real-world robotic control, showing that brain-inspired approaches can tackle fast-paced interaction tasks while supporting always-on learning in intelligent machines.

Motivation: Vision-Language-Action models have succeeded in ground-based robotics but remain unexplored for aerial manipulation systems, which face unique challenges including floating-base dynamics, UAV-manipulator coupling, and multi-step operational tasks.

Method: Created a physics-based simulation environment and released a high-quality multimodal dataset of 3000 manually teleoperated demonstrations covering base manipulation, object/spatial understanding, semantic reasoning, and long-horizon planning.

Conclusion: AIR-VLA establishes the first standardized testbed and data foundation for general-purpose aerial robotics research, bridging the gap between VLA models and aerial manipulation challenges.

Abstract: While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable success in ground-based embodied intelligence, their application to Aerial Manipulation Systems (AMS) remains a largely unexplored frontier. The inherent characteristics of AMS, including floating-base dynamics, strong coupling between the UAV and the manipulator, and the multi-step, long-horizon nature of operational tasks, pose severe challenges to existing VLA paradigms designed for static or 2D mobile bases. To bridge this gap, we propose AIR-VLA, the first VLA benchmark specifically tailored for aerial manipulation. We construct a physics-based simulation environment and release a high-quality multimodal dataset comprising 3000 manually teleoperated demonstrations, covering base manipulation, object & spatial understanding, semantic reasoning, and long-horizon planning. Leveraging this platform, we systematically evaluate mainstream VLA models and state-of-the-art VLM models. Our experiments not only validate the feasibility of transferring VLA paradigms to aerial systems but also, through multi-dimensional metrics tailored to aerial tasks, reveal the capabilities and boundaries of current models regarding UAV mobility, manipulator control, and high-level planning. AIR-VLA establishes a standardized testbed and data foundation for future research in general-purpose aerial robotics.

*Hao Ju,Shaofei Huang,Hongyu Li,Zihan Ding,Si Liu,Meng Wang,Zhedong Zheng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Sound-triggered mobile manipulation enables agents to actively perceive and interact with sound-emitting objects without explicit instructions, moving beyond traditional instruction-driven paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mobile manipulation research relies on predefined textual commands, confining agents to passive roles and limiting their autonomy and ability to react to dynamic environmental events.

Method: Developed Habitat-Echo data platform integrating acoustic rendering with physical interaction, and proposed a baseline with high-level task planner and low-level policy models for sound-triggered manipulation tasks.

Result: The baseline enables agents to actively detect and respond to auditory events without case-by-case instructions, successfully handling challenging dual-source scenarios by isolating primary sources from acoustic interference.

Conclusion: Sound-triggered mobile manipulation represents a significant advancement in agent autonomy, allowing active perception and interaction with sound-emitting objects in dynamic environments without explicit instructions.

Abstract: Current mobile manipulation research predominantly follows an instruction-driven paradigm, where agents rely on predefined textual commands to execute tasks. However, this setting confines agents to a passive role, limiting their autonomy and ability to react to dynamic environmental events. To address these limitations, we introduce sound-triggered mobile manipulation, where agents must actively perceive and interact with sound-emitting objects without explicit action instructions. To support these tasks, we develop Habitat-Echo, a data platform that integrates acoustic rendering with physical interaction. We further propose a baseline comprising a high-level task planner and low-level policy models to complete these tasks. Extensive experiments show that the proposed baseline empowers agents to actively detect and respond to auditory events, eliminating the need for case-by-case instructions. Notably, in the challenging dual-source scenario, the agent successfully isolates the primary source from overlapping acoustic interference to execute the first interaction, and subsequently proceeds to manipulate the secondary object, verifying the robustness of the baseline.

Conclusion: CoFreeVLA effectively enhances safety in dual-arm manipulation by integrating collision risk estimation into VLA models, demonstrating practical improvements in real-world bimanual tasks.

Abstract: Vision Language Action (VLA) models enable instruction following manipulation, yet dualarm deployment remains unsafe due to under modeled selfcollisions between arms and grasped objects.

*Donatien Delehelle,Fei Chen,Darwin Caldwell*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes efficient modular RL for cloth manipulation using careful design choices to reduce model size/training time while enabling sim-to-real transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cloth manipulation RL approaches use large models with long training times and end-to-end learning from images, incurring high computational costs and lossy state representations.

Method: Efficient modular RL approach with careful design choices to reduce model size and training time in simulation, enabling transfer to real world.

Result: Achieves significant performance improvements over baselines on SoftGym benchmark while using substantially smaller model.

Conclusion: Questions common end-to-end design choices and demonstrates efficient modular RL can overcome computational barriers for cloth manipulation.

Abstract: Cloth manipulation is a ubiquitous task in everyday life, but it remains an open challenge for robotics. The difficulties in developing cloth manipulation policies are attributed to the high-dimensional state space, complex dynamics, and high propensity to self-occlusion exhibited by fabrics. As analytical methods have not been able to provide robust and general manipulation policies, reinforcement learning (RL) is considered a promising approach to these problems. However, to address the large state space and complex dynamics, data-based methods usually rely on large models and long training times. The resulting computational cost significantly hampers the development and adoption of these methods. Additionally, due to the challenge of robust state estimation, garment manipulation policies often adopt an end-to-end learning approach with workspace images as input. While this approach enables a conceptually straightforward sim-to-real transfer via real-world fine-tuning, it also incurs a significant computational cost by training agents on a highly lossy representation of the environment state. This paper questions this common design choice by exploring an efficient and modular approach to RL for cloth manipulation. We show that, through careful design choices, model size and training time can be significantly reduced when learning in simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the resulting simulation-trained model can be transferred to the real world. We evaluate our approach on the SoftGym benchmark and achieve significant performance improvements over available baselines on our task, while using a substantially smaller model.

Abstract: This article describes GAZELOAD, a multimodal dataset for mental workload estimation in industrial human-robot collaboration. The data were collected in a laboratory assembly testbed where 26 participants interacted with two collaborative robots (UR5 and Franka Emika Panda) while wearing Meta ARIA smart glasses. The dataset time-synchronizes eye-tracking signals (pupil diameter, fixations, saccades, eye gaze, gaze transition entropy, fixation dispersion index) with environmental real-time and continuous measurements (illuminance) and task and robot context (bench, task block, induced faults), under controlled manipulations of task difficulty and ambient conditions. For each participant and workload-graded task block, we provide CSV files with ocular metrics aggregated into 250 ms windows, environmental logs, and self-reported mental workload ratings on a 1-10 Likert scale, organized in participant-specific folders alongside documentation. These data can be used to develop and benchmark algorithms for mental workload estimation, feature extraction, and temporal modeling in realistic industrial HRC scenarios, and to investigate the influence of environmental factors such as lighting on eye-based workload markers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hybrid planner switching frameworks for autonomous driving fail to make reliable mode transitions or sustain efficient driving in congested environments due to heuristic scene recognition and low-frequency control updates.

Method: Proposes LAP: LLM-driven adaptive planning method that switches between high-speed driving (low-complexity scenes) and precise driving (high-complexity scenes). Uses LLM for scene understanding and integrates inference into joint optimization of mode configuration and motion planning, solved using tree-search model predictive control and alternating minimization.

Result: High-fidelity simulation results show LAP outperforms other benchmarks in both driving time and success rate.

Conclusion: LAP effectively reconciles high-speed driving efficiency with safe maneuvering in dense traffic through LLM-driven adaptive planning and joint optimization.

Abstract: Hybrid planner switching framework (HPSF) for autonomous driving needs to reconcile high-speed driving efficiency with safe maneuvering in dense traffic. Existing HPSF methods often fail to make reliable mode transitions or sustain efficient driving in congested environments, owing to heuristic scene recognition and low-frequency control updates. To address the limitation, this paper proposes LAP, a large language model (LLM) driven, adaptive planning method, which switches between high-speed driving in low-complexity scenes and precise driving in high-complexity scenes, enabling high qualities of trajectory generation through confined gaps. This is achieved by leveraging LLM for scene understanding and integrating its inference into the joint optimization of mode configuration and motion planning. The joint optimization is solved using tree-search model predictive control and alternating minimization. We implement LAP by Python in Robot Operating System (ROS). High-fidelity simulation results show that the proposed LAP outperforms other benchmarks in terms of both driving time and success rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous single-module MANTA-RAY systems with four actuators had limited scalability; need for distributed, modular systems that maintain manipulation performance while reducing actuator density for practical applications.

Method: Distributed modular platform with geometric transformation driven PID controller that maps tilt-angle control outputs directly to actuator commands, eliminating need for data-driven training; employs object passing between modules.

Result: Successfully manipulates diverse objects (eggs, apples) with varying geometries, masses, and textures; enables parallel manipulation; validated in simulation (3x3, 4x4) and physical 2x2 hardware prototype.

Conclusion: Multi-module MANTA-RAY improves scalability and enables coordinated manipulation of multiple objects across larger areas, highlighting potential for practical real-world applications.

Abstract: Manipulation surfaces control objects by actively deforming their shape rather than directly grasping them. While dense actuator arrays can generate complex deformations, they also introduce high degrees of freedom (DOF), increasing system complexity and limiting scalability. The MANTA-RAY (Manipulation with Adaptive Non-rigid Textile Actuation with Reduced Actuation densitY) platform addresses these challenges by leveraging a soft, fabric-based surface with reduced actuator density to manipulate fragile and heterogeneous objects. Previous studies focused on single-module implementations supported by four actuators, whereas the feasibility and benefits of a scalable, multi-module configuration remain unexplored. In this work, we present a distributed, modular, and scalable variant of the MANTA-RAY platform that maintains manipulation performance with a reduced actuator density. The proposed multi-module MANTA-RAY platform and control strategy employs object passing between modules and a geometric transformation driven PID controller that directly maps tilt-angle control outputs to actuator commands, eliminating the need for extensive data-driven or black-box training. We evaluate system performance in simulation across surface configurations of varying modules (3x3 and 4x4) and validate its feasibility through experiments on a physical 2x2 hardware prototype. The system successfully manipulates objects with diverse geometries, masses, and textures including fragile items such as eggs and apples as well as enabling parallel manipulation. The results demonstrate that the multi-module MANTA-RAY improves scalability and enables coordinated manipulation of multiple objects across larger areas, highlighting its potential for practical, real-world applications.

TL;DR: Proposes Variational Regularization (VR) to reduce noise in diffusion-based visuomotor policies by applying timestep-conditioned Gaussian constraints on backbone features, improving performance across simulation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based visuomotor policies use oversized denoising decoders that introduce redundancy and task-irrelevant noise in intermediate features, which hurts performance despite increased model capacity.

Method: Introduces Variational Regularization (VR) - a lightweight module that imposes a timestep-conditioned Gaussian distribution over backbone features and applies KL-divergence regularization, creating an adaptive information bottleneck to filter noise.

Result: Improves success rates by 6.1% on RoboTwin2.0 and 4.1% on Adroit and MetaWorld benchmarks compared to baseline DP3, achieving state-of-the-art results. Real-world experiments confirm practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: VR effectively reduces noise in intermediate features of diffusion-based policies through variational regularization, leading to significant performance improvements across multiple robotic skill learning benchmarks.

Abstract: Diffusion-based visuomotor policies built on 3D visual representations have achieved strong performance in learning complex robotic skills. However, most existing methods employ an oversized denoising decoder. While increasing model capacity can improve denoising, empirical evidence suggests that it also introduces redundancy and noise in intermediate feature blocks. Crucially, we find that randomly masking backbone features at inference time (without changing training) can improve performance, confirming the presence of task-irrelevant noise in intermediate features. To this end, we propose Variational Regularization (VR), a lightweight module that imposes a timestep-conditioned Gaussian over backbone features and applies a KL-divergence regularizer, forming an adaptive information bottleneck. Extensive experiments on three simulation benchmarks (RoboTwin2.0, Adroit, and MetaWorld) show that, compared to the baseline DP3, our approach improves the success rate by 6.1% on RoboTwin2.0 and by 4.1% on Adroit and MetaWorld, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Real-world experiments further demonstrate that our method performs well in practical deployments. Code will released.

TL;DR: A supervised Mixture-of-Experts architecture boosts surgical robot learning from limited demonstrations (under 150) using only stereo endoscopic images, achieving superior performance and robustness in bowel grasping tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation learning for surgical robotics faces challenges due to data scarcity, constrained workspaces, and high safety requirements. Current approaches need extensive demonstrations or complex setups, limiting practical deployment.

Method: A supervised Mixture-of-Experts architecture added to autonomous policies (like Action Chunking Transformer) that learns from under 150 demonstrations using only stereo endoscopic images for phase-structured surgical manipulation tasks.

Result: The MoE-enhanced ACT significantly outperforms standard ACT and generalist VLA models, achieving higher success rates in-distribution and superior robustness to out-of-distribution scenarios (novel grasp locations, reduced illumination, occlusions). It generalizes to unseen viewpoints and transfers zero-shot to ex vivo porcine tissue.

Conclusion: The supervised MoE architecture enables effective surgical robot learning from limited demonstrations, offering a promising pathway toward in vivo deployment with demonstrated preliminary success in porcine surgery.

Abstract: Imitation learning has achieved remarkable success in robotic manipulation, yet its application to surgical robotics remains challenging due to data scarcity, constrained workspaces, and the need for an exceptional level of safety and predictability. We present a supervised Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture designed for phase-structured surgical manipulation tasks, which can be added on top of any autonomous policy. Unlike prior surgical robot learning approaches that rely on multi-camera setups or thousands of demonstrations, we show that a lightweight action decoder policy like Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) can learn complex, long-horizon manipulation from less than 150 demonstrations using solely stereo endoscopic images, when equipped with our architecture. We evaluate our approach on the collaborative surgical task of bowel grasping and retraction, where a robot assistant interprets visual cues from a human surgeon, executes targeted grasping on deformable tissue, and performs sustained retraction. We benchmark our method against state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and the standard ACT baseline. Our results show that generalist VLAs fail to acquire the task entirely, even under standard in-distribution conditions. Furthermore, while standard ACT achieves moderate success in-distribution, adopting a supervised MoE architecture significantly boosts its performance, yielding higher success rates in-distribution and demonstrating superior robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, including novel grasp locations, reduced illumination, and partial occlusions. Notably, it generalizes to unseen testing viewpoints and also transfers zero-shot to ex vivo porcine tissue without additional training, offering a promising pathway toward in vivo deployment. To support this, we present qualitative preliminary results of policy roll-outs during in vivo porcine surgery.

TL;DR: First macro-scale origami rotary motor that folds flat and unfurls to operate, using corona discharge for torque production.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foldable robots need actuators that can fold with the structure; existing foldable robots use linear actuators or non-folding rotary motors, lacking a folding continuous rotary actuator at macro-scale.

Method: Developed origami rotary motor using corona discharge for torque production, designed to fold flat and then unfurl for operation.

Result: Prototype achieved 2.5:1 expansion ratio, reached 1440 rpm at -29 kV, with maximum output torque over 0.15 mN·m and active component torque density of 0.04 Nm/kg.

Conclusion: Successfully demonstrated the first macro-scale origami rotary motor, enabling foldable robots with integrated folding rotary actuators for improved packability and shape adaptability.

Abstract: Foldable robots have been an active area of robotics research due to their high volume-to-mass ratio, easy packability, and shape adaptability. For locomotion, previously developed foldable robots have either embedded linear actuators in, or attached non-folding rotary motors to, their structure. Further, those actuators directly embedded in the structure of the folding medium all contributed to linear or folding motion, not to continuous rotary motion. On the macro-scale there has not yet been a folding continuous rotary actuator. This paper details the development and testing of the first macro-scale origami rotary motor that can be folded flat, and then unfurled to operate. Using corona discharge for torque production, the prototype motor achieved an expansion ratio of 2.5:1, reached a top speed of 1440 rpm when driven at -29 kV, and exhibited a maximum output torque over 0.15 mN m with an active component torque density of 0.04 Nm/kg.

Motivation: Existing 3D vision-based diffusion policies suffer from architectural mismatch where tiny point-cloud encoders are paired with massive decoders, leading to parameter waste in the decoder given compact scene representations.

Method: Proposes PocketDP3 with lightweight Diffusion Mixer (DiM) built on MLP-Mixer blocks instead of heavy conditional U-Net decoders, enabling efficient fusion across temporal and channel dimensions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across RoboTwin2.0, Adroit, and MetaWorld benchmarks with fewer than 1% of prior methods' parameters, accelerates inference, and supports two-step inference without consistency distillation.

Conclusion: PocketDP3 demonstrates that compact 3D diffusion policies can match or exceed performance of larger models while being more practical for real-time deployment and real-world applications.

Abstract: Recently, 3D vision-based diffusion policies have shown strong capability in learning complex robotic manipulation skills. However, a common architectural mismatch exists in these models: a tiny yet efficient point-cloud encoder is often paired with a massive decoder. Given a compact scene representation, we argue that this may lead to substantial parameter waste in the decoder. Motivated by this observation, we propose PocketDP3, a pocket-scale 3D diffusion policy that replaces the heavy conditional U-Net decoder used in prior methods with a lightweight Diffusion Mixer (DiM) built on MLP-Mixer blocks. This architecture enables efficient fusion across temporal and channel dimensions, significantly reducing model size. Notably, without any additional consistency distillation techniques, our method supports two-step inference without sacrificing performance, improving practicality for real-time deployment. Across three simulation benchmarks--RoboTwin2.0, Adroit, and MetaWorld--PocketDP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer than 1% of the parameters of prior methods, while also accelerating inference. Real-world experiments further demonstrate the practicality and transferability of our method in real-world settings. Code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sEMG-based intent detection for stroke rehabilitation requires lengthy subject-specific calibration and is brittle to variability. There's a need to reduce calibration burden while improving robustness.

Method: Propose healthy-to-stroke adaptation pipeline: pretrain model on large-scale able-bodied sEMG data, then fine-tune for each stroke participant using small amount of subject-specific data. Compare adaptation strategies including head-only tuning, LoRA adapters, and full fine-tuning.

Result: Healthy-pretrained adaptation consistently improves stroke intent detection across conditions. Best methods improve average transition accuracy from 0.42 to 0.61 and raw accuracy from 0.69 to 0.78, outperforming both zero-shot transfer and stroke-only training.

Conclusion: Transferring reusable healthy-domain EMG representations can reduce calibration burden while improving robustness for real-time post-stroke intent detection, making sEMG-based rehabilitation more practical.

Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) is a promising control signal for assist-as-needed hand rehabilitation after stroke, but detecting intent from paretic muscles often requires lengthy, subject-specific calibration and remains brittle to variability. We propose a healthy-to-stroke adaptation pipeline that initializes an intent detector from a model pretrained on large-scale able-bodied sEMG, then fine-tunes it for each stroke participant using only a small amount of subject-specific data. Using a newly collected dataset from three individuals with chronic stroke, we compare adaptation strategies (head-only tuning, parameter-efficient LoRA adapters, and full end-to-end fine-tuning) and evaluate on held-out test sets that include realistic distribution shifts such as within-session drift, posture changes, and armband repositioning. Across conditions, healthy-pretrained adaptation consistently improves stroke intent detection relative to both zero-shot transfer and stroke-only training under the same data budget; the best adaptation methods improve average transition accuracy from 0.42 to 0.61 and raw accuracy from 0.69 to 0.78. These results suggest that transferring a reusable healthy-domain EMG representation can reduce calibration burden while improving robustness for real-time post-stroke intent detection.

Abstract: Manipulating dynamic objects remains an open challenge for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which, despite strong generalization in static manipulation, struggle in dynamic scenarios requiring rapid perception, temporal anticipation, and continuous control. We present DynamicVLA, a framework for dynamic object manipulation that integrates temporal reasoning and closed-loop adaptation through three key designs: 1) a compact 0.4B VLA using a convolutional vision encoder for spatially efficient, structurally faithful encoding, enabling fast multimodal inference; 2) Continuous Inference, enabling overlapping reasoning and execution for lower latency and timely adaptation to object motion; and 3) Latent-aware Action Streaming, which bridges the perception-execution gap by enforcing temporally aligned action execution. To fill the missing foundation of dynamic manipulation data, we introduce the Dynamic Object Manipulation (DOM) benchmark, built from scratch with an auto data collection pipeline that efficiently gathers 200K synthetic episodes across 2.8K scenes and 206 objects, and enables fast collection of 2K real-world episodes without teleoperation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate remarkable improvements in response speed, perception, and generalization, positioning DynamicVLA as a unified framework for general dynamic object manipulation across embodiments.
