Their prohibitive computational and memory costs\nseverely hinder real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has\nbecome a common practice for compressing and accelerating models. However, we\nempirically observe that PTQ faces unique obstacles when compressing\nbillion-scale VGGTs: the data-independent special tokens induce heavy-tailed\nactivation distributions, while the multi-view nature of 3D data makes\ncalibration sample selection highly unstable. This paper proposes the first\nQuantization framework for VGGTs, namely QuantVGGT. This mainly relies on two\ntechnical contributions: First, we introduce Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained\nQuantization, which integrates pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local\nchannel smoothing to mitigate heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel\nvariance robustly. Second, we design Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling, which\nfilters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse\ncalibration clusters to ensure stable quantization ranges. Comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate that QuantVGGT achieves the state-of-the-art results\nacross different benchmarks and bit-width, surpassing the previous\nstate-of-the-art generic quantization method with a great margin.
