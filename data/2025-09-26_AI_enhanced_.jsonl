We highlight\nthat our 4-bit QuantVGGT can deliver a 3.7$\\times$ memory reduction and\n2.5$\\times$ acceleration in real-hardware inference, while maintaining\nreconstruction accuracy above 98\\% of its full-precision counterpart. This\ndemonstrates the vast advantages and practicality of QuantVGGT in\nresource-constrained scenarios.

Despite recent advances,\nstate-of-the-art models often produce unrealistic motions, such as objects\nfalling upward, or abrupt changes in velocity and direction. Moreover, these\nmodels lack precise parameter control, struggling to generate physically\nconsistent dynamics under different initial conditions. We argue that this\nfundamental limitation stems from current models learning motion distributions\nsolely from appearance, while lacking an understanding of the underlying\ndynamics. In this work, we propose NewtonGen, a framework that integrates\ndata-driven synthesis with learnable physical principles. At its core lies\ntrainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND), which can model and predict a\nvariety of Newtonian motions, thereby injecting latent dynamical constraints\ninto the video generation process. By jointly leveraging data priors and\ndynamical guidance, NewtonGen enables physically consistent video synthesis\nwith precise parameter control.", "AI": {"tldr": "NewtonGen is a framework that integrates data-driven synthesis with learnable physical principles to address physical inconsistency in text-to-video generation.", "motivation": "Current text-to-video models produce unrealistic motions and lack precise parameter control due to learning motion distributions solely from appearance without understanding underlying dynamics.", "method": "Proposes trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND) that models Newtonian motions and injects latent dynamical constraints into video generation, combining data priors with dynamical guidance.", "result": "Enables physically consistent video synthesis with precise parameter control by jointly leveraging data-driven synthesis and physical principles.", "conclusion": "NewtonGen addresses fundamental limitations in text-to-video generation by incorporating learnable physical dynamics, improving physical consistency and controllability."}}
