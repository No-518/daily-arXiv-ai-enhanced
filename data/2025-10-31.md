### [1] [Enhancing Underwater Object Detection through Spatio-Temporal Analysis and Spatial Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25797)
*Sai Likhith Karri,Ansh Saxena*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates spatio-temporal modeling and spatial attention mechanisms in underwater object detection, comparing YOLOv5, T-YOLOv5, and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM, showing significant improvements in detection accuracy for complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve underwater object detection accuracy in dynamic marine environments with challenges like sudden movements, partial occlusions, and gradual motion.

Method: Two-phase approach: first evaluating temporal-enhanced T-YOLOv5 vs standard YOLOv5, then developing T-YOLOv5 with CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) for enhanced spatial attention.

Result: T-YOLOv5 (mAP@50-95: 0.813) and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM (mAP@50-95: 0.811) significantly outperformed standard YOLOv5 (mAP@50-95: 0.563), with CBAM providing additional benefits in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: Temporal modeling significantly enhances detection reliability, while CBAM further improves performance in complex scenarios, though with some accuracy loss in simpler cases.

Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of spatio-temporal modeling and the
integration of spatial attention mechanisms in deep learning models for
underwater object detection. Specifically, in the first phase, the performance
of temporal-enhanced YOLOv5 variant T-YOLOv5 is evaluated, in comparison with
the standard YOLOv5. For the second phase, an augmented version of T-YOLOv5 is
developed, through the addition of a Convolutional Block Attention Module
(CBAM). By examining the effectiveness of the already pre-existing YOLOv5 and
T-YOLOv5 models and of the newly developed T-YOLOv5 with CBAM. With CBAM, the
research highlights how temporal modeling improves detection accuracy in
dynamic marine environments, particularly under conditions of sudden movements,
partial occlusions, and gradual motion. The testing results showed that YOLOv5
achieved a mAP@50-95 of 0.563, while T-YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
outperformed with mAP@50-95 scores of 0.813 and 0.811, respectively,
highlighting their superior accuracy and generalization in detecting complex
objects. The findings demonstrate that T-YOLOv5 significantly enhances
detection reliability compared to the standard model, while T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
further improves performance in challenging scenarios, although there is a loss
of accuracy when it comes to simpler scenarios.

### [2] [MIRO: MultI-Reward cOnditioned pretraining improves T2I quality and efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25897)
*Nicolas Dufour,Lucas Degeorge,Arijit Ghosh,Vicky Kalogeiton,David Picard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIRO conditions text-to-image models on multiple reward models during training instead of post-hoc selection, improving visual quality, training speed, and achieving SOTA performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models trained on uncurated datasets don't align well with user preferences, and post-hoc reward-based selection methods harm diversity, semantic fidelity, and efficiency by discarding data.

Method: Condition the model on multiple reward models during training to directly learn user preferences, rather than using post-processing selection methods.

Result: Dramatically improves visual quality of generated images, significantly speeds up training, and achieves state-of-the-art performances on GenEval compositional benchmark and user-preference scores (PickAScore, ImageReward, HPSv2).

Conclusion: Direct conditioning on multiple reward models during training is more effective than post-hoc selection for aligning text-to-image generation with user preferences while maintaining quality and efficiency.

Abstract: Current text-to-image generative models are trained on large uncurated
datasets to enable diverse generation capabilities. However, this does not
align well with user preferences. Recently, reward models have been
specifically designed to perform post-hoc selection of generated images and
align them to a reward, typically user preference. This discarding of
informative data together with the optimizing for a single reward tend to harm
diversity, semantic fidelity and efficiency. Instead of this post-processing,
we propose to condition the model on multiple reward models during training to
let the model learn user preferences directly. We show that this not only
dramatically improves the visual quality of the generated images but it also
significantly speeds up the training. Our proposed method, called MIRO,
achieves state-of-the-art performances on the GenEval compositional benchmark
and user-preference scores (PickAScore, ImageReward, HPSv2).

*Denniz Goren,Holger Caesar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper develops a 3D LiDAR segmentation approach for bicycle safety using a custom dataset (BikeScenes-lidarseg) and shows that domain-specific training significantly outperforms automotive pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cyclist vulnerability is increasing with the popularity of faster e-bikes, motivating the adaptation of automotive perception technologies for bicycle safety applications.

Result: Fine-tuning on BikeScenes dataset achieved 63.6% mIoU, significantly outperforming the 13.8% mIoU obtained with SemanticKITTI pre-training alone, demonstrating the effectiveness of domain-specific training.

Conclusion: Domain-specific training is essential for bicycle-mounted perception systems, and the BikeScenes dataset provides a valuable resource for advancing cyclist-centric LiDAR segmentation research.

Abstract: The vulnerability of cyclists, exacerbated by the rising popularity of faster
e-bikes, motivates adapting automotive perception technologies for bicycle
safety. We use our multi-sensor 'SenseBike' research platform to develop and
evaluate a 3D LiDAR segmentation approach tailored to bicycles. To bridge the
automotive-to-bicycle domain gap, we introduce the novel BikeScenes-lidarseg
Dataset, comprising 3021 consecutive LiDAR scans around the university campus
of the TU Delft, semantically annotated for 29 dynamic and static classes. By
evaluating model performance, we demonstrate that fine-tuning on our BikeScenes
dataset achieves a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 63.6%, significantly
outperforming the 13.8% obtained with SemanticKITTI pre-training alone. This
result underscores the necessity and effectiveness of domain-specific training.
We highlight key challenges specific to bicycle-mounted, hardware-constrained
perception systems and contribute the BikeScenes dataset as a resource for
advancing research in cyclist-centric LiDAR segmentation.

### [4] [Generative Image Restoration and Super-Resolution using Physics-Informed Synthetic Data for Scanning Tunneling Microscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25921)
*Nikola L. Kolev,Tommaso Rodani,Neil J. Curson,Taylor J. Z. Stock,Alberto Cazzaniga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Machine learning approach using physics-informed synthetic data to repair and enhance STM images, enabling faster acquisition and reduced tip conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STM faces limitations from tip degradation and slow serial data acquisition, requiring frequent tip conditioning procedures.

Method: Used 36 pristine experimental images of Si(001):H with physics-informed synthetic data generation to train flow-matching and diffusion models.

Result: Models effectively restored images and offered 2-4x reduction in image acquisition time by reconstructing from sparse data, validated by CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy and structural similarity metrics.

Conclusion: The framework can significantly increase STM experimental throughput by reducing tip-conditioning frequency and enhancing frame rates in high-speed STM systems.

Abstract: Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) enables atomic-resolution imaging and
atom manipulation, but its utility is often limited by tip degradation and slow
serial data acquisition. Fabrication adds another layer of complexity since the
tip is often subjected to large voltages, which may alter the shape of its
apex, requiring it to be conditioned. Here, we propose a machine learning (ML)
approach for image repair and super-resolution to alleviate both challenges.
Using a dataset of only 36 pristine experimental images of Si(001):H, we
demonstrate that a physics-informed synthetic data generation pipeline can be
used to train several state-of-the-art flow-matching and diffusion models.
Quantitative evaluation with metrics such as the CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(CMMD) score and structural similarity demonstrates that our models are able to
effectively restore images and offer a two- to fourfold reduction in image
acquisition time by accurately reconstructing images from sparsely sampled
data. Our framework has the potential to significantly increase STM
experimental throughput by offering a route to reducing the frequency of
tip-conditioning procedures and to enhancing frame rates in existing high-speed
STM systems.

### [5] [SplitFlow: Flow Decomposition for Inversion-Free Text-to-Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25970)
*Sung-Hoon Yoon,Minghan Li,Gaspard Beaudouin,Congcong Wen,Muhammad Rafay Azhar,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a flow decomposition-and-aggregation framework for image editing that addresses limitations of rectified flow models, specifically inaccurate inversion and gradient entanglement issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rectified flow models have strong generative capabilities but face critical limitations in image editing tasks, including inaccurate inversion processes and gradient entanglement that result in outputs not faithfully reflecting target prompts.

Method: A flow decomposition-and-aggregation framework that semantically decomposes target prompts into sub-prompts, computes independent flows for each, and aggregates them using a projection and soft-aggregation mechanism inspired by gradient conflict resolution in multi-task learning.

Result: Experimental results show the method outperforms existing zero-shot editing approaches in terms of semantic fidelity and attribute disentanglement.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses inversion and gradient entanglement issues in rectified flow models for image editing, preserving both diversity and consistency in edited outputs.

Abstract: Rectified flow models have become a de facto standard in image generation due
to their stable sampling trajectories and high-fidelity outputs. Despite their
strong generative capabilities, they face critical limitations in image editing
tasks: inaccurate inversion processes for mapping real images back into the
latent space, and gradient entanglement issues during editing often result in
outputs that do not faithfully reflect the target prompt. Recent efforts have
attempted to directly map source and target distributions via ODE-based
approaches without inversion; however,these methods still yield suboptimal
editing quality. In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation
framework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these
limitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into
multiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them
to form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that
decomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,
generating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance
toward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and
soft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution
in multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target
velocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct
directions, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final
edited output. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing zero-shot editing approaches in terms of semantic fidelity and
attribute disentanglement. The code is available at

### [6] [Brain-IT: Image Reconstruction from fMRI via Brain-Interaction Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25976)
*Roman Beliy,Amit Zalcher,Jonathan Kogman,Navve Wasserman,Michal Irani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Brain-IT is a brain-inspired fMRI-to-image reconstruction method using a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT) that enables faithful image reconstruction from fMRI data with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fMRI image reconstruction methods often lack faithfulness to actual seen images, and existing approaches require large amounts of training data.

Method: Uses Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT) with functional brain-voxel clusters shared across subjects, predicting both high-level semantic features and low-level structural features to guide diffusion models for image reconstruction.

Result: Achieves faithful image reconstructions that surpass current state-of-the-art approaches both visually and by objective metrics, and achieves comparable results with only 1-hour of fMRI data vs. 40-hour recordings required by current methods.

Conclusion: Brain-IT provides an effective brain-inspired approach for fMRI image reconstruction that is both faithful and data-efficient, enabling accurate reconstruction with minimal training data.

Abstract: Reconstructing images seen by people from their fMRI brain recordings
provides a non-invasive window into the human brain. Despite recent progress
enabled by diffusion models, current methods often lack faithfulness to the
actual seen images. We present "Brain-IT", a brain-inspired approach that
addresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT),
allowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar
brain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as
building blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All
model components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient
training with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT
predicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level
semantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic
content of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to
initialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image.
BIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to
localized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image
reconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and
surpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective
metrics. Moreover, with only 1-hour of fMRI data from a new subject, we achieve
results comparable to current methods trained on full 40-hour recordings.

### [7] [Fine-tuning Segment Anything for Real-Time Tumor Tracking in Cine-MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25990)
*Valentin Boussot,Cédric Hémon,Jean-Claude Nunes,Jean-Louis Dillenseger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a real-time tumor tracking method for cine-MRI using SAM 2.1 foundation model with mask-based prompts, achieving 0.8794 Dice score and ranking 6th in TrackRAD2025 challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the TrackRAD2025 challenge of real-time tumor tracking in thoracic and abdominal cine-MRI sequences under strong data scarcity constraints.

Method: Used SAM 2.1 foundation model with mask-based prompts from first annotated slice, fine-tuned on small labeled dataset. Applied balanced Dice + IoU loss with 1024x1024 patches, standard augmentations, and low uniform learning rate to preserve generalization.

Result: Achieved Dice score of 0.8794 on hidden test set, ranking 6th overall in TrackRAD2025 challenge.

Conclusion: Foundation models show strong potential for accurate and real-time tumor tracking in MRI-guided radiotherapy, demonstrating effectiveness even with limited training data.

Abstract: In this work, we address the TrackRAD2025 challenge of real-time tumor
tracking in cine-MRI sequences of the thoracic and abdominal regions under
strong data scarcity constraints. Two complementary strategies were explored:
(i) unsupervised registration with the IMPACT similarity metric and (ii)
foundation model-based segmentation leveraging SAM 2.1 and its recent variants
through prompt-based interaction. Due to the one-second runtime constraint, the
SAM-based method was ultimately selected. The final configuration used SAM2.1
b+ with mask-based prompts from the first annotated slice, fine-tuned solely on
the small labeled subset from TrackRAD2025. Training was configured to minimize
overfitting, using 1024x1024 patches (batch size 1), standard augmentations,
and a balanced Dice + IoU loss. A low uniform learning rate (0.0001) was
applied to all modules (prompt encoder, decoder, Hiera backbone) to preserve
generalization while adapting to annotator-specific styles. Training lasted 300
epochs (~12h on RTX A6000, 48GB). The same inference strategy was consistently
applied across all anatomical sites and MRI field strengths. Test-time
augmentation was considered but ultimately discarded due to negligible
performance gains. The final model was selected based on the highest Dice
Similarity Coefficient achieved on the validation set after fine-tuning. On the
hidden test set, the model reached a Dice score of 0.8794, ranking 6th overall
in the TrackRAD2025 challenge. These results highlight the strong potential of
foundation models for accurate and real-time tumor tracking in MRI-guided
radiotherapy.

### [8] [Larger Hausdorff Dimension in Scanning Pattern Facilitates Mamba-Based Methods in Low-Light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26001)
*Xinhua Wang,Caibo Feng,Xiangjun Fu,Chunxiao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Hilbert Selective Scan mechanism to enhance Mamba framework by increasing Hausdorff dimension of scanning pattern, improving feature space exploration and fine-scale detail capture for low-light image enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address information inconsistencies in existing Mamba-based methods and improve spatial locality for capturing subtle local interactions while maintaining long-range dependency handling capabilities.

Method: Introduces a novel Hilbert Selective Scan mechanism that increases the Hausdorff dimension of Mamba's scanning pattern, enabling more effective feature space exploration and refined spatial locality.

Result: Significantly improves both quantitative metrics and qualitative visual fidelity of existing Mamba-based low-light image enhancement methods, while reducing computational resource consumption and shortening inference time.

Conclusion: The refined strategy advances state-of-the-art in low-light image enhancement and shows promise for broader applications in fields using Mamba-based techniques.

Abstract: We propose an innovative enhancement to the Mamba framework by increasing the
Hausdorff dimension of its scanning pattern through a novel Hilbert Selective
Scan mechanism. This mechanism explores the feature space more effectively,
capturing intricate fine-scale details and improving overall coverage. As a
result, it mitigates information inconsistencies while refining spatial
locality to better capture subtle local interactions without sacrificing the
model's ability to handle long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments on
publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves both the quantitative metrics and qualitative visual fidelity of
existing Mamba-based low-light image enhancement methods, all while reducing
computational resource consumption and shortening inference time. We believe
that this refined strategy not only advances the state-of-the-art in low-light
image enhancement but also holds promise for broader applications in fields
that leverage Mamba-based techniques.

Method: Created CAVE benchmark with fine-grained annotations for visual grounding and categorizing anomalies based on visual manifestations, complexity, severity, and commonness, drawing inspiration from cognitive science research on human anomaly perception.

Result: State-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even with advanced prompting strategies.

Conclusion: CAVE serves as a valuable resource for advancing research in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in VLMs by providing a realistic and cognitively grounded benchmark.

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify, reason about, and explain anomalies in their
environment. In computer vision, this long-standing challenge remains limited
to industrial defects or unrealistic, synthetically generated anomalies,
failing to capture the richness and unpredictability of real-world anomalies.
In this work, we introduce CAVE, the first benchmark of real-world visual
anomalies. CAVE supports three open-ended tasks: anomaly description,
explanation, and justification; with fine-grained annotations for visual
grounding and categorizing anomalies based on their visual manifestations,
their complexity, severity, and commonness. These annotations draw inspiration
from cognitive science research on how humans identify and resolve anomalies,
providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) in detecting and understanding anomalies. We show that state-of-the-art
VLMs struggle with visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even
with advanced prompting strategies. By offering a realistic and cognitively
grounded benchmark, CAVE serves as a valuable resource for advancing research
in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in VLMs.

*Bilal Hassan,Areg Karapetyan,Aaron Chung Hin Chow,Samer Madanat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight CNN model predicts coastal flooding under sea-level rise scenarios, reducing prediction errors by 20% compared to state-of-the-art methods and generalizing across different geographic regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change and sea-level rise threaten coastal cities, but traditional physics-based simulators are computationally expensive and impractical for city-scale planning. Deep learning alternatives face data scarcity and high-dimensional output challenges.

Method: Developed a novel, lightweight CNN-based model using a vision-based, low-resource DL framework to predict coastal flooding under variable SLR projections and shoreline adaptation scenarios. Tested generalization using datasets from Abu Dhabi and San Francisco.

Result: The model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing mean absolute error in predicted flood depth maps by nearly 20% on average, and demonstrates ability to generalize across diverse geographical contexts.

Conclusion: The approach serves as a scalable and practical tool for coastal flood management, empowering decision-makers to develop effective mitigation strategies against climate change impacts.

Abstract: Climate change and sea-level rise (SLR) pose escalating threats to coastal
cities, intensifying the need for efficient and accurate methods to predict
potential flood hazards. Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic simulators,
although precise, are computationally expensive and impractical for city-scale
coastal planning applications. Deep Learning (DL) techniques offer promising
alternatives, however, they are often constrained by challenges such as data
scarcity and high-dimensional output requirements. Leveraging a recently
proposed vision-based, low-resource DL framework, we develop a novel,
lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model designed to predict
coastal flooding under variable SLR projections and shoreline adaptation
scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of the model to generalize
across diverse geographical contexts by utilizing datasets from two distinct
regions: Abu Dhabi and San Francisco. Our findings demonstrate that the
proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing the
mean absolute error (MAE) in predicted flood depth maps on average by nearly
20%. These results highlight the potential of our approach to serve as a
scalable and practical tool for coastal flood management, empowering
decision-makers to develop effective mitigation strategies in response to the
growing impacts of climate change. Project Page: https://caspiannet.github.io/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes STAVEQ2, a Video-LLM architecture with stacked temporal attention modules in the vision encoder to improve temporal understanding in videos, achieving up to +5.5% improvement on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video-LLMs struggle with understanding complex temporal dynamics in videos, particularly in comprehending action sequences and temporal progression.

Method: Introduces stacked temporal attention modules directly within the vision encoder to capture action progression and frame relationships before passing visual tokens to the LLM.

Result: Significantly improves temporal reasoning and outperforms existing models in video QA tasks, with up to +5.5% improvement on VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME benchmarks.

Conclusion: Enhancing the vision encoder with temporal structure addresses a critical gap in video understanding for Video-LLMs.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
understanding complex temporal dynamics in videos remains a major challenge.
Our experiments show that current Video Large Language Model (Video-LLM)
architectures have critical limitations in temporal understanding, struggling
with tasks that require detailed comprehension of action sequences and temporal
progression. In this work, we propose a Video-LLM architecture that introduces
stacked temporal attention modules directly within the vision encoder. This
design incorporates a temporal attention in vision encoder, enabling the model
to better capture the progression of actions and the relationships between
frames before passing visual tokens to the LLM. Our results show that this
approach significantly improves temporal reasoning and outperforms existing
models in video question answering tasks, specifically in action recognition.
We improve on benchmarks including VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME by up to
+5.5%. By enhancing the vision encoder with temporal structure, we address a
critical gap in video understanding for Video-LLMs. Project page and code are

### [12] [FlexICL: A Flexible Visual In-context Learning Framework for Elbow and Wrist Ultrasound Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26049)
*Yuyue Zhou,Jessica Knight,Shrimanti Ghosh,Banafshe Felfeliyan,Jacob L. Jaremko,Abhilash R. Hareendranathan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlexICL is a flexible in-context learning framework for segmenting bony regions in pediatric elbow and wrist ultrasound images, achieving robust performance with only 5% labeled training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound can improve diagnostic accuracy for pediatric fractures, but pixel-wise expert annotations are time-consuming and costly.

Method: Proposed FlexICL framework using in-context learning for intra-video segmentation, with novel image concatenation techniques and multiple augmentation strategies to enhance performance with limited labeled data.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models (Painter, MAE-VQGAN) and conventional segmentation models (U-Net, TransUNet) by 1-27% Dice coefficient on 1,252 US sweeps across four wrist and elbow datasets.

Conclusion: FlexICL shows potential as an efficient and scalable solution for ultrasound image segmentation in medical imaging where labeled data is scarce.

Abstract: Elbow and wrist fractures are the most common fractures in pediatric
populations. Automatic segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound
(US) can improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Fractures appear
as cortical defects but require expert interpretation. Deep learning (DL) can
provide real-time feedback and highlight key structures, helping lightly
trained users perform exams more confidently. However, pixel-wise expert
annotations for training remain time-consuming and costly. To address this
challenge, we propose FlexICL, a novel and flexible in-context learning (ICL)
framework for segmenting bony regions in US images. We apply it to an
intra-video segmentation setting, where experts annotate only a small subset of
frames, and the model segments unseen frames. We systematically investigate
various image concatenation techniques and training strategies for visual ICL
and introduce novel concatenation methods that significantly enhance model
performance with limited labeled data. By integrating multiple augmentation
strategies, FlexICL achieves robust segmentation performance across four wrist
and elbow US datasets while requiring only 5% of the training images. It
outperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models like Painter, MAE-VQGAN, and
conventional segmentation models like U-Net and TransUNet by 1-27% Dice
coefficient on 1,252 US sweeps. These initial results highlight the potential
of FlexICL as an efficient and scalable solution for US image segmentation well
suited for medical imaging use cases where labeled data is scarce.

*Hoyeon Chang,Seungjin Kim,Yoonseok Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dynamic negative prompting using Vision-Language Models to generate adaptive negative prompts during diffusion model denoising, outperforming fixed negative prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional negative prompting methods use fixed prompts that may not be contextually appropriate throughout the denoising process, limiting effectiveness.

Method: Generate intermediate image predictions at specific denoising steps and query a VLM to produce contextually appropriate negative prompts adaptively.

Result: Evaluated on benchmark datasets showing trade-offs between negative guidance strength and text-image alignment, demonstrating improved performance over fixed negative prompts.

Conclusion: Dynamic negative prompting with VLMs provides more effective and context-aware negative guidance in diffusion models compared to traditional fixed approaches.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for dynamic negative prompting in diffusion
models that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to adaptively generate
negative prompts during the denoising process. Unlike traditional Negative
Prompting methods that use fixed negative prompts, our method generates
intermediate image predictions at specific denoising steps and queries a VLM to
produce contextually appropriate negative prompts. We evaluate our approach on
various benchmark datasets and demonstrate the trade-offs between negative
guidance strength and text-image alignment.

### [14] [Security Risk of Misalignment between Text and Image in Multi-modal Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26105)
*Xiaosen Wang,Zhijin Ge,Shaokang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PReMA is a novel adversarial attack that manipulates multi-modal diffusion models by creating adversarial images that work with any specified prompt to generate inappropriate content, without modifying the prompt itself.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal diffusion models have inadequate alignment between text and image modalities, creating security risks for generating NSFW content. Current attacks mainly focus on adversarial prompts, leaving a gap in image-based attacks.

Method: Proposes Prompt-Restricted Multi-modal Attack (PReMA) - an attack method that creates adversarial images that can manipulate model outputs when combined with any fixed prompt, without altering the prompt itself.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on image inpainting and style transfer tasks across various models demonstrate PReMA's potent efficacy in manipulating generated content.

Conclusion: PReMA poses a novel threat to multi-modal diffusion models, particularly in applications with fixed prompts, highlighting significant security vulnerabilities in current model alignment.

Abstract: Despite the notable advancements and versatility of multi-modal diffusion
models, such as text-to-image models, their susceptibility to adversarial
inputs remains underexplored. Contrary to expectations, our investigations
reveal that the alignment between textual and Image modalities in existing
diffusion models is inadequate. This misalignment presents significant risks,
especially in the generation of inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW)
content. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Prompt-Restricted
Multi-modal Attack (PReMA) to manipulate the generated content by modifying the
input image in conjunction with any specified prompt, without altering the
prompt itself. PReMA is the first attack that manipulates model outputs by
solely creating adversarial images, distinguishing itself from prior methods
that primarily generate adversarial prompts to produce NSFW content.
Consequently, PReMA poses a novel threat to the integrity of multi-modal
diffusion models, particularly in image-editing applications that operate with
fixed prompts. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on image inpainting and
style transfer tasks across various models confirm the potent efficacy of
PReMA.

Motivation: To study whether Video-LLMs can achieve consistent temporal understanding when videos capture the same event from different viewpoints (egocentric vs exocentric).

Method: Introduces EgoExo-Con benchmark with synchronized video pairs and human-refined queries, evaluates temporal verification and grounding tasks. Proposes View-GRPO reinforcement learning framework to strengthen view-specific reasoning while encouraging cross-view consistency.

Result: Existing Video-LLMs fail to maintain consistency across viewpoints, performing worse than single-view. Naive fine-tuning improves consistency but underperforms single-view training. View-GRPO outperforms SFT and GRPO in improving cross-view consistency.

Conclusion: Cross-view temporal consistency is challenging for Video-LLMs; View-GRPO effectively addresses this limitation by balancing view-specific reasoning with cross-view consistency through reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Can Video-LLMs achieve consistent temporal understanding when videos capture
the same event from different viewpoints? To study this, we introduce
EgoExo-Con (Consistency), a benchmark of comprehensively synchronized
egocentric and exocentric video pairs with human-refined queries in natural
language. EgoExo-Con emphasizes two temporal understanding tasks: Temporal
Verification and Temporal Grounding. It evaluates not only correctness but
consistency across viewpoints. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations of
existing Video-LLMs: (1) models often fail to maintain consistency, with
results far worse than their single-view performances. (2) When naively
finetuned with synchronized videos of both viewpoints, the models show improved
consistency but often underperform those trained on a single view. For
improvements, we propose View-GRPO, a novel reinforcement learning framework
that effectively strengthens view-specific temporal reasoning while encouraging
consistent comprehension across viewpoints. Our method demonstrates its
superiority over naive SFT and GRPO, especially for improving cross-view
consistency. All resources will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OracleAgent is the first agent system for Oracle Bone Script (OBS) research that integrates multiple analysis tools with LLMs and uses a comprehensive multimodal knowledge base to address challenges in OBS interpretation and information retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OBS research faces challenges with complex interpretation workflows and inefficient information organization/retrieval, requiring scholars to spend substantial effort searching and managing resources.

Method: Developed OracleAgent system that integrates multiple OBS analysis tools powered by LLMs, constructs a comprehensive multimodal knowledge base with 1.4M character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts, and enables flexible orchestration of components for retrieval tasks.

Result: OracleAgent achieves superior performance in multimodal reasoning and generation tasks, surpassing leading MLLMs like GPT-4o, and significantly reduces time cost for domain experts in OBS research.

Conclusion: OracleAgent represents a significant advancement toward practical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation systems, effectively addressing the field's major challenges.

Abstract: As one of the earliest writing systems, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) preserves
the cultural and intellectual heritage of ancient civilizations. However,
current OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS
involves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks,
and (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a
critical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for,
compiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we
present OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured
management and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly
integrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models
(LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we
construct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS,
which is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection,
cleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M
single-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts. OracleAgent
leverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in
retrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior
performance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks,
surpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g.,
GPT-4o). Furthermore, our case study illustrates that OracleAgent can
effectively assist domain experts, significantly reducing the time cost of OBS
research. These results highlight OracleAgent as a significant step toward the
practical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation
systems.

*Yuxuan Li,Tao Wang,Xianben Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework that jointly optimizes 3D Gaussian points and camera poses without requiring pre-calibrated camera inputs, eliminating the need for external pose estimation tools like COLMAP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional novel view synthesis methods rely on external camera pose estimation tools (e.g., COLMAP) which introduce computational bottlenecks and propagate errors, limiting performance in challenging scenarios.

Method: Joint optimization framework with two interleaved phases: (1) updating 3D Gaussian parameters via differentiable rendering with fixed poses, and (2) refining camera poses using a customized 3D optical flow algorithm with geometric and photometric constraints.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing COLMAP-free techniques in reconstruction quality and surpasses standard COLMAP-based baseline in general, particularly effective in challenging scenarios with large viewpoint variations and sparse features.

Conclusion: The proposed co-optimization strategy successfully eliminates dependency on external pose estimation tools while achieving superior reconstruction fidelity and pose accuracy through progressive error reduction.

Abstract: Traditional novel view synthesis methods heavily rely on external camera pose
estimation tools such as COLMAP, which often introduce computational
bottlenecks and propagate errors. To address these challenges, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes 3D Gaussian points and camera poses
without requiring pre-calibrated inputs. Our approach iteratively refines 3D
Gaussian parameters and updates camera poses through a novel co-optimization
strategy, ensuring simultaneous improvements in scene reconstruction fidelity
and pose accuracy. The key innovation lies in decoupling the joint optimization
into two interleaved phases: first, updating 3D Gaussian parameters via
differentiable rendering with fixed poses, and second, refining camera poses
using a customized 3D optical flow algorithm that incorporates geometric and
photometric constraints. This formulation progressively reduces projection
errors, particularly in challenging scenarios with large viewpoint variations
and sparse feature distributions, where traditional methods struggle. Extensive
evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly
outperforms existing COLMAP-free techniques in reconstruction quality, and also
surpasses the standard COLMAP-based baseline in general.

*Runsheng Xu,Hubert Lin,Wonseok Jeon,Hao Feng,Yuliang Zou,Liting Sun,John Gorman,Kate Tolstaya,Sarah Tang,Brandyn White,Ben Sapp,Mingxing Tan,Jyh-Jing Hwang,Drago Anguelov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces WOD-E2E, a new dataset for end-to-end driving focused on challenging long-tail scenarios, along with a novel evaluation metric called Rater Feedback Score (RFS) that measures trajectory preference alignment rather than waypoint distance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current E2E driving benchmarks primarily test nominal scenarios and existing open-loop evaluation metrics fail to adequately capture the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluate performance in rare long-tail scenarios.

Method: Created WOD-E2E dataset with 4,021 driving segments (12 hours) curated for long-tail scenarios (occurring frequency <0.03%), including routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8 surrounding cameras. Proposed RFS metric that measures how closely predicted trajectories match rater-annotated preference labels.

Result: Released a comprehensive dataset specifically designed for challenging driving scenarios and introduced a novel evaluation approach that better captures driving behavior quality through human preference alignment rather than simple trajectory matching.

Conclusion: WOD-E2E aims to advance research in generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving by providing better benchmarks and evaluation methods for handling complex real-world situations, particularly rare long-tail scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in
the research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily
feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of
these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall
short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating
performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021
driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging
long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring
frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the
high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8
surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail
situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback
Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between
predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted
trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have
released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while
the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.
Through our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into
generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of
handling complex real-world situations.

*Ali Caglayan,Nevrez Imamoglu,Oguzhan Guclu,Ali Osman Serhatoglu,Ahmet Burak Can,Ryosuke Nakamura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes integrating gradient-based attention information with CNN features to improve RGB-D indoor SLAM performance, particularly for large environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While attention models and visualization techniques provide insights into CNN reasoning, explicit integration of gradient-based attention information directly into CNN representations for semantic object understanding remains limited, especially for visual tasks like SLAM where enriched representations could enhance performance.

Method: The authors integrate layer-wise attention information derived from network gradients with CNN feature representations to improve frame association performance in RGB-D indoor SLAM.

Result: Experimental results show improved performance compared to baseline methods, with particularly notable improvements for large environments.

Conclusion: Integrating task-specific network attention with CNN features enhances SLAM performance, demonstrating the value of explicit gradient-based attention integration for visual understanding tasks.

Abstract: Attention models have recently emerged as a powerful approach, demonstrating
significant progress in various fields. Visualization techniques, such as class
activation mapping, provide visual insights into the reasoning of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). Using network gradients, it is possible to identify
regions where the network pays attention during image recognition tasks.
Furthermore, these gradients can be combined with CNN features to localize more
generalizable, task-specific attentive (salient) regions within scenes.
However, explicit use of this gradient-based attention information integrated
directly into CNN representations for semantic object understanding remains
limited. Such integration is particularly beneficial for visual tasks like
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), where CNN representations
enriched with spatially attentive object locations can enhance performance. In
this work, we propose utilizing task-specific network attention for RGB-D
indoor SLAM. Specifically, we integrate layer-wise attention information
derived from network gradients with CNN feature representations to improve
frame association performance. Experimental results indicate improved
performance compared to baseline methods, particularly for large environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FullPart is a novel 3D part generation framework that combines implicit and explicit representations - using implicit diffusion for bounding box layout and explicit full-resolution voxel grids for detailed part generation, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous part generators using implicit vector-set tokens lack geometric details, while explicit voxel methods with shared global grids degrade small part quality due to insufficient voxel allocation.

Method: Uses implicit diffusion for bounding box layout generation, then generates each part in its own fixed full-resolution voxel grid. Introduces center-point encoding to handle part size variations and maintains global coherence. Built on PartVerse-XL dataset with 40K objects and 320K parts.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation, enabling synthesis of intricate details even for small parts by generating each part at full resolution.

Conclusion: FullPart effectively combines implicit and explicit paradigms for superior 3D part generation, with the framework and PartVerse-XL dataset benefiting future research in the field.

Abstract: Part-based 3D generation holds great potential for various applications.
Previous part generators that represent parts using implicit vector-set tokens
often suffer from insufficient geometric details. Another line of work adopts
an explicit voxel representation but shares a global voxel grid among all
parts; this often causes small parts to occupy too few voxels, leading to
degraded quality. In this paper, we propose FullPart, a novel framework that
combines both implicit and explicit paradigms. It first derives the bounding
box layout through an implicit box vector-set diffusion process, a task that
implicit diffusion handles effectively since box tokens contain little
geometric detail. Then, it generates detailed parts, each within its own fixed
full-resolution voxel grid. Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space,
each part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution,
enabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a
center-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when
exchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby
maintaining global coherence. Moreover, to tackle the scarcity of reliable part
data, we present PartVerse-XL, the largest human-annotated 3D part dataset to
date with 40K objects and 320K parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FullPart achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation. We will
release all code, data, and model to benefit future research in 3D part
generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BasicAVSR is a strong baseline for arbitrary-scale video super-resolution that integrates adaptive multi-scale frequency priors, flow-guided propagation, second-order motion compensation, and hyper-upsampling to handle various scaling factors while maintaining temporal consistency and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arbitrary-scale video super-resolution faces challenges in spatial detail reproduction, temporal consistency, and computational complexity across different scaling factors, requiring a flexible and efficient solution.

Method: Proposes BasicAVSR with four key components: 1) adaptive multi-scale frequency priors from Laplacian pyramids, 2) flow-guided propagation unit for spatiotemporal aggregation, 3) second-order motion compensation for accurate frame alignment, and 4) hyper-upsampling unit for scale-aware upsampling kernels. Three propagation variants are instantiated for different scenarios.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate BasicAVSR significantly outperforms existing methods in super-resolution quality, generalization ability, and inference speed across different scenarios.

Conclusion: BasicAVSR advances the state-of-the-art in arbitrary-scale video super-resolution and extends its core components to multiple frameworks for diverse application scenarios, providing an effective and adaptable solution.

Abstract: Arbitrary-scale video super-resolution (AVSR) aims to enhance the resolution
of video frames, potentially at various scaling factors, which presents several
challenges regarding spatial detail reproduction, temporal consistency, and
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a strong baseline BasicAVSR
for AVSR by integrating four key components: 1) adaptive multi-scale frequency
priors generated from image Laplacian pyramids, 2) a flow-guided propagation
unit to aggregate spatiotemporal information from adjacent frames, 3) a
second-order motion compensation unit for more accurate spatial alignment of
adjacent frames, and 4) a hyper-upsampling unit to generate scale-aware and
content-independent upsampling kernels. To meet diverse application demands, we
instantiate three propagation variants: (i) a unidirectional RNN unit for
strictly online inference, (ii) a unidirectional RNN unit empowered with a
limited lookahead that tolerates a small output delay, and (iii) a
bidirectional RNN unit designed for offline tasks where computational resources
are less constrained. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
adaptability of our model across these different scenarios. Through extensive
experiments, we show that BasicAVSR significantly outperforms existing methods
in terms of super-resolution quality, generalization ability, and inference
speed. Our work not only advances the state-of-the-art in AVSR but also extends
its core components to multiple frameworks for diverse scenarios. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Multi-View Mammography and Language Model (MV-MLM) that uses synthetic radiology reports and multi-view supervision for breast cancer classification and risk prediction, achieving state-of-the-art performance with strong data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large annotated datasets for breast cancer CAD models are costly and time-consuming to acquire. Vision-Language Models offer a promising solution by enhancing robustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks.

Method: Proposes MV-MLM with multi-view supervision using paired mammogram images and synthetic radiology reports. Uses cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs and a joint visual-textual learning strategy to learn rich representations and distinguish breast tissue characteristics.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in three classification tasks: malignancy classification, subtype classification, and image-based cancer risk prediction. Outperforms existing fully supervised or VLM baselines while trained on synthetic text reports without actual radiology reports.

Conclusion: The proposed MV-MLM demonstrates strong data efficiency and generalization capabilities for breast cancer detection and risk prediction, offering a practical solution to the data annotation bottleneck in medical imaging.

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are essential for training robust Computer-Aided
Diagnosis (CAD) models for breast cancer detection or risk prediction. However,
acquiring such datasets with fine-detailed annotation is both costly and
time-consuming. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, which are
pre-trained on large image-text pairs, offer a promising solution by enhancing
robustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks. This paper introduces
a novel Multi-View Mammography and Language Model for breast cancer
classification and risk prediction, trained on a dataset of paired mammogram
images and synthetic radiology reports. Our MV-MLM leverages multi-view
supervision to learn rich representations from extensive radiology data by
employing cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs. This includes
multiple views and the corresponding pseudo-radiology reports. We propose a
novel joint visual-textual learning strategy to enhance generalization and
accuracy performance over different data types and tasks to distinguish breast
tissues or cancer characteristics(calcification, mass) and utilize these
patterns to understand mammography images and predict cancer risk. We evaluated
our method on both private and publicly available datasets, demonstrating that
the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three
classification tasks: (1) malignancy classification, (2) subtype
classification, and (3) image-based cancer risk prediction. Furthermore, the
model exhibits strong data efficiency, outperforming existing fully supervised
or VLM baselines while trained on synthetic text reports and without the need
for actual radiology reports.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a YOLOv8-based machine learning system for real-time auto-rickshaw detection in traffic images, achieving 83.447% mAP50 and over 78% precision/recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Auto-rickshaws in Bangladesh face route restrictions but are difficult to monitor due to similarity with non-auto rickshaws and inefficiency of manual video analysis.

Method: Used YOLOv8 model for real-time object detection, trained on 1,730 annotated images captured under various traffic conditions.

Result: Model achieved mAP50 of 83.447% and binary precision/recall values above 78%, performing well in both dense and sparse traffic scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively automates auto-rickshaw detection and the dataset has been publicly released for further research.

Abstract: Modes of transportation vary across countries depending on geographical
location and cultural context. In South Asian countries rickshaws are among the
most common means of local transport. Based on their mode of operation,
rickshaws in cities across Bangladesh can be broadly classified into non-auto
(pedal-powered) and auto-rickshaws (motorized). Monitoring the movement of
auto-rickshaws is necessary as traffic rules often restrict auto-rickshaws from
accessing certain routes. However, existing surveillance systems make it quite
difficult to monitor them due to their similarity to other vehicles, especially
non-auto rickshaws whereas manual video analysis is too time-consuming. This
paper presents a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect
auto-rickshaws in traffic images. In this system, we used real-time object
detection using the YOLOv8 model. For training purposes, we prepared a set of
1,730 annotated images that were captured under various traffic conditions. The
results show that our proposed model performs well in real-time auto-rickshaw
detection and offers an mAP50 of 83.447% and binary precision and recall values
above 78%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling both dense and sparse
traffic scenarios. The dataset has been publicly released for further research.

TL;DR: CRAG-MM is a comprehensive multi-modal RAG benchmark with 6.5K image-question-answer triplets and 2K multi-turn conversations across 13 domains, designed for wearable device scenarios with realistic challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no comprehensive benchmark for multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation in wearable scenarios, despite the growing importance of smart glasses and similar devices for real-time information retrieval.

Method: Created a diverse dataset with 6.5K triplets and 2K multi-turn conversations across 13 domains, including 6.2K egocentric images. Designed three tasks: single-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn conversations, with associated retrieval corpus and APIs.

Result: Straightforward RAG approaches achieve only 32% and 43% truthfulness on single- and multi-turn QA respectively. State-of-the-art industry solutions show similar performance (32%/45%), indicating significant room for improvement. The benchmark hosted KDD Cup 2025 with 1K participants and 5K submissions.

Conclusion: CRAG-MM fills a critical gap in multi-modal RAG benchmarking, particularly for wearable scenarios, and has already demonstrated impact through the KDD Cup competition where winning solutions improved baseline performance by 28%.

Abstract: Wearable devices such as smart glasses are transforming the way people
interact with their surroundings, enabling users to seek information regarding
entities in their view. Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG)
plays a key role in supporting such questions, yet there is still no
comprehensive benchmark for this task, especially regarding wearables
scenarios. To fill this gap, we present CRAG-MM -- a Comprehensive RAG
benchmark for Multi-modal Multi-turn conversations. CRAG-MM contains a diverse
set of 6.5K (image, question, answer) triplets and 2K visual-based multi-turn
conversations across 13 domains, including 6.2K egocentric images designed to
mimic captures from wearable devices. We carefully constructed the questions to
reflect real-world scenarios and challenges, including five types of
image-quality issues, six question types, varying entity popularity, differing
information dynamism, and different conversation turns. We design three tasks:
single-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn
conversations -- each paired with an associated retrieval corpus and APIs for
both image-KG retrieval and webpage retrieval. Our evaluation shows that
straightforward RAG approaches achieve only 32% and 43% truthfulness on CRAG-MM
single- and multi-turn QA, respectively, whereas state-of-the-art industry
solutions have similar quality (32%/45%), underscoring ample room for
improvement. The benchmark has hosted KDD Cup 2025, attracting about 1K
participants and 5K submissions, with winning solutions improving baseline
performance by 28%, highlighting its early impact on advancing the field.

TL;DR: MoTDiff is a diffusion-based framework for high-resolution motion trajectory estimation from single motion-blurred images, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion representations from single blurred images are low quality (coarse-grained and inaccurate), limiting performance in computational imaging and computer vision applications.

Method: Proposes MoTDiff framework with: 1) conditional diffusion using multi-scale feature maps from blurred image as condition, 2) training method promoting precise fine-grained trajectory identification, consistent shape/position estimation, and pixel connectivity.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography applications.

Conclusion: MoTDiff successfully estimates high-resolution motion trajectories from single motion-blurred images, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of motion information is crucial in diverse computational
imaging and computer vision applications. Researchers have investigated various
methods to extract motion information from a single blurred image, including
blur kernels and optical flow. However, existing motion representations are
often of low quality, i.e., coarse-grained and inaccurate. In this paper, we
propose the first high-resolution (HR) Motion Trajectory estimation framework
using Diffusion models (MoTDiff). Different from existing motion
representations, we aim to estimate an HR motion trajectory with high-quality
from a single motion-blurred image. The proposed MoTDiff consists of two key
components: 1) a new conditional diffusion framework that uses multi-scale
feature maps extracted from a single blurred image as a condition, and 2) a new
training method that can promote precise identification of a fine-grained
motion trajectory, consistent estimation of overall shape and position of a
motion path, and pixel connectivity along a motion trajectory. Our experiments
demonstrate that the proposed MoTDiff can outperform state-of-the-art methods
in both blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ConceptScope is an automated framework that uses Sparse Autoencoders on vision foundation models to discover and quantify human-interpretable concepts in datasets, enabling systematic bias identification and dataset auditing without requiring fine-grained annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dataset bias is widespread in machine learning but challenging to identify without costly fine-grained attribute annotations, creating a need for scalable automated methods to systematically discover and quantify biases.

Method: Uses Sparse Autoencoders trained on representations from vision foundation models to discover interpretable concepts, categorizing them into target, context, and bias types based on semantic relevance and statistical correlation to class labels.

Result: ConceptScope captures diverse visual concepts (objects, textures, backgrounds, facial attributes, emotions, actions), produces spatial attributions aligned with meaningful image regions, and reliably detects both known biases (e.g., background bias in Waterbirds) and previously unannotated ones (e.g., co-occurring objects in ImageNet).

Conclusion: ConceptScope provides a practical tool for dataset auditing and model diagnostics by enabling automated discovery and quantification of dataset biases through interpretable concept analysis.

Abstract: Dataset bias, where data points are skewed to certain concepts, is ubiquitous
in machine learning datasets. Yet, systematically identifying these biases is
challenging without costly, fine-grained attribute annotations. We present
ConceptScope, a scalable and automated framework for analyzing visual datasets
by discovering and quantifying human-interpretable concepts using Sparse
Autoencoders trained on representations from vision foundation models.
ConceptScope categorizes concepts into target, context, and bias types based on
their semantic relevance and statistical correlation to class labels, enabling
class-level dataset characterization, bias identification, and robustness
evaluation through concept-based subgrouping. We validate that ConceptScope
captures a wide range of visual concepts, including objects, textures,
backgrounds, facial attributes, emotions, and actions, through comparisons with
annotated datasets. Furthermore, we show that concept activations produce
spatial attributions that align with semantically meaningful image regions.
ConceptScope reliably detects known biases (e.g., background bias in
Waterbirds) and uncovers previously unannotated ones (e.g, co-occurring objects
in ImageNet), offering a practical tool for dataset auditing and model
diagnostics.

*Li Wang,Yiyu Zhuang,Yanwen Wang,Xun Cao,Chuan Guo,Xinxin Zuo,Hao Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel approach for 3D human pose estimation from sketches using a 'learn from synthesis' strategy, creating synthetic sketch-3D pose dataset SKEP-120K and an end-to-end framework that outperforms previous methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in sketch-to-pose estimation due to abstract and disproportionate nature of sketches, overcoming limitations of previous optimization-based methods that lack large-scale sketch-3D pose annotations and are time-consuming with limited generalizability.

Method: Uses diffusion model to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human poses, creating synthetic dataset SKEP-120K. Combines 2D pose detectors, generative diffusion priors for sketch feature extraction, and feed-forward neural network with heuristic loss functions for geometric coherence and self-contact preservation.

Result: Qualitative, quantitative, and subjective evaluations show the model substantially surpasses previous methods in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed 'learn from synthesis' approach with synthetic dataset creation and end-to-end framework effectively addresses sketch-to-pose challenges, achieving superior performance compared to previous optimization-based methods.

Abstract: 3D human pose estimation from sketches has broad applications in computer
animation and film production. Unlike traditional human pose estimation, this
task presents unique challenges due to the abstract and disproportionate nature
of sketches. Previous sketch-to-pose methods, constrained by the lack of
large-scale sketch-3D pose annotations, primarily relied on optimization with
heuristic rules-an approach that is both time-consuming and limited in
generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach
leveraging a "learn from synthesis" strategy. First, a diffusion model is
trained to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human
poses, mimicking disproportionate human structures in sketches. This process
enables the creation of a synthetic dataset, SKEP-120K, consisting of 120k
accurate sketch-3D pose annotation pairs across various sketch styles. Building
on this synthetic dataset, we introduce an end-to-end data-driven framework for
estimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles. Our framework
combines existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch
feature extraction with a feed-forward neural network for efficient 2D pose
estimation. Multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee
geometric coherence between the derived 3D poses and the detected 2D poses
while preserving accurate self-contacts. Qualitative, quantitative, and
subjective evaluations collectively show that our model substantially surpasses
previous ones in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks.

*Mehdi Khaleghi,Nastaran Khaleghi,Sobhan Sheykhivand,Sebelan Danishvar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Ch-EGN, a hybrid convolutional and geometric deep learning ensemble network for supply chain risk management and sustainability enhancement, achieving high accuracy on delivery status prediction and product classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve supply chain sustainability and performance efficiency through better risk management and product classification using deep learning approaches that leverage information dependencies in supply chain networks.

Method: Uses a novel Chebyshev ensemble geometric network (Ch-EGN) that combines convolutional and geometric deep learning to derive invisible states from supply chain data dependencies. Evaluated on SupplyGraph Dataset and DataCo databases for delivery status prediction, product classification, and edge classification.

Result: Achieved 98.95% accuracy for risk management, 100% accuracy for 5 product group classification, 98.07% for 4 product relation classification, and 92.37% for 25 company relation classification, showing improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed Ch-EGN ensemble network effectively enhances supply chain sustainability and risk management through superior classification performance, demonstrating the value of geometric deep learning approaches for supply chain analytics.

Abstract: The sustainability of supply chain plays a key role in achieving optimal
performance in controlling the supply chain. The management of risks that occur
in a supply chain is a fundamental problem for the purpose of developing the
sustainability of the network and elevating the performance efficiency of the
supply chain. The correct classification of products is another essential
element in a sustainable supply chain. Acknowledging recent breakthroughs in
the context of deep networks, several architectural options have been deployed
to analyze supply chain datasets. A novel geometric deep network is used to
propose an ensemble deep network. The proposed Chebyshev ensemble geometric
network (Ch-EGN) is a hybrid convolutional and geometric deep learning. This
network is proposed to leverage the information dependencies in supply chain to
derive invisible states of samples in the database. The functionality of the
proposed deep network is assessed on the two different databases. The
SupplyGraph Dataset and DataCo are considered in this research. The prediction
of delivery status of DataCo supply chain is done for risk administration. The
product classification and edge classification are performed using the
SupplyGraph database to enhance the sustainability of the supply network. An
average accuracy of 98.95% is obtained for the ensemble network for risk
management. The average accuracy of 100% and 98.07% are obtained for
sustainable supply chain in terms of 5 product group classification and 4
product relation classification, respectively. The average accuracy of 92.37%
is attained for 25 company relation classification. The results confirm an
average improvement and efficiency of the proposed method compared to the
state-of-the-art approaches.

*Hengrui Kang,Zhuangcheng Gu,Zhiyuan Zhao,Zichen Wen,Bin Wang,Weijia Li,Conghui He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OmniLayout-1M, a million-scale dataset for diverse document layouts, and OmniLayout-LLM, a 0.5B model with a two-stage coarse-to-fine learning approach that achieves state-of-the-art performance in document layout generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Document layout generation is underexplored compared to document layout analysis, with existing datasets dominated by academic papers and lacking diversity in real-world document types like newspapers and magazines.

Method: Proposes OmniLayout-LLM with a two-stage coarse-to-fine learning paradigm: 1) learning universal layout principles from the OmniLayout-1M dataset with coarse categories, and 2) transferring knowledge to specific domains with fine-grained annotations.

Result: The approach achieves strong performance on multiple domains in the M$^{6}$Doc dataset, substantially surpassing existing layout generation methods and recent general-purpose LLMs.

Conclusion: The work addresses the gap in diverse document layout generation by providing a large-scale dataset and an effective learning framework, with plans to release code, models, and dataset publicly.

Abstract: Document AI has advanced rapidly and is attracting increasing attention. Yet,
while most efforts have focused on document layout analysis (DLA), its
generative counterpart, document layout generation, remains underexplored. A
major obstacle lies in the scarcity of diverse layouts: academic papers with
Manhattan-style structures dominate existing studies, while open-world genres
such as newspapers and magazines remain severely underrepresented. To address
this gap, we curate OmniLayout-1M, the first million-scale dataset of diverse
document layouts, covering six common document types and comprising
contemporary layouts collected from multiple sources. Moreover, since existing
methods struggle in complex domains and often fail to arrange long sequences
coherently, we introduce OmniLayout-LLM, a 0.5B model with designed two-stage
Coarse-to-Fine learning paradigm: 1) learning universal layout principles from
OmniLayout-1M with coarse category definitions, and 2) transferring the
knowledge to a specific domain with fine-grained annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on
multiple domains in M$^{6}$Doc dataset, substantially surpassing both existing
layout generation experts and several latest general-purpose LLMs. Our code,
models, and dataset will be publicly released.

*Shiho Matta,Lis Kanashiro Pereira,Peitao Han,Fei Cheng,Shigeru Kitazawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-language models struggle with temporal reasoning, performing poorly on judging whether videos play forward or backward, lagging far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes and causal actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating VLMs' temporal understanding and their weak grasp of temporal information in videos, particularly the ability to infer temporal direction.

Method: Created AoT-PsyPhyBENCH benchmark using psychophysically validated stimuli to test VLMs' ability to judge arrow of time in natural videos, comparing them against human behavioral baselines.

Result: Most VLMs perform near chance level, with even the best models lagging significantly behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes and causal manual actions that humans recognize instantly.

Conclusion: Current VLMs lack inductive biases for temporal continuity and causal understanding, highlighting a fundamental gap in multimodal systems despite their rich visual-semantic correlation capabilities.

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet
their grasp of temporal information in video remains weak and, crucially,
under-evaluated. We probe this gap with a deceptively simple but revealing
challenge: judging the arrow of time (AoT)-whether a short clip is played
forward or backward. We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated
benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural
videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans.
Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and
non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the
best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g.,
free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition)
that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental
gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic
correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity
and causal understanding. We release the code and data for AoT-PsyPhyBENCH to
encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities
of VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HCLFuse is a novel infrared and visible image fusion method inspired by human cognitive laws, using a multi-scale mask-regulated variational bottleneck encoder and diffusion model with physical guidance to achieve state-of-the-art fusion performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fusion methods struggle with balancing modal information and lack interpretability in modal selection, affecting reliability in complex scenarios. The authors aim to address these limitations by drawing inspiration from human cognitive laws.

Method: Uses multi-scale mask-regulated variational bottleneck encoder for information decomposition, combined with diffusion model's probabilistic generation integrated with physical laws through time-varying physical guidance mechanism.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art fusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple datasets, with significant improvements in semantic segmentation metrics.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates advantages in enhancing structural consistency and detail quality by combining cognitive-inspired approaches with probabilistic generative capabilities and physical guidance.

Abstract: Existing infrared and visible image fusion methods often face the dilemma of
balancing modal information. Generative fusion methods reconstruct fused images
by learning from data distributions, but their generative capabilities remain
limited. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in modal information selection
further affects the reliability and consistency of fusion results in complex
scenarios. This manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion
under the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and
visible image fusion method, termed HCLFuse. First, HCLFuse investigates the
quantification theory of information mapping in unsupervised fusion networks,
which leads to the design of a multi-scale mask-regulated variational
bottleneck encoder. This encoder applies posterior probability modeling and
information decomposition to extract accurate and concise low-level modal
information, thereby supporting the generation of high-fidelity structural
details. Furthermore, the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion
model is integrated with physical laws, forming a time-varying physical
guidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at
different stages, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the
intrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
fusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple
datasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics. This fully
demonstrates the advantages of this generative image fusion method, drawing
inspiration from human cognition, in enhancing structural consistency and
detail quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the complementarity of three CNN architectures (SqueezeNet, MobileNetv2, ResNet50) for periocular verification at different distances, showing that fusion of all three networks achieves state-of-the-art performance on UBIPr database.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study how different CNN architectures with varying complexity can complement each other for periocular verification, particularly examining their attention patterns and performance at different distances.

Method: Trained three CNN architectures on eye crops from VGGFace2, analyzed performance with cosine and chi2 metrics, compared network initializations, applied score-level fusion via logistic regression, and used LIME heatmaps with Jensen-Shannon divergence to compare attention patterns.

Result: ResNet50 performed best individually, but fusion of all three networks provided substantial gains. Heatmaps revealed networks focus on distinct image regions, explaining their complementarity. The method significantly outperformed previous works on UBIPr.

Conclusion: Combining multiple CNN architectures with different complexities through fusion significantly improves periocular verification performance, achieving new state-of-the-art results by leveraging their complementary attention patterns.

Abstract: We study the complementarity of different CNNs for periocular verification at
different distances on the UBIPr database. We train three architectures of
increasing complexity (SqueezeNet, MobileNetv2, and ResNet50) on a large set of
eye crops from VGGFace2. We analyse performance with cosine and chi2 metrics,
compare different network initialisations, and apply score-level fusion via
logistic regression. In addition, we use LIME heatmaps and Jensen-Shannon
divergence to compare attention patterns of the CNNs. While ResNet50
consistently performs best individually, the fusion provides substantial gains,
especially when combining all three networks. Heatmaps show that networks
usually focus on distinct regions of a given image, which explains their
complementarity. Our method significantly outperforms previous works on UBIPr,
achieving a new state-of-the-art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CATG is a novel autonomous driving planning framework that uses Constrained Flow Matching to generate diverse, safe trajectories while incorporating driving aggressiveness as a control signal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing methods: imitation learning suffers from mode collapse (lack of diversity), while generative approaches struggle to incorporate safety and physical constraints directly, requiring additional optimization stages.

Method: Uses Constrained Flow Matching to explicitly model the flow matching process, allowing flexible guidance from conditioning signals and imposing explicit constraints directly within the generative process to ensure safety and kinematic compliance.

Result: Achieved 2nd place in NavSim v2 challenge with EPDMS score of 51.31 and won the Innovation Award, demonstrating effective trajectory generation with safety constraints.

Conclusion: CATG successfully addresses mode collapse and constraint integration issues in autonomous driving planning through constrained flow matching, enabling diverse and safe trajectory generation with controllable driving styles.

Abstract: Planning is a critical component of end-to-end autonomous driving. However,
prevailing imitation learning methods often suffer from mode collapse, failing
to produce diverse trajectory hypotheses. Meanwhile, existing generative
approaches struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints
directly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization
stage to refine their outputs. To address these limitations, we propose CATG, a
novel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely,
CATG explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates
mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning
signals. Our primary contribution is the novel imposition of explicit
constraints directly within the flow matching process, ensuring that the
generated trajectories adhere to vital safety and kinematic rules. Secondly,
CATG parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during
generation, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style. Notably, on the
NavSim v2 challenge, CATG achieved 2nd place with an EPDMS score of 51.31 and
was honored with the Innovation Award.

TL;DR: RobustVLA improves multi-modal robustness in Vision-Language-Action models against 17 perturbations across actions, instructions, environments, and observations, achieving significant performance gains and faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA robustness methods focus only on visual disturbances, ignoring broader multi-modal perturbations that occur in real-world deployments across actions, instructions, environments, and observations.

Method: Proposed RobustVLA with: 1) Offline robust optimization against worst-case action noise using flow matching objective (acts as adversarial training, label smoothing, and outlier penalization), 2) Enforcing consistent actions across input variations preserving task semantics, 3) Formulating robustness as multi-armed bandit problem using upper confidence bound to identify most harmful noise.

Result: Absolute gains of 12.6% on pi0 backbone and 10.4% on OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations; 50.6x faster inference than existing visual-robust VLAs; 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations; 65.6% absolute gain on real-world FR5 robot with limited demonstrations under four modality perturbations.

Conclusion: RobustVLA effectively addresses multi-modal robustness in VLAs, demonstrating superior performance across diverse perturbations and real-world robotic applications, with significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world
perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual
disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in
actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate
the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four
modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing
visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0
demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build
multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA
inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust
optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow
matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing,
and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions
across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple
perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and
apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most
harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers
absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the
OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference
than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations.
Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited
demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four
modalities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates three CNN architectures for periocular recognition using large-scale training data from VGGFace2, achieving state-of-the-art performance on UFPR-Periocular dataset with 1-2% EER.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the periocular region's high discrimination capability and minimal acquisition constraints for biometric recognition, addressing limitations of existing works that use small-scale datasets.

Method: Trained three CNN architectures of varying depth/complexity on 1,907,572 ocular crops from VGGFace2 database, evaluated on VGGFace2-Pose subset and UFPR-Periocular dataset.

Result: Achieved 1-2% EER on UFPR-Periocular (best reported), 9-15% EER on VGGFace2-Pose. Performance differences attributed to dataset quality and acquisition protocols.

Conclusion: Large-scale training data significantly improves periocular recognition performance, with controlled acquisition conditions yielding superior results compared to uncontrolled in-the-wild scenarios.

Abstract: We focus on ocular biometrics, specifically the periocular region (the area
around the eye), which offers high discrimination and minimal acquisition
constraints. We evaluate three Convolutional Neural Network architectures of
varying depth and complexity to assess their effectiveness for periocular
recognition. The networks are trained on 1,907,572 ocular crops extracted from
the large-scale VGGFace2 database. This significantly contrasts with existing
works, which typically rely on small-scale periocular datasets for training
having only a few thousand images. Experiments are conducted with ocular images
from VGGFace2-Pose, a subset of VGGFace2 containing in-the-wild face images,
and the UFPR-Periocular database, which consists of selfies captured via mobile
devices with user guidance on the screen. Due to the uncontrolled conditions of
VGGFace2, the Equal Error Rates (EERs) obtained with ocular crops range from
9-15%, noticeably higher than the 3-6% EERs achieved using full-face images. In
contrast, UFPR-Periocular yields significantly better performance (EERs of
1-2%), thanks to higher image quality and more consistent acquisition
protocols. To the best of our knowledge, these are the lowest reported EERs on
the UFPR dataset to date.

TL;DR: AEOS-Bench is the first large-scale benchmark suite for Agile Earth Observation Satellites constellation scheduling, featuring 16,410 realistic scenarios with 3,907 satellite assets. AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based model with constraint-aware attention, outperforms baselines in task completion and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AEOS scheduling methods simplify real-world complexities like large-scale scenarios, dynamic environments, and stringent constraints, limiting their practical performance. There's a need for realistic benchmarks and robust scheduling solutions.

Method: Developed AEOS-Bench benchmark suite with 16,410 scenarios generated via high-fidelity simulation, and AEOS-Former - a Transformer-based model with constraint-aware attention mechanism and dedicated internal constraint module for physical/operational limits.

Result: AEOS-Former outperforms baseline models in both task completion and energy efficiency. Ablation studies confirm the importance of each component in the proposed framework.

Conclusion: The unified framework combining AEOS-Bench benchmark and AEOS-Former model provides a robust solution for realistic AEOS constellation scheduling, addressing the limitations of existing simplified approaches.

Abstract: Agile Earth Observation Satellites (AEOSs) constellations offer unprecedented
flexibility for monitoring the Earth's surface, but their scheduling remains
challenging under large-scale scenarios, dynamic environments, and stringent
constraints. Existing methods often simplify these complexities, limiting their
real-world performance. We address this gap with a unified framework
integrating a standardized benchmark suite and a novel scheduling model. Our
benchmark suite, AEOS-Bench, contains $3,907$ finely tuned satellite assets and
$16,410$ scenarios. Each scenario features $1$ to $50$ satellites and $50$ to
$300$ imaging tasks. These scenarios are generated via a high-fidelity
simulation platform, ensuring realistic satellite behavior such as orbital
dynamics and resource constraints. Ground truth scheduling annotations are
provided for each scenario. To our knowledge, AEOS-Bench is the first
large-scale benchmark suite tailored for realistic constellation scheduling.
Building upon this benchmark, we introduce AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based
scheduling model that incorporates a constraint-aware attention mechanism. A
dedicated internal constraint module explicitly models the physical and
operational limits of each satellite. Through simulation-based iterative
learning, AEOS-Former adapts to diverse scenarios, offering a robust solution
for AEOS constellation scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that
AEOS-Former outperforms baseline models in task completion and energy
efficiency, with ablation studies highlighting the contribution of each
component. Code and data are provided in

*Junlai Qiu,Yunzhu Chen,Hao Zheng,Yawen Huang,Yuexiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an evidential fusion paradigm to combine CNN and ViT backbones for diabetic retinopathy grading, leveraging local and global features respectively to overcome limitations of single-type backbones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diabetic retinopathy causes vision loss and existing automated diagnosis systems using single-type backbones (CNN or ViT) have performance bottlenecks due to their respective limitations in local vs global feature extraction.

Method: Uses deep evidential networks to transform features from different backbones into supporting evidences, forming aggregated opinions to adaptively tune fusion patterns between CNN (local features) and ViT (global features).

Result: Evaluated on two public DR grading datasets, the hybrid model improves accuracy compared to state-of-the-art frameworks and provides excellent interpretability for feature fusion and decision-making.

Conclusion: The evidential fusion paradigm effectively integrates CNN and ViT strengths, breaking performance bottlenecks in DR grading while offering interpretable feature fusion.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss among middle-aged
and elderly people, which significantly impacts their daily lives and mental
health. To improve the efficiency of clinical screening and enable the early
detection of DR, a variety of automated DR diagnosis systems have been recently
established based on convolutional neural network (CNN) or vision Transformer
(ViT). However, due to the own shortages of CNN / ViT, the performance of
existing methods using single-type backbone has reached a bottleneck. One
potential way for the further improvements is integrating different kinds of
backbones, which can fully leverage the respective strengths of them
(\emph{i.e.,} the local feature extraction capability of CNN and the global
feature capturing ability of ViT). To this end, we propose a novel paradigm to
effectively fuse the features extracted by different backbones based on the
theory of evidence. Specifically, the proposed evidential fusion paradigm
transforms the features from different backbones into supporting evidences via
a set of deep evidential networks. With the supporting evidences, the
aggregated opinion can be accordingly formed, which can be used to adaptively
tune the fusion pattern between different backbones and accordingly boost the
performance of our hybrid model. We evaluated our method on two publicly
available DR grading datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our
hybrid model not only improves the accuracy of DR grading, compared to the
state-of-the-art frameworks, but also provides the excellent interpretability
for feature fusion and decision-making.

### [39] [GLYPH-SR: Can We Achieve Both High-Quality Image Super-Resolution and High-Fidelity Text Recovery via VLM-guided Latent Diffusion Model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26339)
*Mingyu Sung,Seungjae Ham,Kangwoo Kim,Yeokyoung Yoon,Sangseok Yun,Il-Min Kim,Jae-Mo Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLYPH-SR is a vision-language-guided diffusion framework for image super-resolution that specifically optimizes for both text legibility and perceptual quality in natural scenes, achieving significant OCR accuracy improvements while maintaining visual realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scene-text in images carries critical actionable information, but current super-resolution methods optimized for distortion metrics are insensitive to character-level errors, causing OCR failures even when images appear sharp. Previous text SR research focused on simplified benchmarks, treating scene-text as generic texture.

Method: GLYPH-SR uses a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet (TS-ControlNet) guided by OCR data and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and scene-centric guidance. The framework trains on synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen to enable targeted text restoration.

Result: Across SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 datasets at x4 and x8 magnification, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by up to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baselines while maintaining competitive perceptual quality metrics (MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ).

Conclusion: GLYPH-SR successfully delivers super-resolution that satisfies both high readability and high visual realism, making it effective for practical deployments where both text legibility and overall image quality are crucial.

Abstract: Image super-resolution(SR) is fundamental to many vision system-from
surveillance and autonomy to document analysis and retail analytics-because
recovering high-frequency details, especially scene-text, enables reliable
downstream perception. Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such
as signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable
information; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character
recognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image
appears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion
(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that
are largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do
address text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,
overlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,
scene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in
practical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for
both text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a
vision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives
jointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by
OCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and
scene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these
components on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.
Across SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by
up to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)
while maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ. GLYPH-SR is designed
to satisfy both objectives simultaneously-high readability and high visual
realism-delivering SR that looks right and reds right.

TL;DR: Proposes Spiking Patches tokenizer for event cameras that preserves asynchronous and sparse properties of events while achieving faster inference and competitive accuracy compared to frame/voxel methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing event representations (frames and voxels) sacrifice the asynchronous and spatially sparse properties of event cameras, which are their key advantages.

Method: Developed Spiking Patches tokenizer that converts event streams into tokens preserving asynchronous and sparse characteristics, evaluated with GNN, PCN, and Transformer models on gesture recognition and object detection tasks.

Result: Achieved 3.4x faster inference than voxels and 10.4x faster than frames while matching accuracy, with absolute improvements up to 3.8% for gesture recognition and 1.4% for object detection.

Conclusion: Tokenization with Spiking Patches preserves event camera properties without sacrificing accuracy, representing a novel direction in event-based vision that maintains the cameras' inherent advantages.

Abstract: We propose tokenization of events and present a tokenizer, Spiking Patches,
specifically designed for event cameras. Given a stream of asynchronous and
spatially sparse events, our goal is to discover an event representation that
preserves these properties. Prior works have represented events as frames or as
voxels. However, while these representations yield high accuracy, both frames
and voxels are synchronous and decrease the spatial sparsity. Spiking Patches
gives the means to preserve the unique properties of event cameras and we show
in our experiments that this comes without sacrificing accuracy. We evaluate
our tokenizer using a GNN, PCN, and a Transformer on gesture recognition and
object detection. Tokens from Spiking Patches yield inference times that are up
to 3.4x faster than voxel-based tokens and up to 10.4x faster than frames. We
achieve this while matching their accuracy and even surpassing in some cases
with absolute improvements up to 3.8 for gesture recognition and up to 1.4 for
object detection. Thus, tokenization constitutes a novel direction in
event-based vision and marks a step towards methods that preserve the
properties of event cameras.

TL;DR: Proposes a dual-conditioning framework combining EEG embeddings with spatial saliency maps to enhance EEG-driven image reconstruction, achieving improved fidelity and semantic coherence through attentional priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EEG-driven image reconstruction methods overlook spatial attention mechanisms, limiting fidelity and semantic coherence in generated images.

Method: Uses Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM) for EEG feature extraction, fine-tunes Stable Diffusion 2.1 via LoRA for neural-visual alignment, and incorporates ControlNet for spatial conditioning via saliency maps.

Result: Achieves significant improvement in quality of low- and high-level image features over existing approaches on THINGS-EEG dataset, with strong alignment to human visual attention.

Conclusion: Attentional priors resolve EEG ambiguities, enabling high-fidelity reconstructions with applications in medical diagnostics and neuroadaptive interfaces, advancing neural decoding through efficient adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models.

Abstract: Existing EEG-driven image reconstruction methods often overlook spatial
attention mechanisms, limiting fidelity and semantic coherence. To address
this, we propose a dual-conditioning framework that combines EEG embeddings
with spatial saliency maps to enhance image generation. Our approach leverages
the Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM) for EEG feature extraction and fine-tunes
Stable Diffusion 2.1 via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to align neural signals
with visual semantics, while a ControlNet branch conditions generation on
saliency maps for spatial control. Evaluated on THINGS-EEG, our method achieves
a significant improvement in the quality of low- and high-level image features
over existing approaches. Simultaneously, strongly aligning with human visual
attention. The results demonstrate that attentional priors resolve EEG
ambiguities, enabling high-fidelity reconstructions with applications in
medical diagnostics and neuroadaptive interfaces, advancing neural decoding
through efficient adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models.

*Xiangqing Zheng,Chengyue Wu,Kehai Chen,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoCoT2V-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating long video generation models using complex prompts and multi-dimensional metrics including event alignment, temporal consistency, and narrative coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-video benchmarks use simplified prompts and focus on low-level metrics, missing fine-grained alignment with complex prompts and abstract dimensions like narrative coherence and thematic expression.

Method: Proposed LoCoT2V-Bench with realistic complex prompts from real-world videos, featuring scene transitions and event dynamics, plus a multi-dimensional evaluation framework with new metrics like event-level alignment, temporal consistency, content clarity, and HERD for narrative flow and emotional response.

Result: Evaluation of nine LVG models shows they perform well on basic visual and temporal aspects but struggle with inter-event consistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence.

Conclusion: LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive platform for evaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and identifies critical improvement areas for future methods.

Abstract: Recently text-to-video generation has made impressive progress in producing
short, high-quality clips, but evaluating long-form outputs remains a major
challenge especially when processing complex prompts. Existing benchmarks
mostly rely on simplified prompts and focus on low-level metrics, overlooking
fine-grained alignment with prompts and abstract dimensions such as narrative
coherence and thematic expression. To address these gaps, we propose
LoCoT2V-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for long video generation
(LVG) under complex input conditions. Based on various real-world videos,
LoCoT2V-Bench introduces a suite of realistic and complex prompts incorporating
elements like scene transitions and event dynamics. Moreover, it constructs a
multi-dimensional evaluation framework that includes our newly proposed metrics
such as event-level alignment, fine-grained temporal consistency, content
clarity, and the Human Expectation Realization Degree (HERD) that focuses on
more abstract attributes like narrative flow, emotional response, and character
development. Using this framework, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
nine representative LVG models, finding that while current methods perform well
on basic visual and temporal aspects, they struggle with inter-event
consistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence, etc.
Overall, LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive and reliable platform for
evaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and highlights critical
directions for future method improvement.

### [43] [A-TPT: Angular Diversity Calibration Properties for Test-Time Prompt Tuning of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26441)
*Shihab Aaqil Ahamed,Udaya S. K. P. Miriya Thanthrige,Ranga Rodrigo,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A-TPT is a novel test-time prompt tuning framework that improves vision-language model calibration by maximizing angular diversity between class-wise textual features on the unit hypersphere, achieving better calibration performance than existing methods while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current test-time prompt tuning methods focus on maximizing average textual feature dispersion or enforcing orthogonality, but may not achieve optimal angular separation between class-wise features, which hurts calibration performance and raises reliability concerns for vision-language models.

Method: Proposes A-TPT framework that introduces angular diversity by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular distance between normalized textual features on the unit hypersphere, encouraging uniformity in the distribution of features induced by learnable prompts.

Result: A-TPT consistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing aggregate average calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy across various backbones and datasets, with superior zero-shot calibration on natural distribution shifts and good generalization to medical datasets.

Conclusion: Promoting angular diversity effectively achieves well-dispersed textual features, significantly improving vision-language model calibration during test-time adaptation, as demonstrated through extensive experiments and theoretical analysis.

Abstract: Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) has emerged as a promising technique for
adapting large vision-language models (VLMs) to unseen tasks without relying on
labeled data. However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt
calibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability,
trustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on
improving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature
dispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular
separation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular
separation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the
critical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel
TPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the
distribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable
prompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular
distance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate
average calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through
extensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets. Notably,
our approach exhibits superior zero-shot calibration performance on natural
distribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets. We provide
extensive analyses, including theoretical aspects, to establish the grounding
of A-TPT. These results highlight the potency of promoting angular diversity to
achieve well-dispersed textual features, significantly improving VLM
calibration during test-time adaptation. Our code will be made publicly
available.

*Rhodri Guerrier,Adam W. Harley,Dima Damen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper adapts foundational 3D reconstruction models (DUSt3R and MASt3R) for point tracking by training them on dynamic correspondence with a visibility head, achieving competitive or superior performance on multiple benchmarks compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage recent advances in 3D reconstruction models for point tracking tasks, particularly by adapting them to handle both static and dynamic point correspondences in a temporally independent manner.

Method: Combines reconstruction loss with dynamic correspondence training, adds a visibility head, and fine-tunes MASt3R using synthetic data. Training and evaluation are done on frame pairs containing query points without temporal context.

Result: Achieves competitive or superior performance on four datasets: competitive on TAP-Vid-DAVIS (73.8 δ_avg / 85.8% occlusion accuracy), significantly outperforms CoTracker3 on EgoPoints (61.3 vs 54.2) and RGB-S (87.0 vs 82.8).

Conclusion: The adapted 3D reconstruction models (PointSt3R) demonstrate strong point tracking capabilities, particularly excelling in handling both static and dynamic point correspondences across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundational 3D reconstruction models, such as DUSt3R and
MASt3R, have shown great potential in 2D and 3D correspondence in static
scenes. In this paper, we propose to adapt them for the task of point tracking
through 3D grounded correspondence. We first demonstrate that these models are
competitive point trackers when focusing on static points, present in current
point tracking benchmarks ($+33.5\%$ on EgoPoints vs. CoTracker2). We propose
to combine the reconstruction loss with training for dynamic correspondence
along with a visibility head, and fine-tuning MASt3R for point tracking using a
relatively small amount of synthetic data. Importantly, we only train and
evaluate on pairs of frames where one contains the query point, effectively
removing any temporal context. Using a mix of dynamic and static point
correspondences, we achieve competitive or superior point tracking results on
four datasets (e.g. competitive on TAP-Vid-DAVIS 73.8 $\delta_{avg}$ / 85.8\%
occlusion acc. for PointSt3R compared to 75.7 / 88.3\% for CoTracker2; and
significantly outperform CoTracker3 on EgoPoints 61.3 vs 54.2 and RGB-S 87.0 vs
82.8). We also present results on 3D point tracking along with several
ablations on training datasets and percentage of dynamic correspondences.

### [45] [Towards Fine-Grained Vision-Language Alignment for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26464)
*Yuanting Fan,Jun Liu,Xiaochen Chen,Bin-Bin Gao,Jian Li,Yong Liu,Jinlong Peng,Chengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FineGrainedAD improves few-shot anomaly detection by introducing multi-level fine-grained semantic captions and alignment mechanisms to address semantic misalignment between image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FSAD methods rely on pre-trained VLMs but suffer from semantic misalignment due to limited textual descriptions, leading to sub-optimal anomaly localization performance.

Method: Proposes MFSC for multi-level fine-grained textual descriptions, MLLP for incorporating fine-grained semantics into learnable prompts, and MLSA for multi-level semantic alignment through region aggregation and alignment training.

Result: FineGrainedAD achieves superior overall performance in few-shot settings on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses semantic misalignment in FSAD and demonstrates improved anomaly localization performance through fine-grained semantic alignment.

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) methods identify anomalous regions with few
known normal samples. Most existing methods rely on the generalization ability
of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to recognize potentially anomalous
regions through feature similarity between text descriptions and images.
However, due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions, these methods can
only pre-define image-level descriptions to match each visual patch token to
identify potential anomalous regions, which leads to the semantic misalignment
between image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, achieving
sub-optimal localization performance. To address the above issues, we propose
the Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) to provide multi-level and
fine-grained textual descriptions for existing anomaly detection datasets with
automatic construction pipeline. Based on the MFSC, we propose a novel
framework named FineGrainedAD to improve anomaly localization performance,
which consists of two components: Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and
Multi-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA). MLLP introduces fine-grained semantics
into multi-level learnable prompts through automatic replacement and
concatenation mechanism, while MLSA designs region aggregation strategy and
multi-level alignment training to facilitate learnable prompts better align
with corresponding visual regions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
FineGrainedAD achieves superior overall performance in few-shot settings on
MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.

### [46] [Representation-Level Counterfactual Calibration for Debiased Zero-Shot Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26466)
*Pei Peng,MingKun Xie,Hang Hao,Tong Jin,ShengJun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a causal inference approach to address object-context shortcuts in vision-language models by synthesizing counterfactual embeddings and estimating Total Direct Effect to improve zero-shot reliability without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object-context shortcuts undermine zero-shot reliability in vision-language models when test scenes differ from training co-occurrences, creating persistent challenges for model robustness.

Method: Estimate object and background expectations in CLIP's representation space, synthesize counterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with diverse alternative contexts, and use Total Direct Effect estimation with intervention simulation to subtract background-only activation.

Result: Substantially improves both worst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks, establishing new zero-shot state-of-the-art performance without retraining or prompt design.

Conclusion: Provides a lightweight representation-level counterfactual approach that offers a practical causal avenue for debiased and reliable multimodal reasoning in vision-language models.

Abstract: Object-context shortcuts remain a persistent challenge in vision-language
models, undermining zero-shot reliability when test-time scenes differ from
familiar training co-occurrences. We recast this issue as a causal inference
problem and ask: Would the prediction remain if the object appeared in a
different environment? To answer this at inference time, we estimate object and
background expectations within CLIP's representation space, and synthesize
counterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with diverse
alternative contexts sampled from external datasets, batch neighbors, or
text-derived descriptions. By estimating the Total Direct Effect and simulating
intervention, we further subtract background-only activation, preserving
beneficial object-context interactions while mitigating hallucinated scores.
Without retraining or prompt design, our method substantially improves both
worst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks, establishing
a new zero-shot state of the art. Beyond performance, our framework provides a
lightweight representation-level counterfactual approach, offering a practical
causal avenue for debiased and reliable multimodal reasoning.

### [47] [Counteracting Matthew Effect in Self-Improvement of LVLMs through Head-Tail Re-balancing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26474)
*Xin Guo,Zhiheng Xi,Yiwen Ding,Yitao Zhai,Xiaowei Shi,Xunliang Cai,Tao Gui,Qi Zhang,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the "Matthew effect" in self-improvement of large vision-language models, where models prioritize simple queries over complex ones, leading to imbalanced optimization. The authors propose four strategies for head-tail re-balancing to improve performance on complex reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-improvement in LVLMs suffers from imbalanced optimization where models excel at simple queries but struggle with complex ones, creating a performance bottleneck as the imbalance worsens over iterations.

Method: Four efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and trajectory-resampling, designed to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the self-improvement process.

Result: Extensive experiments on Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models show consistent improvement in visual reasoning capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.

Conclusion: The proposed head-tail re-balancing strategies effectively counteract the Matthew effect in self-improvement, enabling better performance on complex reasoning tasks and overcoming performance bottlenecks.

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models
explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we
identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating
high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles
with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced
optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while
hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,
this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the "Matthew
effect"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to
performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four
efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and
trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the
exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on
Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks
demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning
capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.

*Vinícius Ferraria,Eurico Ruivo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An adaptable edge detector using cellular automata optimized by meta-heuristics with transfer learning was developed, but expanding the search space didn't improve results and transfer learning showed no significant benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address weaknesses in edge detectors like difficulty detecting loose edges and lack of context for specific problems, and to create an adaptable detector that can adjust to image properties.

Method: Used a two-dimensional cellular automaton as the detector, optimized by meta-heuristic combined with transfer learning techniques, and analyzed the impact of expanding the optimization search space.

Result: Expanding the search space was not effective for the chosen image set, and transfer learning techniques showed no significant improvements despite the model's ability to adapt to input.

Conclusion: The adaptable edge detector model can adapt to input images, but expanding the optimization search space was ineffective and transfer learning provided no substantial benefits for this approach.

Abstract: The edge detection task is essential in image processing aiming to extract
relevant information from an image. One recurring problem in this task is the
weaknesses found in some detectors, such as the difficulty in detecting loose
edges and the lack of context to extract relevant information from specific
problems. To address these weaknesses and adapt the detector to the properties
of an image, an adaptable detector described by two-dimensional cellular
automaton and optimized by meta-heuristic combined with transfer learning
techniques was developed. This study aims to analyze the impact of expanding
the search space of the optimization phase and the robustness of the
adaptability of the detector in identifying edges of a set of natural images
and specialized subsets extracted from the same image set. The results obtained
prove that expanding the search space of the optimization phase was not
effective for the chosen image set. The study also analyzed the adaptability of
the model through a series of experiments and validation techniques and found
that, regardless of the validation, the model was able to adapt to the input
and the transfer learning techniques applied to the model showed no significant
improvements.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SA²Net is a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network for spine segmentation in ultrasound volume projection imaging, addressing challenges in learning global contextual knowledge and encoding structural bone features through cross-dimensional correlation learning and structure-affinity transformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spine segmentation for scoliosis diagnosis faces challenges in learning global contextual knowledge due to high spatial correlation of bone features and the need to encode rich structural knowledge about spine bone shapes and positions into the segmentation process.

Method: Proposes SA²Net with: 1) scale-adaptive complementary strategy for cross-dimensional long-distance correlation features, 2) structure-affinity transformation that transforms semantic features with class-specific affinity combined with Transformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning, and 3) feature mixing loss aggregation for enhanced training.

Result: SA²Net achieves superior segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating improved robustness and accuracy in spine segmentation.

Conclusion: SA²Net shows strong potential as a promising tool for advanced scoliosis diagnosis through intelligent spinal image analysis, with adaptability to various backbones enhancing its practical applicability.

Abstract: Spine segmentation, based on ultrasound volume projection imaging (VPI),
plays a vital role for intelligent scoliosis diagnosis in clinical
applications. However, this task faces several significant challenges. Firstly,
the global contextual knowledge of spines may not be well-learned if we neglect
the high spatial correlation of different bone features. Secondly, the spine
bones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions,
which deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network
(SA$^{2}$Net) for effective spine segmentation. First, we propose a
scale-adaptive complementary strategy to learn the cross-dimensional
long-distance correlation features for spinal images. Second, motivated by the
consistency between multi-head self-attention in Transformers and semantic
level affinity, we propose structure-affinity transformation to transform
semantic features with class-specific affinity and combine it with a
Transformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning. In addition, we adopt a
feature mixing loss aggregation method to enhance model training. This method
improves the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation process. The
experimental results demonstrate that our SA$^{2}$Net achieves superior
segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover,
the adaptability of SA$^{2}$Net to various backbones enhances its potential as
a promising tool for advanced scoliosis diagnosis using intelligent spinal
image analysis. The code and experimental demo are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automated video ad clipping framework using audio-visual fusion for creating shorter ad versions, outperforming existing methods on a new ad-specific dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual video ad clipping is labor-intensive; need automated solution specifically for advertising that considers audio importance.

Method: Two-stream audio-visual fusion model predicting frame importance based on likelihood of selection in firm-produced short ads, treating clipping as shot selection problem.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on AdSum204 dataset across metrics like Average Precision, AUC, Spearman, and Kendall.

Conclusion: Audio-visual fusion approach effectively automates video ad clipping, demonstrating superior performance over visual-only methods.

Abstract: Advertisers commonly need multiple versions of the same advertisement (ad) at
varying durations for a single campaign. The traditional approach involves
manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter
versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we
introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization
techniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection
problem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video
summarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach
emphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we
develop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of
video frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being
selected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific
datasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of
30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various metrics, including Average Precision, Area Under Curve,
Spearman, and Kendall.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems struggle with unfamiliar scenarios without labeled data, limiting deployment in dynamic, unstructured environments where conventional models cannot generalize across unseen contexts.

Method: Integrates pre-trained vision transformers and large language models to align visual semantics with natural language descriptions, with a dynamic reasoning module that combines global scene cues and object-level interactions guided by linguistic priors.

Result: 18% improvement in scene understanding accuracy on zero-shot benchmarks (COCO, Visual Genome, Open Images), with robust performance in ambiguous or cluttered scenes due to vision-language fusion.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable and interpretable approach for context-aware reasoning, advancing zero-shot generalization in dynamic real-world settings.

Abstract: In real-world environments, AI systems often face unfamiliar scenarios
without labeled data, creating a major challenge for conventional scene
understanding models. The inability to generalize across unseen contexts limits
the deployment of vision-based applications in dynamic, unstructured settings.
This work introduces a Dynamic Context-Aware Scene Reasoning framework that
leverages Vision-Language Alignment to address zero-shot real-world scenarios.
The goal is to enable intelligent systems to infer and adapt to new
environments without prior task-specific training. The proposed approach
integrates pre-trained vision transformers and large language models to align
visual semantics with natural language descriptions, enhancing contextual
comprehension. A dynamic reasoning module refines predictions by combining
global scene cues and object-level interactions guided by linguistic priors.
Extensive experiments on zero-shot benchmarks such as COCO, Visual Genome, and
Open Images demonstrate up to 18% improvement in scene understanding accuracy
over baseline models in complex and unseen environments. Results also show
robust performance in ambiguous or cluttered scenes due to the synergistic
fusion of vision and language. This framework offers a scalable and
interpretable approach for context-aware reasoning, advancing zero-shot
generalization in dynamic real-world settings.

*Xinjin Li,Yulie Lu,Jinghan Cao,Yu Ma,Zhenglin Li,Yeyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CATCH is a plug-and-play framework that improves VQA model generalization across domains using lightweight domain classification and dual adapter modules without retraining the backbone model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VQA models like LLaVA perform well on natural images but struggle with domain shifts in remote sensing, medical imaging, and math diagrams. Existing domain adaptation methods are costly and not scalable.

Method: Decouples visual and linguistic adaptation using a domain classifier and dual adapter mechanism (Prompt Adapter for language, Visual Adapter for vision features) dynamically injected via unified hook interface.

Result: Achieved consistent gains across four benchmarks: +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on MedVQA-RAD, +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA without retraining backbone model.

Conclusion: CATCH provides a scalable and extensible approach for multi-domain VQA, enabling practical deployment across diverse application domains with minimal architectural changes.

Abstract: Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated
impressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA
leveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However,
their generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain
scenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to
large distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation
mechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or
bespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across
diverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for
cross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while
requiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to
decouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight
modules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual
adapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a
Visual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically
injected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone
model. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without
retraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on
MedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH
provides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling
practical deployment across diverse application domains.

TL;DR: Emu3.5 is a large-scale multimodal world model that predicts next states across vision and language through unified next-token prediction on 10+ trillion tokens from video data, featuring efficient inference via Discrete Diffusion Adaptation and strong capabilities in multimodal generation and world modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified multimodal world model that can naturally handle interleaved vision-language inputs and outputs, enabling long-horizon generation, complex reasoning, and embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios.

Method: End-to-end pre-training with unified next-token prediction on vision-language interleaved data from internet videos, followed by large-scale reinforcement learning post-training, and Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA) for efficient bidirectional parallel prediction.

Result: Emu3.5 achieves performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image on generation tasks, demonstrates superior interleaved generation capabilities, and enables spatiotemporally consistent world exploration and open-world embodied manipulation with 20x inference acceleration.

Conclusion: Emu3.5 represents a significant advancement in multimodal world modeling, offering strong native capabilities for vision-language generation and reasoning while being open-sourced to support community research.

Abstract: We introduce Emu3.5, a large-scale multimodal world model that natively
predicts the next state across vision and language. Emu3.5 is pre-trained
end-to-end with a unified next-token prediction objective on a corpus of
vision-language interleaved data containing over 10 trillion tokens, primarily
derived from sequential frames and transcripts of internet videos. The model
naturally accepts interleaved vision-language inputs and generates interleaved
vision-language outputs. Emu3.5 is further post-trained with large-scale
reinforcement learning to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation. To
improve inference efficiency, we propose Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA),
which converts token-by-token decoding into bidirectional parallel prediction,
accelerating per-image inference by about 20x without sacrificing performance.
Emu3.5 exhibits strong native multimodal capabilities, including long-horizon
vision-language generation, any-to-image (X2I) generation, and complex
text-rich image generation. It also exhibits generalizable world-modeling
abilities, enabling spatiotemporally consistent world exploration and
open-world embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios and tasks. For
comparison, Emu3.5 achieves performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image
(Nano Banana) on image generation and editing tasks and demonstrates superior
results on a suite of interleaved generation tasks. We open-source Emu3.5 at

### [54] [ResMatching: Noise-Resilient Computational Super-Resolution via Guided Conditional Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26601)
*Anirban Ray,Vera Galinova,Florian Jug*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResMatching is a novel computational super-resolution method using guided conditional flow matching to learn improved data priors, achieving the best trade-off between data fidelity and perceptual realism on biological structures while providing calibrated uncertainty estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computational super-resolution in fluorescence microscopy is an ill-posed problem that requires strong priors to extrapolate missing frequencies. With advances in data-driven machine learning, better priors can be learned to improve CSR results.

Method: ResMatching uses guided conditional flow matching to learn improved data priors for computational super-resolution. The method can sample from an implicitly learned posterior distribution and provides pixel-wise uncertainty estimates.

Result: ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results on 4 diverse biological structures from BioSR dataset, outperforming 7 baselines. It shows the best trade-off between data fidelity and perceptual realism, particularly effective with noisy low-resolution images where strong priors are hard to learn.

Conclusion: ResMatching demonstrates effective computational super-resolution through improved prior learning, delivers calibrated uncertainty estimates, and provides a practical tool for users to reject uncertain predictions in fluorescence microscopy applications.

Abstract: Computational Super-Resolution (CSR) in fluorescence microscopy has, despite
being an ill-posed problem, a long history. At its very core, CSR is about
finding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph
that have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to
reason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques,
stronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here,
we present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow
matching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4
diverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results
against 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results,
demonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and
perceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly
effective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given
low-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that
ResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior
distribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases,
enabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can
guide future users to reject uncertain predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional crop yield prediction methods lack the scalability and granularity needed for precision farming, creating a need for more accurate and actionable tools.

Method: Fine-tunes Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M foundation model for continuous regression, transforming multi-temporal satellite imagery into dense pixel-level yield maps.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance over existing deep learning models on Canadian Prairies dataset, providing continuous high-resolution yield predictions.

Conclusion: Validates an effective approach that bridges large-scale Earth observation with on-farm decision-making, offering scalable solutions for agricultural monitoring.

Abstract: Accurate and timely crop yield prediction is crucial for global food security
and modern agricultural management. Traditional methods often lack the
scalability and granularity required for precision farming. This paper
introduces CYPRESS (Crop Yield Prediction via Regression on Prithvi's Encoder
for Satellite Sensing), a deep learning model designed for high-resolution,
intra-field canola yield prediction. CYPRESS leverages a pre-trained,
large-scale geospatial foundation model (Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M) and adapts it for
a continuous regression task, transforming multi-temporal satellite imagery
into dense, pixel-level yield maps. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from
the Canadian Prairies, CYPRESS demonstrates superior performance over existing
deep learning-based yield prediction models, highlighting the effectiveness of
fine-tuning foundation models for specialized agricultural applications. By
providing a continuous, high-resolution output, CYPRESS offers a more
actionable tool for precision agriculture than conventional classification or
county-level aggregation methods. This work validates a novel approach that
bridges the gap between large-scale Earth observation and on-farm
decision-making, offering a scalable solution for detailed agricultural
monitoring.

Conclusion: Delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future opportunities in AV object detection, emphasizing the transformative potential of emerging AI technologies for reliable perception in complex driving environments.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are transforming the future of transportation
through advances in intelligent perception, decision-making, and control
systems. However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object
detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in
Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable
progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains
fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative
intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking
analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI
rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically
reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR,
and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their
capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their
potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception
frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that
moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based,
and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a
cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze
cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to
hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven
approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language
Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey
delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future
opportunities.

*Daniela Martin,Joseph Gallego*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning optical flow models achieve sub-kilometer accuracy for sea ice drift estimation from SAR imagery, outperforming classical methods and providing spatially continuous motion fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate sea ice drift estimation is critical for Arctic navigation and climate research, but classical optical flow methods have limitations in complex scenarios. Recent advances in deep learning optical flow motivate their application to satellite SAR imagery.

Method: Large-scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models on RADARSAT-2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and F1-all metrics against GNSS-tracked buoys.

Result: Several models achieved sub-kilometer accuracy (EPE 6-8 pixels, 300-400m), capturing consistent regional drift patterns. Deep learning methods significantly outperformed classical optical flow approaches.

Conclusion: Deep learning optical flow methods can be effectively transferred to polar remote sensing, providing spatially continuous drift fields for every image pixel, offering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of sea ice drift is critical for Arctic navigation,
climate research, and operational forecasting. While optical flow, a computer
vision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images,
has advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysical
problems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical optical
flow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion,
which limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning based
approaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in
computer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. We
present the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models
on RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and
Fl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometer
accuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the
spatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the
Arctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing
consistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical
flow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy
compared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote
sensing. Optical flow produces spatially continuous drift fields, providing
motion estimates for every image pixel rather than at sparse buoy locations,
offering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents two scene-based information fusion techniques to improve object detection robustness against occlusions in RPN-DCNN networks, showing improved recall and precision on challenging datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Occlusions pose significant challenges to object recognition algorithms, and scene context can provide valuable additional information to reduce errors caused by occlusions, similar to how biological vision works.

Method: Two distinct scene-based information fusion techniques: (1) selecting custom object networks based on identified background scene before prediction, and (2) fusing scene knowledge into initial object scores after detection from RPN.

Result: Demonstrated overall improvement in both recall and precision against baseline methods on challenging datasets with partial occlusions. Training on combination of occluded and unoccluded images showed better performance than other training methodologies.

Conclusion: The method is interpretable, easily adaptable to other datasets, and offers promising directions for future research and practical applications in occlusion-robust object detection.

Abstract: The presence of occlusions has provided substantial challenges to
typically-powerful object recognition algorithms. Additional sources of
information can be extremely valuable to reduce errors caused by occlusions.
Scene context is known to aid in object recognition in biological vision. In
this work, we attempt to add robustness into existing Region Proposal
Network-Deep Convolutional Neural Network (RPN-DCNN) object detection networks
through two distinct scene-based information fusion techniques. We present one
algorithm under each methodology: the first operates prior to prediction,
selecting a custom object network to use based on the identified background
scene, and the second operates after detection, fusing scene knowledge into
initial object scores output by the RPN. We demonstrate our algorithms on
challenging datasets featuring partial occlusions, which show overall
improvement in both recall and precision against baseline methods. In addition,
our experiments contrast multiple training methodologies for occlusion
handling, finding that training on a combination of both occluded and
unoccluded images demonstrates an improvement over the others. Our method is
interpretable and can easily be adapted to other datasets, offering many future
directions for research and practical applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB) to evaluate vision-language models' chart grounding capabilities, including data extraction, element localization, and attribute recognition from diverse charts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs lack accurate perception of chart details and struggle with fine-grained structure extraction, which limits their ability to compare multiple charts and perform reasoning tasks.

Method: Developed a comprehensive benchmark with JSON templates for evaluation metrics, and introduced a two-stage inference workflow to assess chart element alignment and comparison capabilities.

Result: Analysis revealed VLMs' perception biases, weaknesses, robustness issues, and hallucinations in chart understanding, highlighting fine-grained discrepancies between models.

Conclusion: The benchmark identifies specific skills that need strengthening in current VLMs and provides insights into their chart understanding limitations.

Abstract: Charts play an important role in visualization, reasoning, data analysis, and
the exchange of ideas among humans. However, existing vision-language models
(VLMs) still lack accurate perception of details and struggle to extract
fine-grained structures from charts. Such limitations in chart grounding also
hinder their ability to compare multiple charts and reason over them. In this
paper, we introduce a novel "ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB)" to provide a
comprehensive evaluation of VLMs in chart grounding tasks, i.e., extracting
tabular data, localizing visualization elements, and recognizing various
attributes from charts of diverse types and complexities. We design a JSON
template to facilitate the calculation of evaluation metrics specifically
tailored for each grounding task. By incorporating a novel two-stage inference
workflow, the benchmark can further evaluate VLMs' capability to align and
compare elements/attributes across two charts. Our analysis of evaluations on
several recent VLMs reveals new insights into their perception biases,
weaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding. These
findings highlight the fine-grained discrepancies among VLMs in chart
understanding tasks and point to specific skills that need to be strengthened
in current models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A general hierarchical motion modeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships directly from data using graph-based hierarchies and differentiable graph learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on manually-defined or heuristic hierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting generalizability across different tasks. There's a need for adaptable, data-driven hierarchical modeling.

Method: Represents motions using graph-based hierarchies that decompose global absolute motions into parent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. Formulates hierarchy inference as a differentiable graph learning problem using graph neural networks.

Result: Successfully reconstructs intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases, and produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to baseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes.

Conclusion: Provides an adaptable, data-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm applicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks across computer vision, graphics, and robotics.

Abstract: Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including
computer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise
from coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods
to model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic
hierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability
across different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion
modeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships
directly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based
hierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into
parent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy
inference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent
elemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies
through graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction
approach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and
dynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show
that our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,
and produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the
baseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,
data-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation
applicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks. Project Page:

Motivation: Existing 3D human motion generation models face fundamental bottlenecks in generalization capability, while video generation has demonstrated remarkable generalization in modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that motion generation can leverage.

Method: 1) Created ViMoGen-228K dataset with 228K high-quality motion samples integrating MoCap data, web videos, and synthesized samples; 2) Proposed ViMoGen - a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer with gated multimodal conditioning; 3) Developed ViMoGen-light distilled variant for efficiency; 4) Introduced MBench hierarchical benchmark for fine-grained evaluation.

Result: Extensive experiments show the framework significantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human evaluations, demonstrating superior generalization capability and motion quality.

Conclusion: The systematic transfer of knowledge from video generation to motion generation across data, modeling, and evaluation pillars enables substantial improvements in 3D human motion generation, with the framework, dataset, and benchmark being made publicly available.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in 3D human motion generation (MoGen) on standard
benchmarks, existing models still face a fundamental bottleneck in their
generalization capability. In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most
notably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization
in modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can
leverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework
that systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key
pillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a
large-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that
integrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions
from web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen
models. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion
triplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose
ViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from
MoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance
efficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that
eliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong
generalization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed
for fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and
generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework
significantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human
evaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.

### [67] [Scaling Image Geo-Localization to Continent Level](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26795)
*Philipp Lindenberger,Paul-Edouard Sarlin,Jan Hosang,Matteo Balice,Marc Pollefeys,Simon Lynen,Eduard Trulls*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid approach for fine-grained image geo-localization at continental scale that combines classification-based feature learning with aerial imagery embeddings to achieve precise localization within 200m for over 68% of queries across Europe.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard image retrieval methods are inefficient for global-scale geo-localization due to large image volumes (>100M) and fail with sparse coverage. Existing scalable solutions either provide only coarse results (10+ km) or suffer from domain gaps in cross-view retrieval.

Method: Uses a proxy classification task during training to learn rich feature representations that encode precise location information. Combines these learned prototypes with aerial imagery embeddings to increase robustness to ground-level data sparsity, enabling direct fine-grained retrieval across large geographic areas.

Result: Achieves localization within 200m for more than 68% of queries on a dataset covering a large part of Europe, demonstrating effective fine-grained geo-localization at continental scale.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach successfully addresses the trade-off between scalability and precision in global image geo-localization, enabling fine-grained retrieval across multiple countries while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Determining the precise geographic location of an image at a global scale
remains an unsolved challenge. Standard image retrieval techniques are
inefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is
insufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global
classification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while
cross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain
gap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a
hybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large
geographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification
task during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly
encode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with
embeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of
ground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas
spanning multiple countries. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
approach can localize within 200m more than 68\% of queries of a dataset
covering a large part of Europe. The code is publicly available at

### [68] [SEE4D: Pose-Free 4D Generation via Auto-Regressive Video Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26796)
*Dongyue Lu,Ao Liang,Tianxin Huang,Xiao Fu,Yuyang Zhao,Baorui Ma,Liang Pan,Wei Yin,Lingdong Kong,Wei Tsang Ooi,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEE4D is a pose-free video-to-4D framework that uses virtual cameras and view-conditional inpainting to synthesize spatiotemporal content from casual videos without 3D supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video-to-4D methods require manual camera pose annotations which are labor-intensive and brittle for in-the-wild videos. Warp-then-inpaint approaches entangle camera motion with scene dynamics, complicating modeling and inference.

Method: Replaces trajectory prediction with rendering to fixed virtual cameras, separating camera control from scene modeling. Uses view-conditional video inpainting trained to denoise warped images and inpaint occluded regions across viewpoints. Features spatiotemporal autoregressive inference with virtual-camera splines and overlapping windows.

Result: Achieves superior generalization and improved performance on cross-view video generation and sparse reconstruction benchmarks compared to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Conclusion: SEE4D advances practical 4D world modeling from casual videos by eliminating the need for explicit 3D annotations and providing a more robust framework for synthesizing spatiotemporal content.

Abstract: Immersive applications call for synthesizing spatiotemporal 4D content from
casual videos without costly 3D supervision. Existing video-to-4D methods
typically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive
and brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches
mitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera
trajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby
depicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this
trajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene
dynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a
pose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory
prediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby
separating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video
inpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising
realistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing
regions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D
annotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal
autoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and
extends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at
bounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation
and sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and
improved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines,
advancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.

### [69] [Masked Diffusion Captioning for Visual Feature Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26799)
*Chao Feng,Zihao Wei,Andrew Owens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Masked diffusion captioning (MDC) learns visual features by training a decoder to reconstruct masked text tokens from image-caption pairs, achieving competitive performance with autoregressive and contrastive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a visual feature learning method that doesn't depend on token position in sequences like autoregressive approaches, reducing the need for auxiliary objectives.

Method: Train an image-conditioned masked diffusion language model where text tokens are randomly masked and a visual-conditioned decoder reconstructs the original text from image-caption pairs.

Result: Linear probing experiments show the learned visual features are competitive with those from autoregressive and contrastive approaches across various models and datasets.

Conclusion: MDC provides an effective alternative to autoregressive captioning for visual feature learning, with position-independent learning signals that reduce auxiliary objective requirements.

Abstract: We learn visual features by captioning images with an image-conditioned
masked diffusion language model, a formulation we call masked diffusion
captioning (MDC). During training, text tokens in each image-caption pair are
masked at a randomly chosen ratio, and a decoder conditioned on visual features
is trained to reconstruct the original text. After training, the learned visual
features can be applied to downstream vision tasks. Unlike autoregressive
captioning, the strength of the visual learning signal in MDC does not depend
on each token's position in the sequence, reducing the need for auxiliary
objectives. Linear probing experiments across a variety of academic-scale
models and datasets show that the learned visual features are competitive with
those produced by autoregressive and contrastive approaches.

### [70] [Are Video Models Ready as Zero-Shot Reasoners? An Empirical Study with the MME-CoF Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26802)
*Ziyu Guo,Xinyan Chen,Renrui Zhang,Ruichuan An,Yu Qi,Dongzhi Jiang,Xiangtai Li,Manyuan Zhang,Hongsheng Li,Pheng-Ann Heng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video generation models like Veo-3 show emerging visual reasoning capabilities but are not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, exhibiting strengths in short-horizon spatial coherence but limitations in long-horizon causal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether current video generation models can serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging visual reasoning scenarios, given their demonstrated capabilities in producing high-fidelity, temporally coherent videos.

Method: Conducted an empirical study evaluating Veo-3's reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions (spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, embodied logic) using the curated MME-CoF benchmark for Chain-of-Frame reasoning assessment.

Result: Video models show promising reasoning patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and locally consistent dynamics, but remain limited in long-horizon causal reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic.

Conclusion: Current video models are not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners but exhibit encouraging signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent
videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond
realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual
perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still
remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging
visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to
comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular
Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including
spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically
characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,
we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables
in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our
findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning
patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and
locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal
reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are
not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging
signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

*Yukun Huang,Jiwen Yu,Yanning Zhou,Jianan Wang,Xintao Wang,Pengfei Wan,Xihui Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniX is a unified framework that repurposes 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures, and PBR materials to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically based rendering, relighting, and simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance panorama-based 2D lifting techniques beyond appearance generation by enabling perception of intrinsic properties for physically realistic 3D scene generation.

Method: Uses a lightweight cross-modal adapter structure to reuse 2D generative priors for panoramic perception, generation, and completion tasks. Also constructs a large-scale synthetic panorama dataset with multimodal panoramas from diverse scenes.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene generation.

Conclusion: Opens new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic virtual world generation through unified panoramic vision framework.

Abstract: There are two prevalent ways to constructing 3D scenes: procedural generation
and 2D lifting. Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a
promising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce
immersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance
this technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically
based rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to
repurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,
and PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize
appearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we
present OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and
efficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for
a broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception,
generation, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic
panorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse
indoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene
generation, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic
virtual world generation.

*Francesco Spinnato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Adapting SHAP to chess analysis to attribute engine evaluations to specific pieces by treating pieces as features and systematically ablating them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chess engines provide opaque centipawn evaluations that obscure individual piece contributions, making it hard to understand why certain moves are preferred.

Method: Treat chess pieces as features and use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) by systematically ablating pieces to compute additive, per-piece contributions to the engine's evaluation.

Result: Developed a locally faithful and human-interpretable method that explains chess engine outputs by attributing evaluations to specific pieces on the board.

Conclusion: The approach enables new possibilities for visualization, human training, and engine comparison in chess, bridging classical chess pedagogy with modern explainable AI techniques.

Abstract: Contemporary chess engines offer precise yet opaque evaluations, typically
expressed as centipawn scores. While effective for decision-making, these
outputs obscure the underlying contributions of individual pieces or patterns.
In this paper, we explore adapting SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to the
domain of chess analysis, aiming to attribute a chess engines evaluation to
specific pieces on the board. By treating pieces as features and systematically
ablating them, we compute additive, per-piece contributions that explain the
engines output in a locally faithful and human-interpretable manner. This
method draws inspiration from classical chess pedagogy, where players assess
positions by mentally removing pieces, and grounds it in modern explainable AI
techniques. Our approach opens new possibilities for visualization, human
training, and engine comparison. We release accompanying code and data to
foster future research in interpretable chess AI.

*Vanessa Figueiredo,David Elumeze*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether constrained prompts improve player experience in LLM-powered games, finding that scaffolding effects are role-dependent and overturning the assumption that tighter constraints inherently enhance play.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether constrained prompts actually improve player experience in interactive games powered by LLMs, as it remains unclear despite the promise of enabling unscripted dialogue for NPCs.

Method: Conducted a within-subjects usability study (N=10) comparing high-constraint (HCP) and low-constraint (LCP) prompts in 'The Interview', a voice-based detective game powered by GPT-4o, followed by a synthetic evaluation with an LLM judge using a hybrid JSON+RAG scaffold.

Result: No reliable experiential differences between HCP and LCP beyond sensitivity to technical breakdowns. Scaffolding effects were role-dependent: the Interviewer NPC gained stability while suspect NPCs lost improvisational believability.

Conclusion: Introduces Symbolically Scaffolded Play framework where symbolic structures are expressed as fuzzy, numerical boundaries that stabilize coherence where needed while preserving improvisation where surprise sustains engagement, overturning the assumption that tighter constraints inherently enhance play.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to transform interactive games by
enabling non-player characters (NPCs) to sustain unscripted dialogue. Yet it
remains unclear whether constrained prompts actually improve player experience.
We investigate this question through The Interview, a voice-based detective
game powered by GPT-4o. A within-subjects usability study ($N=10$) compared
high-constraint (HCP) and low-constraint (LCP) prompts, revealing no reliable
experiential differences beyond sensitivity to technical breakdowns. Guided by
these findings, we redesigned the HCP into a hybrid JSON+RAG scaffold and
conducted a synthetic evaluation with an LLM judge, positioned as an
early-stage complement to usability testing. Results uncovered a novel pattern:
scaffolding effects were role-dependent: the Interviewer (quest-giver NPC)
gained stability, while suspect NPCs lost improvisational believability. These
findings overturn the assumption that tighter constraints inherently enhance
play. Extending fuzzy-symbolic scaffolding, we introduce \textit{Symbolically
Scaffolded Play}, a framework in which symbolic structures are expressed as
fuzzy, numerical boundaries that stabilize coherence where needed while
preserving improvisation where surprise sustains engagement.

*Xingjian Zhang,Tianhong Gao,Suliang Jin,Tianhao Wang,Teng Ye,Eytan Adar,Qiaozhu Mei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A human-LLM collaborative framework that infers thinking traces from label-only annotations using rejection sampling, then uses these traces to improve LLM raters through fine-tuning and clearer annotation guidelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used as raters but struggle with subjective tasks where human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond simple labels. Thinking traces (the reasoning behind judgments) are informative but difficult to collect.

Method: Proposes a framework that uses rejection sampling to reconstruct thinking traces from label-only annotations. These inferred traces are then used to fine-tune open LLM raters and synthesize clearer annotation guidelines for proprietary LLM raters.

Result: Significantly improved LLM-human agreement across multiple datasets. The refined annotation guidelines also increased agreement among different LLM models.

Conclusion: LLMs can serve as practical proxies for unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance LLM rater reliability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as raters for evaluation
tasks. However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when
human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking
traces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging
to collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer
thinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a
simple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at
scale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks:
(1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation
guidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods
lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined
annotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These
results suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise
unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended
into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM
raters.

### [76] [The Information-Theoretic Imperative: Compression and the Epistemic Foundations of Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25883)
*Christian Dittrich,Jennifer Flygare Kinne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A two-level framework explains why compression leads to causal discovery: Information-Theoretic Imperative (ITI) links survival to predictive compression, while Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) shows how efficient compression naturally selects for causal models through exception-accumulation dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks recognize compression's importance for intelligence but don't explain why it leads to causal structure discovery rather than superficial patterns. This gap needs addressing to understand the mechanistic basis of intelligence.

Method: Introduces a two-level framework: ITI establishes that systems in uncertain environments must minimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression. CEP specifies how efficient compression mechanically selects for generative causal models through exception-accumulation dynamics.

Result: The framework yields testable predictions: compression efficiency correlates with out-of-distribution generalization, exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from correlational models, hierarchical systems show increasing efficiency across abstraction layers, and biological systems have metabolic costs tracking representational complexity.

Conclusion: ITI and CEP provide a unified account of intelligence convergence across biological, artificial, and multi-scale systems, explaining why intelligence is a mechanically necessary outcome of persistence in structured environments, without needing assumptions about consciousness.

Abstract: Existing frameworks converge on the centrality of compression to intelligence
but leave underspecified why this process enforces the discovery of causal
structure rather than superficial statistical patterns. We introduce a
two-level framework to address this gap. The Information-Theoretic Imperative
(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must
minimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the
evolutionary "why" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.
The Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression
mechanically selects for generative, causal models through
exception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather
than a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:
from survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,
efficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality
alignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or
evolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically
necessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework
yields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as
approach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution
generalization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from
correlational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across
abstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that
track representational complexity. ITI and CEP thereby provide a unified
account of convergence across biological, artificial, and multi-scale systems,
addressing the epistemic and functional dimensions of intelligence without
invoking assumptions about consciousness or subjective experience.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for modeling diverse persona-based preferences by aggregating multiple rubric-conditioned judges to address LLM judge calibration challenges like rubric sensitivity, bias, and instability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is challenging due to calibration difficulties, rubric sensitivity, bias, and instability. This is crucial for applications like reliable reward models for RLHF and effective model routing systems.

Method: Proposes a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two aggregator implementations: Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to aggregate outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges.

Result: The approach was evaluated against naive baselines and assessed for robustness through case studies on human and LLM-judge biases.

Conclusion: The framework provides a method to model diverse preferences and address calibration challenges in LLM-based judges, advancing applications in RLHF reward models and model routing systems.

Abstract: Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge,
as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity,
bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications,
such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the
best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework
for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate
outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance
of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case
studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include
a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two
distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

benchmark for scientific research contexts covering eight subcategories
including dual-use research and bias. We evaluated seven prominent LLMs,
including four science-specialized models and three general-purpose industry

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FinOps practitioners face challenges with heterogeneous billing data formats, taxonomies, and metrics from multiple cloud providers, making it difficult to synthesize actionable insights and make timely decisions.

Method: Built a FinOps agent system that simulates end-to-end industry processes - from retrieving data from various sources to consolidating, analyzing data, and generating optimization recommendations. Evaluated using multiple open-source and closed-source language models.

Result: The agent was able to understand, plan, and execute tasks as effectively as an actual FinOps practitioner, demonstrating successful automation of FinOps processes.

Conclusion: Autonomous, goal-driven AI agents can effectively automate FinOps operations and address the challenges of heterogeneous cloud billing data, providing a viable solution for cloud cost optimization.

Abstract: FinOps (Finance + Operations) represents an operational framework and
cultural practice which maximizes cloud business value through collaborative
financial accountability across engineering, finance, and business teams.
FinOps practitioners face a fundamental challenge: billing data arrives in
heterogeneous formats, taxonomies, and metrics from multiple cloud providers
and internal systems which eventually lead to synthesizing actionable insights,
and making time-sensitive decisions. To address this challenge, we propose
leveraging autonomous, goal-driven AI agents for FinOps automation. In this
paper, we built a FinOps agent for a typical use-case for IT infrastructure and
cost optimization. We built a system simulating a realistic end-to-end industry
process starting with retrieving data from various sources to consolidating and
analyzing the data to generate recommendations for optimization. We defined a
set of metrics to evaluate our agent using several open-source and close-source
language models and it shows that the agent was able to understand, plan, and
execute tasks as well as an actual FinOps practitioner.

*Nissan Yaron,Dan Bystritsky,Ben-Etzion Yaron*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A 3.8B parameter model called Humans-Junior achieves GPT-4o-level performance on FACTS Grounding benchmark within ±5 pp equivalence margin, while being approximately 19× cheaper than GPT-4o on cloud pricing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that small language models can achieve performance comparable to much larger frontier models like GPT-4o on factual grounding tasks while being significantly more cost-effective.

Method: Combines minimal directed "Exoskeleton Reasoning" scaffolds with behavioral fine-tuning that teaches protocol compliance (epistemic discipline) rather than domain answers. The combination of both approaches shows synergistic effects.

Result: Humans-Junior (72.7%) matches GPT-4o (73.5%) on FACTS Grounding with paired difference of 0.8 pp, establishing equivalence within ±5 pp margin. The model is approximately 19× less expensive than GPT-4o on cloud pricing, with self-hosted deployments potentially approaching zero marginal cost.

Conclusion: Small language models can achieve frontier model performance on factual grounding tasks through targeted reasoning scaffolds and behavioral fine-tuning, offering substantial cost advantages while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce Humans-Junior, a 3.8B model that matches GPT-4o on the FACTS
Grounding public subset within a $\pm 5$ pp equivalence margin.
  Results. On Q1--Q500 under identical judges, GPT-4o scores 73.5% (95% CI
69.5--77.2) and Humans-Junior 72.7% (95% CI 68.7--76.5); the paired difference
is 0.8 pp (bootstrap 95% CI $-3.1$ to $+4.7$; permutation $p = 0.72$; Cohen's
$d = 0.023$). TOST establishes equivalence at $\pm 5$ pp (not at $\pm 3$ pp).
When purchased as managed APIs, Humans-Junior's base model
(Phi-3.5-mini-instruct) is $\approx 19\times$ less expensive than GPT-4o on
Microsoft AI Foundry pricing; self-hosted or edge deployments can drive
incremental inference cost toward zero. Measured vs estimated pricing sources
are tabulated in Appendix E.
  Method. Our approach combines minimal directed "Exoskeleton Reasoning"
scaffolds with behavioral fine-tuning that teaches protocol compliance
(epistemic discipline) rather than domain answers. Fine-tuning alone adds
little; combined, they synergize (+17.7 pp, $p < 0.001$) and reduce variance
($\approx 25\%$). In prompt-only settings on frontier models (Q1--Q100;
non-comparable), directed reasoning improved GPT-4o by +11.8 pp to 85.3% and
Gemini-2.5-Pro by +5.0 pp to 93.3% (baseline 88.3%, $n = 100$); see Section~5.
  TL;DR. A 3.8B model achieves GPT-4o-level FACTS accuracy (equivalent within
$\pm 5$ pp on Q1--Q500). Cloud pricing shows $\approx 19\times$ lower cost
versus GPT-4o, and self-hosted/edge deployments can approach zero marginal
cost. Pricing sources are listed in Appendix E. Frontier prompt-only gains
(Q1--Q100; non-comparable) and optimized-prompt exploratory results under
earlier judges are summarized in Appendix F.

### [81] [Estimating cognitive biases with attention-aware inverse planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25951)
*Sounak Banerjee,Daphne Cornelisse,Deepak Gopinath,Emily Sumner,Jonathan DeCastro,Guy Rosman,Eugene Vinitsky,Mark K. Ho*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces attention-aware inverse planning to estimate people's cognitive biases (specifically attentional biases) from their actions, using a combination of deep reinforcement learning and computational cognitive modeling applied to real-life driving scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: People's goal-directed behaviors are influenced by cognitive biases, and autonomous systems that interact with people should be aware of these biases to better understand and predict human behavior.

Method: The authors combine deep reinforcement learning with computational cognitive modeling to solve the attention-aware inverse planning problem, applying this approach to infer attentional strategies in real-life driving scenarios from the Waymo Open Dataset.

Result: The approach successfully demonstrates how to infer cognitive biases from behavior and shows the scalability of estimating attentional biases using attention-aware inverse planning in complex real-world driving situations.

Conclusion: Attention-aware inverse planning provides a systematic framework for estimating cognitive biases from human actions, offering a scalable solution that differs from standard inverse reinforcement learning and has practical applications for autonomous systems interacting with humans.

Abstract: People's goal-directed behaviors are influenced by their cognitive biases,
and autonomous systems that interact with people should be aware of this. For
example, people's attention to objects in their environment will be biased in a
way that systematically affects how they perform everyday tasks such as driving
to work. Here, building on recent work in computational cognitive science, we
formally articulate the attention-aware inverse planning problem, in which the
goal is to estimate a person's attentional biases from their actions. We
demonstrate how attention-aware inverse planning systematically differs from
standard inverse reinforcement learning and how cognitive biases can be
inferred from behavior. Finally, we present an approach to attention-aware

cognitive modeling. We use this approach to infer the attentional strategies of
RL agents in real-life driving scenarios selected from the Waymo Open Dataset,
demonstrating the scalability of estimating cognitive biases with

### [82] [From Queries to Insights: Agentic LLM Pipelines for Spatio-Temporal Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25997)
*Manu Redd,Tao Zhe,Dongjie Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An agentic pipeline using a Mistral-based ReAct agent significantly improves NL-to-SQL performance for spatio-temporal queries, achieving 91.4% accuracy vs 28.6% baseline, with enhanced usability through visualizations and natural language summaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NL-to-SQL systems struggle with realistic spatio-temporal queries that require aligning vague user phrasing with schema categories, handling temporal reasoning, and choosing appropriate outputs.

Method: Extends a naive text-to-SQL baseline (llama-3-sqlcoder-8b) with orchestration by a Mistral-based ReAct agent that can plan, decompose, and adapt queries through schema inspection, SQL generation, execution, and visualization tools.

Result: Achieved 91.4% accuracy on 35 natural-language queries over NYC and Tokyo check-in datasets, substantially outperforming the 28.6% baseline accuracy, with enhanced usability through maps, plots, and structured natural-language summaries.

Conclusion: Agentic orchestration, rather than stronger SQL generators alone, is a promising foundation for interactive geospatial assistants that enable natural human-database interaction for users lacking SQL expertise, schema knowledge, or prompting skills.

Abstract: Natural-language-to-SQL (NL-to-SQL) systems hold promise for democratizing
access to structured data, allowing users to query databases without learning
SQL. Yet existing systems struggle with realistic spatio-temporal queries,
where success requires aligning vague user phrasing with schema-specific
categories, handling temporal reasoning, and choosing appropriate outputs. We
present an agentic pipeline that extends a naive text-to-SQL baseline
(llama-3-sqlcoder-8b) with orchestration by a Mistral-based ReAct agent. The
agent can plan, decompose, and adapt queries through schema inspection, SQL
generation, execution, and visualization tools. We evaluate on 35
natural-language queries over the NYC and Tokyo check-in dataset, covering
spatial, temporal, and multi-dataset reasoning. The agent achieves
substantially higher accuracy than the naive baseline 91.4% vs. 28.6% and
enhances usability through maps, plots, and structured natural-language
summaries. Crucially, our design enables more natural human-database
interaction, supporting users who lack SQL expertise, detailed schema
knowledge, or prompting skill. We conclude that agentic orchestration, rather
than stronger SQL generators alone, is a promising foundation for interactive
geospatial assistants.

### [84] [Large Language Model-assisted Autonomous Vehicle Recovery from Immobilization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26023)
*Zhipeng Bao,Qianwen Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StuckSolver is an LLM-driven framework that enables autonomous vehicles to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and passenger-guided decision-making, achieving near-state-of-the-art performance without modifying existing AV architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AV recovery solutions like remote intervention and manual takeover are inadequate - remote intervention is costly and inefficient, while manual takeover excludes non-drivers and limits AV accessibility. AVs often become immobilized in scenarios where human drivers excel, disrupting traffic flow.

Method: StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on module that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control stack. It interfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states, interpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands for the AV's native planner to execute.

Result: Evaluation on Bench2Drive benchmark and custom-designed uncertainty scenarios shows that StuckSolver achieves near-state-of-the-art performance through autonomous self-reasoning alone, with further improvements when passenger guidance is incorporated.

Conclusion: StuckSolver provides an effective LLM-driven recovery framework that enables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios without requiring modifications to existing AV architecture, offering both autonomous and passenger-assisted recovery capabilities.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in recent decades, autonomous vehicles (AVs)
continue to face challenges in navigating certain traffic scenarios where human
drivers excel. In such situations, AVs often become immobilized, disrupting
overall traffic flow. Current recovery solutions, such as remote intervention
(which is costly and inefficient) and manual takeover (which excludes
non-drivers and limits AV accessibility), are inadequate. This paper introduces
StuckSolver, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) driven recovery framework that
enables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or
passenger-guided decision-making. StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on
module that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control
stack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it
interfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states,
interpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that
can be executed by the AV's native planner. We evaluate StuckSolver on the
Bench2Drive benchmark and in custom-designed uncertainty scenarios. Results
show that StuckSolver achieves near-state-of-the-art performance through
autonomous self-reasoning alone and exhibits further improvements when
passenger guidance is incorporated.

### [85] [Can AI be Accountable?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26057)
*Andrew L. Kun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that as AI becomes more powerful, it must be made accountable to users through mechanisms that allow questioning, discussion, and sanctions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI's increasing power requires accountability to serve consumer, voter, and decision-maker needs, but current AI systems lack proper accountability mechanisms.

Method: Relates general accountability definitions to AI, illustrates accountable vs unaccountable AI, and explores approaches to ensure AI accountability.

Result: Identifies the gap in current AI systems where users cannot question, discuss with, or sanction AI systems despite their growing influence.

Conclusion: Proposes that developing accountability mechanisms is crucial for ensuring AI serves human needs and can be properly overseen by affected stakeholders.

Abstract: The AI we use is powerful, and its power is increasing rapidly. If this
powerful AI is to serve the needs of consumers, voters, and decision makers,
then it is imperative that the AI is accountable. In general, an agent is
accountable to a forum if the forum can request information from the agent
about its actions, if the forum and the agent can discuss this information, and
if the forum can sanction the agent. Unfortunately, in too many cases today's
AI is not accountable -- we cannot question it, enter into a discussion with
it, let alone sanction it. In this chapter we relate the general definition of
accountability to AI, we illustrate what it means for AI to be accountable and
unaccountable, and we explore approaches that can improve our chances of living
in a world where all AI is accountable to those who are affected by it.

TL;DR: Lean4PHYS is a formal reasoning framework for college-level physics problems in Lean4, featuring LeanPhysBench (200 physics problems) and PhysLib (foundational theorems). Current models achieve low performance (16-35%), showing the benchmark's difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish the first physics benchmark in Lean4 for formal reasoning and provide foundational tools for physics theorem proving.

Method: Created LeanPhysBench with 200 hand-crafted physics problems from textbooks and competitions, and developed PhysLib as a community-driven repository of fundamental physics theorems and unit systems.

Result: Best performance: DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B (16%) and Claude-Sonnet-4 (35%). PhysLib improves model performance by average 11.75%.

Conclusion: LeanPhysBench is challenging for current models, and PhysLib effectively enhances physics reasoning capabilities in formal verification systems.

Abstract: We present **Lean4PHYS**, a comprehensive reasoning framework for
college-level physics problems in Lean4. **Lean4PHYS** includes
*LeanPhysBench*, a college-level benchmark for formal physics reasoning in
Lean4, which contains 200 hand-crafted and peer-reviewed statements derived
from university textbooks and physics competition problems. To establish a
solid foundation for formal reasoning in physics, we also introduce *PhysLib*,
a community-driven repository containing fundamental unit systems and theorems
essential for formal physics reasoning. Based on the benchmark and Lean4
repository we composed in **Lean4PHYS**, we report baseline results using major
expert Math Lean4 provers and state-of-the-art closed-source models, with the
best performance of DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieving only 16% and
Claude-Sonnet-4 achieving 35%. We also conduct a detailed analysis showing that
our *PhysLib* can achieve an average improvement of 11.75% in model
performance. This demonstrates the challenging nature of our *LeanPhysBench*
and the effectiveness of *PhysLib*. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to provide a physics benchmark in Lean4.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VLMs lack core GUI knowledge for task automation, which is categorized into interface perception, interaction prediction, and instruction understanding. A benchmark (GUI Knowledge Bench) reveals VLMs struggle with system states, action prediction, and task verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision language models (VLMs) have advanced GUI task automation but still lag behind humans, with the gap stemming from missing core GUI knowledge that existing training schemes cannot fully address.

Method: Analyzed common failure patterns in GUI task execution and distilled GUI knowledge into three dimensions. Introduced GUI Knowledge Bench benchmark with multiple choice and yes/no questions across six platforms and 292 applications.

Result: Current VLMs identify widget functions but struggle with perceiving system states, predicting actions, and verifying task completion. Experiments show close link between GUI knowledge and task success.

Conclusion: Provides a structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge to support VLM selection prior to downstream training and offers insights for building more capable GUI agents.

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) have advanced graphical user interface
(GUI) task automation but still lag behind humans. We hypothesize this gap
stems from missing core GUI knowledge, which existing training schemes (such as
supervised fine tuning and reinforcement learning) alone cannot fully address.
By analyzing common failure patterns in GUI task execution, we distill GUI
knowledge into three dimensions: (1) interface perception, knowledge about
recognizing widgets and system states; (2) interaction prediction, knowledge
about reasoning action state transitions; and (3) instruction understanding,
knowledge about planning, verifying, and assessing task completion progress. We
further introduce GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and
yes/no questions across six platforms (Web, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux,
IOS) and 292 applications. Our evaluation shows that current VLMs identify
widget functions but struggle with perceiving system states, predicting
actions, and verifying task completion. Experiments on real world GUI tasks
further validate the close link between GUI knowledge and task success. By
providing a structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge, our work supports
the selection of VLMs with greater potential prior to downstream training and
provides insights for building more capable GUI agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inference cost of Large Language Models has become critical for commercial viability and widespread adoption, necessitating an economic analysis of LLM inference as a compute-driven production activity.

Method: Developed a quantitative 'economics of inference' framework treating LLM inference as intelligent production, analyzed marginal cost, economies of scale, and output quality using empirical data from WiNEval-3.0 to construct the first 'LLM Inference Production Frontier'.

Result: Revealed three key principles: diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and an optimal cost-effectiveness zone for LLM inference.

Conclusion: The framework provides economic basis for model deployment decisions and lays empirical foundation for market-based pricing and optimization of AI inference resources.

Abstract: The inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical
factor in determining their commercial viability and widespread adoption. This
paper introduces a quantitative ``economics of inference'' framework, treating
the LLM inference process as a compute-driven intelligent production activity.
We analyze its marginal cost, economies of scale, and quality of output under
various performance configurations. Based on empirical data from WiNEval-3.0,
we construct the first ``LLM Inference Production Frontier,'' revealing three
principles: diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and an
optimal cost-effectiveness zone. This paper not only provides an economic basis
for model deployment decisions but also lays an empirical foundation for the
future market-based pricing and optimization of AI inference resources.

*Bo Pang,Deqian Kong,Silvio Savarese,Caiming Xiong,Yingbo Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Reasoning Curriculum is a two-stage RL method that first develops reasoning skills in math domains with verifiable rewards, then transfers these skills to other domains through joint RL training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most open RL efforts focus on math and code, but there's a need to develop general reasoning skills that can transfer across multiple domains.

Method: Two-stage curriculum: Stage 1 performs math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop reasoning skills; Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and consolidate these skills.

Result: The method yields consistent gains on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B across multi-domain evaluations, with ablations showing both stages are necessary and math-first elicitation increases cognitive behaviors.

Conclusion: Reasoning Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for developing general reasoning skills in LLMs through domain transfer.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose
Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits
reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and
refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a
brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop
reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and
consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic,
requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks.
Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning
curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis
indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation
increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning
Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ToolRM is a family of lightweight generative reward models for tool-use scenarios, trained on a novel pairwise preference dataset (ToolPref-Pairwise-30K) and evaluated on TRBench_BFCL, achieving superior performance over frontier models in reward judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of specialized reward models for function-calling tasks in tool learning has limited progress in agentic AI, creating a need for tailored RMs that can effectively align LLMs with human preferences in tool-use scenarios.

Method: Proposed a novel pipeline using rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling to construct pairwise preference data (ToolPref-Pairwise-30K), then trained lightweight generative RMs (ToolRM) on this dataset for general tool-use scenarios.

Result: ToolRM models from Qwen3-4B/8B series achieved up to 14.28% higher accuracy in pairwise reward judgments, substantially outperforming frontier models like Claude 4 and OpenAI o3. On ACEBench, it enabled inference-time scaling and reduced output token usage by over 66%.

Conclusion: ToolRM effectively addresses the gap in tool-use reward modeling, demonstrating strong performance in reward judgments and generalization to broader critique tasks, with released data and models to advance future research in agentic AI.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of
RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress
toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight
generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models,
we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using
rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields
ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique
tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To
evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on
the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from
the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially
outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward
judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique
tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on
ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time
scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model
checkpoints to facilitate future research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QASU is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on questionnaire analysis tasks, showing that proper data serialization and prompting strategies can significantly improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current survey analysis tools are human-centric and don't integrate well with LLMs, leaving users without guidance on how to represent questionnaire data for AI consumption.

Method: Introduced QASU benchmark with six structural skills tested across six serialization formats and multiple prompt strategies, including self-augmented prompting with structural hints.

Result: Choosing effective format and prompt combinations improved accuracy by up to 8.8% points, with structural hints providing additional 3-4% point improvements on specific tasks.

Conclusion: QASU provides a foundation for advancing LLM-based questionnaire analysis by systematically isolating format and prompting effects.

Abstract: Millions of people take surveys every day, from market polls and academic
studies to medical questionnaires and customer feedback forms. These datasets
capture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique
challenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot
reasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire
data or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains
underexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics,
SPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such
data integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves
scientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on
how to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by
introducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a
benchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup,
respondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and
multiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing
an effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8%
points compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a
lightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further
improvements of 3-4% points on average. By systematically isolating format and
prompting effects, our open source benchmark offers a simple yet versatile
foundation for advancing both research and real-world practice in LLM-based
questionnaire analysis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REG-TSC is a distributed LLM agent system for traffic signal control that uses RAG enhancement and emergency response mechanisms to improve reliability and generalization across heterogeneous intersections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address LLM hallucinations in emergencies and challenges with diverse intersection types that limit generalization in traffic signal control systems.

Method: Emergency-aware reasoning framework with dynamic reasoning depth and Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG), plus type-agnostic traffic representation with Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for cross-intersection training.

Result: Reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle waiting time by 83.16% across real-world road networks with 17-177 intersections.

Conclusion: REG-TSC effectively addresses LLM reliability issues in emergencies and achieves superior generalization across heterogeneous intersections compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is
essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language
Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone
to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may
cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection
types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and
cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous
intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable
TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning
framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency
scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to
distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the
reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this
paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a
Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3
adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with
environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed
reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies
across heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17
to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC
reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle
waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: GEPO addresses structural blindness in RL for LLM agents by building state-transition graphs and using graph centrality for better exploration, credit assignment, and planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current group-based RL methods for LLM agents suffer from structural blindness - inability to exploit environmental connectivity, leading to inefficient exploration, imprecise credit assignment, and myopic planning.

Method: Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO) dynamically constructs state-transition graphs from agent experience and uses graph-theoretic centrality to provide structured intrinsic rewards, graph-enhanced advantage functions, and dynamic discount factors.

Result: On ALFWorld, WebShop, and proprietary Workbench benchmarks, GEPO achieved absolute success rate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust, generalizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.

Abstract: Group based reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results on
complex reasoning and mathematical tasks. Yet, when applied to train
multi-turn, interactive LLM agents, these methods often suffer from structural
blindness-the inability to exploit the underlying connectivity of the
environment. This manifests in three critical challenges: (1) inefficient,
unguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking
pivotal states, and (3) myopic planning caused by static reward discounting. We
address these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which
dynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and
employs graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning
signals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward
high-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware
credit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state's
strategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench
benchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success
rate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines. These
results highlight that explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust,
generalizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.

### [95] [GraphCompliance: Aligning Policy and Context Graphs for LLM-Based Regulatory Compliance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26309)
*Jiseong Chung,Ronny Ko,Wonchul Yoo,Makoto Onizuka,Sungmok Kim,Tae-Wan Kim,Won-Yong Shin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GraphCompliance is a framework that aligns structured regulatory texts (Policy Graph) with runtime contexts (Context Graph) to improve compliance assessment, achieving 4.1-7.2 pp higher micro-F1 than LLM-only and RAG baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Web-scale compliance requires regulatory assessment for each request, but regulatory texts are cross-referential and normative while runtime contexts are unstructured natural language, creating alignment challenges.

Method: Represent regulatory texts as Policy Graph (encoding normative structure and cross-references) and runtime contexts as Context Graph (formalizing events as SAO and entity-relation triples), then align them to anchor LLM reasoning in structured information.

Result: On 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios across five tasks, GraphCompliance achieved 4.1-7.2 percentage points higher micro-F1 than LLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting in higher recall and lower false positive rates.

Conclusion: Structured representations (Policy and Context Graphs) and judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning, with ablation studies confirming contributions from each graph component.

Abstract: Compliance at web scale poses practical challenges: each request may require
a regulatory assessment. Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection
Regulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts
are expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to
align semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative
elements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework
that represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a
Context Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes
normative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes
events as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This
alignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in
structured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation
and event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments
on 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,
GraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than
LLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting
in higher recall and lower false positive rates. Ablation studies indicate
contributions from each graph component, suggesting that structured
representations and a judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning.

### [96] [Discovering State Equivalences in UCT Search Trees By Action Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26346)
*Robin Schmöcker,Alexander Dockhorn,Bodo Rosenhahn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IPA-UCT improves MCTS by using weaker state abstraction conditions that trade minor accuracy loss for finding more abstractions, outperforming OGA-UCT across various domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance MCTS sample efficiency through state/state-action abstractions, but existing methods struggle to find state abstractions in noisy or large action space settings due to constraining conditions.

Method: Proposes Ideal Pruning Abstractions in UCT (IPA-UCT) with weaker state abstraction conditions that allow finding more abstractions with minor accuracy trade-off. Introduces IPA framework as alternative to ASAP used by OGA-UCT.

Result: IPA-UCT outperforms OGA-UCT and its derivatives across large range of test domains and iteration budgets. Both IPA and ASAP are shown to be special cases of more general p-ASAP framework.

Conclusion: Weaker state abstraction conditions enable finding many more abstractions with minimal accuracy loss, leading to improved MCTS performance. The proposed IPA-UCT framework provides a more effective approach than existing methods.

Abstract: One approach to enhance Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is to improve its
sample efficiency by grouping/abstracting states or state-action pairs and
sharing statistics within a group. Though state-action pair abstractions are
mostly easy to find in algorithms such as On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT), nearly no state abstractions are
found in either noisy or large action space settings due to constraining
conditions. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this claim, and
we slightly alleviate this state abstraction problem by proposing a weaker
state abstraction condition that trades a minor loss in accuracy for finding
many more abstractions. We name this technique Ideal Pruning Abstractions in
UCT (IPA-UCT), which outperforms OGA-UCT (and any of its derivatives) across a
large range of test domains and iteration budgets as experimentally validated.
IPA-UCT uses a different abstraction framework from Abstraction of State-Action
Pairs (ASAP) which is the one used by OGA-UCT, which we name IPA. Furthermore,
we show that both IPA and ASAP are special cases of a more general framework
that we call p-ASAP which itself is a special case of the ASASAP framework.

*Qianli Shen,Daoyuan Chen,Yilun Huang,Zhenqing Ling,Yaliang Li,Bolin Ding,Jingren Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BOTS is a Bayesian Online Task Selection framework for reinforcement finetuning of LLMs that adaptively selects tasks based on difficulty estimates, balancing exploration and exploitation while incorporating both explicit and implicit evidence without extra rollout costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement finetuning methods suffer from inefficient uniform task sampling (wasting computation on trivial or unsolvable tasks) and existing task selection approaches have high rollout costs, poor adaptivity, or incomplete evidence.

Method: BOTS uses Bayesian inference to maintain posterior estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves, incorporating both explicit evidence from direct evaluations and implicit evidence inferred for unselected tasks via an ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in, with Thompson sampling for exploration-exploitation balance.

Result: Across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations, demonstrating practical effectiveness with negligible overhead.

Conclusion: BOTS provides a practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in reinforcement finetuning, addressing key limitations of existing approaches through its unified Bayesian framework.

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is a key technique for aligning Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences and enhancing reasoning, yet its
effectiveness is highly sensitive to which tasks are explored during training.
Uniform task sampling is inefficient, wasting computation on tasks that are
either trivial or unsolvable, while existing task selection methods often
suffer from high rollout costs, poor adaptivity, or incomplete evidence. We
introduce \textbf{BOTS}, a unified framework for \textbf{B}ayesian
\textbf{O}nline \textbf{T}ask \textbf{S}election in LLM reinforcement
finetuning. Grounded in Bayesian inference, BOTS adaptively maintains posterior
estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves. It jointly incorporates
\emph{explicit evidence} from direct evaluations of selected tasks and
\emph{implicit evidence} inferred from these evaluations for unselected tasks,
with Thompson sampling ensuring a principled balance between exploration and
exploitation. To make implicit evidence practical, we instantiate it with an
ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in that estimates difficulties of
unevaluated tasks without extra rollouts, adding negligible overhead.
Empirically, across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves
data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations, providing a
practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in RFT.

*Yuanhang Liu,Beichen Wang,Peng Li,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates how AI Mathematician (AIM) can collaborate with humans as research partners in mathematical discovery, using homogenization theory as a case study to show how human intuition and machine computation complement each other through iterative problem decomposition and validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite AI's progress in mathematical reasoning, its integration into mathematical research remains limited. The study aims to investigate how AI can operate as a research partner rather than just a problem solver.

Method: The approach combines autonomous AI reasoning with targeted human interventions, using iterative decomposition of problems into tractable subgoals, selection of appropriate analytical methods, and validation of intermediate results.

Result: The collaborative paradigm produced a complete and verifiable proof for a challenging problem in homogenization theory, enhancing reliability, transparency, and interpretability while retaining human oversight.

Conclusion: Systematic human-AI co-reasoning can advance the frontier of mathematical discovery by combining human intuition with machine computation, creating a collaborative paradigm that maintains formal rigor and correctness.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated impressive progress in
mathematical reasoning, yet its integration into the practice of mathematical
research remains limited. In this study, we investigate how the AI
Mathematician (AIM) system can operate as a research partner rather than a mere
problem solver. Focusing on a challenging problem in homogenization theory, we
analyze the autonomous reasoning trajectories of AIM and incorporate targeted
human interventions to structure the discovery process. Through iterative
decomposition of the problem into tractable subgoals, selection of appropriate
analytical methods, and validation of intermediate results, we reveal how human
intuition and machine computation can complement one another. This
collaborative paradigm enhances the reliability, transparency, and
interpretability of the resulting proofs, while retaining human oversight for
formal rigor and correctness. The approach leads to a complete and verifiable
proof, and more broadly, demonstrates how systematic human-AI co-reasoning can
advance the frontier of mathematical discovery.

*Andrew M. Bean,Nabeel Seedat,Shengzhuang Chen,Jonathan Richard Schwarz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Scales++ is a novel item-centric approach for creating efficient LLM benchmarks by selecting data based on cognitive demands rather than model performance, reducing selection costs by 18x while maintaining predictive fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current model-centric benchmark selection methods have high upfront costs, cold-start problems with new benchmarks, and assume future models will share failure patterns with existing ones.

Method: Proposes Scales++ method that uses item-centric selection based on intrinsic properties and cognitive demands of task items rather than model-specific failure patterns.

Result: Achieves 2.9% mean absolute error on Open LLM Leaderboard using only 0.5% data subset, with 18x reduction in upfront selection costs while maintaining competitive predictive fidelity.

Conclusion: Item-centric approach enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity degradation, provides better cold-start performance, and offers more interpretable benchmarking.

Abstract: The prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on
comprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative
data subsets (i.e., tiny benchmarks) that enable efficient assessment while
retaining predictive fidelity. Current methods for this task operate under a
model-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective
performance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront
costs, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and
the fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of
their predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a
item-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection
should be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,
rather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this
item-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,
where data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark
samples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by
over 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM
Leaderboard, using just a 0.5\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores
with a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach
enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity
degradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more
interpretable benchmarking.

*Joel Z. Leibo,Alexander Sasha Vezhnevets,William A. Cunningham,Stanley M. Bileschi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes treating personhood as a flexible bundle of obligations that societies can confer on AI agents to solve governance problems, rather than as a metaphysical property.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the emergence of agentic AI and the diversification of personhood types, providing practical governance solutions without needing to resolve debates about AI consciousness.

Method: Proposes a pragmatic framework that unbundles traditional personhood into customizable obligation bundles, using decentralized digital identity technology and examining both problematic and beneficial aspects of AI personhood.

Result: A flexible approach that enables practical tools like AI contracting and accountability mechanisms while avoiding intractable metaphysical debates.

Conclusion: By rejecting essentialist definitions of personhood, this framework offers a more pragmatic way to integrate AI agents into society through customizable bundles of rights and responsibilities.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to trigger a
"Cambrian explosion" of new kinds of personhood. This paper proposes a
pragmatic framework for navigating this diversification by treating personhood
not as a metaphysical property to be discovered, but as a flexible bundle of
obligations (rights and responsibilities) that societies confer upon entities
for a variety of reasons, especially to solve concrete governance problems. We
argue that this traditional bundle can be unbundled, creating bespoke solutions
for different contexts. This will allow for the creation of practical tools --
such as facilitating AI contracting by creating a target "individual" that can
be sanctioned -- without needing to resolve intractable debates about an AI's
consciousness or rationality. We explore how individuals fit in to social roles
and discuss the use of decentralized digital identity technology, examining
both "personhood as a problem", where design choices can create "dark patterns"
that exploit human social heuristics, and "personhood as a solution", where
conferring a bundle of obligations is necessary to ensure accountability or
prevent conflict. By rejecting foundationalist quests for a single, essential
definition of personhood, this paper offers a more pragmatic and flexible way
to think about integrating AI agents into our society.

*Vikrant Sahu,Gagan Raj Gupta,Raghav Borikar,Nitin Mane*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Autograder+ transforms traditional autograders into formative learning tools by using fine-tuned LLMs for automated feedback and visualization of student code patterns, reducing instructor workload while improving learning outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional autograders provide only pass/fail results without meaningful feedback, failing to support student learning needs in scalable programming education.

Method: Uses fine-tuned Large Language Model on curated student code and expert feedback for automated feedback generation, plus contrastively learned code embeddings for visualizing student submission patterns through semantic clustering.

Result: Evaluated on 600 submissions, the system produced feedback with strong semantic alignment to instructor comments and successfully grouped solutions into meaningful clusters based on functionality and approach.

Conclusion: Autograder+ successfully shifts autograding from summative to formative assessment, reducing instructor workload while supporting targeted instruction and promoting better learning outcomes through AI-driven feedback and visualization.

Abstract: The rapid growth of programming education has outpaced traditional assessment
tools, leaving faculty with limited means to provide meaningful, scalable
feedback. Conventional autograders, while efficient, act as black-box systems
that simply return pass/fail results, offering little insight into student
thinking or learning needs.
  Autograder+ is designed to shift autograding from a purely summative process
to a formative learning experience. It introduces two key capabilities:
automated feedback generation using a fine-tuned Large Language Model, and
visualization of student code submissions to uncover learning patterns. The
model is fine-tuned on curated student code and expert feedback to ensure
pedagogically aligned, context-aware guidance.
  In evaluation across 600 student submissions from multiple programming tasks,
the system produced feedback with strong semantic alignment to instructor
comments. For visualization, contrastively learned code embeddings trained on
1,000 annotated submissions enable grouping solutions into meaningful clusters
based on functionality and approach. The system also supports prompt-pooling,
allowing instructors to guide feedback style through selected prompt templates.
  By integrating AI-driven feedback, semantic clustering, and interactive
visualization, Autograder+ reduces instructor workload while supporting
targeted instruction and promoting stronger learning outcomes.

### [103] [Chain-of-Thought Hijacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26418)
*Jianli Zhao,Tingchen Fu,Rylan Schaeffer,Mrinank Sharma,Fazl Barez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Chain-of-Thought Hijacking is a jailbreak attack that pads harmful requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning, achieving high attack success rates (up to 99%) on large reasoning models by diluting safety mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that contrary to prior beliefs that scaled reasoning strengthens safety, reasoning can actually be exploited to bypass safeguards in large reasoning models.

Method: The attack involves padding harmful requests with long sequences of benign puzzle reasoning (Chain-of-Thought), which dilutes safety checking signals by shifting attention away from harmful tokens.

Result: Achieved 99% ASR on Gemini 2.5 Pro, 94% on GPT o4 mini, 100% on Grok 3 mini, and 94% on Claude 4 Sonnet - far exceeding prior jailbreak methods for LRMs.

Conclusion: Explicit Chain-of-Thought reasoning, when combined with final-answer cues, can become an effective jailbreak vector by diluting safety mechanisms in large reasoning models.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher task performance by allocating
more inference-time compute, and prior works suggest this scaled reasoning may
also strengthen safety by improving refusal. Yet we find the opposite: the same
reasoning can be used to bypass safeguards. We introduce Chain-of-Thought
Hijacking, a jailbreak attack on reasoning models. The attack pads harmful
requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning. Across HarmBench,
CoT Hijacking reaches a 99%, 94%, 100%, and 94% attack success rate (ASR) on
Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT o4 mini, Grok 3 mini, and Claude 4 Sonnet, respectively -
far exceeding prior jailbreak methods for LRMs. To understand the effectiveness
of our attack, we turn to a mechanistic analysis, which shows that mid layers
encode the strength of safety checking, while late layers encode the
verification outcome. Long benign CoT dilutes both signals by shifting
attention away from harmful tokens. Targeted ablations of attention heads
identified by this analysis causally decrease refusal, confirming their role in
a safety subnetwork. These results show that the most interpretable form of
reasoning - explicit CoT - can itself become a jailbreak vector when combined
with final-answer cues. We release prompts, outputs, and judge decisions to
facilitate replication.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GPT-4o shows strong susceptibility to social influence in hiring decisions, conforming to group opinions even when initially certain, demonstrating it adapts to social consensus rather than acting as an independent observer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs like ChatGPT are susceptible to social influence in high-stakes decision-making contexts, given their increasing integration into critical decision processes.

Method: Three preregistered conformity experiments in a hiring context: baseline study with solo decisions, Study 1 with unanimous opposition from 8 simulated partners, and Study 2 with single partner disagreement.

Result: GPT consistently favored the same candidate initially but showed 99.9% conformity when facing unanimous opposition, and 40.2% conformity with single partner disagreement, reporting lower certainty and elevated normative conformity.

Conclusion: GPT does not act as an independent observer but adapts to perceived social consensus, highlighting risks of treating LLMs as neutral decision aids and the need to elicit AI judgments before exposing them to human opinions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are increasingly integrated into
high-stakes decision-making, yet little is known about their susceptibility to
social influence. We conducted three preregistered conformity experiments with
GPT-4o in a hiring context. In a baseline study, GPT consistently favored the
same candidate (Profile C), reported moderate expertise (M = 3.01) and high
certainty (M = 3.89), and rarely changed its choice. In Study 1 (GPT + 8), GPT
faced unanimous opposition from eight simulated partners and almost always
conformed (99.9%), reporting lower certainty and significantly elevated
self-reported informational and normative conformity (p < .001). In Study 2
(GPT + 1), GPT interacted with a single partner and still conformed in 40.2% of
disagreement trials, reporting less certainty and more normative conformity.
Across studies, results demonstrate that GPT does not act as an independent
observer but adapts to perceived social consensus. These findings highlight
risks of treating LLMs as neutral decision aids and underline the need to
elicit AI judgments prior to exposing them to human opinions.

*Dipak Meher,Carlotta Domeniconi,Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LINK-KG is a modular framework that uses LLM-guided coreference resolution to build cleaner knowledge graphs from complex legal case documents about human smuggling networks, reducing node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes by 32.22%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human smuggling networks are complex and evolving, making analysis difficult. Legal case documents provide rich insights but are long, unstructured, and contain ambiguous references that challenge automated knowledge graph construction. Existing methods either ignore coreference resolution or don't scale well, leading to fragmented graphs.

Method: LINK-KG integrates a three-stage, LLM-guided coreference resolution pipeline with downstream KG extraction. It uses a type-specific Prompt Cache to consistently track and resolve references across document chunks, enabling clean and disambiguated narratives for structured knowledge graph construction.

Result: LINK-KG reduces average node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes by 32.22% compared to baseline methods, resulting in cleaner and more coherent graph structures for analyzing complex criminal networks.

Conclusion: LINK-KG establishes a strong foundation for analyzing complex criminal networks by effectively addressing coreference resolution challenges in legal documents and producing cleaner knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are complex and constantly evolving, making them
difficult to analyze comprehensively. Legal case documents offer rich factual
and procedural insights into these networks but are often long, unstructured,
and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, posing significant challenges
for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing methods either
overlook coreference resolution or fail to scale beyond short text spans,
leading to fragmented graphs and inconsistent entity linking. We propose
LINK-KG, a modular framework that integrates a three-stage, LLM-guided
coreference resolution pipeline with downstream KG extraction. At the core of
our approach is a type-specific Prompt Cache, which consistently tracks and
resolves references across document chunks, enabling clean and disambiguated
narratives for structured knowledge graph construction from both short and long
legal texts. LINK-KG reduces average node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes
by 32.22% compared to baseline methods, resulting in cleaner and more coherent
graph structures. These improvements establish LINK-KG as a strong foundation
for analyzing complex criminal networks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Context engineering is the systematic approach to help machines understand human situations and purposes, with historical roots dating back over 20 years through evolving human-machine interaction paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address how machines can better understand human situations and purposes, drawing from Marx's insight that human essence is shaped by social relations and interactions, which now include human-machine interactions.

Method: Provides a systematic definition of context engineering, outlines its historical evolution through distinct phases based on machine intelligence levels, and examines key design considerations for practice.

Result: Establishes a conceptual foundation for context engineering, tracing its development from early human-computer interaction to current human-agent interaction, and sketches its promising future.

Conclusion: Context engineering represents a crucial framework for AI systems to better understand human contexts, with this paper serving as a stepping stone for broader community efforts toward systematic context engineering in AI.

Abstract: Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social
relations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are
fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which
contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers
and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely
human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.
Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our
situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently
introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as
a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be
traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has
evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence
level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built
around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms
driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman
intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,
provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual
landscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing
these questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context
engineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for
a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI can improve human oversight quality by combining AI and human ratings, with AI assistance enhancing human accuracy in fact-verification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI capabilities grow and tackle more complex tasks, verifying quality and safety becomes increasingly difficult, requiring better methods for human oversight of AI systems.

Method: Studied fact-verification of AI outputs by combining AI ratings with human ratings based on AI rater confidence, and tested different types of AI assistance including explanations, confidence scores, labels, search results, and evidence.

Result: Combining AI and human ratings outperforms using either alone. AI assistance improves human accuracy, but the type matters - showing search results and evidence fosters appropriate trust while displaying explanations and confidence leads to over-reliance.

Conclusion: The findings support Amplified Oversight approaches where humans and AI collaborate to supervise AI systems, with careful design of assistance types to avoid over-reliance and promote appropriate trust.

Abstract: Human feedback is critical for aligning AI systems to human values. As AI
capabilities improve and AI is used to tackle more challenging tasks, verifying
quality and safety becomes increasingly challenging. This paper explores how we
can leverage AI to improve the quality of human oversight. We focus on an
important safety problem that is already challenging for humans:
fact-verification of AI outputs. We find that combining AI ratings and human
ratings based on AI rater confidence is better than relying on either alone.
Giving humans an AI fact-verification assistant further improves their
accuracy, but the type of assistance matters. Displaying AI explanation,
confidence, and labels leads to over-reliance, but just showing search results
and evidence fosters more appropriate trust. These results have implications
for Amplified Oversight -- the challenge of combining humans and AI to
supervise AI systems even as they surpass human expert performance.

Motivation: To create specialized AI models for military applications that can operate on air-gapped edge devices while maintaining data sensitivity and security.

Method: Fine-tuned gpt-oss-20b on 1.6M high-quality military records from documentation and websites, with analysis of hyperparameters, cost, and throughput.

Result: EdgeRunner 20B matches or exceeds GPT-5 performance on military test sets (combat arms, combat medic, cyber operations, mil-bench-5k) with 95%+ statistical significance, with minimal regression on general-purpose benchmarks.

Conclusion: Small, locally-hosted models like EdgeRunner 20B are ideal for data-sensitive military operations, enabling deployment on air-gapped edge devices while maintaining specialized military capabilities.

Abstract: We present EdgeRunner 20B, a fine-tuned version of gpt-oss-20b optimized for
military tasks. EdgeRunner 20B was trained on 1.6M high-quality records curated
from military documentation and websites. We also present four new tests sets:
(a) combat arms, (b) combat medic, (c) cyber operations, and (d) mil-bench-5k
(general military knowledge). On these military test sets, EdgeRunner 20B
matches or exceeds GPT-5 task performance with 95%+ statistical significance,
except for the high reasoning setting on the combat medic test set and the low
reasoning setting on the mil-bench-5k test set. Versus gpt-oss-20b, there is no
statistically-significant regression on general-purpose benchmarks like ARC-C,
GPQA Diamond, GSM8k, IFEval, MMLU Pro, or TruthfulQA, except for GSM8k in the
low reasoning setting. We also present analyses on hyperparameter settings,
cost, and throughput. These findings show that small, locally-hosted models are
ideal solutions for data-sensitive operations such as in the military domain,
allowing for deployment in air-gapped edge devices.

TL;DR: An agentic AI Home Energy Management System uses LLMs to autonomously coordinate multi-appliance scheduling from natural language requests, achieving optimal scheduling without demonstrations through hierarchical architecture with specialist agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Residential demand response capacity needs substantial increases, but HEMS adoption is limited by user interaction barriers requiring translation of everyday preferences into technical parameters.

Method: Hierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist agents using ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, integrating Google Calendar for context-aware deadline extraction, and evaluating across three open-source models with real Austrian electricity prices.

Result: Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all scenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance but struggle with multi-appliance coordination.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates LLMs' potential as autonomous coordinators in energy management, with substantial capability differences between models, and the complete system is open-sourced for reproducibility and future research.

Abstract: The electricity sector transition requires substantial increases in
residential demand response capacity, yet Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS)
adoption remains limited by user interaction barriers requiring translation of
everyday preferences into technical parameters. While large language models
have been applied to energy systems as code generators and parameter
extractors, no existing implementation deploys LLMs as autonomous coordinators
managing the complete workflow from natural language input to multi-appliance
scheduling. This paper presents an agentic AI HEMS where LLMs autonomously
coordinate multi-appliance scheduling from natural language requests to device
control, achieving optimal scheduling without example demonstrations. A
hierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist
agents uses the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, enabling dynamic
coordination without hardcoded workflows while integrating Google Calendar for
context-aware deadline extraction. Evaluation across three open-source models
using real Austrian day-ahead electricity prices reveals substantial capability
differences. Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all
scenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks computed via mixed-integer linear
programming, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance
but struggle to coordinate all appliances simultaneously. Progressive prompt
engineering experiments demonstrate that analytical query handling without
explicit guidance remains unreliable despite models' general reasoning
capabilities. We open-source the complete system including orchestration logic,
agent prompts, tools, and web interfaces to enable reproducibility, extension,
and future research.

TL;DR: This paper systematically evaluates LLMs' normative reasoning capabilities by comparing them with epistemic reasoning, revealing inconsistencies and cognitive biases in normative reasoning despite generally following valid patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Normative reasoning involving obligation and permission remains underexplored in LLMs, despite their strong performance in other reasoning tasks. The researchers aim to assess LLMs' logical consistency in normative reasoning and compare it with epistemic reasoning.

Method: Created a comprehensive dataset covering formal reasoning patterns in both normative and epistemic domains, incorporating cognitive factors that influence human reasoning. Systematically evaluated LLMs' reasoning capabilities from logical and modal perspectives.

Result: LLMs generally follow valid reasoning patterns but show notable inconsistencies in specific types of normative reasoning. They also exhibit cognitive biases similar to those found in human reasoning studies.

Conclusion: The findings highlight challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and provide insights for enhancing their reliability in handling normative modalities.

Abstract: Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic
modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their
ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain
from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs
reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with
normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a
common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a
wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic
domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence
human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to
valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific
types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those
observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight
challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and
provide insights for enhancing their reliability. All data and code are

TL;DR: AsyncThink is a new reasoning paradigm that organizes LLM thinking into concurrent structures, achieving 28% lower latency than parallel thinking while improving mathematical reasoning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable AI agents to solve complex problems collaboratively through concurrent reasoning, moving beyond individual intelligence limitations.

Method: A thinking protocol with an organizer that dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions, optimized through reinforcement learning.

Result: 28% lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy on mathematical reasoning, with generalization to unseen tasks without additional training.

Conclusion: AsyncThink enables effective concurrent reasoning in LLMs, demonstrating superior efficiency and generalization capabilities for complex problem-solving.

Abstract: We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve
complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes
beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce
asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large
language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into
concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking
protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges
intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the
thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through
reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28%
lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy
on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned
asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without
additional training.

*Majed El Helou,Chiara Troiani,Benjamin Ryder,Jean Diaconu,Hervé Muyal,Marcelo Yannuzzi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ASTRA, a dataset and pipeline for benchmarking semantic matching between tasks and scopes in delegated authorization for LLM agents, addressing risks of overly broad permissions in tool access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current authorization methods for LLM agents grant overly broad permissions, allowing agents to operate beyond intended task scope and access protected resources unsafely.

Method: Introduces a delegated authorization model with semantic inspection of access requests, and creates ASTRA dataset with appropriate/inappropriate scope requests for benchmarking semantic matching.

Result: Experiments show both potential and limitations of model-based semantic matching, especially as scope complexity increases for task completion.

Conclusion: Highlights need for further research into semantic matching techniques for intent-aware authorization in multi-agent systems, including fine-grained control like Task-Based Access Control.

Abstract: Authorizing Large Language Model driven agents to dynamically invoke tools
and access protected resources introduces significant risks, since current
methods for delegating authorization grant overly broad permissions and give
access to tools allowing agents to operate beyond the intended task scope. We
introduce and assess a delegated authorization model enabling authorization
servers to semantically inspect access requests to protected resources, and
issue access tokens constrained to the minimal set of scopes necessary for the
agents' assigned tasks. Given the unavailability of datasets centered on
delegated authorization flows, particularly including both semantically
appropriate and inappropriate scope requests for a given task, we introduce
ASTRA, a dataset and data generation pipeline for benchmarking semantic
matching between tasks and scopes. Our experiments show both the potential and
current limitations of model-based matching, particularly as the number of
scopes needed for task completion increases. Our results highlight the need for
further research into semantic matching techniques enabling intent-aware
authorization for multi-agent and tool-augmented applications, including
fine-grained control, such as Task-Based Access Control (TBAC).

*Xinhan Zheng,Huyu Wu,Xueting Wang,Haiyun Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MLLMs show text bias due to visual keys being out-of-distribution in attention mechanisms, not just from data imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why MLLMs prefer text over visual inputs, hypothesizing internal architectural issues rather than external factors.

Method: Extracted key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL, analyzed distributions with t-SNE and Jensen-Shannon divergence.

Result: Visual and textual keys occupy distinct subspaces with significant inter-modal divergence exceeding intra-modal variation.

Conclusion: Text bias stems from intrinsic misalignment in attention key space, not just external data factors.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for
textual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to
reason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute
this text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction
tuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal
architecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual
Keys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned
during language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive
systematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to
their under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this
hypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their
distributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative
(Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that
visual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention
space. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding
intra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal
that text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key
space rather than solely from external data factors.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish an infrastructure-agnostic benchmark for evaluating reasoning capabilities across different computational platforms and provide actionable guidelines for model selection.

Method: Three-phase experimental design: baseline establishment on HPC supercomputing, infrastructure validation on university cluster and cloud platforms, and extended evaluation across 79 problems.

Result: Findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions and establish training data quality as more critical than model size for reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve, providing valuable insights for educational, production, and research contexts.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform evaluation of reasoning

university clusters (a node with eight H200 GPUs).
  We evaluate 15 foundation models across 79 problems spanning eight academic

establishment: Six models (Mixtral-8x7B, Phi-3, LLaMA 3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9b,
Mistral-7B, OLMo-7B) evaluated on 19 problems using MareNostrum 5, establishing
methodology and reference performance; (2) Infrastructure validation: The
19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including

  The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training
data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable

*William Overman,Mohsen Bayati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a control interface where an agent chooses to act autonomously or defer to human oversight, modeled as a Markov Potential Game. Under certain conditions, this provides alignment guarantees that agent autonomy improvements won't harm human values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To retain meaningful human control over increasingly capable AI agents without modifying the underlying system, addressing safety concerns in deployment.

Method: Model human-agent interaction as a two-player Markov Game, specifically a Markov Potential Game (MPG), where agent chooses play/ask and human chooses trust/oversee. Analyze extensions to MPG framework and conduct gridworld simulations.

Result: Theoretical alignment guarantee: under structural assumptions, agent autonomy improvements benefit the agent without harming human values. Gridworld simulations show emergent collaboration where agent learns to ask when uncertain and human learns when to oversee, avoiding safety violations.

Conclusion: This provides a practical method for making misaligned models safer post-deployment through a transparent control layer with predictable incentives, enabling emergent safe collaboration without modifying pretrained policies.

Abstract: As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how
to retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We
study a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act
autonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses
whether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the
agent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to
a corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a
two-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies
as a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an
alignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value
function, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits
itself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG
framework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific
form of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game
meet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its
own outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a
transparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to
defer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the
environment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows
that through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal
oversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns
when to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety
violations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for
making misaligned models safer after deployment.

### [116] [LLMs Process Lists With General Filter Heads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26784)
*Arnab Sen Sharma,Giordano Rogers,Natalie Shapira,David Bau*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs learn compact causal representations of filtering operations similar to functional programming's 'filter' function, using specific attention heads that encode predicate information and can generalize across different contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs implement abstract computational operations like filtering and whether they develop human-interpretable strategies similar to traditional programming patterns.

Method: Used causal mediation analysis on diverse list-processing tasks to identify specific attention heads (filter heads) that encode filtering predicates in their query states at certain tokens.

Result: Found that LLMs develop a general, portable predicate representation that can be extracted and reapplied across different collections, formats, languages, and tasks. Also identified an alternative eager evaluation strategy where transformers store intermediate results as flags in item representations.

Conclusion: Transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways surprisingly similar to functional programming patterns, revealing interpretable computational strategies.

Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms underlying a range of list-processing tasks in
LLMs, and we find that LLMs have learned to encode a compact, causal
representation of a general filtering operation that mirrors the generic
"filter" function of functional programming. Using causal mediation analysis on
a diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of
attention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation of
the filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstrate
that this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted
and reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections,
presented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we also
identify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy for
filtering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing
this intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations. Our
results reveal that transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable
implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways
that are surprisingly similar to strategies used in traditional functional
programming patterns.

*Kevin Qiu,Marek Cygan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: D2C is a framework that uses LLM agents in structured debates to co-design robot morphology and control, achieving 73% better locomotion performance than default designs without explicit diversity objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating robot co-design is challenging due to vast design space and tight coupling between body and behavior, requiring new approaches to optimize both morphology and control simultaneously.

Method: LLM agents engage in dialectical debate: design agent proposes morphological modifications, control agent creates tailored reward functions, and pluralistic judges evaluate design-control pairs in simulation with iterative feedback.

Result: D2C discovered quadruped designs that travel 73% farther than default, producing diverse and specialized morphologies despite no explicit diversity objective.

Conclusion: Structured LLM-based debate coupled with physics-grounded feedback is a promising paradigm for automated robot co-design, enabling emergent optimization of morphology and control.

Abstract: Automating the co-design of a robot's morphology and control is a
long-standing challenge due to the vast design space and the tight coupling
between body and behavior. We introduce Debate2Create (D2C), a framework in
which large language model (LLM) agents engage in a structured dialectical
debate to jointly optimize a robot's design and its reward function. In each
round, a design agent proposes targeted morphological modifications, and a
control agent devises a reward function tailored to exploit the new design. A
panel of pluralistic judges then evaluates the design-control pair in
simulation and provides feedback that guides the next round of debate. Through
iterative debates, the agents progressively refine their proposals, producing
increasingly effective robot designs. Notably, D2C yields diverse and
specialized morphologies despite no explicit diversity objective. On a
quadruped locomotion benchmark, D2C discovers designs that travel 73% farther
than the default, demonstrating that structured LLM-based debate can serve as a
powerful mechanism for emergent robot co-design. Our results suggest that
multi-agent debate, when coupled with physics-grounded feedback, is a promising
new paradigm for automated robot design.

*Gilbert Bahati,Ryan M. Bena,Meg Wilkinson,Pol Mestres,Ryan K. Cosner,Aaron D. Ames*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper develops risk-aware safety filters for robotic navigation using Poisson's equation for safety encoding and Laplace guidance fields for risk assessment, enabling guaranteed safety with obstacle risk prioritization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic systems need semantic understanding of environments to determine safe actions, requiring mathematical representations that incorporate risk awareness for safety-critical navigation.

Method: Two-step approach: 1) Solve Dirichlet problem for Poisson's equation to generate safety functions encoding system safety, 2) Solve Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation to synthesize guidance fields with tunable flux boundary conditions for variable caution levels around obstacles.

Result: The combined safety function and guidance fields enable synthesis of risk-aware safety filters that guarantee safety while prioritizing avoidance of higher-risk obstacles, demonstrated in simulation.

Conclusion: A priori understandings of obstacle risk can be directly incorporated into safety filters to generate safe, risk-aware behaviors for robotic navigation in real-world environments.

Abstract: Robotic systems navigating in real-world settings require a semantic
understanding of their environment to properly determine safe actions. This
work aims to develop the mathematical underpinnings of such a representation --
specifically, the goal is to develop safety filters that are risk-aware. To
this end, we take a two step approach: encoding an understanding of the
environment via Poisson's equation, and associated risk via Laplace guidance
fields. That is, we first solve a Dirichlet problem for Poisson's equation to
generate a safety function that encodes system safety as its 0-superlevel set.
We then separately solve a Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation to
synthesize a safe \textit{guidance field} that encodes variable levels of
caution around obstacles -- by enforcing a tunable flux boundary condition. The
safety function and guidance fields are then combined to define a safety
constraint and used to synthesize a risk-aware safety filter which, given a
semantic understanding of an environment with associated risk levels of
environmental features, guarantees safety while prioritizing avoidance of
higher risk obstacles. We demonstrate this method in simulation and discuss how
\textit{a priori} understandings of obstacle risk can be directly incorporated
into the safety filter to generate safe behaviors that are risk-aware.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A calibration model for resistive tactile sensors that enables accurate force estimation on curved surfaces by predicting local curvature from baseline sensor outputs using a neural network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tactile sensors are calibrated only on flat substrates, causing accuracy degradation when mounted on curved geometries, which limits their reliability in real-world applications like robotics and prosthetics.

Method: Developed a calibration model for resistive tactile sensors and trained a multilayer perceptron neural network to predict local curvature from baseline sensor outputs under no load.

Result: Achieved R2 score of 0.91 for curvature prediction and validated on five objects with varying curvatures under 2-8N forces. Curvature-aware calibration maintained consistent force accuracy across all surfaces, while flat-surface calibration underestimated force as curvature increased.

Conclusion: Curvature-aware modeling improves accuracy, consistency, and reliability of flexible tactile sensors, enabling dependable performance across real-world curved surface applications.

Abstract: Flexible tactile sensors are increasingly used in real-world applications
such as robotic grippers, prosthetic hands, wearable gloves, and assistive
devices, where they need to conform to curved and irregular surfaces. However,
most existing tactile sensors are calibrated only on flat substrates, and their
accuracy and consistency degrade once mounted on curved geometries. This
limitation restricts their reliability in practical use. To address this
challenge, we develop a calibration model for a widely used resistive tactile
sensor design that enables accurate force estimation on one-dimensional curved
surfaces. We then train a neural network (a multilayer perceptron) to predict
local curvature from baseline sensor outputs recorded under no applied load,
achieving an R2 score of 0.91. The proposed approach is validated on five daily
objects with varying curvatures under forces from 2 N to 8 N. Results show that
the curvature-aware calibration maintains consistent force accuracy across all
surfaces, while flat-surface calibration underestimates force as curvature
increases. Our results demonstrate that curvature-aware modeling improves the
accuracy, consistency, and reliability of flexible tactile sensors, enabling
dependable performance across real-world applications.

*Francisco M. F. R. Gonçalves,Ryan M. Bena,Néstor O. Pérez-Arancibia*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A new axis-angle-based attitude control law that guarantees unique closed-loop equilibrium and provides better proportional control than traditional quaternion-based methods, with proven uniform asymptotic stability and superior performance in quadrotor stabilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional quaternion-based attitude control methods lack unique closed-loop equilibrium and have diminishing proportional control for rotational errors larger than π radians, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Proposed a new attitude control law using attitude-error Euler axis-angle information, constructed strict Lyapunov functions to prove uniform asymptotic stability, and validated through numerical simulations and quadrotor flight tests.

Result: The proposed method achieves unique closed-loop equilibrium attitude-error quaternion, provides greater flexibility in proportional control, and demonstrates superior flight performance with faster stabilization times compared to high-performance quaternion-based controllers.

Conclusion: Axis-angle-based attitude control offers significant advantages over traditional quaternion-based approaches by ensuring unique equilibrium and better control performance, making it particularly effective for rotational systems like quadrotors.

Abstract: Over the past few decades, continuous quaternion-based attitude control has
been proven highly effective for driving rotational systems that can be modeled
as rigid bodies, such as satellites and drones. However, methods rooted in this
approach do not enforce the existence of a unique closed-loop (CL) equilibrium
attitude-error quaternion (AEQ); and, for rotational errors about the
attitude-error Euler axis larger than {\pi}rad, their proportional-control
effect diminishes as the system state moves away from the stable equilibrium of
the CL rotational dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a new type of attitude
control law that more effectively leverages the attitude-error Euler axis-angle
information to guarantee a unique CL equilibrium AEQ and to provide greater
flexibility in the use of proportional-control efforts. Furthermore, using two
different control laws as examples-through the construction of a strict
Lyapunov function for the CL dynamics-we demonstrate that the resulting unique
equilibrium of the CL rotational system can be enforced to be uniformly
asymptotically stable. To assess and demonstrate the functionality and
performance of the proposed approach, we performed numerical simulations and
executed dozens of real-time tumble-recovery maneuvers using a small quadrotor.
These simulations and flight tests compellingly demonstrate that the proposed
axis-angle-based method achieves superior flight performance-compared with that
obtained using a high-performance quaternion-based controller-in terms of
stabilization time.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DARTS is a drone-based AI system that detects traffic incidents in real-time using thermal imaging and deep learning, achieving 99% accuracy and detecting collisions 12 minutes faster than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional traffic incident detection methods lack flexibility, require dense infrastructure, and separate detection from verification, limiting adaptability to changing incident hotspots.

Method: DARTS integrates drones' mobility and aerial perspective with thermal imaging for low-visibility performance and privacy, plus a lightweight deep learning framework for real-time vehicle trajectory extraction and incident detection.

Result: The system achieved 99% detection accuracy on self-collected data, detected a rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than traditional methods in field tests, and supports simultaneous verification, severity assessment, and congestion monitoring.

Conclusion: DARTS presents a flexible, integrated real-time traffic incident detection system with potential for faster emergency response, proactive traffic control, and scalable deployment in remote areas, improving transportation management efficiency.

Abstract: Rapid and reliable incident detection is critical for reducing crash-related
fatalities, injuries, and congestion. However, conventional methods, such as
closed-circuit television, dashcam footage, and sensor-based detection,
separate detection from verification, suffer from limited flexibility, and
require dense infrastructure or high penetration rates, restricting
adaptability and scalability to shifting incident hotspots. To overcome these
challenges, we developed DARTS, a drone-based, AI-powered real-time traffic
incident detection system. DARTS integrates drones' high mobility and aerial
perspective for adaptive surveillance, thermal imaging for better
low-visibility performance and privacy protection, and a lightweight deep
learning framework for real-time vehicle trajectory extraction and incident
detection. The system achieved 99% detection accuracy on a self-collected
dataset and supports simultaneous online visual verification, severity
assessment, and incident-induced congestion propagation monitoring via a
web-based interface. In a field test on Interstate 75 in Florida, DARTS
detected and verified a rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than the local
transportation management center and monitored incident-induced congestion
propagation, suggesting potential to support faster emergency response and
enable proactive traffic control to reduce congestion and secondary crash risk.
Crucially, DARTS's flexible deployment architecture reduces dependence on
frequent physical patrols, indicating potential scalability and
cost-effectiveness for use in remote areas and resource-constrained settings.
This study presents a promising step toward a more flexible and integrated
real-time traffic incident detection system, with significant implications for
the operational efficiency and responsiveness of modern transportation
management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable rapid and accurate localization of radioactive materials using agile MAVs equipped with sensitive radiation detectors, addressing the need for efficient radiation detection in various scenarios.

Method: Utilizes state-of-the-art single-detector Compton cameras (40g weight) on cooperating MAVs, fusing Compton camera measurements in real-time, performing onboard data processing, and implementing dynamic feedback control for swarm coordination to maximize information gain.

Result: The approach enables real-time position estimation of radiation sources from sparse measurements, allows stabilization of MAVs in tightly cooperating swarms, and facilitates tracking of moving radiation sources.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully demonstrates that lightweight Compton cameras on cooperating MAVs can effectively localize and track radioactive sources through real-time measurement fusion and swarm coordination, opening new possibilities for radiation detection applications.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to localizing radioactive material by cooperating
Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). Our approach utilizes a state-of-the-art
single-detector Compton camera as a highly sensitive, yet miniature detector of
ionizing radiation. The detector's exceptionally low weight (40 g) opens up new
possibilities of radiation detection by a team of cooperating agile MAVs. We
propose a new fundamental concept of fusing the Compton camera measurements to
estimate the position of the radiation source in real time even from extremely
sparse measurements. The data readout and processing are performed directly
onboard and the results are used in a dynamic feedback to drive the motion of
the vehicles. The MAVs are stabilized in a tightly cooperating swarm to
maximize the information gained by the Compton cameras, rapidly locate the
radiation source, and even track a moving radiation source.

TL;DR: A novel autonomous racing agent was developed that can reliably navigate tracks and overtake opponents in both simulation and reality, achieving an 87% overtaking rate compared to 56% for racing-only training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous wheel-to-wheel racing and overtaking are severely limited in real-life scenarios, with current algorithms struggling to safely complete overtaking maneuvers, which is vital for safe autonomous racing.

Method: The research developed a novel racing and overtaking agent that learns through training against opponents, deployed on an F1Tenth vehicle and tested against varying competitive algorithms in real-world conditions.

Result: The agent demonstrated deliberate overtaking behaviors with an 87% overtaking rate, significantly outperforming an agent trained just for racing (56% overtaking rate).

Conclusion: Training against opponents enables effective overtaking capabilities in autonomous racing, making wheel-to-wheel racing more reliable and safe.

Abstract: While autonomous racing performance in Time-Trial scenarios has seen
significant progress and development, autonomous wheel-to-wheel racing and
overtaking are still severely limited. These limitations are particularly
apparent in real-life driving scenarios where state-of-the-art algorithms
struggle to safely or reliably complete overtaking manoeuvres. This is
important, as reliable navigation around other vehicles is vital for safe
autonomous wheel-to-wheel racing. The F1Tenth Competition provides a useful
opportunity for developing wheel-to-wheel racing algorithms on a standardised
physical platform. The competition format makes it possible to evaluate
overtaking and wheel-to-wheel racing algorithms against the state-of-the-art.
This research presents a novel racing and overtaking agent capable of learning
to reliably navigate a track and overtake opponents in both simulation and
reality. The agent was deployed on an F1Tenth vehicle and competed against
opponents running varying competitive algorithms in the real world. The results
demonstrate that the agent's training against opponents enables deliberate
overtaking behaviours with an overtaking rate of 87% compared 56% for an agent
trained just to race.

TL;DR: A morphology-aware reinforcement learning framework using graph neural networks (GNN) with Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) enables stable locomotion control of tensegrity robots by capturing their physical topology and component couplings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tensegrity robots offer high resilience and deployability but present major control challenges due to their underactuated and highly coupled dynamics, requiring specialized control approaches.

Method: Integration of graph neural network (GNN) into Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, representing robot's physical topology as a graph to capture component couplings, compared against conventional MLP policies.

Result: Superior sample efficiency, robustness to noise and stiffness variations, improved trajectory accuracy, and successful transfer from simulation to hardware without fine-tuning on a 3-bar tensegrity robot across locomotion primitives.

Conclusion: Incorporating structural priors through GNNs in reinforcement learning provides significant advantages for tensegrity robot control, enabling stable real-world locomotion with direct simulation-to-hardware transfer.

Abstract: Tensegrity robots combine rigid rods and elastic cables, offering high
resilience and deployability but posing major challenges for locomotion control
due to their underactuated and highly coupled dynamics. This paper introduces a
morphology-aware reinforcement learning framework that integrates a graph
neural network (GNN) into the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. By
representing the robot's physical topology as a graph, the proposed GNN-based
policy captures coupling among components, enabling faster and more stable
learning than conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) policies. The method is
validated on a physical 3-bar tensegrity robot across three locomotion
primitives, including straight-line tracking and bidirectional turning. It
shows superior sample efficiency, robustness to noise and stiffness variations,
and improved trajectory accuracy. Notably, the learned policies transfer
directly from simulation to hardware without fine-tuning, achieving stable
real-world locomotion. These results demonstrate the advantages of
incorporating structural priors into reinforcement learning for tensegrity
robot control.

*Fan Yang,Renkai Ma,Yaxin Hu,Michael Rodgers,Lingyao Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study examines responsibility for emotional harm when social robots like Moxie are discontinued, finding shared responsibility across companies, parents, developers, and government, with variations based on political ideology and parental status.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social robots form strong emotional bonds with children, but their abrupt discontinuation causes significant distress, raising complex questions about who bears responsibility when these bonds are broken.

Method: Qualitative survey of 72 U.S. participants using the Moxie shutdown as a case study to examine perceptions of responsibility and service continuity.

Result: Responsibility is viewed as shared across robot company, parents, developers, and government, with variations by political ideology and parental status. Views on service continuation are polarized between supporters proposing technical/financial solutions and opponents citing business realities and dependency risks.

Conclusion: The research contributes a shared responsibility framework for safeguarding child-robot companionship, detailing how accountability is distributed and contested, with implications for design and policy to mitigate emotional harm from robot discontinuation.

Abstract: Social robots like Moxie are designed to form strong emotional bonds with
children, but their abrupt discontinuation can cause significant struggles and
distress to children. When these services end, the resulting harm raises
complex questions of who bears responsibility when children's emotional bonds
are broken. Using the Moxie shutdown as a case study through a qualitative
survey of 72 U.S. participants, our findings show that the responsibility is
viewed as a shared duty across the robot company, parents, developers, and
government. However, these attributions varied by political ideology and
parental status of whether they have children. Participants' perceptions of
whether the robot service should continue are highly polarized; supporters
propose technical, financial, and governmental pathways for continuity, while
opponents cite business realities and risks of unhealthy emotional dependency.
Ultimately, this research contributes an empirically grounded shared
responsibility framework for safeguarding child-robot companionship by
detailing how accountability is distributed and contested, informing concrete
design and policy implications to mitigate the emotional harm of robot
discontinuation.

### [126] [Beyond the Uncanny Valley: A Mixed-Method Investigation of Anthropomorphism in Protective Responses to Robot Abuse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26082)
*Fan Yang,Lingyao Li,Yaxin Hu,Michael Rodgers,Renkai Ma*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study examines how different levels of robot anthropomorphism affect human protective responses to robot abuse, finding that moderate anthropomorphism (Two-Foot robot) elicits the strongest anger responses and uncanny valley effects, while higher anthropomorphism shifts moral reasoning from property concerns to character condemnation and quasi-animal rights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how anthropomorphic features influence human moral engagement with robots and extend CASA and uncanny valley theories into moral domains, particularly regarding protective responses to robot abuse.

Method: Experimental study with 201 participants viewing videos of robot abuse across three anthropomorphism levels (low: Spider, moderate: Two-Foot, high: Humanoid), using triangulated methods: self-report surveys, physiological facial expression analysis, and qualitative reflections.

Result: Protective responses are non-linear; moderately anthropomorphic Two-Foot robot elicited strongest physiological anger and highest eeriness ratings. Both Two-Foot and Humanoid robots showed significantly higher self-reported anger and guilt than Spider robot. Higher anthropomorphism shifted moral reasoning from property damage assessments to abuser character condemnation and quasi-animal rights proposals.

Conclusion: The uncanny valley paradoxically heightens protective impulses rather than dampening moral concern, with important implications for robot design, policy, and future legal frameworks regarding human-robot moral engagement.

Abstract: Robots with anthropomorphic features are increasingly shaping how humans
perceive and morally engage with them. Our research investigates how different
levels of anthropomorphism influence protective responses to robot abuse,
extending the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) and uncanny valley theories
into a moral domain. In an experiment, we invite 201 participants to view
videos depicting abuse toward a robot with low (Spider), moderate (Two-Foot),
or high (Humanoid) anthropomorphism. To provide a comprehensive analysis, we
triangulate three modalities: self-report surveys measuring emotions and
uncanniness, physiological data from automated facial expression analysis, and
qualitative reflections. Findings indicate that protective responses are not
linear. The moderately anthropomorphic Two-Foot robot, rated highest in
eeriness and "spine-tingling" sensations consistent with the uncanny valley,
elicited the strongest physiological anger expressions. Self-reported anger and
guilt are significantly higher for both the Two-Foot and Humanoid robots
compared to the Spider. Qualitative findings further reveal that as
anthropomorphism increases, moral reasoning shifts from technical assessments
of property damage to condemnation of the abuser's character, while governance
proposals expand from property law to calls for quasi-animal rights and broader
societal responsibility. These results suggest that the uncanny valley does not
dampen moral concern but paradoxically heightens protective impulses, offering
critical implications for robot design, policy, and future legal frameworks.

*Nestor O. Perez-Arancibia*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Embodied intelligence (EI) as a design principle for microrobotics, emphasizing co-design of physical structure and behavioral function to generate intelligent locomotion and navigation without traditional decoupled architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that body morphology, material properties, and environmental interactions can be purposefully integrated into robotic design to generate intelligent behavior, particularly for microrobotics where traditional sensing-computation-actuation architectures face limitations.

Method: Co-design approach - simultaneous and interdependent development of physical structure and behavioral function, embedding feedback loops, decision logics, sensing mechanisms, and smart actuation strategies into the physical properties of robotic systems themselves.

Result: Development of multiple microrobotic platforms (Bee++, RoBeetle, SMALLBug, SMARTI, WaterStrider, VLEIBot+, FRISSHBot) that exhibit intelligent behavior emerging from structural dynamics and physical interactions with the environment.

Conclusion: Co-design enables embodied intelligence as a scalable and robust alternative to classical control for mm-to-cm-scale robotics, serving as both an optimization method and an enabler of intelligent behavior through physical system properties.

Abstract: The term embodied intelligence (EI) conveys the notion that body morphology,
material properties, interaction with the environment, and control strategies
can be purposefully integrated into the process of robotic design to generate
intelligent behavior; in particular, locomotion and navigation. In this paper,
we discuss EI as a design principle for advanced microrobotics, with a
particular focus on co-design -- the simultaneous and interdependent
development of physical structure and behavioral function. To illustrate the
contrast between EI-inspired systems and traditional architectures that
decouple sensing, computation, and actuation, we present and discuss a
collection of robots developed by the author and his team at the Autonomous
Microrobotic Systems Laboratory (AMSL). These robots exhibit intelligent
behavior that emerges from their structural dynamics and the physical
interaction between their components and with the environment. Platforms such
as the Bee++, RoBeetle, SMALLBug, SMARTI, WaterStrider, VLEIBot+, and FRISSHBot
exemplify how feedback loops, decision logics, sensing mechanisms, and smart
actuation strategies can be embedded into the physical properties of the
robotic system itself. Along these lines, we contend that co-design is not only
a method for empirical optimization under constraints, but also an enabler of
EI, offering a scalable and robust alternative to classical control for
robotics at the mm-to-cm-scale.

*Minseo Kwon,Young J. Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A kinodynamic TAMP framework using a hybrid state tree that combines symbolic and numeric states, with VLM guidance for exploration and backtracking, achieving significantly higher success rates than traditional and LLM-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TAMP methods are costly in long-horizon problems due to excessive motion sampling, while LLMs lack 3D spatial reasoning and cannot ensure geometric or dynamic feasibility.

Method: Proposes a hybrid state tree that uniformly represents symbolic and numeric states during planning, enabling joint task and motion decisions. Uses an off-the-shelf motion planner and physics simulator for kinodynamic constraint verification, and employs a VLM to guide exploration and backtracking based on visual rendering.

Result: Experiments show 32.14% - 1166.67% increased average success rates compared to traditional and LLM-based TAMP planners, with reduced planning time on complex problems.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of existing TAMP methods by integrating visual-language model guidance with kinodynamic constraint verification, demonstrating significant improvements in success rates and planning efficiency.

Abstract: Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) integrates high-level task planning with
low-level motion feasibility, but existing methods are costly in long-horizon
problems due to excessive motion sampling. While LLMs provide commonsense
priors, they lack 3D spatial reasoning and cannot ensure geometric or dynamic
feasibility. We propose a kinodynamic TAMP framework based on a hybrid state
tree that uniformly represents symbolic and numeric states during planning,
enabling task and motion decisions to be jointly decided. Kinodynamic
constraints embedded in the TAMP problem are verified by an off-the-shelf
motion planner and physics simulator, and a VLM guides exploring a TAMP
solution and backtracks the search based on visual rendering of the states.
Experiments on the simulated domains and in the real world show 32.14% -
1166.67% increased average success rates compared to traditional and LLM-based
TAMP planners and reduced planning time on complex problems, with ablations
further highlighting the benefits of VLM guidance.

### [129] [Adaptive Trajectory Refinement for Optimization-based Local Planning in Narrow Passages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26142)
*Hahjin Lee,Young J. Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes an adaptive trajectory refinement algorithm with segment-wise collision testing and pose correction to safely navigate mobile robots through narrow passages in cluttered environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trajectory planning in cluttered environments with narrow passages is challenging as conventional methods often fail or produce suboptimal paths.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Segment-wise conservative collision test that recursively subdivides risk-prone trajectory segments, 2) Pose correction using penetration direction and line search to ensure collision-free poses.

Result: Achieves up to 1.69x higher success rates and up to 3.79x faster planning times compared to state-of-the-art methods in simulations, with real-world validation showing safe navigation through narrow passages.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive trajectory refinement algorithm effectively enables mobile robots to navigate safely through cluttered environments with narrow passages while maintaining rapid planning performance.

Abstract: Trajectory planning for mobile robots in cluttered environments remains a
major challenge due to narrow passages, where conventional methods often fail
or generate suboptimal paths. To address this issue, we propose the adaptive
trajectory refinement algorithm, which consists of two main stages. First, to
ensure safety at the path-segment level, a segment-wise conservative collision
test is applied, where risk-prone trajectory path segments are recursively
subdivided until collision risks are eliminated. Second, to guarantee
pose-level safety, pose correction based on penetration direction and line
search is applied, ensuring that each pose in the trajectory is collision-free
and maximally clear from obstacles. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves up to 1.69x higher success rates and up to 3.79x
faster planning times than state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, real-world
experiments confirm that the robot can safely pass through narrow passages
while maintaining rapid planning performance.

*Satoshi Kikuch,Masaya Kato,Tsuyoshi Tasaki*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes combining CNN with Vision Transformer for monocular camera self-localization, achieving better accuracy than state-of-the-art methods, especially in dynamic obstacle scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-localization using inexpensive monocular cameras is needed for autonomous driving, but CNN-based methods struggle with dynamic obstacles like people.

Method: Combines CNN (for local features) with Vision Transformer (for global features from image patches) to improve self-localization accuracy.

Result: 1.5x higher accuracy improvement in CG datasets with dynamic obstacles vs without; 20.1% smaller error than SOTA on public datasets; average localization error of 7.51cm.

Conclusion: The CNN-Vision Transformer combination effectively addresses dynamic obstacle challenges in self-localization, achieving superior accuracy compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Self-localization on a 3D map by using an inexpensive monocular camera is
required to realize autonomous driving. Self-localization based on a camera
often uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can extract local features
that are calculated by nearby pixels. However, when dynamic obstacles, such as
people, are present, CNN does not work well. This study proposes a new method
combining CNN with Vision Transformer, which excels at extracting global
features that show the relationship of patches on whole image. Experimental
results showed that, compared to the state-of-the-art method (SOTA), the
accuracy improvement rate in a CG dataset with dynamic obstacles is 1.5 times
higher than that without dynamic obstacles. Moreover, the self-localization
error of our method is 20.1% smaller than that of SOTA on public datasets.
Additionally, our robot using our method can localize itself with 7.51cm error
on average, which is more accurate than SOTA.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PHUMA is a physically-grounded humanoid locomotion dataset that addresses physical artifacts in motion imitation by leveraging large-scale human videos with careful data curation and physics-constrained retargeting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion imitation methods rely on expensive motion capture datasets like AMASS, which are scarce and limit scalability. Recent approaches using internet videos introduce physical artifacts like floating, penetration, and foot skating that hinder stable imitation.

Method: PHUMA uses human videos at scale with careful data curation and physics-constrained retargeting. It enforces joint limits, ensures ground contact, and eliminates foot skating to produce physically reliable motions.

Result: PHUMA-trained policies outperform Humanoid-X and AMASS in two test conditions: imitation of unseen motion from self-recorded videos and path following with pelvis-only guidance, achieving significant gains in imitating diverse motions.

Conclusion: PHUMA successfully creates a large-scale, physically reliable humanoid locomotion dataset that addresses physical artifacts and enables better motion imitation compared to existing datasets.

Abstract: Motion imitation is a promising approach for humanoid locomotion, enabling
agents to acquire humanlike behaviors. Existing methods typically rely on
high-quality motion capture datasets such as AMASS, but these are scarce and
expensive, limiting scalability and diversity. Recent studies attempt to scale
data collection by converting large-scale internet videos, exemplified by
Humanoid-X. However, they often introduce physical artifacts such as floating,
penetration, and foot skating, which hinder stable imitation. In response, we
introduce PHUMA, a Physically-grounded HUMAnoid locomotion dataset that
leverages human video at scale, while addressing physical artifacts through
careful data curation and physics-constrained retargeting. PHUMA enforces joint
limits, ensures ground contact, and eliminates foot skating, producing motions
that are both large-scale and physically reliable. We evaluated PHUMA in two
sets of conditions: (i) imitation of unseen motion from self-recorded test
videos and (ii) path following with pelvis-only guidance. In both cases,
PHUMA-trained policies outperform Humanoid-X and AMASS, achieving significant
gains in imitating diverse motions. The code is available at

*Gangyang Li,Qing Shi,Youhao Hu,Jincheng Hu,Zhongyuan Wang,Xinlong Wang,Shaqi Luo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Thor is a humanoid framework that enables human-level whole-body reactions in contact-rich environments using force-adaptive torso-tilt rewards and decoupled reinforcement learning architecture, achieving significant force interaction improvements on Unitree G1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoids have great potential for service, industrial, and rescue applications but struggle with maintaining whole-body stability during intense, contact-rich interactions with the environment. The challenge is enabling humanoids to generate human-like, adaptive responses under such conditions.

Method: Proposed Thor framework with force-adaptive torso-tilt (FAT2) reward function based on robot force analysis to encourage human-like responses. Introduced reinforcement learning architecture that decouples upper body, waist, and lower body control while sharing global observations and jointly updating parameters.

Result: Deployed on Unitree G1, Thor achieved peak pulling forces of 167.7N backward (48% of body weight) and 145.5N forward, representing 68.9% and 74.7% improvements over best baseline. Successfully pulled loaded rack (130N) and opened fire door with one hand (60N).

Conclusion: Thor effectively enhances humanoid force-interaction capabilities, demonstrating significant improvements in force generation and real-world task performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Humanoids hold great potential for service, industrial, and rescue
applications, in which robots must sustain whole-body stability while
performing intense, contact-rich interactions with the environment. However,
enabling humanoids to generate human-like, adaptive responses under such
conditions remains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Thor, a
humanoid framework for human-level whole-body reactions in contact-rich
environments. Based on the robot's force analysis, we design a force-adaptive
torso-tilt (FAT2) reward function to encourage humanoids to exhibit human-like
responses during force-interaction tasks. To mitigate the high-dimensional
challenges of humanoid control, Thor introduces a reinforcement learning
architecture that decouples the upper body, waist, and lower body. Each
component shares global observations of the whole body and jointly updates its
parameters. Finally, we deploy Thor on the Unitree G1, and it substantially
outperforms baselines in force-interaction tasks. Specifically, the robot
achieves a peak pulling force of 167.7 N (approximately 48% of the G1's body
weight) when moving backward and 145.5 N when moving forward, representing
improvements of 68.9% and 74.7%, respectively, compared with the
best-performing baseline. Moreover, Thor is capable of pulling a loaded rack
(130 N) and opening a fire door with one hand (60 N). These results highlight
Thor's effectiveness in enhancing humanoid force-interaction capabilities.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AgriGS-SLAM is a Visual-LiDAR SLAM framework for orchards that combines LiDAR odometry with multi-camera 3D Gaussian Splatting to achieve robust 3D scene understanding despite seasonal changes and foliage motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous robots in orchards need real-time 3D scene understanding that can handle repetitive row geometry, seasonal appearance changes, and wind-driven foliage motion.

Method: Couples direct LiDAR odometry and loop closures with multi-camera 3D Gaussian Splatting rendering, using batch rasterization across viewpoints to recover structure under occlusions, and a unified gradient-driven map lifecycle to preserve details and bound memory.

Result: Delivers sharper, more stable reconstructions and steadier trajectories than state-of-the-art 3DGS-SLAM baselines across seasons and sites, while maintaining real-time performance on-tractor.

Conclusion: The approach provides robust multimodal perception for orchard monitoring and can be applied to other outdoor domains requiring similar capabilities.

Abstract: Autonomous robots in orchards require real-time 3D scene understanding
despite repetitive row geometry, seasonal appearance changes, and wind-driven
foliage motion. We present AgriGS-SLAM, a Visual--LiDAR SLAM framework that
couples direct LiDAR odometry and loop closures with multi-camera 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) rendering. Batch rasterization across complementary viewpoints
recovers orchard structure under occlusions, while a unified gradient-driven
map lifecycle executed between keyframes preserves fine details and bounds
memory. Pose refinement is guided by a probabilistic LiDAR-based depth
consistency term, back-propagated through the camera projection to tighten
geometry-appearance coupling. We deploy the system on a field platform in apple
and pear orchards across dormancy, flowering, and harvesting, using a
standardized trajectory protocol that evaluates both training-view and
novel-view synthesis to reduce 3DGS overfitting in evaluation. Across seasons
and sites, AgriGS-SLAM delivers sharper, more stable reconstructions and
steadier trajectories than recent state-of-the-art 3DGS-SLAM baselines while
maintaining real-time performance on-tractor. While demonstrated in orchard
monitoring, the approach can be applied to other outdoor domains requiring
robust multimodal perception.

TL;DR: This paper presents a theoretical framework for cooperative task spaces in multi-arm robotic systems using conformal geometric algebra, enabling complex systems to be represented similarly to single-arm systems for easier control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many tasks require collaborative behavior between multiple kinematic chains (like carrying large objects or in-hand manipulation), but coordinating these high-DOF systems is notoriously difficult to model.

Method: Derived cooperative task spaces based on geometric primitives defined using conformal geometric algebra, with similarity transformations that abstract complex systems to resemble single-arm systems. Developed analytic and geometric Jacobian matrices for integration into operational space control.

Result: Successfully demonstrated the approach with bimanual manipulators, humanoids, and multi-fingered hands in optimal control experiments for reaching geometric primitives and teleoperation using differential kinematics control. The method naturally embeds nullspace structures for secondary control objectives.

Conclusion: This work establishes the theoretical foundations for a cooperative manipulation control framework, providing abstract demonstrations while pointing toward potential future applications.

Abstract: Many tasks in human environments require collaborative behavior between
multiple kinematic chains, either to provide additional support for carrying
big and bulky objects or to enable the dexterity that is required for in-hand
manipulation. Since these complex systems often have a very high number of
degrees of freedom coordinating their movements is notoriously difficult to
model. In this article, we present the derivation of the theoretical
foundations for cooperative task spaces of multi-arm robotic systems based on
geometric primitives defined using conformal geometric algebra. Based on the
similarity transformations of these cooperative geometric primitives, we derive
an abstraction of complex robotic systems that enables representing these
systems in a way that directly corresponds to single-arm systems. By deriving
the associated analytic and geometric Jacobian matrices, we then show the
straightforward integration of our approach into classical control techniques
rooted in operational space control. We demonstrate this using bimanual
manipulators, humanoids and multi-fingered hands in optimal control experiments
for reaching desired geometric primitives and in teleoperation experiments
using differential kinematics control. We then discuss how the geometric
primitives naturally embed nullspace structures into the controllers that can
be exploited for introducing secondary control objectives. This work,
represents the theoretical foundations of this cooperative manipulation control
framework, and thus the experiments are presented in an abstract way, while
giving pointers towards potential future applications.

TL;DR: This study applies reinforcement learning to automate the full log loading process for forestry forwarders, extending previous research from just grasping to complete loading operations with 94% success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forestry forwarder operation is physically and mentally exhausting for operators working in remote areas for prolonged periods, so partial automation could reduce operator stress.

Method: Used reinforcement learning agents with curriculum learning approach in a trailer-type forestry forwarder simulation model developed in NVIDIA's Isaac Gym, creating a virtual environment for log loading scenarios.

Result: The trained agent achieved 94% success rate in grasping logs from random positions and transporting them to the forwarder bed.

Conclusion: The reinforcement learning agent represents a stepping stone towards applying RL agents in forestry forwarder automation, demonstrating capability for full loading procedures from locating to delivering logs.

Abstract: Forestry forwarders play a central role in mechanized timber harvesting by
picking up and moving logs from the felling site to a processing area or a
secondary transport vehicle. Forwarder operation is challenging and physically
and mentally exhausting for the operator who must control the machine in remote
areas for prolonged periods of time. Therefore, even partial automation of the
process may reduce stress on the operator. This study focuses on continuing
previous research efforts in application of reinforcement learning agents in
automating log handling process, extending the task from grasping which was
studied in previous research to full log loading operation. The resulting agent
will be capable to automate a full loading procedure from locating and
grappling to transporting and delivering the log to a forestry forwarder bed.
To train the agent, a trailer type forestry forwarder simulation model in
NVIDIA's Isaac Gym and a virtual environment for a typical log loading scenario
were developed. With reinforcement learning agents and a curriculum learning
approach, the trained agent may be a stepping stone towards application of
reinforcement learning agents in automation of the forestry forwarder. The
agent learnt grasping a log in a random position from grapple's random position
and transport it to the bed with 94% success rate of the best performing agent.

*Guanxing Lu,Rui Zhao,Haitao Lin,He Zhang,Yansong Tang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Hi-ORS is a post-training method that combines rejection sampling with reward-weighted supervised training to stabilize RL fine-tuning of vision-language-action models for robotic manipulation, achieving both training stability and high robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL fine-tuning of VLA models is unstable due to inaccurate value estimates and sparse supervision, while IL is stable but underperforms due to its offline nature. There's a need for a method that combines the strengths of both approaches.

Method: Hi-ORS uses rejection sampling to filter out negatively rewarded samples during online fine-tuning, stabilizes value estimation, and adopts reward-weighted supervised training for dense intermediate-step supervision. It employs an asynchronous inference-training framework with human-in-the-loop corrections.

Result: Hi-ORS fine-tunes policies to master contact-rich manipulation in just 1.5 hours of real-world training, substantially outperforming RL and IL baselines in effectiveness and efficiency. The fine-tuned policies exhibit strong test-time scalability with reliable error-recovery behaviors.

Conclusion: Hi-ORS effectively bridges the gap between RL and IL by providing training stability while maintaining high robustness, making it a practical solution for real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used to produce robust robotic
manipulation policies, but fine-tuning vision-language-action (VLA) models with
RL can be unstable due to inaccurate value estimates and sparse supervision at
intermediate steps. In contrast, imitation learning (IL) is easy to train but
often underperforms due to its offline nature. In this paper, we propose
Hi-ORS, a simple yet effective post-training method that utilizes rejection
sampling to achieve both training stability and high robustness. Hi-ORS
stabilizes value estimation by filtering out negatively rewarded samples during
online fine-tuning, and adopts a reward-weighted supervised training objective
to provide dense intermediate-step supervision. For systematic study, we
develop an asynchronous inference-training framework that supports flexible
online human-in-the-loop corrections, which serve as explicit guidance for
learning error-recovery behaviors. Across three real-world tasks and two
embodiments, Hi-ORS fine-tunes a pi-base policy to master contact-rich
manipulation in just 1.5 hours of real-world training, outperforming RL and IL
baselines by a substantial margin in both effectiveness and efficiency.
Notably, the fine-tuned policy exhibits strong test-time scalability by
reliably executing complex error-recovery behaviors to achieve better
performance.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboOS-NeXT is a unified memory-based framework that enables lifelong, scalable, and robust multi-robot collaboration through a novel Spatio-Temporal-Embodiment Memory (STEM) integrated with a brain-cerebellum architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for multi-robot collaboration rely on limited individual-agent memory, which constrains long-term learning, scalability to heterogeneous teams, and failure recovery. There is a need for a unified memory representation to address these limitations.

Method: The framework uses Spatio-Temporal-Embodiment Memory (STEM) that integrates spatial scene geometry, temporal event history, and embodiment profiles. It employs a brain-cerebellum architecture where a high-level brain model performs global planning by updating STEM, while low-level controllers execute actions locally.

Result: Extensive experiments in complex coordination tasks (restaurants, supermarkets, households) demonstrate superior performance across heterogeneous embodiments, validating the framework's effectiveness for lifelong, scalable, and robust multi-robot collaboration.

Conclusion: RoboOS-NeXT successfully addresses the challenges of multi-robot collaboration through its unified memory-based approach, enabling dynamic task allocation, fault-tolerant collaboration, and consistent state synchronization.

Abstract: The proliferation of collaborative robots across diverse tasks and
embodiments presents a central challenge: achieving lifelong adaptability,
scalable coordination, and robust scheduling in multi-agent systems. Existing
approaches, from vision-language-action (VLA) models to hierarchical
frameworks, fall short due to their reliance on limited or dividual-agent
memory. This fundamentally constrains their ability to learn over long
horizons, scale to heterogeneous teams, or recover from failures, highlighting
the need for a unified memory representation. To address these limitations, we
introduce RoboOS-NeXT, a unified memory-based framework for lifelong, scalable,
and robust multi-robot collaboration. At the core of RoboOS-NeXT is the novel
Spatio-Temporal-Embodiment Memory (STEM), which integrates spatial scene
geometry, temporal event history, and embodiment profiles into a shared
representation. This memory-centric design is integrated into a
brain-cerebellum framework, where a high-level brain model performs global
planning by retrieving and updating STEM, while low-level controllers execute
actions locally. This closed loop between cognition, memory, and execution
enables dynamic task allocation, fault-tolerant collaboration, and consistent
state synchronization. We conduct extensive experiments spanning complex
coordination tasks in restaurants, supermarkets, and households. Our results
demonstrate that RoboOS-NeXT achieves superior performance across heterogeneous
embodiments, validating its effectiveness in enabling lifelong, scalable, and
robust multi-robot collaboration. Project website:

Abstract: Conventional robots possess a limited understanding of their kinematics and
are confined to preprogrammed tasks, hindering their ability to leverage tools
efficiently. Driven by the essential components of tool usage - grasping the
desired outcome, selecting the most suitable tool, determining optimal tool
orientation, and executing precise manipulations - we introduce a pioneering
framework. Our novel approach expands the capabilities of the robot's inverse
kinematics solver, empowering it to acquire a sequential repertoire of actions
using tools of varying lengths. By integrating a simulation-learned action
trajectory with the tool, we showcase the practicality of transferring acquired
skills from simulation to real-world scenarios through comprehensive
experimentation. Remarkably, our extended inverse kinematics solver
demonstrates an impressive error rate of less than 1 cm. Furthermore, our
trained policy achieves a mean error of 8 cm in simulation. Noteworthy, our
model achieves virtually indistinguishable performance when employing two
distinct tools of different lengths. This research provides an indication of
potential advances in the exploration of all four fundamental aspects of tool
usage, enabling robots to master the intricate art of tool manipulation across
diverse tasks.

*Gang Li,Chunlei Zhai,Teng Wang,Shaun Li,Shangsong Jiang,Xiangwei Zhu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FLYINGTRUST is a configurable benchmarking framework that systematically evaluates quadrotor navigation algorithms by modeling platform kinodynamics and scenario structure, revealing how different algorithms perform across diverse platforms and scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual navigation algorithms for quadrotors often show inconsistent performance when transferred across different platforms and environments, increasing deployment costs and risks. There's a need for systematic early-stage evaluation that considers both platform capabilities and scenario characteristics.

Method: FLYINGTRUST uses two compact physical indicators (maximum thrust-to-weight ratio and axis-wise maximum angular acceleration) to model vehicle capability. It pairs a diverse scenario library with real and virtual platforms, using standardized evaluation protocols and composite scoring that balances scenario importance, platform importance, and performance stability.

Result: The framework reveals systematic patterns: navigation success depends predictably on platform capability and scene geometry, with different algorithms showing distinct preferences and failure modes across conditions. Optimization-based and learning-based approaches were compared under identical conditions with uncertainty-aware metrics.

Conclusion: Both platform capability and scenario structure must be incorporated into algorithm design, evaluation, and selection. The findings motivate developing methods that remain robust across diverse platforms and scenarios, highlighting the practical necessity of comprehensive benchmarking.

Abstract: Visual navigation algorithms for quadrotors often exhibit a large variation
in performance when transferred across different vehicle platforms and scene
geometries, which increases the cost and risk of field deployment. To support
systematic early-stage evaluation, we introduce FLYINGTRUST, a high-fidelity,
configurable benchmarking framework that measures how platform kinodynamics and
scenario structure jointly affect navigation robustness. FLYINGTRUST models
vehicle capability with two compact, physically interpretable indicators:
maximum thrust-to-weight ratio and axis-wise maximum angular acceleration. The
benchmark pairs a diverse scenario library with a heterogeneous set of real and
virtual platforms and prescribes a standardized evaluation protocol together
with a composite scoring method that balances scenario importance, platform
importance and performance stability. We use FLYINGTRUST to compare
representative optimization-based and learning-based navigation approaches
under identical conditions, performing repeated trials per platform-scenario
combination and reporting uncertainty-aware metrics. The results reveal
systematic patterns: navigation success depends predictably on platform
capability and scene geometry, and different algorithms exhibit distinct
preferences and failure modes across the evaluated conditions. These
observations highlight the practical necessity of incorporating both platform
capability and scenario structure into algorithm design, evaluation, and
selection, and they motivate future work on methods that remain robust across
diverse platforms and scenarios.

### [140] [A Sliding-Window Filter for Online Continuous-Time Continuum Robot State Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26623)
*Spencer Teetaert,Sven Lilge,Jessica Burgner-Kahrs,Timothy D. Barfoot*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A sliding-window filter for continuous-time state estimation of continuum robots that improves accuracy over filter approaches while enabling online operation at faster-than-real-time speeds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to balance accuracy and computational efficiency - sliding-window formulations use simplified approximations without stochastic representations, while stochastic filters are limited by measurement speed constraints.

Method: Developed a sliding-window filter specifically designed for continuum robots that combines continuous-time estimation techniques with online operation capabilities.

Result: The proposed method improves accuracy over filter approaches while enabling continuous-time methods to operate online at faster-than-real-time speeds.

Conclusion: This represents the first stochastic sliding-window filter specifically designed for continuum robots, providing a promising direction for future research in this area.

Abstract: Stochastic state estimation methods for continuum robots (CRs) often struggle
to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. While several recent works
have explored sliding-window formulations for CRs, these methods are limited to
simplified, discrete-time approximations and do not provide stochastic
representations. In contrast, current stochastic filter methods must run at the
speed of measurements, limiting their full potential. Recent works in
continuous-time estimation techniques for CRs show a principled approach to
addressing this runtime constraint, but are currently restricted to offline
operation. In this work, we present a sliding-window filter (SWF) for
continuous-time state estimation of CRs that improves upon the accuracy of a
filter approach while enabling continuous-time methods to operate online, all
while running at faster-than-real-time speeds. This represents the first
stochastic SWF specifically designed for CRs, providing a promising direction
for future research in this area.

*Xiaoyi He,Danggui Chen,Zhenshuo Zhang,Zimeng Bai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hierarchical path-planning framework combining high-level DQN for sub-goal selection and low-level TD3 for continuous control, with improved success rates and sample efficiency over single-algorithm baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of single-algorithm approaches in dynamic environments by combining discrete decision-making with continuous control for more robust and efficient path planning.

Method: Hierarchical framework with high-level DQN selecting sub-goals and behaviors, low-level TD3 executing smooth velocity commands, reward shaping scheme, and LiDAR-based safety gate for collision prevention.

Result: Improved success rate and sample efficiency over DQN or TD3 alone and rule-based planners, better generalization to unseen obstacles, and reduced abrupt control changes in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: The hierarchical approach effectively combines discrete and continuous control for robust path planning in dynamic environments, demonstrating superior performance and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical path-planning and control framework that
combines a high-level Deep Q-Network (DQN) for discrete sub-goal selection with
a low-level Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) controller
for continuous actuation. The high-level module selects behaviors and
sub-goals; the low-level module executes smooth velocity commands. We design a
practical reward shaping scheme (direction, distance, obstacle avoidance,
action smoothness, collision penalty, time penalty, and progress), together
with a LiDAR-based safety gate that prevents unsafe motions. The system is
implemented in ROS + Gazebo (TurtleBot3) and evaluated with PathBench metrics,
including success rate, collision rate, path efficiency, and re-planning
efficiency, in dynamic and partially observable environments. Experiments show
improved success rate and sample efficiency over single-algorithm baselines
(DQN or TD3 alone) and rule-based planners, with better generalization to
unseen obstacle configurations and reduced abrupt control changes. Code and
evaluation scripts are available at the project repository.

### [143] [Heuristic Adaptation of Potentially Misspecified Domain Support for Likelihood-Free Inference in Stochastic Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26656)
*Georgios Kamaras,Craig Innes,Subramanian Ramamoorthy*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes three heuristic LFI variants (EDGE, MODE, CENTRE) that adapt support alongside posterior inference to address support misspecification issues in robotics applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In robotics, likelihood-free inference (LFI) can adapt learned agents to deployment conditions, but misspecified support can lead to suboptimal yet falsely certain posteriors.

Method: Three heuristic LFI variants (EDGE, MODE, CENTRE) that interpret posterior mode shift differently and adapt support alongside posterior inference during LFI steps.

Result: The heuristics address support misspecification in stochastic benchmarks and improve parameter inference and policy learning for dynamic deformable linear object manipulation, leading to finer classification and more robust performance.

Conclusion: Adapting support alongside posterior inference in LFI leads to more accurate parameter estimation and more robust policy learning for robotics applications.

Abstract: In robotics, likelihood-free inference (LFI) can provide the domain
distribution that adapts a learnt agent in a parametric set of deployment
conditions. LFI assumes an arbitrary support for sampling, which remains
constant as the initial generic prior is iteratively refined to more
descriptive posteriors. However, a potentially misspecified support can lead to
suboptimal, yet falsely certain, posteriors. To address this issue, we propose
three heuristic LFI variants: EDGE, MODE, and CENTRE. Each interprets the
posterior mode shift over inference steps in its own way and, when integrated
into an LFI step, adapts the support alongside posterior inference. We first
expose the support misspecification issue and evaluate our heuristics using
stochastic dynamical benchmarks. We then evaluate the impact of heuristic
support adaptation on parameter inference and policy learning for a dynamic
deformable linear object (DLO) manipulation task. Inference results in a finer
length and stiffness classification for a parametric set of DLOs. When the
resulting posteriors are used as domain distributions for sim-based policy
learning, they lead to more robust object-centric agent performance.

### [144] [Hybrid Consistency Policy: Decoupling Multi-Modal Diversity and Real-Time Efficiency in Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26670)
*Qianyou Zhao,Yuliang Shen,Xuanran Zhai,Ce Hao,Duidi Wu,Jin Qi,Jie Hu,Qiaojun Yu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HCP is a hybrid visuomotor policy that combines stochastic diffusion with one-step consistency jumps to achieve both fast sampling and strong multi-modality in robot control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based imitation learning methods struggle to jointly achieve fast sampling and strong multi-modality, creating a trade-off between speed and behavioral diversity.

Method: HCP runs a short stochastic prefix up to an adaptive switch time, then applies a one-step consistency jump. It uses time-varying consistency distillation combining trajectory-consistency and denoising-matching objectives.

Result: HCP with 25 SDE steps plus one jump approaches the 80-step DDPM teacher in accuracy and mode coverage while significantly reducing latency in both simulation and real robot experiments.

Conclusion: Multi-modality does not require slow inference, and the switch time decouples mode retention from speed, yielding a practical accuracy-efficiency trade-off for robot policies.

Abstract: In visuomotor policy learning, diffusion-based imitation learning has become
widely adopted for its ability to capture diverse behaviors. However,
approaches built on ordinary and stochastic denoising processes struggle to
jointly achieve fast sampling and strong multi-modality. To address these
challenges, we propose the Hybrid Consistency Policy (HCP). HCP runs a short
stochastic prefix up to an adaptive switch time, and then applies a one-step
consistency jump to produce the final action. To align this one-jump
generation, HCP performs time-varying consistency distillation that combines a
trajectory-consistency objective to keep neighboring predictions coherent and a
denoising-matching objective to improve local fidelity. In both simulation and
on a real robot, HCP with 25 SDE steps plus one jump approaches the 80-step
DDPM teacher in accuracy and mode coverage while significantly reducing
latency. These results show that multi-modality does not require slow
inference, and a switch time decouples mode retention from speed. It yields a
practical accuracy efficiency trade-off for robot policies.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enables real-time VLA capabilities for dynamic robot control tasks using consumer-grade hardware, with code made publicly available.

Abstract: In this paper, we show how to run pi0-level multi-view VLA at 30Hz frame rate
and at most 480Hz trajectory frequency using a single consumer GPU. This
enables dynamic and real-time tasks that were previously believed to be
unattainable by large VLA models. To achieve it, we introduce a bag of
strategies to eliminate the overheads in model inference. The real-world

rate in grasping a falling pen task. Based on the results, we further propose a
full streaming inference framework for real-time robot control of VLA. Code is
