TL;DR: Fine-tuning ESA-IBM's TerraMind GFM on multimodal FloodsNet dataset improves flood mapping accuracy, with base-unfrozen model offering best balance of performance and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Floods are major climate hazards, and while EO satellites provide critical data, operational flood mapping depends on labeled datasets and model generalization. Recent GFMs like TerraMind offer improved generalizability but their performance on diverse global flood events remains poorly understood.

Method: Fine-tuned TerraMind for flood extent mapping using FloodsNet dataset (85 global flood events with Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical imagery). Tested four configurations (base vs. large models; frozen vs. unfrozen backbones) and compared against TerraMind Sen1Floods11 example and U-Net trained on both datasets.

Result: Base-unfrozen configuration provided best balance of accuracy, precision, and recall at lower computational cost. Large unfrozen model achieved highest recall. FloodsNet-trained models outperformed Sen1Floods11-trained example in recall with similar overall accuracy. U-Net achieved higher recall than all GFM configurations but with slightly lower accuracy and precision.

Conclusion: Integrating multimodal optical and SAR data and fine-tuning GFMs can enhance near-real-time flood mapping. This study provides one of the first global-scale GFM evaluations for flood segmentation, highlighting both potential and limitations for climate adaptation and disaster resilience.

Abstract: Floods are among the most damaging weather-related hazards, and in 2024, the warmest year on record, extreme flood events affected communities across five continents. Earth observation (EO) satellites provide critical, frequent coverage for mapping inundation, yet operational accuracy depends heavily on labeled datasets and model generalization. Recent Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs), such as ESA-IBM's TerraMind, offer improved generalizability through large-scale self-supervised pretraining, but their performance on diverse global flood events remains poorly understood.
  We fine-tune TerraMind for flood extent mapping using FloodsNet, a harmonized multimodal dataset containing co-located Sentinel-1 (Synthetic Aperture Radar, SAR data) and Sentinel-2 (optical) imagery for 85 flood events worldwide. We tested four configurations (base vs. large models; frozen vs. unfrozen backbones) and compared against the TerraMind Sen1Floods11 example and a U-Net trained on both FloodsNet and Sen1Floods11. The base-unfrozen configuration provided the best balance of accuracy, precision, and recall at substantially lower computational cost than the large model. The large unfrozen model achieved the highest recall. Models trained on FloodsNet outperformed the Sen1Floods11-trained example in recall with similar overall accuracy. U-Net achieved higher recall than all GFM configurations, though with slightly lower accuracy and precision.
  Our results demonstrate that integrating multimodal optical and SAR data and fine-tuning a GFM can enhance near-real-time flood mapping. This study provides one of the first global-scale evaluations of a GFM for flood segmentation, highlighting both its potential and current limitations for climate adaptation and disaster resilience.

### [2] [Context-Enriched Contrastive Loss: Enhancing Presentation of Inherent Sample Connections in Contrastive Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02152)
*Haojin Deng,Yimin Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a context-enriched contrastive loss function with two convergence targets to address information distortion in contrastive learning while improving learning effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrastive learning can introduce information distortion where models over-rely on samples with identical labels while neglecting positive pairs from the same original image, especially in large datasets.

Method: A context-enriched contrastive loss function with two components: (1) label-sensitive component differentiating features of identical vs. distinct classes, and (2) component drawing closer augmented samples from same source image while distancing all others.

Result: Achieves improvements over 16 state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods on 8 benchmark datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Caltech-101, Caltech-256, ImageNet, BiasedMNIST, UTKFace, CelebA) in both generalization and convergence speed. Shows 22.9% improvement on BiasedMNIST for systematic distortion tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses information distortion in contrastive learning, leading to more efficient and equitable downstream training with better generalization and faster convergence.

Abstract: Contrastive learning has gained popularity and pushes state-of-the-art performance across numerous large-scale benchmarks. In contrastive learning, the contrastive loss function plays a pivotal role in discerning similarities between samples through techniques such as rotation or cropping. However, this learning mechanism can also introduce information distortion from the augmented samples. This is because the trained model may develop a significant overreliance on information from samples with identical labels, while concurrently neglecting positive pairs that originate from the same initial image, especially in expansive datasets. This paper proposes a context-enriched contrastive loss function that concurrently improves learning effectiveness and addresses the information distortion by encompassing two convergence targets. The first component, which is notably sensitive to label contrast, differentiates between features of identical and distinct classes which boosts the contrastive training efficiency. Meanwhile, the second component draws closer the augmented samples from the same source image and distances all other samples. We evaluate the proposed approach on image classification tasks, which are among the most widely accepted 8 recognition large-scale benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Caltech-101, Caltech-256, ImageNet, BiasedMNIST, UTKFace, and CelebA datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves improvements over 16 state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods in terms of both generalization performance and learning convergence speed. Interestingly, our technique stands out in addressing systematic distortion tasks. It demonstrates a 22.9% improvement compared to original contrastive loss functions in the downstream BiasedMNIST dataset, highlighting its promise for more efficient and equitable downstream training.

### [3] [FineGRAIN: Evaluating Failure Modes of Text-to-Image Models with Vision Language Model Judges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02161)
*Kevin David Hayes,Micah Goldblum,Vikash Sehwag,Gowthami Somepalli,Ashwinee Panda,Tom Goldstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a joint evaluation framework for text-to-image models and vision-language models by testing VLMs' ability to identify 27 specific failure modes in T2I-generated images from challenging prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I models often fail to accurately capture specific attributes in prompts, and current VLM benchmarks don't match the complexity of scenes VLMs need to analyze. There's a need for hierarchical evaluation to compare prompt adherence abilities across models.

Method: Created a structured methodology to jointly evaluate T2I models and VLMs by testing whether VLMs can identify 27 specific failure modes in images generated by T2I models from challenging prompts. Built a dataset with prompts, images from 5 T2I models, and VLM annotations processed by an LLM.

Result: Analysis revealed systematic errors in attribute fidelity and object representation across models. Current metrics are insufficient to capture these nuanced errors, highlighting the need for targeted benchmarks.

Conclusion: Targeted benchmarks are crucial for advancing generative model reliability and interpretability, as current evaluation methods fail to capture the nuanced failure modes in T2I models and VLMs' ability to detect them.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are capable of generating visually impressive images, yet they often fail to accurately capture specific attributes in user prompts, such as the correct number of objects with the specified colors. The diversity of such errors underscores the need for a hierarchical evaluation framework that can compare prompt adherence abilities of different image generation models. Simultaneously, benchmarks of vision language models (VLMs) have not kept pace with the complexity of scenes that VLMs are used to annotate. In this work, we propose a structured methodology for jointly evaluating T2I models and VLMs by testing whether VLMs can identify 27 specific failure modes in the images generated by T2I models conditioned on challenging prompts. Our second contribution is a dataset of prompts and images generated by 5 T2I models (Flux, SD3-Medium, SD3-Large, SD3.5-Medium, SD3.5-Large) and the corresponding annotations from VLMs (Molmo, InternVL3, Pixtral) annotated by an LLM (Llama3) to test whether VLMs correctly identify the failure mode in a generated image. By analyzing failure modes on a curated set of prompts, we reveal systematic errors in attribute fidelity and object representation. Our findings suggest that current metrics are insufficient to capture these nuanced errors, highlighting the importance of targeted benchmarks for advancing generative model reliability and interpretability.

### [4] [Mapping of Lesion Images to Somatic Mutations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02162)
*Rahul Mehta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLOST: A deep latent variable model that predicts somatic mutation profiles from medical images using dual variational autoencoders coupled by a shared latent space with normalizing flow priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early cancer diagnosis is crucial for treatment efficacy. Medical imaging is used initially, followed by genetic analysis for treatment selection. The goal is to predict somatic mutations directly from medical images to enable earlier genetic insights.

Method: 1) Convert lesion images to point clouds for modality invariance; 2) Use dual variational autoencoders for lesion point clouds and somatic mutation counts; 3) Couple them via a shared latent space; 4) Use conditional normalizing flow priors for each of three latent spaces to handle diverse distributions.

Result: Model shows predictive performance for specific mutation counts and accurate mutation occurrence prediction. Identifies shared patterns between imaging and somatic mutation domains that reflect cancer type. Tested on TCIA medical images and Pan Cancer somatic mutation data.

Conclusion: The model successfully links imaging features to genetic profiles. Future improvements could include expanding to other genetic domains and enhancing model architecture.

Abstract: Medical imaging is a critical initial tool used by clinicians to determine a patient's cancer diagnosis, allowing for faster intervention and more reliable patient prognosis. At subsequent stages of patient diagnosis, genetic information is extracted to help select specific patient treatment options. As the efficacy of cancer treatment often relies on early diagnosis and treatment, we build a deep latent variable model to determine patients' somatic mutation profiles based on their corresponding medical images. We first introduce a point cloud representation of lesions images to allow for invariance to the imaging modality. We then propose, LLOST, a model with dual variational autoencoders coupled together by a separate shared latent space that unifies features from the lesion point clouds and counts of distinct somatic mutations. Therefore our model consists of three latent space, each of which is learned with a conditional normalizing flow prior to account for the diverse distributions of each domain. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on de-identified medical images from The Cancer Imaging Archive and the corresponding somatic mutations from the Pan Cancer dataset of The Cancer Genomic Archive. We show the model's predictive performance on the counts of specific mutations as well as it's ability to accurately predict the occurrence of mutations. In particular, shared patterns between the imaging and somatic mutation domain that reflect cancer type. We conclude with a remark on how to improve the model and possible future avenues of research to include other genetic domains.

### [5] [SplatSuRe: Selective Super-Resolution for Multi-view Consistent 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02172)
*Pranav Asthana,Alex Hanson,Allen Tu,Tom Goldstein,Matthias Zwicker,Amitabh Varshney*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SplatSuRe selectively applies super-resolution only to undersampled regions using camera geometry, producing sharper 3DGS renders than uniform SR methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard super-resolution applied uniformly to all views creates multi-view inconsistencies and blurry renders in 3D Gaussian Splatting. The authors want to leverage the insight that close-up views may contain high-frequency information for distant-view regions, using camera geometry to intelligently apply SR only where needed.

Method: SplatSuRe selectively applies super-resolution content only in undersampled regions that lack high-frequency supervision, using camera pose relative to scene geometry to determine where to add SR content rather than applying it uniformly across all images.

Result: The approach surpasses baselines in both fidelity and perceptual quality across Tanks & Temples, Deep Blending and Mip-NeRF 360 datasets. Gains are most significant in localized foreground regions where higher detail is desired.

Conclusion: Selective super-resolution based on camera geometry and undersampled regions produces sharper and more consistent 3DGS renders than uniform SR approaches, with particular benefits for foreground detail enhancement.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-quality novel view synthesis, motivating interest in generating higher-resolution renders than those available during training. A natural strategy is to apply super-resolution (SR) to low-resolution (LR) input views, but independently enhancing each image introduces multi-view inconsistencies, leading to blurry renders. Prior methods attempt to mitigate these inconsistencies through learned neural components, temporally consistent video priors, or joint optimization on LR and SR views, but all uniformly apply SR across every image. In contrast, our key insight is that close-up LR views may contain high-frequency information for regions also captured in more distant views, and that we can use the camera pose relative to scene geometry to inform where to add SR content. Building from this insight, we propose SplatSuRe, a method that selectively applies SR content only in undersampled regions lacking high-frequency supervision, yielding sharper and more consistent results. Across Tanks & Temples, Deep Blending and Mip-NeRF 360, our approach surpasses baselines in both fidelity and perceptual quality. Notably, our gains are most significant in localized foreground regions where higher detail is desired.

### [6] [RobustSurg: Tackling domain generalisation for out-of-distribution surgical scene segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02188)
*Mansoor Ali,Maksim Richards,Gilberto Ochoa-Ruiz,Sharib Ali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RobustSurg improves surgical scene segmentation generalization across centers and modalities by exploiting style-content separation with instance normalization and feature covariance mapping, plus a restitution module to preserve task-relevant features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surgical scene segmentation methods fail to generalize to unseen centers and modalities due to limited visual cues and diverse scenarios. Natural scene domain adaptation methods don't directly apply to surgical scenes.

Method: Uses instance normalization and feature covariance mapping to separate style and content, minimizing appearance variations. Adds a restitution module within ResNet backbone to preserve task-relevant features. Also provides new multiclass/multicenter dataset.

Result: 23% improvement over baseline DeepLabv3+ and 10-32% improvement over SOTA on unseen HeiCholSeg dataset. 22% improvement over baseline and 11% over recent SOTA on EndoUDA polyp dataset.

Conclusion: RobustSurg effectively addresses generalization challenges in surgical scene segmentation across different centers and imaging modalities through style-content separation and feature preservation techniques.

Abstract: While recent advances in deep learning for surgical scene segmentation have demonstrated promising results on single-centre and single-imaging modality data, these methods usually do not generalise to unseen distribution (i.e., from other centres) and unseen modalities. Current literature for tackling generalisation on out-of-distribution data and domain gaps due to modality changes has been widely researched but mostly for natural scene data. However, these methods cannot be directly applied to the surgical scenes due to limited visual cues and often extremely diverse scenarios compared to the natural scene data. Inspired by these works in natural scenes to push generalisability on OOD data, we hypothesise that exploiting the style and content information in the surgical scenes could minimise the appearances, making it less variable to sudden changes such as blood or imaging artefacts. This can be achieved by performing instance normalisation and feature covariance mapping techniques for robust and generalisable feature representations. Further, to eliminate the risk of removing salient feature representation associated with the objects of interest, we introduce a restitution module within the feature learning ResNet backbone that can enable the retention of useful task-relevant features. To tackle the lack of multiclass and multicentre data for surgical scene segmentation, we also provide a newly curated dataset that can be vital for addressing generalisability in this domain. Our proposed RobustSurg obtained nearly 23% improvement on the baseline DeepLabv3+ and from 10-32% improvement on the SOTA in terms of mean IoU score on an unseen centre HeiCholSeg dataset when trained on CholecSeg8K. Similarly, RobustSurg also obtained nearly 22% improvement over the baseline and nearly 11% improvement on a recent SOTA method for the target set of the EndoUDA polyp dataset.

### [7] [Multifractal Recalibration of Neural Networks for Medical Imaging Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02198)
*Miguel L. Martins,Miguel T. Coimbra,Francesco Renna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Monofractal and Multifractal Recalibration as inductive priors for deep learning, leveraging multifractal analysis to improve channel-attention mechanisms in convolutional networks, with validation on medical imaging datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multifractal methods in deep learning rely on heavy pooling or feature-space decimation, which limit their effectiveness in tasks like semantic segmentation. There's a need for better integration of multifractal analysis into modern deep learning architectures.

Method: Introduces two inductive priors: Monofractal and Multifractal Recalibration, which use relationships between probability mass of exponents and multifractal spectrum to form statistical descriptions of encoder embeddings. These are implemented as channel-attention functions in convolutional networks using a U-Net-based framework.

Result: Multifractal recalibration yields substantial gains over baselines with other channel-attention mechanisms using higher-order statistics. Validated on three medical imaging datasets: ISIC18 (dermoscopy), Kvasir-SEG (endoscopy), and BUSI (ultrasound). Analysis reveals that excitation responses don't become increasingly specialized with encoder depth in U-Nets due to skip connections.

Conclusion: Multifractal analysis can be effectively integrated into deep learning through channel-attention mechanisms, providing performance improvements in medical imaging tasks. The approach offers insights into attention layer behavior in U-Net architectures and suggests effectiveness relates to global statistics of instance variability.

Abstract: Multifractal analysis has revealed regularities in many self-seeding phenomena, yet its use in modern deep learning remains limited. Existing end-to-end multifractal methods rely on heavy pooling or strong feature-space decimation, which constrain tasks such as semantic segmentation. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce two inductive priors: Monofractal and Multifractal Recalibration. These methods leverage relationships between the probability mass of the exponents and the multifractal spectrum to form statistical descriptions of encoder embeddings, implemented as channel-attention functions in convolutional networks.
  Using a U-Net-based framework, we show that multifractal recalibration yields substantial gains over a baseline equipped with other channel-attention mechanisms that also use higher-order statistics. Given the proven ability of multifractal analysis to capture pathological regularities, we validate our approach on three public medical-imaging datasets: ISIC18 (dermoscopy), Kvasir-SEG (endoscopy), and BUSI (ultrasound).
  Our empirical analysis also provides insights into the behavior of these attention layers. We find that excitation responses do not become increasingly specialized with encoder depth in U-Net architectures due to skip connections, and that their effectiveness may relate to global statistics of instance variability.

### [8] [Towards Unified Video Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02224)
*Chen Feng,Tianhao Peng,Fan Zhang,David Bull*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unified-VQA is a diagnostic mixture-of-experts framework that provides both global quality scores and interpretable artifact vectors for diverse video formats without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VQA methods lack interpretability (single scores without diagnostic feedback) and are format-specific rather than truly generic solutions that work across different video formats and distortion types.

Method: Proposes Unified-VQA framework using Diagnostic Mixture-of-Experts with multiple perceptual experts for distinct domains, multi-proxy expert training with ranking-inspired loss, and diagnostic multi-task head with weakly-supervised learning.

Result: Outperforms 18 benchmark methods for both generic VQA and diagnostic artifact detection across 17 databases with diverse streaming artifacts in HD, UHD, HDR, and HFR formats, all without retraining or fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Represents an important step towards practical, actionable, and interpretable video quality assessment that works across multiple formats and provides diagnostic feedback.

Abstract: Recent works in video quality assessment (VQA) typically employ monolithic models that typically predict a single quality score for each test video. These approaches cannot provide diagnostic, interpretable feedback, offering little insight into why the video quality is degraded. Most of them are also specialized, format-specific metrics rather than truly ``generic" solutions, as they are designed to learn a compromised representation from disparate perceptual domains. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Unified-VQA, a framework that provides a single, unified quality model applicable to various distortion types within multiple video formats by recasting generic VQA as a Diagnostic Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) problem. Unified-VQA employs multiple ``perceptual experts'' dedicated to distinct perceptual domains. A novel multi-proxy expert training strategy is designed to optimize each expert using a ranking-inspired loss, guided by the most suitable proxy metric for its domain. We also integrated a diagnostic multi-task head into this framework to generate a global quality score and an interpretable multi-dimensional artifact vector, which is optimized using a weakly-supervised learning strategy, leveraging the known properties of the large-scale training database generated for this work. With static model parameters (without retraining or fine-tuning), Unified-VQA demonstrates consistent and superior performance compared to over 18 benchmark methods for both generic VQA and diagnostic artifact detection tasks across 17 databases containing diverse streaming artifacts in HD, UHD, HDR and HFR formats. This work represents an important step towards practical, actionable, and interpretable video quality assessment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AV-SpeakerBench is a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal LLMs on fine-grained speaker-centric audiovisual reasoning in videos, focusing on aligning who speaks, what is said, and when it occurs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video benchmarks rarely assess fine-grained reasoning about human speech, often being visually solvable or only coarsely evaluating speech, limiting insight into models' ability to align speakers, speech content, and timing.

Method: Created a curated benchmark of 3,212 multiple-choice questions with: 1) speaker-centered formulation treating speakers as core reasoning units, 2) fusion-grounded question design embedding audiovisual dependencies, and 3) expert-curated annotations ensuring temporal precision and cross-modal validity.

Result: Gemini family consistently outperforms open-source systems, with Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving best results. Among open models, Qwen3-Omni-30B approaches Gemini 2.0 Flash but remains far behind Gemini 2.5 Pro, primarily due to weaker audiovisual fusion rather than visual perception.

Conclusion: AV-SpeakerBench establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing fine-grained audiovisual reasoning in future multimodal systems by addressing the gap in speaker-centric evaluation.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are expected to jointly interpret vision, audio, and language, yet existing video benchmarks rarely assess fine-grained reasoning about human speech. Many tasks remain visually solvable or only coarsely evaluate speech, offering limited insight into whether models can align who speaks, what is said, and when it occurs. We introduce AV-SpeakerBench, a curated benchmark of 3,212 multiple-choice questions focused on speaker-centric audiovisual reasoning in real-world videos. It features: (1) a speaker-centered formulation that treats speakers-not scenes-as the core reasoning unit; (2) fusion-grounded question design embedding audiovisual dependencies into question semantics; and (3) expert-curated annotations ensuring temporal precision and cross-modal validity. Comprehensive evaluations show that the Gemini family consistently outperforms open-source systems, with Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving the best results. Among open models, Qwen3-Omni-30B approaches Gemini 2.0 Flash but remains far behind Gemini 2.5 Pro, primarily due to weaker audiovisual fusion rather than visual perception. We believe AV-SpeakerBench establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing fine-grained audiovisual reasoning in future multimodal systems.

*Shuang Chen,Tomas Krajnik,Farshad Arvin,Amir Atapour-Abarghouei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Visual LIF (VLIF) neuron for SNN-based image deraining, achieving SOTA performance with 87% less energy than other SNN methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNNs are biologically plausible and energy-efficient but underexplored for low-level vision tasks like image deraining. Traditional spiking neurons lack spatial contextual understanding and suffer from frequency-domain saturation.

Method: Introduces Visual LIF (VLIF) neuron to address spatial context limitations. Uses VLIF to create Spiking Decomposition and Enhancement Module and lightweight Spiking Multi-scale Unit for hierarchical multi-scale representation learning.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art SNN-based deraining methods on five benchmark datasets while using only 13% of their energy consumption (87% energy reduction).

Conclusion: Establishes foundation for deploying SNNs in high-performance, energy-efficient low-level vision tasks, demonstrating practical viability of SNNs for real-world applications.

Abstract: Biologically plausible and energy-efficient frameworks such as Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have not been sufficiently explored in low-level vision tasks. Taking image deraining as an example, this study addresses the representation of the inherent high-pass characteristics of spiking neurons, specifically in image deraining and innovatively proposes the Visual LIF (VLIF) neuron, overcoming the obstacle of lacking spatial contextual understanding present in traditional spiking neurons. To tackle the limitation of frequency-domain saturation inherent in conventional spiking neurons, we leverage the proposed VLIF to introduce the Spiking Decomposition and Enhancement Module and the lightweight Spiking Multi-scale Unit for hierarchical multi-scale representation learning. Extensive experiments across five benchmark deraining datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SNN-based deraining methods, achieving this superior performance with only 13\% of their energy consumption. These findings establish a solid foundation for deploying SNNs in high-performance, energy-efficient low-level vision tasks.

*Jeremy Andrew Irvin,Jiaqi Han,Zikui Wang,Abdulaziz Alharbi,Yufei Zhao,Nomin-Erdene Bayarsaikhan,Daniele Visioni,Andrew Y. Ng,Duncan Watson-Parris*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPF is a new flow matching approach for climate emulation that uses spatiotemporal pyramids to enable efficient, parallel generation across multiple timescales, outperforming baselines on ClimateBench and scaling with the new ClimateSuite dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative approaches for climate emulation rely on slow weather-scale autoregression that struggles with long climate horizons and nonstationary forcings, limiting practical climate modeling applications.

Method: Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flows (SPF) partition the generative trajectory into a spatiotemporal pyramid, progressively increasing spatial resolution while coupling each stage with specific timescales, enabling direct sampling at any temporal level and conditioning on physical forcings.

Result: SPF outperforms flow matching baselines and pre-trained models on ClimateBench at yearly and monthly timescales with fast sampling, especially at coarser temporal levels. When scaled with ClimateSuite (33,000+ simulation-years), SPF shows good generalization to held-out scenarios across climate models.

Conclusion: SPF and ClimateSuite provide a foundation for accurate, efficient, probabilistic climate emulation across temporal scales and realistic future scenarios, with publicly available data and code.

Abstract: Generative models have the potential to transform the way we emulate Earth's changing climate. Previous generative approaches rely on weather-scale autoregression for climate emulation, but this is inherently slow for long climate horizons and has yet to demonstrate stable rollouts under nonstationary forcings. Here, we introduce Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flows (SPF), a new class of flow matching approaches that model data hierarchically across spatial and temporal scales. Inspired by cascaded video models, SPF partitions the generative trajectory into a spatiotemporal pyramid, progressively increasing spatial resolution to reduce computation and coupling each stage with an associated timescale to enable direct sampling at any temporal level in the pyramid. This design, together with conditioning each stage on prescribed physical forcings (e.g., greenhouse gases or aerosols), enables efficient, parallel climate emulation at multiple timescales. On ClimateBench, SPF outperforms strong flow matching baselines and pre-trained models at yearly and monthly timescales while offering fast sampling, especially at coarser temporal levels. To scale SPF, we curate ClimateSuite, the largest collection of Earth system simulations to date, comprising over 33,000 simulation-years across ten climate models and the first dataset to include simulations of climate interventions. We find that the scaled SPF model demonstrates good generalization to held-out scenarios across climate models. Together, SPF and ClimateSuite provide a foundation for accurate, efficient, probabilistic climate emulation across temporal scales and realistic future scenarios. Data and code is publicly available at https://github.com/stanfordmlgroup/spf .

*Peng Kang,Xijun Wang,Yu Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fine-tuning CogVideo for progressive image restoration by generating restoration trajectories instead of natural motion, achieving improved perceptual metrics and temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-video models have strong temporal generation capabilities but their potential for image restoration remains underexplored. The authors aim to repurpose these models for visual restoration tasks.

Method: Fine-tune CogVideo to generate restoration trajectories rather than natural video motion. Construct synthetic datasets for super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light enhancement with gradual transitions from degraded to clean frames. Compare two prompting strategies: uniform text prompts and scene-specific prompts generated via LLaVA multi-modal LLM and refined with ChatGPT.

Result: The fine-tuned model learns to associate temporal progression with restoration quality, producing sequences that improve perceptual metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) across frames. It effectively restores spatial detail and illumination consistency while maintaining temporal coherence. The model generalizes to real-world scenarios on ReLoBlur dataset without additional training, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness and interpretability.

Conclusion: CogVideo can be successfully repurposed for progressive visual restoration tasks, showing strong performance in generating restoration trajectories with temporal coherence and generalization to real-world scenarios without additional training.

Abstract: Recent text-to-video models have demonstrated strong temporal generation capabilities, yet their potential for image restoration remains underexplored. In this work, we repurpose CogVideo for progressive visual restoration tasks by fine-tuning it to generate restoration trajectories rather than natural video motion. Specifically, we construct synthetic datasets for super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light enhancement, where each sample depicts a gradual transition from degraded to clean frames. Two prompting strategies are compared: a uniform text prompt shared across all samples, and a scene-specific prompting scheme generated via LLaVA multi-modal LLM and refined with ChatGPT. Our fine-tuned model learns to associate temporal progression with restoration quality, producing sequences that improve perceptual metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS across frames. Extensive experiments show that CogVideo effectively restores spatial detail and illumination consistency while maintaining temporal coherence. Moreover, the model generalizes to real-world scenarios on the ReLoBlur dataset without additional training, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness and interpretability through temporal restoration.

*Andre Juarez,Luis Salsavilca,Frida Coaquira,Celso Gonzales*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MORP-Synth improves SAR oil spill segmentation transfer from Mediterranean to Peruvian domains using synthetic data augmentation with morphological perturbations and conditional generative modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for SAR oil spill segmentation fail to generalize across regions due to differences in sea-state, backscatter statistics, and slick morphology, especially problematic for Peruvian coast where labeled Sentinel-1 data is scarce.

Method: Two-stage synthetic augmentation framework: Stage A uses Morphological Region Perturbation (curvature guided label space method) to generate realistic geometric variations; Stage B renders SAR-like textures from edited masks using conditional generative INADE model.

Result: Models pretrained on Mediterranean data degrade from 67.8% to 51.8% mIoU on Peruvian domain; MORP-Synth improves performance up to +6 mIoU and boosts minority-class IoU (+10.8 oil, +14.6 look-alike). Compiled Peruvian dataset of 2112 labeled patches from 40 Sentinel-1 scenes (2014-2024).

Conclusion: MORP-Synth effectively addresses domain shift in SAR oil spill segmentation by generating realistic synthetic data that improves model generalization from Mediterranean to Peruvian conditions, particularly benefiting minority classes.

Abstract: Deep learning models for SAR oil spill segmentation often fail to generalize across regions due to differences in sea-state, backscatter statistics, and slick morphology, a limitation that is particularly severe along the Peruvian coast where labeled Sentinel-1 data remain scarce. To address this problem, we propose \textbf{MORP--Synth}, a two-stage synthetic augmentation framework designed to improve transfer from Mediterranean to Peruvian conditions. Stage~A applies Morphological Region Perturbation, a curvature guided label space method that generates realistic geometric variations of oil and look-alike regions. Stage~B renders SAR-like textures from the edited masks using a conditional generative INADE model. We compile a Peruvian dataset of 2112 labeled 512$\times$512 patches from 40 Sentinel-1 scenes (2014--2024), harmonized with the Mediterranean CleanSeaNet benchmark, and evaluate seven segmentation architectures. Models pretrained on Mediterranean data degrade from 67.8\% to 51.8\% mIoU on the Peruvian domain; MORP--Synth improves performance up to +6 mIoU and boosts minority-class IoU (+10.8 oil, +14.6 look-alike).

TL;DR: Self-supervised tracker using pre-trained video diffusion models' motion representations outperforms existing methods on visually similar object tracking by 6 points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised trackers struggle with visually similar objects when visual cues become ambiguous, limiting scalability without extensive labeled data.

Method: Leverages pre-trained video diffusion models' inherent motion representations, where early denoising stages isolate motion distinct from later appearance refinement, without task-specific training.

Result: Achieves up to 6-point improvement over recent self-supervised approaches on established benchmarks and new tests for tracking visually similar items.

Conclusion: Diffusion-derived motion representations enable robust tracking of even identical objects across challenging viewpoint changes and deformations, addressing a key failure point in existing methods.

Abstract: Distinguishing visually similar objects by their motion remains a critical challenge in computer vision. Although supervised trackers show promise, contemporary self-supervised trackers struggle when visual cues become ambiguous, limiting their scalability and generalization without extensive labeled data. We find that pre-trained video diffusion models inherently learn motion representations suitable for tracking without task-specific training. This ability arises because their denoising process isolates motion in early, high-noise stages, distinct from later appearance refinement. Capitalizing on this discovery, our self-supervised tracker significantly improves performance in distinguishing visually similar objects, an underexplored failure point for existing methods. Our method achieves up to a 6-point improvement over recent self-supervised approaches on established benchmarks and our newly introduced tests focused on tracking visually similar items. Visualizations confirm that these diffusion-derived motion representations enable robust tracking of even identical objects across challenging viewpoint changes and deformations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an unprecedented look into the creation and technical details of the widely-used nuScenes autonomous driving dataset, which has been foundational for AV/ADAS development but lacks comprehensive documentation in academic publications.

Method: Retrospective analysis of nuScenes dataset creation, examination of its extensions (nuImages and Panoptic nuScenes), tracing its influence on subsequent datasets, and reviewing methodological developments using nuScenes across various autonomous driving tasks.

Result: Reveals previously unpublished technical details about nuScenes' creation, demonstrates its pioneering role as the first dataset with radar data and diverse urban scenes from two continents, and shows its significant impact on defining community standards and influencing numerous subsequent datasets.

Conclusion: nuScenes has been a foundational building block for autonomous driving research, setting key standards and influencing the field through its multi-modal sensor fusion approach, diverse data collection, and comprehensive task support, while serving as a benchmark for methodological developments across perception, prediction, and planning tasks.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AV) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) have been revolutionized by Deep Learning. As a data-driven approach, Deep Learning relies on vast amounts of driving data, typically labeled in great detail. As a result, datasets, alongside hardware and algorithms, are foundational building blocks for the development of AVs. In this work we revisit one of the most widely used autonomous driving datasets: the nuScenes dataset. nuScenes exemplifies key trends in AV development, being the first dataset to include radar data, to feature diverse urban driving scenes from two continents, and to be collected using a fully autonomous vehicle operating on public roads, while also promoting multi-modal sensor fusion, standardized benchmarks, and a broad range of tasks including perception, localization \& mapping, prediction and planning. We provide an unprecedented look into the creation of nuScenes, as well as its extensions nuImages and Panoptic nuScenes, summarizing many technical details that have hitherto not been revealed in academic publications. Furthermore, we trace how the influence of nuScenes impacted a large number of other datasets that were released later and how it defined numerous standards that are used by the community to this day. Finally, we present an overview of both official and unofficial tasks using the nuScenes dataset and review major methodological developments, thereby offering a comprehensive survey of the autonomous driving literature, with a particular focus on nuScenes.

TL;DR: TALO: A plug-and-play framework for temporal alignment of 3D foundation model predictions using Thin Plate Spline with globally propagated control points and point-agnostic submap registration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D vision foundation models lack temporal consistency in online settings like driving scenarios, and existing alignment methods have limitations in assumption validity, local alignment scope, and robustness to noisy geometry.

Method: Proposes a higher-DOF alignment framework based on Thin Plate Spline with globally propagated control points for spatially varying inconsistencies, plus point-agnostic submap registration robust to noisy geometry predictions.

Result: Consistently yields more coherent geometry and lower trajectory errors across multiple datasets, backbone models, and camera setups (monocular/surround-view).

Conclusion: The framework is fully plug-and-play, compatible with diverse 3D foundation models and camera configurations, demonstrating robustness and generality for temporal alignment in online 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: 3D vision foundation models have shown strong generalization in reconstructing key 3D attributes from uncalibrated images through a single feed-forward pass. However, when deployed in online settings such as driving scenarios, predictions are made over temporal windows, making it non-trivial to maintain consistency across time. Recent strategies align consecutive predictions by solving global transformation, yet our analysis reveals their fundamental limitations in assumption validity, local alignment scope, and robustness under noisy geometry. In this work, we propose a higher-DOF and long-term alignment framework based on Thin Plate Spline, leveraging globally propagated control points to correct spatially varying inconsistencies. In addition, we adopt a point-agnostic submap registration design that is inherently robust to noisy geometry predictions. The proposed framework is fully plug-and-play, compatible with diverse 3D foundation models and camera configurations (e.g., monocular or surround-view). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently yields more coherent geometry and lower trajectory errors across multiple datasets, backbone models, and camera setups, highlighting its robustness and generality.

Conclusion: Carefully designed LiDAR-to-image projections can serve as an effective surrogate for end-to-end 3D learning in LiDAR place recognition, offering practical advantages for real-time autonomous systems while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation into how alternative LiDAR-to-image projections affect metric place recognition when coupled with a state-of-the-art vision foundation model. We introduce a modular retrieval pipeline that controls for backbone, aggregation, and evaluation protocol, thereby isolating the influence of the 2-D projection itself. Using consistent geometric and structural channels across multiple datasets and deployment scenarios, we identify the projection characteristics that most strongly determine discriminative power, robustness to environmental variation, and suitability for real-time autonomy.

TL;DR: MS-CAM is a visual explanation method that combines channel-wise and element-wise weights to interpret CNN decisions in SAR images, improving interpretability and enabling weakly-supervised object localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN opacity hinders reliability in SAR applications; improving interpretability is crucial for SAR development and deployment.

Method: Multi-weight self-matching class activation mapping (MS-CAM) matches SAR images with CNN feature maps and gradients, combining channel-wise and element-wise weights for visualization.

Result: MS-CAM more accurately highlights network's regions of interest and captures detailed target features, enhancing interpretability; validated for weakly-supervised object localization.

Conclusion: MS-CAM improves CNN interpretability for SAR applications and shows promise for weakly-supervised localization, with pixel thresholds identified as key factors for future work.

Abstract: In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved significant success in various synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tasks. However, the complexity and opacity of their internal mechanisms hinder the fulfillment of high-reliability requirements, thereby limiting their application in SAR. Improving the interpretability of CNNs is thus of great importance for their development and deployment in SAR. In this paper, a visual explanation method termed multi-weight self-matching class activation mapping (MS-CAM) is proposed. MS-CAM matches SAR images with the feature maps and corresponding gradients extracted by the CNN, and combines both channel-wise and element-wise weights to visualize the decision basis learned by the model in SAR images. Extensive experiments conducted on a self-constructed SAR target classification dataset demonstrate that MS-CAM more accurately highlights the network's regions of interest and captures detailed target feature information, thereby enhancing network interpretability. Furthermore, the feasibility of applying MS-CAM to weakly-supervised obiect localization is validated. Key factors affecting localization accuracy, such as pixel thresholds, are analyzed in depth to inform future work.

TL;DR: BEVDilation: A LiDAR-centric fusion framework that uses image BEV features as implicit guidance to enhance 3D object detection while mitigating spatial misalignment from depth errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods suffer from degraded performance due to indiscriminate fusion of LiDAR and camera data, caused by fundamental geometric accuracy disparities between sensors. The spatial misalignment from image depth estimation errors needs to be addressed.

Method: Proposes BEVDilation with two key blocks: 1) Sparse Voxel Dilation Block that densifies foreground voxels using image priors to address point cloud sparsity, and 2) Semantic-Guided BEV Dilation Block that enhances LiDAR feature diffusion with image semantic guidance and long-range context capture. Formulates image BEV features as implicit guidance rather than naive concatenation.

Result: Achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods on the challenging nuScenes benchmark while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. Demonstrates greater robustness to depth noise compared to naive fusion approaches.

Conclusion: BEVDilation effectively addresses the limitations of indiscriminate sensor fusion by prioritizing LiDAR information while using image features as guidance, successfully mitigating spatial misalignment and enhancing 3D object detection performance.

Abstract: Integrating LiDAR and camera information in the bird's eye view (BEV) representation has demonstrated its effectiveness in 3D object detection. However, because of the fundamental disparity in geometric accuracy between these sensors, indiscriminate fusion in previous methods often leads to degraded performance. In this paper, we propose BEVDilation, a novel LiDAR-centric framework that prioritizes LiDAR information in the fusion. By formulating image BEV features as implicit guidance rather than naive concatenation, our strategy effectively alleviates the spatial misalignment caused by image depth estimation errors. Furthermore, the image guidance can effectively help the LiDAR-centric paradigm to address the sparsity and semantic limitations of point clouds. Specifically, we propose a Sparse Voxel Dilation Block that mitigates the inherent point sparsity by densifying foreground voxels through image priors. Moreover, we introduce a Semantic-Guided BEV Dilation Block to enhance the LiDAR feature diffusion processing with image semantic guidance and long-range context capture. On the challenging nuScenes benchmark, BEVDilation achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. Importantly, our LiDAR-centric strategy demonstrates greater robustness to depth noise compared to naive fusion. The source code is available at https://github.com/gwenzhang/BEVDilation.

*Shwai He,Chaorui Deng,Ang Li,Shen Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Systematic analysis reveals unified multimodal models have inefficient inference: understanding components are compressible but generation components are sensitive. Proposed Mixture-of-Experts Adaptation enables sparse activation, achieving full model performance with ~50% parameter activation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified multimodal models integrating understanding and generation capabilities suffer from inference inefficiencies - specific tasks/samples don't need full model capacity, but systematic understanding of these inefficiencies across components is limited.

Method: 1) Systematic analysis using training-free pruning (depth/width reduction) to probe component compressibility. 2) Proposed Mixture-of-Experts Adaptation partitions generation module into experts with sparse activation. 3) Validated via expert-frozen tuning and fully trainable adaptation.

Result: Understanding components show notable compressibility (especially in generation tasks), while generation components are highly sensitive to compression. MoE Adaptation restores generation quality, enabling BAGEL model to achieve comparable performance to full model while activating only ~50% parameters.

Conclusion: Unified multimodal models have component-specific inefficiencies: understanding is compressible but generation requires careful handling. Sparse activation via MoE Adaptation effectively addresses generation sensitivity, enabling efficient inference without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Large multimodal models have achieved remarkable progress in both understanding and generation. Recent efforts pursue unified multimodal models that integrate heterogeneous components to support both capabilities within a single framework. However, such unification introduces inference inefficiencies, e.g., specific tasks or samples may not require the full knowledge or capacity of the unified model. Yet, a systematic understanding of how these inefficiencies manifest across different components remains limited. In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of unified multimodal model components using training-free pruning as a probing methodology, considering both depth pruning and width reduction. Our study reveals that the understanding component exhibits notable compressibility in both understanding and generation tasks, which is more pronounced in the latter. In contrast, the generation components are highly sensitive to compression, with performance deteriorating sharply even under moderate compression ratios. To address this limitation, we propose the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adaptation, inspired by the dynamic activation patterns observed across different samples. This approach partitions the generation module into multiple experts and enables sparse activation to restore generation quality. We validate the effectiveness of sparse activation through expert-frozen tuning and further demonstrate that a fully trainable adaptation delivers additional gains. As a result, the adapted BAGEL model achieves performance comparable to the full model while activating only about half of its parameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: U4D is an uncertainty-aware framework for 4D LiDAR world modeling that uses spatial uncertainty maps to guide "hard-to-easy" generation, improving geometric fidelity and temporal coherence in complex scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative frameworks for 4D LiDAR modeling treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking varying uncertainty across real-world scenes, which leads to artifacts in complex or ambiguous regions and limits realism and temporal stability.

Method: U4D first estimates spatial uncertainty maps from a pretrained segmentation model to identify semantically challenging regions. It then performs "hard-to-easy" generation through two stages: (1) uncertainty-region modeling for high-entropy regions with fine geometric fidelity, and (2) uncertainty-conditioned completion for remaining areas using learned structural priors. It also incorporates a mixture of spatio-temporal (MoST) block to adaptively fuse spatial and temporal representations during diffusion for temporal coherence.

Result: Extensive experiments show that U4D produces geometrically faithful and temporally consistent LiDAR sequences, advancing the reliability of 4D world modeling for autonomous perception and simulation.

Conclusion: U4D presents an effective uncertainty-aware approach to 4D LiDAR world modeling that addresses the limitations of uniform generation methods, improving both geometric accuracy and temporal stability in dynamic 3D environments.

Abstract: Modeling dynamic 3D environments from LiDAR sequences is central to building reliable 4D worlds for autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing generative frameworks, however, often treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the varying uncertainty across real-world scenes. This uniform generation leads to artifacts in complex or ambiguous regions, limiting realism and temporal stability. In this work, we present U4D, an uncertainty-aware framework for 4D LiDAR world modeling. Our approach first estimates spatial uncertainty maps from a pretrained segmentation model to localize semantically challenging regions. It then performs generation in a "hard-to-easy" manner through two sequential stages: (1) uncertainty-region modeling, which reconstructs high-entropy regions with fine geometric fidelity, and (2) uncertainty-conditioned completion, which synthesizes the remaining areas under learned structural priors. To further ensure temporal coherence, U4D incorporates a mixture of spatio-temporal (MoST) block that adaptively fuses spatial and temporal representations during diffusion. Extensive experiments show that U4D produces geometrically faithful and temporally consistent LiDAR sequences, advancing the reliability of 4D world modeling for autonomous perception and simulation.

TL;DR: WSCF-MVCC is a weakly-supervised, calibration-free multi-view crowd counting method that uses only crowd counts as supervision instead of expensive density maps or camera calibrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-view crowd counting methods require costly camera calibrations and crowd annotations (density maps or image-level counts). There's a need for more practical, annotation-efficient methods suitable for real-world deployment.

Method: Uses crowd count as supervision for single-view counting module instead of density maps; employs self-supervised ranking loss with multi-scale priors; leverages semantic information for more accurate view matching; calibration-free approach.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three widely used multi-view counting datasets under weakly supervised settings, demonstrating practical deployment suitability.

Conclusion: The proposed WSCF-MVCC method provides a more practical and annotation-efficient solution for multi-view crowd counting, eliminating the need for camera calibrations and expensive crowd annotations while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Multi-view crowd counting can effectively mitigate occlusion issues that commonly arise in single-image crowd counting. Existing deep-learning multi-view crowd counting methods project different camera view images onto a common space to obtain ground-plane density maps, requiring abundant and costly crowd annotations and camera calibrations. Hence, calibration-free methods are proposed that do not require camera calibrations and scene-level crowd annotations. However, existing calibration-free methods still require expensive image-level crowd annotations for training the single-view counting module. Thus, in this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised calibration-free multi-view crowd counting method (WSCF-MVCC), directly using crowd count as supervision for the single-view counting module rather than density maps constructed from crowd annotations. Instead, a self-supervised ranking loss that leverages multi-scale priors is utilized to enhance the model's perceptual ability without additional annotation costs. What's more, the proposed model leverages semantic information to achieve a more accurate view matching and, consequently, a more precise scene-level crowd count estimation. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three widely used multi-view counting datasets under weakly supervised settings, indicating that it is more suitable for practical deployment compared with calibrated methods. Code is released in https://github.com/zqyq/Weakly-MVCC.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurfFill combines LiDAR and photogrammetry using Gaussian surfels to complete LiDAR scans by identifying ambiguous areas and growing points from them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR excels in flat regions but misses small structures and dark materials, while photogrammetry captures details but lacks LiDAR's accuracy in featureless areas. Combining both strengths addresses their individual limitations.

Method: Introduces ambiguity heuristic based on density changes to identify missed areas, then uses constrained Gaussian surfel reconstruction to focus optimization on ambiguous regions, extracts Gaussian primitives, and samples points to complete the cloud. Includes divide-and-conquer for large-scale scenes.

Result: Outperforms previous reconstruction methods on both synthetic and real-world LiDAR point cloud completion tasks.

Conclusion: SurfFill effectively combines LiDAR and camera-based capture strengths through Gaussian surfel-based completion, addressing LiDAR's limitations while maintaining its accuracy advantages.

Abstract: LiDAR-captured point clouds are often considered the gold standard in active 3D reconstruction. While their accuracy is exceptional in flat regions, the capturing is susceptible to miss small geometric structures and may fail with dark, absorbent materials. Alternatively, capturing multiple photos of the scene and applying 3D photogrammetry can infer these details as they often represent feature-rich regions. However, the accuracy of LiDAR for featureless regions is rarely reached. Therefore, we suggest combining the strengths of LiDAR and camera-based capture by introducing SurfFill: a Gaussian surfel-based LiDAR completion scheme. We analyze LiDAR capturings and attribute LiDAR beam divergence as a main factor for artifacts, manifesting mostly at thin structures and edges. We use this insight to introduce an ambiguity heuristic for completed scans by evaluating the change in density in the point cloud. This allows us to identify points close to missed areas, which we can then use to grow additional points from to complete the scan. For this point growing, we constrain Gaussian surfel reconstruction [Huang et al. 2024] to focus optimization and densification on these ambiguous areas. Finally, Gaussian primitives of the reconstruction in ambiguous areas are extracted and sampled for points to complete the point cloud. To address the challenges of large-scale reconstruction, we extend this pipeline with a divide-and-conquer scheme for building-sized point cloud completion. We evaluate on the task of LiDAR point cloud completion of synthetic and real-world scenes and find that our method outperforms previous reconstruction methods.

TL;DR: VACoT is a framework that dynamically applies image augmentations during VLM inference to improve robustness on challenging inputs, especially OCR-related adversarial scenarios, without costly retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs rely heavily on large-scale real data or synthetic diversity but struggle with basic perception tasks that conventional models handle well. Retraining VLMs on augmented data is expensive and yields diminishing returns, creating a need for inference-time augmentation approaches.

Method: VACoT dynamically invokes image augmentations during model inference, integrating a structured collection of general visual augmentations (not just local cropping). It uses efficient agentic reinforcement learning with a conditional reward scheme that encourages necessary augmentation while penalizing verbose responses.

Result: VACoT substantially improves robustness on challenging and out-of-distribution inputs, especially in OCR-related adversarial scenarios. It demonstrates superiority on 13 perception benchmarks and introduces AdvOCR to highlight generalization benefits of post-hoc visual augmentations.

Conclusion: VACoT provides an effective framework for improving VLM robustness through inference-time visual augmentations, addressing the limitations of costly retraining approaches while broadening query image views and reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: While visual data augmentation remains a cornerstone for training robust vision models, it has received limited attention in visual language models (VLMs), which predominantly rely on large-scale real data acquisition or synthetic diversity. Consequently, they may struggle with basic perception tasks that conventional models handle reliably. Given the substantial cost of pre-training and fine-tuning VLMs, continue training on augmented data yields limited and diminishing returns. In this paper, we present Visual Augmentation Chain-of-Thought (VACoT), a framework that dynamically invokes image augmentations during model inference. By incorporating post-hoc transformations such as denoising, VACoT substantially improves robustness on challenging and out-of-distribution inputs, especially in OCR-related adversarial scenarios. Distinct from prior approaches limited to local cropping, VACoT integrates a structured collection of general visual augmentations, broadening the query image views while reducing training complexity and computational overhead with efficient agentic reinforcement learning. We propose a conditional reward scheme that encourages necessary augmentation while penalizing verbose responses, ensuring concise and effective reasoning in perception tasks. We demonstrate the superiority of VACoT with extensive experiments on 13 perception benchmarks and further introduce AdvOCR to highlight the generalization benefits of post-hoc visual augmentations in adversarial scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional TB diagnostic methods like sputum smear microscopy are inefficient, especially in resource-limited settings, prompting exploration of deep learning and computer vision for faster, more accessible TB detection.

Method: Used Kaggle dataset of 4,200 chest X-rays; compared pretrained ResNet-50 with general SqueezeNet models; applied data splitting, augmentation, and resizing; evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix metrics.

Result: SqueezeNet achieved superior performance: 89% accuracy, 98% precision, 80% recall, 87% F1 score, 32% loss. ResNet-50 performed worse: 73% accuracy, 88% precision, 52% recall, 65% F1 score, 54% loss.

Conclusion: Machine learning shows strong potential for TB detection, with SqueezeNet particularly promising for mobile deployment in resource-limited areas, but continued development of faster, smaller, more accurate models is needed to support global TB eradication efforts.

Abstract: This study explores the application of machine learning models, specifically a pretrained ResNet-50 model and a general SqueezeNet model, in diagnosing tuberculosis (TB) using chest X-ray images. TB, a persistent infectious disease affecting humanity for millennia, poses challenges in diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings. Traditional methods, such as sputum smear microscopy and culture, are inefficient, prompting the exploration of advanced technologies like deep learning and computer vision. The study utilized a dataset from Kaggle, consisting of 4,200 chest X-rays, to develop and compare the performance of the two machine learning models. Preprocessing involved data splitting, augmentation, and resizing to enhance training efficiency. Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, were employed to assess model performance. Results showcase that the SqueezeNet achieved a loss of 32%, accuracy of 89%, precision of 98%, recall of 80%, and an F1 score of 87%. In contrast, the ResNet-50 model exhibited a loss of 54%, accuracy of 73%, precision of 88%, recall of 52%, and an F1 score of 65%. This study emphasizes the potential of machine learning in TB detection and possible implications for early identification and treatment initiation. The possibility of integrating such models into mobile devices expands their utility in areas lacking TB detection resources. However, despite promising results, the need for continued development of faster, smaller, and more accurate TB detection models remains crucial in contributing to the global efforts in combating TB.

Conclusion: The proposed map-free trajectory prediction algorithm successfully addresses efficiency and accuracy challenges in complex interactive driving scenarios through temporal, spatial, and frequency domain processing.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is crucial for the reliability and safety of autonomous driving systems, yet it remains a challenging task in complex interactive scenarios. Existing methods often struggle to efficiently extract valuable scene information from redundant data, thereby reducing computational efficiency and prediction accuracy, especially when dealing with intricate agent interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel map-free trajectory prediction algorithm that achieves trajectory prediction across the temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. Specifically, in temporal information processing, We utilize a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism to adaptively select critical frequency components. Concurrently, we extract these components and integrate multi-scale temporal features. Subsequently, a selective attention module is proposed to filter out redundant information in both temporal sequences and spatial interactions. Finally, we design a multimodal decoder. Under the supervision of patch-level and point-level losses, we obtain reasonable trajectory results. Experiments on Nuscences datasets demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm, validating its effectiveness in handling complex interactive scenarios.

Motivation: Traditional fine-tuning is hindered when model parameters are inaccessible due to privacy/security constraints, creating demand for input-level strategies that enhance generalization without modifying model weights.

Method: Uses style transfer to construct diverse style representations, then adaptively fuses style cues based on visual context to create dynamic prompts that align feature distributions across styles without touching model internals.

Result: Achieves competitive/superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods under privacy constraints and outperforms full fine-tuning baselines across five benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: SAGE effectively bridges the gap between frozen model invariance and unseen domain diversity through a closed-loop design that synthesizes adaptive visual prompts.

Abstract: Domain generalization for semantic segmentation aims to mitigate the degradation in model performance caused by domain shifts. However, in many real-world scenarios, we are unable to access the model parameters and architectural details due to privacy concerns and security constraints. Traditional fine-tuning or adaptation is hindered, leading to the demand for input-level strategies that can enhance generalization without modifying model weights. To this end, we propose a \textbf{S}tyle-\textbf{A}daptive \textbf{GE}neralization framework (\textbf{SAGE}), which improves the generalization of frozen models under privacy constraints. SAGE learns to synthesize visual prompts that implicitly align feature distributions across styles instead of directly fine-tuning the backbone. Specifically, we first utilize style transfer to construct a diverse style representation of the source domain, thereby learning a set of style characteristics that can cover a wide range of visual features. Then, the model adaptively fuses these style cues according to the visual context of each input, forming a dynamic prompt that harmonizes the image appearance without touching the interior of the model. Through this closed-loop design, SAGE effectively bridges the gap between frozen model invariance and the diversity of unseen domains. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAGE achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods under privacy constraints and outperforms full fine-tuning baselines in all settings.

TL;DR: Real-time UAV photogrammetry framework with explore-and-exploit approach that provides quality assessment and guided feedback during image acquisition to improve 3D reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing real-time UAV photogrammetry methods lack quality assessment of on-the-go 3D reconstruction and don't provide feedback to enhance image acquisition, which is critical for time-sensitive applications like disaster response and digital-twin maintenance.

Method: On-the-fly Feedback SfM framework with three integrated modules: (1) online incremental coarse-mesh generation from expanding sparse point clouds, (2) online mesh quality assessment with actionable indicators, and (3) predictive path planning for trajectory refinement.

Result: Achieves in-situ reconstruction and evaluation in near real-time, significantly reduces coverage gaps and re-flight costs through actionable feedback, enabling transition from passive to intelligent adaptive exploration workflows.

Conclusion: The framework enables intelligent, adaptive UAV photogrammetry by integrating data collection, processing, reconstruction, assessment, and online feedback, representing an alternative to traditional passive workflows.

Abstract: Compared with conventional offline UAV photogrammetry, real-time UAV photogrammetry is essential for time-critical geospatial applications such as disaster response and active digital-twin maintenance. However, most existing methods focus on processing captured images or sequential frames in real time, without explicitly evaluating the quality of the on-the-go 3D reconstruction or providing guided feedback to enhance image acquisition in the target area. This work presents On-the-fly Feedback SfM, an explore-and-exploit framework for real-time UAV photogrammetry, enabling iterative exploration of unseen regions and exploitation of already observed and reconstructed areas in near real time. Built upon SfM on-the-fly , the proposed method integrates three modules: (1) online incremental coarse-mesh generation for dynamically expanding sparse 3D point cloud; (2) online mesh quality assessment with actionable indicators; and (3) predictive path planning for on-the-fly trajectory refinement. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves in-situ reconstruction and evaluation in near real time while providing actionable feedback that markedly reduces coverage gaps and re-flight costs. Via the integration of data collection, processing, 3D reconstruction and assessment, and online feedback, our on the-fly feedback SfM could be an alternative for the transition from traditional passive working mode to a more intelligent and adaptive exploration workflow.

*Yuqing Shao,Yuchen Yang,Rui Yu,Weilong Li,Xu Guo,Huaicheng Yan,Wei Wang,Xiao Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FDTA improves end-to-end MOT by enhancing object embeddings with spatial, temporal, and identity adapters to address low association accuracy in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end MOT methods have strong detection but low association accuracy because object embeddings from DETR architectures have high inter-object similarity, focusing only on category-level discrimination within single frames rather than instance-level distinction across frames with spatiotemporal continuity.

Method: FDTA introduces explicit feature refinement with three adapters: Spatial Adapter (SA) integrates depth-aware cues for spatial continuity, Temporal Adapter (TA) aggregates historical information for temporal dependencies, and Identity Adapter (IA) uses quality-aware contrastive learning for instance-level separability.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging MOT benchmarks including DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BFT, demonstrating effectiveness of discriminative embedding enhancement.

Conclusion: FDTA's explicit feature refinement framework successfully addresses association accuracy limitations in end-to-end MOT by enhancing object discriminativeness through complementary spatial, temporal, and identity perspectives.

Abstract: End-to-end multi-object tracking (MOT) methods have recently achieved remarkable progress by unifying detection and association within a single framework. Despite their strong detection performance, these methods suffer from relatively low association accuracy. Through detailed analysis, we observe that object embeddings produced by the shared DETR architecture display excessively high inter-object similarity, as it emphasizes only category-level discrimination within single frames. In contrast, tracking requires instance-level distinction across frames with spatial and temporal continuity, for which current end-to-end approaches insufficiently optimize object embeddings. To address this, we introduce FDTA (From Detection to Association), an explicit feature refinement framework that enhances object discriminativeness across three complementary perspectives. Specifically, we introduce a Spatial Adapter (SA) to integrate depth-aware cues for spatial continuity, a Temporal Adapter (TA) to aggregate historical information for temporal dependencies, and an Identity Adapter (IA) to leverage quality-aware contrastive learning for instance-level separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FDTA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging MOT benchmarks, including DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BFT, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed discriminative embedding enhancement strategy.

Motivation: 4D radar semantic segmentation is limited by scarce open-source datasets and labels. Existing datasets like RaDelft only provide LiDAR annotations with no public code for radar labeling, hindering reproducibility and research progress.

Method: Camera-guided radar labeling pipeline that projects radar point clouds into camera-based semantic segmentation, then applies spatial clustering to generate accurate radar labels without human annotation.

Result: Successfully reproduced RaDelft results and created labels that significantly enhance radar segmentation accuracy. Established reproducible framework for training/evaluating labeled 4D radar data. Quantified how different fog levels affect radar labeling performance.

Conclusion: The camera-guided labeling pipeline provides an effective solution to the radar dataset scarcity problem, enabling reproducible research and advancing 4D radar semantic segmentation capabilities, with additional insights into fog effects on radar performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D radar highlight its potential for robust environment perception under adverse conditions, yet progress in radar semantic segmentation remains constrained by the scarcity of open source datasets and labels. The RaDelft data set, although seminal, provides only LiDAR annotations and no public code to generate radar labels, limiting reproducibility and downstream research. In this work, we reproduce the numerical results of the RaDelft group and demonstrate that a camera-guided radar labeling pipeline can generate accurate labels for radar point clouds without relying on human annotations. By projecting radar point clouds into camera-based semantic segmentation and applying spatial clustering, we create labels that significantly enhance the accuracy of radar labels. These results establish a reproducible framework that allows the research community to train and evaluate the labeled 4D radar data. In addition, we study and quantify how different fog levels affect the radar labeling performance.

Conclusion: Sophisticated agentic multimodal intelligence can be achieved through carefully curated supervised learning alone, without any reliance on reinforcement learning, demonstrating the effectiveness of unified multimodal planning and execution.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in multimodal agentic systems, existing approaches often treat image manipulation and web search as disjoint capabilities, rely heavily on costly reinforcement learning, and lack planning grounded in real tool-execution traces. To address these limitations, we present Skywork-R1V4, a 30B (A3B) parameter multimodal agentic model that unifies multimodal planning, active image manipulation ("thinking with images"), deep multimodal search, and, most critically, interleaved reasoning that dynamically alternates between visual operations and external knowledge retrieval. Trained solely via supervised fine-tuning on fewer than 30,000 high-quality, planning-execution-consistent trajectories and validated through stepwise consistency filtering, Skywork-R1V4 achieves state-of-the-art results across perception and multimodal search benchmarks: it scores 66.1 on MMSearch and 67.2 on FVQA, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash on all 11 metrics. Skywork-R1V4 exhibits emergent long-horizon reasoning at inference time, successfully orchestrating more than 10 tool calls to solve complex, multi-step tasks. Our results demonstrate that sophisticated agentic multimodal intelligence can be achieved through carefully curated supervised learning alone, without any reliance on reinforcement learning.

Motivation: Existing object-goal navigation approaches suffer from opaque decision-making processes and low success rates when locating unseen objects in open-vocabulary settings.

Method: Explicitly models target-environment relationships and environment-action planning through structured Chain-of-Thought reasoning, coupled with a Similarity-Aware Memory that compresses video frames and fuses historical observations without additional parameters.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in localizing unseen objects, avoids overfitting to seen object categories, and maintains real-time inference at 2Hz.

Conclusion: Nav-R² provides a streamlined, efficient pipeline for open-vocabulary object-goal navigation with transparent reasoning and improved generalization to novel objects.

Abstract: Object-goal navigation in open-vocabulary settings requires agents to locate novel objects in unseen environments, yet existing approaches suffer from opaque decision-making processes and low success rate on locating unseen objects. To address these challenges, we propose Nav-$R^2$, a framework that explicitly models two critical types of relationships, target-environment modeling and environment-action planning, through structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning coupled with a Similarity-Aware Memory. We construct a Nav$R^2$-CoT dataset that teaches the model to perceive the environment, focus on target-related objects in the surrounding context and finally make future action plans. Our SA-Mem preserves the most target-relevant and current observation-relevant features from both temporal and semantic perspectives by compressing video frames and fusing historical observations, while introducing no additional parameters. Compared to previous methods, Nav-R^2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in localizing unseen objects through a streamlined and efficient pipeline, avoiding overfitting to seen object categories while maintaining real-time inference at 2Hz.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WISE is a multi-agent debate framework for multimodal reasoning that uses heterogeneous experts (Solvers and Reflectors) with weighted feedback and modified Dawid-Skene aggregation, achieving 2-7% accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent debate (MAD) has shown promise for leveraging complementary strengths of LLMs in language tasks, but its application to multimodal vision-and-language reasoning problems remains underexplored. The authors aim to generalize MAD protocols to handle heterogeneous experts with both single- and multi-modal capabilities.

Method: WISE (Weighted Iterative Society-of-Experts) partitions agents into Solvers (generate solutions) and Reflectors (verify correctness, assign weights, provide natural language feedback). Uses a modified Dawid-Skene algorithm for post-processing that integrates the two-stage debate model while accounting for response variance and feedback weights.

Result: WISE consistently improves accuracy by 2-7% over state-of-the-art MAD setups and aggregation methods across diverse multimodal tasks (SMART-840, VisualPuzzles, EvoChart-QA, and new SMART-840++ dataset) and LLM configurations.

Conclusion: The WISE framework successfully extends multi-agent debate to multimodal reasoning problems, demonstrating that heterogeneous expert agents with specialized roles (Solvers and Reflectors) and weighted feedback mechanisms can significantly improve reasoning accuracy across diverse vision-and-language tasks.

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) are trained on diverse corpora and tasks, leading them to develop complementary strengths. Multi-agent debate (MAD) has emerged as a popular way to leverage these strengths for robust reasoning, though it has mostly been applied to language-only tasks, leaving its efficacy on multimodal problems underexplored. In this paper, we study MAD for solving vision-and-language reasoning problems. Our setup enables generalizing the debate protocol with heterogeneous experts that possess single- and multi-modal capabilities. To this end, we present Weighted Iterative Society-of-Experts (WISE), a generalized and modular MAD framework that partitions the agents into Solvers, that generate solutions, and Reflectors, that verify correctness, assign weights, and provide natural language feedback. To aggregate the agents' solutions across debate rounds, while accounting for variance in their responses and the feedback weights, we present a modified Dawid-Skene algorithm for post-processing that integrates our two-stage debate model. We evaluate WISE on SMART-840, VisualPuzzles, EvoChart-QA, and a new SMART-840++ dataset with programmatically generated problem instances of controlled difficulty. Our results show that WISE consistently improves accuracy by 2-7% over the state-of-the-art MAD setups and aggregation methods across diverse multimodal tasks and LLM configurations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for wall segmentation in floor plans struggle with thin structural components and produce masks with irregular boundaries, lacking the geometric precision needed for subsequent vectorization in 3D reconstruction pipelines.

Method: MitUNet combines a hierarchical Mix-Transformer encoder for global context capture with a U-Net decoder enhanced with scSE attention blocks for boundary recovery. Uses Tversky loss optimization with fine-tuned hyperparameters to balance precision and recall, suppressing false positives while maintaining sensitivity to thin structures.

Result: Experiments on CubiCasa5k dataset and proprietary regional dataset show MitUNet generates structurally correct masks with high boundary accuracy, outperforming standard single-task models.

Conclusion: MitUNet provides a robust tool for data preparation in automated 3D reconstruction pipelines by ensuring precise wall segmentation with improved geometric accuracy.

Abstract: Automatic 3D reconstruction of indoor spaces from 2D floor plans requires high-precision semantic segmentation of structural elements, particularly walls. However, existing methods optimized for standard metrics often struggle to detect thin structural components and yield masks with irregular boundaries, lacking the geometric precision required for subsequent vectorization. To address this issue, we introduce MitUNet, a hybrid neural network architecture specifically designed for wall segmentation tasks in the context of 3D modeling. In MitUNet, we utilize a hierarchical Mix-Transformer encoder to capture global context and a U-Net decoder enhanced with scSE attention blocks for precise boundary recovery. Furthermore, we propose an optimization strategy based on the Tversky loss function to effectively balance precision and recall. By fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the loss function, we prioritize the suppression of false positive noise along wall boundaries while maintaining high sensitivity to thin structures. Our experiments on the public CubiCasa5k dataset and a proprietary regional dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures the generation of structurally correct masks with high boundary accuracy, outperforming standard single-task models. MitUNet provides a robust tool for data preparation in automated 3D reconstruction pipelines.

TL;DR: GuiDG improves domain generalization in vision-language models by training multiple domain experts instead of a single universal model, using prompt tuning and cross-modal attention for adaptive expert integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fine-tuning methods for vision-language models face a trade-off between domain specificity and generalization ability, often compromising generalization to unseen domains when training a single universal model on entire datasets.

Method: Two-step framework: 1) Use prompt tuning to obtain source domain experts from partitioned domains, 2) Introduce Cross-Modal Attention module to guide vision encoder fine-tuning via adaptive expert integration.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard DG benchmarks and newly constructed ImageNet-DG show GuiDG improves upon state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: Training multiple parameter-efficient expert models on partitioned source domains leads to better domain generalization than fine-tuning a single universal model, as demonstrated by the proposed GuiDG framework.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) has emerged as a prevalent paradigm for downstream adaptation, yet it faces a critical trade-off between domain specificity and domain generalization (DG) ability. Current methods typically fine-tune a universal model on the entire dataset, which potentially compromises the ability to generalize to unseen domains. To fill this gap, we provide a theoretical understanding of the generalization ability for VLM fine-tuning, which reveals that training multiple parameter-efficient expert models on partitioned source domains leads to better generalization than fine-tuning a universal model. Inspired by this finding, we propose a two-step domain-expert-Guided DG (GuiDG) framework. GuiDG first employs prompt tuning to obtain source domain experts, then introduces a Cross-Modal Attention module to guide the fine-tuning of the vision encoder via adaptive expert integration. To better evaluate few-shot DG, we construct ImageNet-DG from ImageNet and its variants. Extensive experiments on standard DG benchmarks and ImageNet-DG demonstrate that GuiDG improves upon state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods while maintaining efficiency.

Motivation: Real-world GUI environments (PC software, mobile apps) are complex and proprietary, making it difficult to obtain comprehensive environment information needed for agent training and evaluation, which hinders systematic investigation and benchmarking of agent navigation capabilities.

Method: Introduce GUI Exploration Lab, a simulation environment engine that enables flexible definition/composition of screens, icons, and navigation graphs with full environment access. Use three-stage training: 1) supervised fine-tuning for fundamental knowledge memorization, 2) single-turn reinforcement learning for generalization to unseen scenarios, and 3) multi-turn reinforcement learning for exploration strategy development.

Result: The approach demonstrates effective generalization to real-world scenarios on both static and interactive benchmarks. Supervised fine-tuning provides crucial foundation, single-turn RL enhances generalization to unseen scenarios, and multi-turn RL develops exploration strategies through interactive trial and error, leading to further performance improvements.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning approaches offer significant advantages in GUI navigation tasks. The findings provide practical guidance for building more capable and generalizable GUI agents, with the GUI Exploration Lab enabling systematic research in this domain.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Vision Language Models, the focus of Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent tasks shifts from single-screen tasks to complex screen navigation challenges. However, real-world GUI environments, such as PC software and mobile Apps, are often complex and proprietary, making it difficult to obtain the comprehensive environment information needed for agent training and evaluation. This limitation hinders systematic investigation and benchmarking of agent navigation capabilities. To address this limitation, we introduce GUI Exploration Lab, a simulation environment engine for GUI agent navigation research that enables flexible definition and composition of screens, icons, and navigation graphs, while providing full access to environment information for comprehensive agent training and evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we find that supervised fine-tuning enables effective memorization of fundamental knowledge, serving as a crucial foundation for subsequent training. Building on this, single-turn reinforcement learning further enhances generalization to unseen scenarios. Finally, multi-turn reinforcement learning encourages the development of exploration strategies through interactive trial and error, leading to further improvements in screen navigation performance. We validate our methods on both static and interactive benchmarks, demonstrating that our findings generalize effectively to real-world scenarios. These findings demonstrate the advantages of reinforcement learning approaches in GUI navigation and offer practical guidance for building more capable and generalizable GUI agents.

TL;DR: WorldMM introduces a multimodal memory agent with episodic, semantic, and visual memory types for long video understanding, achieving 8.4% average improvement over SOTA on five benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video LLMs struggle with hours-long videos due to limited context capacity and loss of visual details. Current memory-augmented methods rely too heavily on textual summaries and fixed temporal scales, failing to utilize visual evidence and handle variable-duration events.

Method: WorldMM constructs three complementary memory types: episodic memory (factual events across multiple temporal scales), semantic memory (continuously updated high-level concepts), and visual memory (detailed scene information). An adaptive retrieval agent iteratively selects relevant memory sources and temporal granularities based on queries.

Result: WorldMM significantly outperforms existing baselines across five long video question-answering benchmarks, achieving an average 8.4% performance gain over previous state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: WorldMM demonstrates effective long video reasoning through its multimodal memory architecture with adaptive retrieval, addressing limitations of text-heavy approaches and fixed temporal scales in existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in video large language models have demonstrated strong capabilities in understanding short clips. However, scaling them to hours- or days-long videos remains highly challenging due to limited context capacity and the loss of critical visual details during abstraction. Existing memory-augmented methods mitigate this by leveraging textual summaries of video segments, yet they heavily rely on text and fail to utilize visual evidence when reasoning over complex scenes. Moreover, retrieving from fixed temporal scales further limits their flexibility in capturing events that span variable durations. To address this, we introduce WorldMM, a novel multimodal memory agent that constructs and retrieves from multiple complementary memories, encompassing both textual and visual representations. WorldMM comprises three types of memory: episodic memory indexes factual events across multiple temporal scales, semantic memory continuously updates high-level conceptual knowledge, and visual memory preserves detailed information about scenes. During inference, an adaptive retrieval agent iteratively selects the most relevant memory source and leverages multiple temporal granularities based on the query, continuing until it determines that sufficient information has been gathered. WorldMM significantly outperforms existing baselines across five long video question-answering benchmarks, achieving an average 8.4% performance gain over previous state-of-the-art methods, showing its effectiveness on long video reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-driven glaucoma detection models have limitations in reliability, parameter efficiency, potential spurious correlations, and inability to support intervention analysis or clinical simulations. There's a need for more causal, lightweight approaches.

Method: Proposes LightHCG - an extremely lightweight Convolutional VAE-based latent glaucoma representation model that uses HSIC-based latent space disentanglement and Graph Autoencoder-based unsupervised causal representation learning to capture true causality among glaucoma-related physical factors.

Result: Achieves higher performance in glaucoma classification while using 93-99% less weights compared to advanced vision models like InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, and VGG16. Also enhances potential for AI-driven intervention analysis.

Conclusion: LightHCG represents a significant advancement in glaucoma detection by combining causal representation learning with extreme parameter efficiency, addressing key limitations of current AI approaches while enabling new capabilities like intervention analysis.

Abstract: As a representative optic degenerative condition, glaucoma has been a threat to millions due to its irreversibility and severe impact on human vision fields. Mainly characterized by dimmed and blurred visions, or peripheral vision loss, glaucoma is well known to occur due to damages in the optic nerve from increased intraocular pressure (IOP) or neovascularization within the retina. Traditionally, most glaucoma related works and clinical diagnosis focused on detecting these damages in the optic nerve by using patient data from perimetry tests, optic papilla inspections and tonometer-based IOP measurements. Recently, with advancements in computer vision AI models, such as VGG16 or Vision Transformers (ViT), AI-automatized glaucoma detection and optic cup segmentation based on retinal fundus images or OCT recently exhibited significant performance in aiding conventional diagnosis with high performance. However, current AI-driven glaucoma detection approaches still have significant room for improvement in terms of reliability, excessive parameter usage, possibility of spurious correlation within detection, and limitations in applications to intervention analysis or clinical simulations. Thus, this research introduced a novel causal representation driven glaucoma detection model: LightHCG, an extremely lightweight Convolutional VAE-based latent glaucoma representation model that can consider the true causality among glaucoma-related physical factors within the optic nerve region. Using HSIC-based latent space disentanglement and Graph Autoencoder based unsupervised causal representation learning, LightHCG not only exhibits higher performance in classifying glaucoma with 93~99% less weights, but also enhances the possibility of AI-driven intervention analysis, compared to existing advanced vision models such as InceptionV3, MobileNetV2 or VGG16.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare has limited annotated data and computational resources; contrastive learning requires large batches making it expensive; need to extract knowledge from both data and models efficiently.

Method: Combines momentum method with distillation: (1) momentum self-distillation for enhanced multimodal learning, (2) momentum mechanisms with gradient accumulation to increase effective batch size without more resources.

Result: Competitive with SOTA in zero-shot classification; >90% AUC-ROC in few-shot adaptation; 2-3% improvement in retrieval tasks; high training efficiency with single GPU and reasonable training time.

Conclusion: Method advances efficient multimodal learning by reducing resource requirements while improving performance over SOTA, making VLM training more accessible for healthcare applications.

Abstract: In medical healthcare, obtaining detailed annotations is challenging, highlighting the need for robust Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Pretrained VLMs enable fine-tuning on small datasets or zero-shot inference, achieving performance comparable to task-specific models. Contrastive learning (CL) is a key paradigm for training VLMs but inherently requires large batch sizes for effective learning, making it computationally demanding and often limited to well-resourced institutions. Moreover, with limited data in healthcare, it is important to prioritize knowledge extraction from both data and models during training to improve performance. Therefore, we focus on leveraging the momentum method combined with distillation to simultaneously address computational efficiency and knowledge exploitation. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) leveraging momentum self-distillation to enhance multimodal learning, and (2) integrating momentum mechanisms with gradient accumulation to enlarge the effective batch size without increasing resource consumption. Our method attains competitive performance with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in zero-shot classification, while providing a substantial boost in the few-shot adaption, achieving over 90% AUC-ROC and improving retrieval tasks by 2-3%. Importantly, our method achieves high training efficiency with a single GPU while maintaining reasonable training time. Our approach aims to advance efficient multimodal learning by reducing resource requirements while improving performance over SOTA methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Meta-learning requires expensive meta-training, while many task-specific pre-trained models exist but lack efficient transfer methods. Need lightweight approach to reuse existing models for new tasks.

Method: Offline: Extract dominant singular directions from multiple task vectors and orthogonalize them per layer. Online: Freeze bases, train only small diagonal coefficients per layer for new task, providing rank-controlled updates with few parameters.

Result: BOLT provides strong training-free initialization and achieves robust performance compared to PEFT baselines and meta-learned initialization, with very few trainable parameters.

Conclusion: Constraining adaptation to task-informed orthogonal subspace offers effective alternative for unseen-task transfer, balancing performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Adapting large pre-trained models to unseen tasks under tight data and compute budgets remains challenging. Meta-learning approaches explicitly learn good initializations, but they require an additional meta-training phase over many tasks, incur high training cost, and can be unstable. At the same time, the number of task-specific pre-trained models continues to grow, yet the question of how to transfer them to new tasks with minimal additional training remains relatively underexplored. We propose BOLT (Basis-Oriented Low-rank Transfer), a framework that reuses existing fine-tuned models not by merging weights, but instead by extracting an orthogonal, task-informed spectral basis and adapting within that subspace. In the offline phase, BOLT collects dominant singular directions from multiple task vectors and orthogonalizes them per layer to form reusable bases. In the online phase, we freeze these bases and train only a small set of diagonal coefficients per layer for the new task, yielding a rank-controlled update with very few trainable parameters. This design provides (i) a strong, training-free initialization for unseen tasks, obtained by pooling source-task coefficients, along with a lightweight rescaling step while leveraging the shared orthogonal bases, and (ii) a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) path that, in our experiments, achieves robust performance compared to common PEFT baselines as well as a representative meta-learned initialization. Our results show that constraining adaptation to a task-informed orthogonal subspace provides an effective alternative for unseen-task transfer.

*Fan Luo,Zeyu Gao,Xinhao Luo,Kai Zhao,Yanfeng Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Temporal Dynamics Enhancer (TDE) improves SNN object detection by generating diverse temporal stimuli and using spike-driven attention, achieving state-of-the-art performance with reduced energy consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SNNs have limited expressive power because they replicate or aggregate inputs at fixed intervals, leading to nearly identical stimuli across time steps, which is particularly problematic for complex tasks like object detection.

Method: Proposes Temporal Dynamics Enhancer (TDE) with two modules: Spiking Encoder (SE) generates diverse input stimuli across time steps, and Attention Gating Module (AGM) guides SE generation based on inter-temporal dependencies. Also introduces Spike-Driven Attention (SDA) to reduce attention-related energy consumption by eliminating high-energy multiplication operations.

Result: TDE achieves mAP50-95 scores of 57.7% on PASCAL VOC and 47.6% on EvDET200K, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. SDA consumes only 0.240 times the energy of conventional attention modules.

Conclusion: TDE effectively enhances SNNs' temporal modeling capacity for object detection while maintaining energy efficiency through spike-driven attention, making SNNs more competitive for complex vision tasks.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with their brain-inspired spatiotemporal dynamics and spike-driven computation, have emerged as promising energy-efficient alternatives to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). However, existing SNNs typically replicate inputs directly or aggregate them into frames at fixed intervals. Such strategies lead to neurons receiving nearly identical stimuli across time steps, severely limiting the model's expressive power, particularly in complex tasks like object detection. In this work, we propose the Temporal Dynamics Enhancer (TDE) to strengthen SNNs' capacity for temporal information modeling. TDE consists of two modules: a Spiking Encoder (SE) that generates diverse input stimuli across time steps, and an Attention Gating Module (AGM) that guides the SE generation based on inter-temporal dependencies. Moreover, to eliminate the high-energy multiplication operations introduced by the AGM, we propose a Spike-Driven Attention (SDA) to reduce attention-related energy consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TDE can be seamlessly integrated into existing SNN-based detectors and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving mAP50-95 scores of 57.7% on the static PASCAL VOC dataset and 47.6% on the neuromorphic EvDET200K dataset. In terms of energy consumption, the SDA consumes only 0.240 times the energy of conventional attention modules.

*Valentin Bieri,Marie-Julie Rakotosaona,Keisuke Tateno,Francis Engelmann,Leonidas Guibas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HouseLayout3D is a real-world benchmark for full building-scale 3D layout estimation including multiple floors, addressing limitations of current models trained only on simple single-room/floor synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D layout estimation models are limited to single room/floor synthetic datasets, requiring scene splitting that removes global spatial context essential for reasoning about multi-level structures like staircases.

Method: Introduces HouseLayout3D benchmark for multi-floor building layout estimation, and presents MultiFloor3D - a simple training-free baseline leveraging recent scene understanding methods.

Result: MultiFloor3D already outperforms existing 3D layout estimation models on both the new benchmark and prior datasets, highlighting the need for further research in this direction.

Conclusion: The work addresses a critical gap in 3D layout estimation by providing a real-world benchmark for full building-scale analysis and demonstrating that even simple baselines can outperform current models, indicating significant room for improvement in this area.

Abstract: Current 3D layout estimation models are primarily trained on synthetic datasets containing simple single room or single floor environments. As a consequence, they cannot natively handle large multi floor buildings and require scenes to be split into individual floors before processing, which removes global spatial context that is essential for reasoning about structures such as staircases that connect multiple levels. In this work, we introduce HouseLayout3D, a real world benchmark designed to support progress toward full building scale layout estimation, including multiple floors and architecturally intricate spaces. We also present MultiFloor3D, a simple training free baseline that leverages recent scene understanding methods and already outperforms existing 3D layout estimation models on both our benchmark and prior datasets, highlighting the need for further research in this direction.

### [43] [ClusterStyle: Modeling Intra-Style Diversity with Prototypical Clustering for Stylized Motion Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02453)
*Kerui Chen,Jianrong Zhang,Ming Li,Zhonglong Zheng,Hehe Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ClusterStyle: A clustering-based framework that models intra-style diversity in motion generation using global and local style embedding spaces with prototype anchors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing stylized motion generation models fail to capture intra-style diversity - the ability for a single style to correspond to diverse motion variations. Current approaches learn unstructured embeddings that don't effectively model the rich variations within style categories.

Method: Proposes ClusterStyle with two structured style embedding spaces: global-level for diversity among style motions of same category, and local-level for diversity within temporal dynamics. Uses non-learnable prototype anchors for optimization and augments pretrained text-to-motion models with Stylistic Modulation Adapter (SMA) to integrate style features.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in both stylized motion generation and motion style transfer tasks.

Conclusion: ClusterStyle effectively addresses the intra-style diversity challenge in motion generation by modeling diverse style patterns through structured embedding spaces with prototype-based clustering, achieving superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Existing stylized motion generation models have shown their remarkable ability to understand specific style information from the style motion, and insert it into the content motion. However, capturing intra-style diversity, where a single style should correspond to diverse motion variations, remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based framework, ClusterStyle, to address this limitation. Instead of learning an unstructured embedding from each style motion, we leverage a set of prototypes to effectively model diverse style patterns across motions belonging to the same style category. We consider two types of style diversity: global-level diversity among style motions of the same category, and local-level diversity within the temporal dynamics of motion sequences. These components jointly shape two structured style embedding spaces, i.e., global and local, optimized via alignment with non-learnable prototype anchors. Furthermore, we augment the pretrained text-to-motion generation model with the Stylistic Modulation Adapter (SMA) to integrate the style features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in stylized motion generation and motion style transfer.

*Sourabh Sharma,Sonam Gupta,Sadbhawna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STL is a self-training framework that enhances multimodal reasoning in VLMs by generating structured rationales (see-then-think) and negative rationales, improving both perception and reasoning without expensive human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with multimodal reasoning due to weaknesses in either perception or reasoning. Existing methods to improve reasoning rely on costly human annotations, proprietary models, or self-training that ignores perception, creating a need for a more effective and cost-efficient solution.

Method: STL introduces a structured reasoning template that separates perception ("see") from reasoning ("think"): first extract visual attributes in textual form, then use them to guide reasoning. The framework uses self-training where the model generates and learns from its own structured rationales, augmented with negative rationales that explain why incorrect answers are wrong.

Result: Experiments across diverse domains show STL consistently outperforms baselines trained only on answers or self-generated reasoning. Qualitative analysis confirms the high quality of its rationales, demonstrating improved multimodal reasoning ability.

Conclusion: STL provides a cost-effective solution to enhance multimodal reasoning in VLMs by jointly improving perception and reasoning through structured self-training with negative rationales, offering a practical alternative to expensive annotation methods.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in integrating visual perception with language understanding. However, effective multimodal reasoning requires both accurate perception and robust reasoning, and weakness in either limits the performance of VLMs. Prior efforts to enhance reasoning often depend on high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data, obtained via labor-intensive human annotations, costly proprietary models, or self-training methods that overlook perception. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective self-training framework called See-Think-Learn (STL). At its core, STL introduces a structured reasoning template that encourages the model to see before thinking, first extracting visual attributes in textual form, then using them to guide reasoning. The framework jointly improves perception and reasoning by having the model generate and learn from its own structured rationales in a self-training loop. Furthermore, we augment the training data with negative rationales, i.e. explanations that justify why certain answer choices are incorrect, to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between correct and misleading responses. This fosters more discriminative and robust learning. Experiments across diverse domains show that STL consistently outperforms baselines trained directly only on answers or self-generated reasoning, while qualitative analysis confirms the high quality of its rationales. STL thus provides a cost-effective solution to enhance multimodal reasoning ability of VLMs.

*Jianzong Wu,Hao Lian,Dachao Hao,Ye Tian,Qingyu Shi,Biaolong Chen,Hao Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Audio-video joint denoising training improves video generation quality even when only video quality matters, by using audio as a privileged signal to regularize video dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether audio-video joint denoising training can improve video generation quality beyond just achieving audio-video synchrony, even when the primary concern is video quality alone.

Method: Introduces AVFullDiT, a parameter-efficient architecture leveraging pre-trained T2V and T2A modules for joint denoising. Trains both a T2AV model with audio-video joint denoising and a T2V-only counterpart under identical settings for comparison.

Result: Audio-video joint denoising consistently improves video quality on challenging subsets with large and object contact motions. Audio acts as a privileged signal that helps the model internalize causal relationships between visual events and acoustic consequences.

Conclusion: Cross-modal co-training is a promising approach for developing stronger, more physically grounded world models, as audio-video joint denoising provides benefits beyond synchrony by regularizing video dynamics through causal relationships.

Abstract: Recent audio-video generative systems suggest that coupling modalities benefits not only audio-video synchrony but also the video modality itself. We pose a fundamental question: Does audio-video joint denoising training improve video generation, even when we only care about video quality? To study this, we introduce a parameter-efficient Audio-Video Full DiT (AVFullDiT) architecture that leverages pre-trained text-to-video (T2V) and text-to-audio (T2A) modules for joint denoising. We train (i) a T2AV model with AVFullDiT and (ii) a T2V-only counterpart under identical settings. Our results provide the first systematic evidence that audio-video joint denoising can deliver more than synchrony. We observe consistent improvements on challenging subsets featuring large and object contact motions. We hypothesize that predicting audio acts as a privileged signal, encouraging the model to internalize causal relationships between visual events and their acoustic consequences (e.g., collision $\times$ impact sound), which in turn regularizes video dynamics. Our findings suggest that cross-modal co-training is a promising approach to developing stronger, more physically grounded world models. Code and dataset will be made publicly available.

*Zhongyi Cai,Yi Du,Chen Wang,Yu Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEER-Bench introduces a sequential embodied AI benchmark for realistic multi-step tasks, and 3DSPMR enhances MLLMs with 3D spatial memory for improved reasoning and exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world embodied agents face sequential tasks where sub-tasks build on previous ones, requiring reuse of spatial knowledge from prior explorations, which existing single-task benchmarks don't address.

Method: Proposes 3DSPMR (3D Spatial Memory Reasoning) that augments Multi-Modal Large Language Models with relational, visual, and geometric cues from explored regions to handle sequential embodied tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments show 3DSPMR achieves substantial performance gains on both sequential Embodied Question Answering (EQA) and Embodied Multi-modal Navigation (EMN) tasks in the SEER-Bench benchmark.

Conclusion: This work addresses the practical challenge of sequential embodied tasks by introducing a new benchmark and demonstrating that incorporating geometric information into MLLM-based spatial reasoning significantly improves performance.

Abstract: Existing research on indoor embodied tasks typically requires agents to actively explore unknown environments and reason about the scene to achieve a specific goal. However, when deployed in real life, agents often face sequential tasks, where each new sub-task follows the completion of the previous one, and certain sub-tasks may be infeasible, such as searching for a non-existent object. Compared with the single-task setting, the core challenge lies in reusing spatial knowledge accumulated from previous explorations to support subsequent reasoning and exploration. In this work, we investigate this underexplored yet practically significant embodied AI challenge. To evaluate this challenge, we introduce SEER-Bench, a new Sequential Embodied Exploration and Reasoning Benchmark encompassing encompassing two classic embodied tasks: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) and Embodied Multi-modal Navigation (EMN). Building on SEER-Bench, we propose 3DSPMR, a 3D SPatial Memory Reasoning approach that exploits relational, visual, and geometric cues from explored regions to augment Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for reasoning and exploration in sequential embodied tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly incorporate geometric information into MLLM-based spatial understanding and reasoning. Extensive experiments verify that 3DSPMR achieves substantial performance gains on both sequential EQA and EMN tasks.

TL;DR: TGDD improves dataset distillation by dynamically aligning feature distributions along the model's training trajectory, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 5.0% accuracy gains on high-resolution benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing distribution matching methods for dataset distillation overlook the evolution of feature representations during training, limiting synthetic data expressiveness and weakening downstream performance.

Method: TGDD reformulates distribution matching as dynamic alignment along model training trajectory, capturing evolving semantics at each stage while introducing distribution constraint regularization to reduce class overlap.

Result: TGDD achieves state-of-the-art performance on ten datasets with 5.0% accuracy gain on high-resolution benchmarks, balancing performance and efficiency without additional optimization overhead.

Conclusion: TGDD effectively preserves semantic diversity and representativeness in synthetic data through trajectory-guided dynamic alignment, improving downstream task performance while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses large datasets into compact synthetic ones to reduce storage and computational costs. Among various approaches, distribution matching (DM)-based methods have attracted attention for their high efficiency. However, they often overlook the evolution of feature representations during training, which limits the expressiveness of synthetic data and weakens downstream performance. To address this issue, we propose Trajectory Guided Dataset Distillation (TGDD), which reformulates distribution matching as a dynamic alignment process along the model's training trajectory. At each training stage, TGDD captures evolving semantics by aligning the feature distribution between the synthetic and original dataset. Meanwhile, it introduces a distribution constraint regularization to reduce class overlap. This design helps synthetic data preserve both semantic diversity and representativeness, improving performance in downstream tasks. Without additional optimization overhead, TGDD achieves a favorable balance between performance and efficiency. Experiments on ten datasets demonstrate that TGDD achieves state-of-the-art performance, notably a 5.0% accuracy gain on high-resolution benchmarks.

TL;DR: WorldPack is a video world model with compressed memory that improves long-term spatial consistency and quality in video generation despite shorter context lengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video world models struggle with temporally- and spatially-consistent long-term world modeling due to prohibitively expensive computational costs for long-context inputs.

Method: WorldPack uses efficient compressed memory with two components: trajectory packing for high context efficiency, and memory retrieval to maintain consistency in rollouts and support long-term generations requiring spatial reasoning.

Result: WorldPack significantly outperforms strong state-of-the-art models on the LoopNav benchmark in Minecraft, demonstrating notable improvements in spatial consistency, fidelity, and quality in long-term generation.

Conclusion: WorldPack's compressed memory approach effectively addresses the computational challenges of long-context video world modeling while improving spatial consistency and generation quality.

Abstract: Video world models have attracted significant attention for their ability to produce high-fidelity future visual observations conditioned on past observations and navigation actions. Temporally- and spatially-consistent, long-term world modeling has been a long-standing problem, unresolved with even recent state-of-the-art models, due to the prohibitively expensive computational costs for long-context inputs. In this paper, we propose WorldPack, a video world model with efficient compressed memory, which significantly improves spatial consistency, fidelity, and quality in long-term generation despite much shorter context length. Our compressed memory consists of trajectory packing and memory retrieval; trajectory packing realizes high context efficiency, and memory retrieval maintains the consistency in rollouts and helps long-term generations that require spatial reasoning. Our performance is evaluated with LoopNav, a benchmark on Minecraft, specialized for the evaluation of long-term consistency, and we verify that WorldPack notably outperforms strong state-of-the-art models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UCAgents is a hierarchical multi-agent framework for medical VQA that enforces unidirectional convergence through structured evidence auditing, achieving superior accuracy with 87.7% lower token cost by constraining visual ambiguity and textual noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs in medical diagnosis suffer from reasoning detachment where explanations drift from verifiable image evidence, undermining clinical trust. Multi-agent frameworks for MDT debates amplify textual noise and computational costs while failing to anchor reasoning to visual evidence.

Method: UCAgents uses a hierarchical multi-agent framework with unidirectional convergence through structured evidence auditing. Inspired by clinical workflows, it forbids position changes and limits interactions to targeted evidence verification, introduces one-round inquiry discussions to uncover visual-textual misalignment risks, and formalizes a dual-noise bottleneck via information theory.

Result: Achieves 71.3% accuracy on PathVQA (+6.0% over SOTA) with 87.7% lower token cost across four medical VQA benchmarks. Strikes balance between uncovering visual evidence and avoiding textual interference.

Conclusion: UCAgents demonstrates both diagnostic reliability and computational efficiency critical for real-world clinical deployment by enforcing evidence-anchored reasoning while suppressing rhetorical drift and computational costs.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical diagnosis, yet suffer from reasoning detachment, where linguistically fluent explanations drift from verifiable image evidence, undermining clinical trust. Recent multi-agent frameworks simulate Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) debates to mitigate single-model bias, but open-ended discussions amplify textual noise and computational cost while failing to anchor reasoning to visual evidence, the cornerstone of medical decision-making. We propose UCAgents, a hierarchical multi-agent framework enforcing unidirectional convergence through structured evidence auditing. Inspired by clinical workflows, UCAgents forbids position changes and limits agent interactions to targeted evidence verification, suppressing rhetorical drift while amplifying visual signal extraction. In UCAgents, a one-round inquiry discussion is introduced to uncover potential risks of visual-textual misalignment. This design jointly constrains visual ambiguity and textual noise, a dual-noise bottleneck that we formalize via information theory. Extensive experiments on four medical VQA benchmarks show UCAgents achieves superior accuracy (71.3% on PathVQA, +6.0% over state-of-the-art) with 87.7% lower token cost, the evaluation results further confirm that UCAgents strikes a balance between uncovering more visual evidence and avoiding confusing textual interference. These results demonstrate that UCAgents exhibits both diagnostic reliability and computational efficiency critical for real-world clinical deployment.

TL;DR: 3D-SLIM replaces causal attention masks with adaptive spatial masks for better 3D scene-language reasoning, eliminating sequential bias and improving object-instruction attention without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based 3D scene understanding methods use causal attention masks from language modeling, which creates two problems: sequential bias among order-agnostic 3D objects, and restricted object-instruction attention that hinders task-specific reasoning.

Method: Proposes 3D Spatial Language Instruction Mask (3D-SLIM) with two components: Geometry-adaptive Mask that constrains attention based on spatial density rather than token order, and Instruction-aware Mask that enables object tokens to directly access instruction context. Simple, no architectural modifications or extra parameters needed.

Result: Substantial performance improvements across diverse 3D scene-language tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLM baselines validate effectiveness, underscoring the critical role of decoder design in 3D multi-modal reasoning.

Conclusion: 3D-SLIM demonstrates that adaptive attention masks tailored to 3D spatial structure can overcome fundamental limitations of causal masks in 3D scene-language understanding, providing a simple yet effective solution for better 3D reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene-language understanding have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) for 3D reasoning by transferring their general reasoning ability to 3D multi-modal contexts. However, existing methods typically adopt standard decoders from language modeling, which rely on a causal attention mask. This design introduces two fundamental conflicts in 3D scene understanding: sequential bias among order-agnostic 3D objects and restricted object-instruction attention, hindering task-specific reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Spatial Language Instruction Mask (3D-SLIM), an effective masking strategy that replaces the causal mask with an adaptive attention mask tailored to the spatial structure of 3D scenes. Our 3D-SLIM introduces two key components: a Geometry-adaptive Mask that constrains attention based on spatial density rather than token order, and an Instruction-aware Mask that enables object tokens to directly access instruction context. This design allows the model to process objects based on their spatial relationships while being guided by the user's task. 3D-SLIM is simple, requires no architectural modifications, and adds no extra parameters, yet it yields substantial performance improvements across diverse 3D scene-language tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLM baselines validate its effectiveness and underscore the critical role of decoder design in 3D multi-modal reasoning.

Motivation: Existing diffusion models for audio-driven avatar video generation have made progress in long sequences with audio-visual sync, but music-performance videos with camera motions remain unexplored. Current methods lack explicit camera motion control.

Method: Cascaded framework with: 1) audio semantic analysis, 2) interpretable shot planning module (MV-Director), 3) temporal-aware diffusion Transformer architectures, 4) long-sequence consistency modeling, 5) camera adapter module for embedding camera poses, and 6) time-aware dynamic window range strategy for adaptive denoising.

Result: Comprehensive benchmarks show YingVideo-MV achieves outstanding performance in generating coherent and expressive music videos with precise music-motion-camera synchronization. The system uses a large-scale Music-in-the-Wild Dataset for diverse, high-quality results.

Conclusion: YingVideo-MV is the first framework for music-driven long-video generation that successfully integrates camera motion control and achieves high-quality music-performance video synthesis with precise audio-visual synchronization.

Abstract: While diffusion model for audio-driven avatar video generation have achieved notable process in synthesizing long sequences with natural audio-visual synchronization and identity consistency, the generation of music-performance videos with camera motions remains largely unexplored. We present YingVideo-MV, the first cascaded framework for music-driven long-video generation. Our approach integrates audio semantic analysis, an interpretable shot planning module (MV-Director), temporal-aware diffusion Transformer architectures, and long-sequence consistency modeling to enable automatic synthesis of high-quality music performance videos from audio signals. We construct a large-scale Music-in-the-Wild Dataset by collecting web data to support the achievement of diverse, high-quality results. Observing that existing long-video generation methods lack explicit camera motion control, we introduce a camera adapter module that embeds camera poses into latent noise. To enhance continulity between clips during long-sequence inference, we further propose a time-aware dynamic window range strategy that adaptively adjust denoising ranges based on audio embedding. Comprehensive benchmark tests demonstrate that YingVideo-MV achieves outstanding performance in generating coherent and expressive music videos, and enables precise music-motion-camera synchronization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the impact of feature vector invariance under translation/rotation for partial-to-partial point set registration, and to address theoretical and practical problems with deep-learning-based registration methods using GMMs, especially DeepGMR's limitations.

Method: Introduces an attention-based reference point shifting (ARPS) layer that uses an attention module to robustly identify a common reference point between two partial point sets, enabling transformation-invariant feature extraction.

Result: The ARPS layer significantly enhances performance of DeepGMR and its variant UGMMReg, outperforming prior deep learning methods that use attention blocks and Transformers to extract overlap regions or common reference points.

Conclusion: The findings provide deeper insights into registration methods using deep learning and GMMs, demonstrating that robust identification of common reference points through attention mechanisms effectively addresses transformation invariance problems in partial-to-partial registration.

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of the invariance of feature vectors for partial-to-partial point set registration under translation and rotation of input point sets, particularly in the realm of techniques based on deep learning and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). We reveal both theoretical and practical problems associated with such deep-learning-based registration methods using GMMs, with a particular focus on the limitations of DeepGMR, a pioneering study in this line, to the partial-to-partial point set registration. Our primary goal is to uncover the causes behind such methods and propose a comprehensible solution for that. To address this, we introduce an attention-based reference point shifting (ARPS) layer, which robustly identifies a common reference point of two partial point sets, thereby acquiring transformation-invariant features. The ARPS layer employs a well-studied attention module to find a common reference point rather than the overlap region. Owing to this, it significantly enhances the performance of DeepGMR and its recent variant, UGMMReg. Furthermore, these extension models outperform even prior deep learning methods using attention blocks and Transformer to extract the overlap region or common reference points. We believe these findings provide deeper insights into registration methods using deep learning and GMMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current test-time adaptation evaluations for medical image segmentation are limited in modality coverage, task diversity, and methodological consistency, creating a need for standardized benchmarking to enable reliable clinical deployment.

Method: Created MedSeg-TTA benchmark with 20 representative adaptation methods across 7 imaging modalities (MRI, CT, ultrasound, pathology, dermoscopy, OCT, chest X-ray) using unified data preprocessing, backbone configuration, and test-time protocols. Evaluated four adaptation paradigms: Input-level Transformation, Feature-level Alignment, Output-level Regularization, and Prior Estimation.

Result: No single paradigm performs best in all conditions. Input-level methods are more stable under mild appearance shifts; feature-level and output-level methods excel in boundary-related metrics; prior-based methods show strong modality dependence. Many methods degrade significantly under large inter-center and inter-device shifts.

Conclusion: MedSeg-TTA establishes a rigorous foundation for test-time adaptation research in medical imaging, providing standardized datasets, validated implementations, and a public leaderboard to guide principled method selection for clinical deployment.

Abstract: Test time Adaptation is a promising approach for mitigating domain shift in medical image segmentation; however, current evaluations remain limited in terms of modality coverage, task diversity, and methodological consistency. We present MedSeg-TTA, a comprehensive benchmark that examines twenty representative adaptation methods across seven imaging modalities, including MRI, CT, ultrasound, pathology, dermoscopy, OCT, and chest X-ray, under fully unified data preprocessing, backbone configuration, and test time protocols. The benchmark encompasses four significant adaptation paradigms: Input-level Transformation, Feature-level Alignment, Output-level Regularization, and Prior Estimation, enabling the first systematic cross-modality comparison of their reliability and applicability. The results show that no single paradigm performs best in all conditions. Input-level methods are more stable under mild appearance shifts. Feature-level and Output-level methods offer greater advantages in boundary-related metrics, whereas prior-based methods exhibit strong modality dependence. Several methods degrade significantly under large inter-center and inter-device shifts, which highlights the importance of principled method selection for clinical deployment. MedSeg-TTA provides standardized datasets, validated implementations, and a public leaderboard, establishing a rigorous foundation for future research on robust, clinically reliable test-time adaptation.

Abstract: Document Layout Parsing serves as a critical gateway for Artificial Intelligence (AI) to access and interpret the world's vast stores of structured knowledge. This process,which encompasses layout detection, text recognition, and relational understanding, is particularly crucial for empowering next-generation Vision-Language Models.

Abstract: Autoregressive models are structurally misaligned with the inherently parallel nature of geospatial understanding, forcing a rigid sequential narrative onto scenes and fundamentally hindering the generation of structured and coherent outputs. We challenge this paradigm by reframing geospatial generation as a parallel refinement process, enabling a holistic, coarse-to-fine synthesis that resolves all semantic elements simultaneously. To operationalize this, we introduce GeoDiT, the first diffusion-based vision-language model tailored for the geospatial domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoDiT establishes a new state-of-the-art on benchmarks requiring structured, object-centric outputs. It achieves significant gains in image captioning, visual grounding, and multi-object detection, precisely the tasks where autoregressive models falter. Our work validates that aligning the generative process with the data's intrinsic structure is key to unlocking superior performance in complex geospatial analysis.

Abstract: In computer vision, Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) is still a difficult problem. We present ViT-SR, a new technique to improve the performance of a Vision Transformer (ViT) employing a two-stage training strategy. In our method, the model learns rich, generalizable visual representations from the data itself through a self-supervised pretraining phase on a colourization task. The pre-trained model is then adjusted for 4x super-resolution. By predicting the addition of a high-frequency residual image to an initial bicubic interpolation, this design simplifies residual learning. ViT-SR, trained and evaluated on the DIV2K benchmark dataset, achieves an impressive SSIM of 0.712 and PSNR of 22.90 dB. These results demonstrate the efficacy of our two-stage approach and highlight the potential of self-supervised pre-training for complex image restoration tasks. Further improvements may be possible with larger ViT architectures or alternative pretext tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose vision-language models are suboptimal for remote sensing tasks, and existing geospatial VLMs struggle to differentiate between task types and interpretation granularities, limiting their ability to balance local detail perception with global contextual understanding.

Method: SkyMoE employs: 1) Adaptive router generating task- and granularity-aware routing instructions to activate specialized LLM experts for different sub-tasks; 2) Context-disentangled augmentation strategy creating contrastive pairs between local and global features to promote expert decoupling and granularity sensitivity; 3) Construction of MGRS-Bench benchmark covering multiple RS interpretation tasks and granularity levels.

Conclusion: SkyMoE effectively addresses the limitations of existing geospatial VLMs by enabling specialized expert handling of diverse sub-tasks through adaptive routing and granularity-aware representation learning, achieving superior performance in multimodal, multi-task remote sensing interpretation.

Abstract: The emergence of large vision-language models (VLMs) has significantly enhanced the efficiency and flexibility of geospatial interpretation. However, general-purpose VLMs remain suboptimal for remote sensing (RS) tasks. Existing geospatial VLMs typically adopt a unified modeling strategy and struggle to differentiate between task types and interpretation granularities, limiting their ability to balance local detail perception and global contextual understanding. In this paper, we present SkyMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) vision-language model tailored for multimodal, multi-task RS interpretation. SkyMoE employs an adaptive router that generates task- and granularity-aware routing instructions, enabling specialized large language model experts to handle diverse sub-tasks. To further promote expert decoupling and granularity sensitivity, we introduce a context-disentangled augmentation strategy that creates contrastive pairs between local and global features, guiding experts toward level-specific representation learning. We also construct MGRS-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple RS interpretation tasks and granularity levels, to evaluate generalization in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments on 21 public datasets demonstrate that SkyMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance across tasks, validating its adaptability, scalability, and superior multi-granularity understanding in remote sensing.

*Tai Le-Gia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This dissertation addresses zero-shot anomaly classification/segmentation challenges, introducing CoDeGraph for filtering consistent anomalies, extending to 3D medical imaging, and bridging batch/text-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot anomaly detection is crucial for industrial inspection and medical imaging where training data is unavailable. The research addresses the problem of consistent anomalies that bias distance-based methods.

Method: 1) Formalizes consistent anomaly problem and analyzes patch representations from pre-trained Vision Transformers. 2) Introduces CoDeGraph framework using multi-stage graph construction, community detection, and structured refinement. 3) Extends to 3D medical imaging with training-free volumetric tokenization. 4) Bridges batch/text-based methods using CoDeGraph pseudo-masks to supervise vision-language models.

Result: Identifies similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout phenomena in patch representations. CoDeGraph effectively suppresses consistent anomalies. Achieves zero-shot 3D anomaly segmentation without training samples. Enables prompt-driven vision-language model supervision.

Conclusion: The dissertation provides theoretical understanding and practical solutions for zero-shot anomaly classification/segmentation, addressing consistent anomalies, extending to 3D medical imaging, and bridging different zero-shot approaches.

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly classification and segmentation (AC/AS) aim to detect anomalous samples and regions without any training data, a capability increasingly crucial in industrial inspection and medical imaging. This dissertation aims to investigate the core challenges of zero-shot AC/AS and presents principled solutions rooted in theory and algorithmic design.
  We first formalize the problem of consistent anomalies, a failure mode in which recurring similar anomalies systematically bias distance-based methods. By analyzing the statistical and geometric behavior of patch representations from pre-trained Vision Transformers, we identify two key phenomena - similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout - that describe how relationships among normal patches change with and without consistent anomalies in settings characterized by highly similar objects.
  We then introduce CoDeGraph, a graph-based framework for filtering consistent anomalies built on the similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout phenomena. Through multi-stage graph construction, community detection, and structured refinement, CoDeGraph effectively suppresses the influence of consistent anomalies.
  Next, we extend this framework to 3D medical imaging by proposing a training-free, computationally efficient volumetric tokenization strategy for MRI data. This enables a genuinely zero-shot 3D anomaly detection pipeline and shows that volumetric anomaly segmentation is achievable without any 3D training samples.
  Finally, we bridge batch-based and text-based zero-shot methods by demonstrating that CoDeGraph-derived pseudo-masks can supervise prompt-driven vision-language models. Together, this dissertation provides theoretical understanding and practical solutions for the zero-shot AC/AS problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods using fixed learnable query tokens suffer from task generalization collapse - they fail to adapt to new tasks that differ from pre-training tasks, limiting the efficient bridging between Vision-Language Models and Diffusion Models.

Method: Introduces Noisy Query Tokens that learn distributed representation space between VLM and Diffusion Model via end-to-end optimization, plus a VAE branch with linear projection to recover fine-grained image details.

Result: Experimental results confirm the approach mitigates generalization collapse and enables stable continual learning across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses the generalization collapse problem in bridging VLMs with Diffusion Models, enabling more robust and adaptable multimodal systems through distributed representations and detail-preserving mechanisms.

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has highlighted the challenge of efficiently bridging pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Diffusion Models. While methods using a fixed number of learnable query tokens offer computational efficiency, they suffer from task generalization collapse, failing to adapt to new tasks that are distant from their pre-training tasks. To overcome this, we propose Noisy Query Tokens, which learn a distributed representation space between the VLM and Diffusion Model via end-to-end optimization, enhancing continual learning. Additionally, we introduce a VAE branch with linear projection to recover fine-grained image details. Experimental results confirm our approach mitigates generalization collapse and enables stable continual learning across diverse tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free acceleration method for multi-view 3D models that replaces early global attention with frame attention and subsamples global attention, achieving 8-10× speedup while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-view 3D models like VGGT and π³ rely heavily on global self-attention, resulting in high computational costs. While sparse-attention variants offer partial speedups, they lack systematic understanding of how global attention contributes to multi-view reasoning.

Method: First analyzed global attention modules in VGGT and π³, discovering role division: early layers don't form meaningful correspondences, middle layers perform cross-view alignment, last layers provide minor refinements. Based on this, proposed training-free two-step acceleration: (1) convert early global layers to frame attention, (2) subsample global attention by subsampling K/V over patch tokens with diagonal preservation and mean-fill component.

Result: Achieved 8-10× speedup in inference time while matching or slightly improving accuracy of original models. Method remains robust even in extremely dense multi-view settings where prior sparse-attention baselines fail.

Conclusion: Systematic analysis of global attention roles enables effective training-free acceleration strategy that significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining performance, offering practical solution for efficient multi-view 3D reasoning.

Abstract: Since DUSt3R, models such as VGGT and $π^3$ have shown strong multi-view 3D performance, but their heavy reliance on global self-attention results in high computational cost. Existing sparse-attention variants offer partial speedups, yet lack a systematic analysis of how global attention contributes to multi-view reasoning. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth investigation of the global attention modules in VGGT and $π^3$ to better understand their roles. Our analysis reveals a clear division of roles in the alternating global-frame architecture: early global layers do not form meaningful correspondences, middle layers perform cross-view alignment, and last layers provide only minor refinements. Guided by these findings, we propose a training-free two-step acceleration scheme: (1) converting early global layers into frame attention, and (2) subsampling global attention by subsampling K/V over patch tokens with diagonal preservation and a mean-fill component. We instantiate this strategy on VGGT and $π^3$ and evaluate across standard pose and point-map benchmarks. Our method achieves up to $8$-$10\times$ speedup in inference time while matching or slightly improving the accuracy of the original models, and remains robust even in extremely dense multi-view settings where prior sparse-attention baselines fail.

TL;DR: OmniPerson is a unified identity-preserving pedestrian generation pipeline for visible/infrared image/video ReID tasks that offers holistic control over pedestrian attributes and maintains identity consistency for effective dataset augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Person re-identification suffers from limited high-quality training data due to privacy concerns and annotation costs. Existing pedestrian generation methods fail to ensure identity consistency and lack sufficient controllability, limiting their effectiveness for dataset augmentation.

Method: 1) OmniPerson unified generation model with holistic control over pedestrian attributes, supporting RGB/IR modality image/video generation with multi-reference inputs, poses, and text. 2) Multi-Refer Fuser for robust identity preservation from any number of reference images. 3) PersonSyn dataset and automated curation pipeline transforming public ReID benchmarks into richly annotated resources.

Result: OmniPerson achieves state-of-the-art in pedestrian generation, excelling in visual fidelity and identity consistency. Augmenting existing datasets with generated data consistently improves ReID model performance.

Conclusion: OmniPerson provides an effective solution for generating high-quality, identity-consistent pedestrian data for ReID tasks, addressing data scarcity issues while maintaining controllability across multiple modalities and attributes.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) suffers from a lack of large-scale high-quality training data due to challenges in data privacy and annotation costs. While previous approaches have explored pedestrian generation for data augmentation, they often fail to ensure identity consistency and suffer from insufficient controllability, thereby limiting their effectiveness in dataset augmentation. To address this, We introduce OmniPerson, the first unified identity-preserving pedestrian generation pipeline for visible/infrared image/video ReID tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1) We proposed OmniPerson, a unified generation model, offering holistic and fine-grained control over all key pedestrian attributes. Supporting RGB/IR modality image/video generation with any number of reference images, two kinds of person poses, and text. Also including RGB-to-IR transfer and image super-resolution abilities.2) We designed Multi-Refer Fuser for robust identity preservation with any number of reference images as input, making OmniPerson could distill a unified identity from a set of multi-view reference images, ensuring our generated pedestrians achieve high-fidelity pedestrian generation.3) We introduce PersonSyn, the first large-scale dataset for multi-reference, controllable pedestrian generation, and present its automated curation pipeline which transforms public, ID-only ReID benchmarks into a richly annotated resource with the dense, multi-modal supervision required for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniPerson achieves SoTA in pedestrian generation, excelling in both visual fidelity and identity consistency. Furthermore, augmenting existing datasets with our generated data consistently improves the performance of ReID models. We will open-source the full codebase, pretrained model, and the PersonSyn dataset.

TL;DR: Panel2Patch: A biomedical vision-language pretraining pipeline that extracts hierarchical supervision from scientific figures by parsing layouts, panels, and markers into multi-granular vision-language pairs, enabling better performance with less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current biomedical vision-language pretraining compresses scientific figures and text into coarse figure-level pairs, discarding fine-grained correspondences that clinicians actually use when examining local structures. This loses important hierarchical information present in multi-panel, marker-heavy figures.

Method: Panel2Patch parses scientific figures and captions to extract layouts, panels, and visual markers, then constructs hierarchical aligned vision-language pairs at figure, panel, and patch levels. This creates multi-granular supervision preserving local semantics. A granularity-aware pretraining strategy unifies heterogeneous objectives from coarse descriptions to fine region-focused phrases.

Result: By applying Panel2Patch to only a small set of literature figures, the pipeline extracts far more effective supervision than prior approaches, enabling substantially better performance with less pretraining data compared to existing biomedical vision-language models.

Conclusion: Panel2Patch addresses the limitation of coarse figure-level pretraining by mining hierarchical structure from biomedical literature, providing multi-granular supervision that better captures the fine-grained correspondences clinicians use, leading to more robust biomedical vision-language representations with less data.

Abstract: There is a growing interest in developing strong biomedical vision-language models. A popular approach to achieve robust representations is to use web-scale scientific data. However, current biomedical vision-language pretraining typically compresses rich scientific figures and text into coarse figure-level pairs, discarding the fine-grained correspondences that clinicians actually rely on when zooming into local structures. To tackle this issue, we introduce Panel2Patch, a novel data pipeline that mines hierarchical structure from existing biomedical scientific literature, i.e., multi-panel, marker-heavy figures and their surrounding text, and converts them into multi-granular supervision. Given scientific figures and captions, Panel2Patch parses layouts, panels, and visual markers, then constructs hierarchical aligned vision-language pairs at the figure, panel, and patch levels, preserving local semantics instead of treating each figure as a single data sample. Built on this hierarchical corpus, we develop a granularity-aware pretraining strategy that unifies heterogeneous objectives from coarse didactic descriptions to fine region-focused phrases. By applying Panel2Patch to only a small set of the literature figures, we extract far more effective supervision than prior pipelines, enabling substantially better performance with less pretraining data.

TL;DR: DF-Mamba: A deformable state scanning Mamba framework for 3D hand pose estimation that captures global context to handle severe occlusions in hand interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D hand pose estimation methods struggle with severe occlusions (like overlapping hands) due to limited global context modeling in CNN-based feature extraction, particularly ResNet's inductive bias.

Method: Proposes Deformable Mamba (DF-Mamba) using state space modeling with deformable state scanning to aggregate local features while selectively preserving global context cues beyond standard convolution.

Result: Outperforms latest image backbones (VMamba, Spatial-Mamba) on all five divergent datasets covering single/two-hand scenarios, hand-object interactions, and RGB/depth-based estimation, with ResNet-50 comparable inference speed.

Conclusion: DF-Mamba effectively addresses occlusion challenges in 3D hand pose estimation by capturing global context through selective state modeling and deformable scanning, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Modeling daily hand interactions often struggles with severe occlusions, such as when two hands overlap, which highlights the need for robust feature learning in 3D hand pose estimation (HPE). To handle such occluded hand images, it is vital to effectively learn the relationship between local image features (e.g., for occluded joints) and global context (e.g., cues from inter-joints, inter-hands, or the scene). However, most current 3D HPE methods still rely on ResNet for feature extraction, and such CNN's inductive bias may not be optimal for 3D HPE due to its limited capability to model the global context. To address this limitation, we propose an effective and efficient framework for visual feature extraction in 3D HPE using recent state space modeling (i.e., Mamba), dubbed Deformable Mamba (DF-Mamba). DF-Mamba is designed to capture global context cues beyond standard convolution through Mamba's selective state modeling and the proposed deformable state scanning. Specifically, for local features after convolution, our deformable scanning aggregates these features within an image while selectively preserving useful cues that represent the global context. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of structured 3D HPE, with comparable inference speed to ResNet-50. Our experiments involve extensive evaluations on five divergent datasets including single-hand and two-hand scenarios, hand-only and hand-object interactions, as well as RGB and depth-based estimation. DF-Mamba outperforms the latest image backbones, including VMamba and Spatial-Mamba, on all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a diffusion-based framework for generating synchronized co-speech gestures using audio features and motion graph retrieval with seamless stitching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using motion graphs with one-to-one audio-motion mapping are suboptimal for the many-to-many nature of audio-gesture relationships, limiting synchronization and naturalness.

Method: 1) Diffusion model learns joint audio-motion distribution using low/high-level audio features; 2) Motion-based retrieval algorithm finds optimal path in graph using global/local similarity; 3) Seamless stitching of discontinuous motion segments.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements over prior approaches in synchronization accuracy and gesture naturalness.

Conclusion: The proposed diffusion-based framework with multi-level audio features and motion graph retrieval effectively addresses the many-to-many audio-gesture mapping problem, producing more synchronized and natural co-speech gestures.

Abstract: Synthesizing synchronized and natural co-speech gesture videos remains a formidable challenge. Recent approaches have leveraged motion graphs to harness the potential of existing video data. To retrieve an appropriate trajectory from the graph, previous methods either utilize the distance between features extracted from the input audio and those associated with the motions in the graph or embed both the input audio and motion into a shared feature space. However, these techniques may not be optimal due to the many-to-many mapping nature between audio and gestures, which cannot be adequately addressed by one-to-one mapping. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel framework that initially employs a diffusion model to generate gesture motions. The diffusion model implicitly learns the joint distribution of audio and motion, enabling the generation of contextually appropriate gestures from input audio sequences. Furthermore, our method extracts both low-level and high-level features from the input audio to enrich the training process of the diffusion model. Subsequently, a meticulously designed motion-based retrieval algorithm is applied to identify the most suitable path within the graph by assessing both global and local similarities in motion. Given that not all nodes in the retrieved path are sequentially continuous, the final step involves seamlessly stitching together these segments to produce a coherent video output. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of our proposed method, demonstrating a significant improvement over prior approaches in terms of synchronization accuracy and naturalness of generated gestures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with multimodal fusion and understanding nuanced hateful content in increasingly complex video platforms.

Method: Proposes RAMF with Local-Global Context Fusion (LGCF) for multi-scale features, Semantic Cross Attention (SCA) for fine-grained multimodal interaction, and adversarial reasoning using vision-language models to generate objective descriptions and hate/non-hate inferences.

Result: Achieves 3% improvement in Macro-F1 and 7% improvement in hate class recall over state-of-the-art methods on two real-world hateful video datasets.

Conclusion: RAMF effectively addresses multimodal fusion challenges and nuanced hate speech understanding, demonstrating robust generalization performance for video hate speech detection.

Abstract: Hate speech in online videos is posing an increasingly serious threat to digital platforms, especially as video content becomes increasingly multimodal and context-dependent. Existing methods often struggle to effectively fuse the complex semantic relationships between modalities and lack the ability to understand nuanced hateful content. To address these issues, we propose an innovative Reasoning-Aware Multimodal Fusion (RAMF) framework. To tackle the first challenge, we design Local-Global Context Fusion (LGCF) to capture both local salient cues and global temporal structures, and propose Semantic Cross Attention (SCA) to enable fine-grained multimodal semantic interaction. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce adversarial reasoning-a structured three-stage process where a vision-language model generates (i) objective descriptions, (ii) hate-assumed inferences, and (iii) non-hate-assumed inferences-providing complementary semantic perspectives that enrich the model's contextual understanding of nuanced hateful intent. Evaluations on two real-world hateful video datasets demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalisation performance, improving upon state-of-the-art methods by 3% and 7% in Macro-F1 and hate class recall, respectively. We will release the code after the anonymity period ends.

*Panagiotis Papantonakis,Georgios Kopanas,Fredo Durand,George Drettakis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Texture-mapped Gaussian Splatting that adaptively adjusts texture resolution to represent detailed appearance more efficiently than using many small Gaussian primitives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Gaussian Splatting methods waste resources by representing fine appearance details as numerous small Gaussian primitives, especially when geometry and appearance have different frequency characteristics. Texture mapping offers a more efficient way to represent detailed appearance.

Method: Proposes a new appearance representation using per-primitive texture maps with adaptive resolution. Texture texel size is bounded by image sampling frequency and adapts to input image content through adaptive upscaling/downscaling during optimization. Also enables control of primitive count based on texture resolution.

Result: The approach performs favorably in image quality while using fewer total parameters compared to alternative textured Gaussian primitive solutions.

Conclusion: Texture mapping can be effectively integrated into Gaussian Splatting optimization to represent detailed appearance more efficiently, reducing parameter count while maintaining image quality.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has become the method of choice for 3D reconstruction and real-time rendering of captured real scenes. However, fine appearance details need to be represented as a large number of small Gaussian primitives, which can be wasteful when geometry and appearance exhibit different frequency characteristics.
  Inspired by the long tradition of texture mapping, we propose to use texture to represent detailed appearance where possible. Our main focus is to incorporate per-primitive texture maps that adapt to the scene in a principled manner during Gaussian Splatting optimization. We do this by proposing a new appearance representation for 2D Gaussian primitives with textures where the size of a texel is bounded by the image sampling frequency and adapted to the content of the input images. We achieve this by adaptively upscaling or downscaling the texture resolution during optimization. In addition, our approach enables control of the number of primitives during optimization based on texture resolution. We show that our approach performs favorably in image quality and total number of parameters used compared to alternative solutions for textured Gaussian primitives.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RULER-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating reasoning capabilities of video generation models, focusing on cognitive rules rather than just visual quality, showing current models achieve only 48.87% rule coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation benchmarks focus on visual perception (aesthetics, instruction adherence, temporal coherence) but neglect rule-based reasoning capabilities. Recent studies lack fine-grained decomposition of reasoning abilities and comprehensive evaluation protocols.

Method: Built RULER-Bench covering 40 tasks across 6 rule categories with 622 annotated instances. Uses text-to-video and image-to-video paradigms. Evaluates generated videos with 4-metric checklist and GPT-o3 scoring (85% alignment with human judgments).

Result: State-of-the-art video generation models achieve only 48.87% on rule coherence metric, revealing significant room for improvement in reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: RULER-Bench provides insights to advance reasoning-aware video generation, moving video models toward vision foundation intelligence by addressing current limitations in rule-based reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have enabled the synthesis of videos with strong temporal consistency and impressive visual quality, marking a crucial step toward vision foundation models. To evaluate these video generation models, existing benchmarks primarily focus on factors related to visual perception and understanding, like visual aesthetics, instruction adherence, and temporal coherence. However, the rule-based reasoning capabilities of video generation models remain largely unexplored. Although recent studies have carried out preliminary explorations into whether video models can serve as zero-shot learners, they still lack a fine-grained decomposition of reasoning capabilities and a comprehensive evaluation protocol. To address this gap, we introduce RULER-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning ability of video generation models from the perspective of cognitive rules. Built upon two fundamental paradigms: text-to-video and image-to-video, RULER-Bench covers 40 representative tasks spanning six rule categories with 622 high-quality annotated instances. For the evaluation of each generated video, we construct a checklist covering four metrics and leverage GPT-o3 to assign scores to each question, achieving 85% alignment with human judgements. Extensive experiments show that the state-of-the-art model achieves only 48.87% on the rule coherence metric, highlighting significant room for improvement in the reasoning capability of next-level video models. We expect that the insight obtained from RULER-Bench will facilitate further development of reasoning-aware video generation, advancing video generation models toward vision foundation intelligence.

*Mohamed Awad,Mahmoud Akrm,Walid Gomaa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adversarial training paradoxically increases transferability of adversarial attacks, creating ecosystem risks despite improving model robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While adversarial training improves model robustness against attacks, its effect on attack transferability remains underexplored, raising concerns about potential unintended consequences.

Method: Trained 36 diverse models (CNNs and ViTs), conducted comprehensive transferability experiments, and analyzed how adversarial training affects attack transferability across models.

Result: Adversarially trained models paradoxically produce perturbations that transfer more effectively than standard models, introducing new ecosystem risks despite improving robustness.

Conclusion: Robustness evaluations should assess both resistance to transferred attacks and propensity to produce transferable adversarial examples; all models, code, and scripts released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved great success in computer vision, but remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Adversarial training is the leading defense designed to improve model robustness. However, its effect on the transferability of attacks is underexplored. In this work, we ask whether adversarial training unintentionally increases the transferability of adversarial examples. To answer this, we trained a diverse zoo of 36 models, including CNNs and ViTs, and conducted comprehensive transferability experiments. Our results reveal a clear paradox: adversarially trained (AT) models produce perturbations that transfer more effectively than those from standard models, which introduce a new ecosystem risk. To enable reproducibility and further study, we release all models, code, and experimental scripts. Furthermore, we argue that robustness evaluations should assess not only the resistance of a model to transferred attacks but also its propensity to produce transferable adversarial examples.

TL;DR: PPTBench is a comprehensive multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs on PowerPoint-related tasks, revealing that current models struggle with visual-layout reasoning despite good semantic understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PowerPoint presentations combine rich text with structured visual layouts, making them ideal for testing multimodal reasoning, but existing benchmarks overlook layout-centric challenges central to real-world slide creation and editing.

Method: Introduced PPTBench using 958 PPTX files, evaluating models across 4 categories (Detection, Understanding, Modification, Generation) with 4,439 samples, analyzing visual-layout reasoning and JSON-based layout structure integration.

Result: Revealed substantial gap between semantic understanding and visual-layout reasoning - models interpret content well but fail at coherent spatial arrangements, struggle with visual cues and JSON layouts, and make systematic layout errors like misalignment and overlap.

Conclusion: PPTBench provides new perspective for evaluating VLLMs in PPT scenarios, highlighting challenges in visual-structural reasoning and coherent slide generation, with datasets and code released for reproducibility and future research.

Abstract: PowerPoint presentations combine rich textual content with structured visual layouts, making them a natural testbed for evaluating the multimodal reasoning and layout understanding abilities of modern MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks focus solely on narrow subtasks while overlooking layout-centric challenges, which are central to real-world slide creation and editing. To bridge this gap, we introduce PPTBench, a comprehensive multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs on PowerPoint-related tasks. Leveraging a diverse source of 958 PPTX files, PPTBench evaluates models across four categories with 4,439 samples, including Detection, Understanding, Modification, and Generation. Our experiments reveal a substantial gap between semantic understanding and visual-layout reasoning in current MLLMs: models can interpret slide content but fail to produce coherent spatial arrangements. Ablation and further analysis show that current MLLMs struggle to combine visual cues with JSON-based layout structures and fail to integrate visual information into their API planning ability. And case studies visually expose systematic layout errors such as misalignment and element overlap. These findings provides a new perspective on evaluating VLLMs in PPT scenarios, highlighting challenges and directions for future research on visual-structural reasoning and coherent slide generation. All datasets and code are fully released to support reproducibility and future research.

TL;DR: Proposes a foundation model pretraining strategy using large-scale simulated datasets to improve generalization in remote sensing image fusion across different satellite sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for remote sensing image fusion suffer from poor generalization to unseen datasets due to limited real training data and domain gaps between different satellite sensors.

Method: Constructs diverse simulated datasets by applying degradation operations and augmentations to natural and remote sensing images, then pretrains fusion models on these simulated data to learn robust spatial-spectral representations. Evaluates using zero-shot and one-shot paradigms with full/freeze-tuning approaches across six satellite datasets.

Result: Pretraining strategy significantly improves generalization performance across different satellite sensors and imaging conditions for various network architectures (CNN, Transformer, Mamba). Models achieve superior zero-shot results and show remarkable adaptation capability with minimal real data in one-shot settings.

Conclusion: Provides a practical solution for cross-domain pansharpening, establishes a new benchmark for generalization in remote sensing image fusion, and paves the way for leveraging foundation models through advanced training strategies.

Abstract: Existing deep learning methods for remote sensing image fusion often suffer from poor generalization when applied to unseen datasets due to the limited availability of real training data and the domain gap between different satellite sensors. To address this challenge, we explore the potential of foundation models by proposing a novel pretraining strategy that leverages large-scale simulated datasets to learn robust spatial-spectral priors. Specifically, our approach first constructs diverse simulated datasets by applying various degradation operations (blur, noise, downsampling) and augmentations (bands generation, channel shuffling, high-pass filtering, color jittering, etc.) to natural images from ImageNet and remote sensing images from SkyScript. We then pretrain fusion models on these simulated data to learn generalizable spatial-spectral representations. The pretrained models are subsequently evaluated on six datasets (WorldView-2/3/4, IKONOS, QuickBird, GaoFen-2) using zero-shot and one-shot paradigms, with both full- and freeze-tuning approaches for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on different network architectures including convolutional neural networks, Transformer, and Mamba demonstrate that our pretraining strategy significantly improves generalization performance across different satellite sensors and imaging conditions for various fusion models. The pretrained models achieve superior results in zero-shot scenarios and show remarkable adaptation capability with minimal real data in one-shot settings. Our work provides a practical solution for cross-domain pansharpening, establishes a new benchmark for generalization in remote sensing image fusion tasks, and paves the way for leveraging foundation models through advanced training strategies.

*Yifan Li,Yingda Yin,Lingting Zhu,Weikai Chen,Shengju Qian,Xin Wang,Yanwei Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReVSeg introduces explicit multi-step reasoning for video object segmentation using pretrained VLMs with reinforcement learning optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video object segmentation methods collapse complex reasoning about dynamics, causality, and temporal interactions into opaque latent embeddings, making the reasoning chain intractable and uninterpretable.

Method: ReVSeg decomposes reasoning into three explicit sequential operations: semantics interpretation, temporal evidence selection, and spatial grounding, using pretrained VLMs. It employs reinforcement learning to optimize the multi-step reasoning chain for self-refinement.

Result: ReVSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard video object segmentation benchmarks and produces interpretable reasoning trajectories.

Conclusion: Explicit decomposition of reasoning into sequential operations with reinforcement learning optimization enables both superior performance and interpretability in complex video object segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Reasoning-centric video object segmentation is an inherently complex task: the query often refers to dynamics, causality, and temporal interactions, rather than static appearances. Yet existing solutions generally collapse these factors into simplified reasoning with latent embeddings, rendering the reasoning chain opaque and essentially intractable. We therefore adopt an explicit decomposition perspective and introduce ReVSeg, which executes reasoning as sequential decisions in the native interface of pretrained vision language models (VLMs). Rather than folding all reasoning into a single-step prediction, ReVSeg executes three explicit operations -- semantics interpretation, temporal evidence selection, and spatial grounding -- aligning pretrained capabilities. We further employ reinforcement learning to optimize the multi-step reasoning chain, enabling the model to self-refine its decision quality from outcome-driven signals. Experimental results demonstrate that ReVSeg attains state-of-the-art performances on standard video object segmentation benchmarks and yields interpretable reasoning trajectories.

*Junwon Lee,Juhan Nam,Jiyoung Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SelVA is a text-conditioned selective video-to-audio generation model that produces only user-intended sounds from multi-object videos, enabling precise audio editing by treating text prompts as explicit source selectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current V2A approaches generate single source-mixed sounds at once, making precise audio editing difficult. Multimedia production requires individual audio tracks for each sound source for editing, mixing, and creative control, but visual features are entangled and region cues often fail to specify sources.

Method: SelVA treats text prompts as explicit source selectors and modulates video encoder to extract prompt-relevant features. It uses supplementary tokens to suppress text-irrelevant activations via cross-attention with efficient parameter tuning. The model employs self-augmentation to overcome lack of mono audio track supervision.

Result: Evaluated on VGG-MONOAUDIO benchmark, SelVA shows effectiveness across audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization. Extensive experiments and ablations consistently verify its performance.

Conclusion: SelVA successfully addresses the selective V2A generation task, enabling precise audio source selection from multi-object videos through text conditioning, with applications in multimedia production where individual audio track handling is crucial.

Abstract: This work introduces a new task, text-conditioned selective video-to-audio (V2A) generation, which produces only the user-intended sound from a multi-object video. This capability is especially crucial in multimedia production, where audio tracks are handled individually for each sound source for precise editing, mixing, and creative control. However, current approaches generate single source-mixed sounds at once, largely because visual features are entangled, and region cues or prompts often fail to specify the source. We propose SelVA, a novel text-conditioned V2A model that treats the text prompt as an explicit selector of target source and modulates video encoder to distinctly extract prompt-relevant video features. The proposed supplementary tokens promote cross-attention by suppressing text-irrelevant activations with efficient parameter tuning, yielding robust semantic and temporal grounding. SelVA further employs a self-augmentation scheme to overcome the lack of mono audio track supervision. We evaluate SelVA on VGG-MONOAUDIO, a curated benchmark of clean single-source videos for such a task. Extensive experiments and ablations consistently verify its effectiveness across audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization.

*Fan Yang,Kaihao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MRD is a training-free framework that improves high-resolution image understanding in MLLMs by using multi-resolution semantic fusion and open-vocabulary detection to address fragmentation issues in crop-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current crop-based approaches for high-resolution image understanding in MLLMs fragment objects across multiple crops, disrupting semantic similarity computation and object integrity. Different sized objects are better handled at different resolutions.

Method: Proposes Multi-resolution Retrieval-Detection (MRD) with: 1) Multi-resolution semantic fusion that integrates semantic similarity maps from different resolutions to preserve object integrity, and 2) Open-vocabulary object detection using sliding-window approach for direct object localization at global scale.

Result: Experiments on high-resolution image understanding benchmarks with different MLLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MRD framework.

Conclusion: MRD provides a training-free solution that addresses fragmentation issues in high-resolution image understanding by combining multi-resolution semantic fusion with open-vocabulary detection, improving object localization and semantic understanding.

Abstract: Understanding high-resolution images remains a significant challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Recent study address this issue by dividing the image into smaller crops and computing the semantic similarity between each crop and a query using a pretrained retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model. The most relevant crops are then selected to localize the target object and suppress irrelevant information. However, such crop-based processing can fragment complete objects across multiple crops, thereby disrupting the computation of semantic similarity. In our experiments, we find that image crops of objects with different sizes are better handled at different resolutions. Based on this observation, we propose Multi-resolution Retrieval-Detection (MRD), a training-free framework for high-resolution image understanding. To address the issue of semantic similarity bias caused by objects being split across different image crops, we propose a multi-resolution semantic fusion method, which integrates semantic similarity maps obtained at different resolutions to produce more accurate semantic information and preserve the integrity of target objects. Furthermore, to achieve direct localization of target objects at a global scale, we introduce an open-vocalbulary object detection (OVD) model that identifies object regions using a sliding-window approach.Experiments on high-resolution image understanding benchmarks using different MLLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid system combines ColPali's visual patch similarity with OCR spatial coordinates to retrieve precise document regions instead of entire pages, improving RAG context precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs like ColPali retrieve entire pages but lack precision for RAG, while OCR systems have spatial coordinates but lack semantic relevance assessment. Need to combine strengths of both approaches.

Method: Unify ColPali's patch-level similarity scores with OCR-extracted regions by formalizing coordinate mapping between vision transformer patch grids and OCR bounding boxes, using intersection metrics for relevance propagation.

Result: Theoretical bounds on retrieval precision established; approach works at inference time without additional training; Snappy implementation released as open-source.

Conclusion: Hybrid architecture successfully combines visual semantic relevance with OCR spatial precision for more accurate region-level document retrieval in RAG applications.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like ColPali achieve state-of-the-art document retrieval by embedding pages as images and computing fine-grained similarity between query tokens and visual patches. However, they return entire pages rather than specific regions, limiting utility for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where precise context is paramount. Conversely, OCR-based systems extract structured text with bounding box coordinates but lack semantic grounding for relevance assessment. We propose a hybrid architecture that unifies these paradigms: using ColPali's patch-level similarity scores as spatial relevance filters over OCR-extracted regions. We formalize the coordinate mapping between vision transformer patch grids and OCR bounding boxes, introduce intersection metrics for relevance propagation, and establish theoretical bounds on retrieval precision. Our approach operates at inference time without additional training. We release Snappy, an open-source implementation demonstrating practical applicability, with empirical evaluation ongoing.

TL;DR: EGGS combines 2D and 3D Gaussian splatting to achieve better balance between appearance quality and geometric accuracy in novel view synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting has high appearance fidelity but suffers from multi-view inconsistencies, while 2D Gaussian Splatting enforces multi-view consistency but compromises texture details. There's a need to balance both appearance and geometry.

Method: Proposes Exchangeable Gaussian Splatting (EGGS) with three key components: Hybrid Gaussian Rasterization for unified rendering, Adaptive Type Exchange for dynamic adaptation between 2D and 3D Gaussians, and Frequency-Decoupled Optimization to exploit strengths of each representation.

Result: Extensive experiments show EGGS outperforms existing methods in rendering quality, geometric accuracy, and efficiency, providing a practical solution for high-quality novel view synthesis.

Conclusion: EGGS successfully balances appearance and geometry through hybrid 2D/3D Gaussian representation, achieving superior performance in novel view synthesis with efficient CUDA-accelerated implementation.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) is crucial in computer vision and graphics, with wide applications in AR, VR, and autonomous driving. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering with high appearance fidelity, it suffers from multi-view inconsistencies, limiting geometric accuracy. In contrast, 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) enforces multi-view consistency but compromises texture details. To address these limitations, we propose Exchangeable Gaussian Splatting (EGGS), a hybrid representation that integrates 2D and 3D Gaussians to balance appearance and geometry. To achieve this, we introduce Hybrid Gaussian Rasterization for unified rendering, Adaptive Type Exchange for dynamic adaptation between 2D and 3D Gaussians, and Frequency-Decoupled Optimization that effectively exploits the strengths of each type of Gaussian representation. Our CUDA-accelerated implementation ensures efficient training and inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EGGS outperforms existing methods in rendering quality, geometric accuracy, and efficiency, providing a practical solution for high-quality NVS.

TL;DR: PolarGuide-GSDR integrates polarization cues with 3D Gaussian Splatting for real-time, high-fidelity reconstruction of specular scenes without environment maps or restrictive material assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like Polarization-aware NeRF have slow training/rendering and depend on material/viewpoint assumptions, while 3DGS struggles with reflection-geometry entanglement and environment map dependence.

Method: Proposes a polarization-forward-guided paradigm with bidirectional coupling: uses 3DGS geometric priors to resolve polarization ambiguity, then refined polarization cues guide 3DGS's normal and spherical harmonic representation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in specular reconstruction, normal estimation, and novel view synthesis on public and self-collected datasets while maintaining real-time rendering capabilities.

Conclusion: First framework embedding polarization priors directly into 3DGS optimization, yielding superior interpretability and real-time performance for modeling complex reflective scenes.

Abstract: Polarization-aware Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) enable novel view synthesis of specular-reflection scenes but face challenges in slow training, inefficient rendering, and strong dependencies on material/viewpoint assumptions. However, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering yet struggles with accurate reflection reconstruction from reflection-geometry entanglement, adding a deferred reflection module introduces environment map dependence. We address these limitations by proposing PolarGuide-GSDR, a polarization-forward-guided paradigm establishing a bidirectional coupling mechanism between polarization and 3DGS: first 3DGS's geometric priors are leveraged to resolve polarization ambiguity, and then the refined polarization information cues are used to guide 3DGS's normal and spherical harmonic representation. This process achieves high-fidelity reflection separation and full-scene reconstruction without requiring environment maps or restrictive material assumptions. We demonstrate on public and self-collected datasets that PolarGuide-GSDR achieves state-of-the-art performance in specular reconstruction, normal estimation, and novel view synthesis, all while maintaining real-time rendering capabilities. To our knowledge, this is the first framework embedding polarization priors directly into 3DGS optimization, yielding superior interpretability and real-time performance for modeling complex reflective scenes.

Conclusion: VideoScience-Bench is the first benchmark to evaluate video models as scientific reasoners, requiring generations to demonstrate understanding consistent with expected physical and chemical phenomena.

Abstract: The next frontier for video generation lies in developing models capable of zero-shot reasoning, where understanding real-world scientific laws is crucial for accurate physical outcome modeling under diverse conditions. However, existing video benchmarks are physical commonsense-based, offering limited insight into video models' scientific reasoning capability. We introduce VideoScience-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate undergraduate-level scientific understanding in video models.

The benchmark comprises 200 carefully curated prompts spanning 14 topics and 103 concepts in physics and chemistry. We conduct expert-annotated evaluations across seven state-of-the-art video models in T2V and I2V settings along five dimensions: Prompt Consistency, Phenomenon Congruency, Correct Dynamism, Immutability, and Spatio-Temporal Continuity. Using a VLM-as-a-Judge to assess video generations, we observe strong correlation with human assessments.

Motivation: Current Anti-UAV tracking lacks a unified framework for cross-modal collaboration, with existing approaches focusing on independent models for individual tasks and struggling with effective multimodal data fusion.

Method: Proposes UAUTrack, a single-stream, single-stage, end-to-end architecture with a text prior prompt strategy that directs the model to focus on UAVs across various scenarios.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Anti-UAV and DUT Anti-UAV datasets, and maintains favorable accuracy-speed trade-off on Anti-UAV410 dataset.

Conclusion: UAUTrack demonstrates both high accuracy and practical efficiency across diverse Anti-UAV scenarios, providing an effective unified framework for cross-modal collaboration in UAV tracking.

Abstract: Research in Anti-UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) tracking has explored various modalities, including RGB, TIR, and RGB-T fusion. However, a unified framework for cross-modal collaboration is still lacking. Existing approaches have primarily focused on independent models for individual tasks, often overlooking the potential for cross-modal information sharing. Furthermore, Anti-UAV tracking techniques are still in their infancy, with current solutions struggling to achieve effective multimodal data fusion. To address these challenges, we propose UAUTrack, a unified single-target tracking framework built upon a single-stream, single-stage, end-to-end architecture that effectively integrates multiple modalities. UAUTrack introduces a key component: a text prior prompt strategy that directs the model to focus on UAVs across various scenarios. Experimental results show that UAUTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Anti-UAV and DUT Anti-UAV datasets, and maintains a favourable trade-off between accuracy and speed on the Anti-UAV410 dataset, demonstrating both high accuracy and practical efficiency across diverse Anti-UAV scenarios.

*Sagi Polaczek,Or Patashnik,Ali Mahdavi-Amiri,Daniel Cohen-Or*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sync-LoRA: A method for editing portrait videos that maintains frame-accurate synchronization while allowing diverse visual modifications by training an in-context LoRA on synchronized video pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Portrait video editing requires flexible control over modifications while preserving the subject's original temporal behavior and maintaining frame-accurate synchronization between edited and source frames.

Method: Uses image-to-video diffusion model where edit is defined by modifying first frame and propagated to entire sequence. Trains in-context LoRA on automatically generated paired videos showing identical motion trajectories but different appearances, filtered for temporal alignment.

Result: Achieves high visual fidelity and strong temporal coherence, generalizing to unseen identities and diverse edits (appearance changes, object addition, background changes) while robustly handling pose and expression variations.

Conclusion: Sync-LoRA demonstrates robust balance between edit fidelity and precise motion preservation, enabling high-quality portrait video editing with frame-accurate synchronization.

Abstract: Editing portrait videos is a challenging task that requires flexible yet precise control over a wide range of modifications, such as appearance changes, expression edits, or the addition of objects. The key difficulty lies in preserving the subject's original temporal behavior, demanding that every edited frame remains precisely synchronized with the corresponding source frame. We present Sync-LoRA, a method for editing portrait videos that achieves high-quality visual modifications while maintaining frame-accurate synchronization and identity consistency. Our approach uses an image-to-video diffusion model, where the edit is defined by modifying the first frame and then propagated to the entire sequence. To enable accurate synchronization, we train an in-context LoRA using paired videos that depict identical motion trajectories but differ in appearance. These pairs are automatically generated and curated through a synchronization-based filtering process that selects only the most temporally aligned examples for training. This training setup teaches the model to combine motion cues from the source video with the visual changes introduced in the edited first frame. Trained on a compact, highly curated set of synchronized human portraits, Sync-LoRA generalizes to unseen identities and diverse edits (e.g., modifying appearance, adding objects, or changing backgrounds), robustly handling variations in pose and expression. Our results demonstrate high visual fidelity and strong temporal coherence, achieving a robust balance between edit fidelity and precise motion preservation.

*Zhongbao Yang,Jiangxin Dong,Yazhou Yao,Jinhui Tang,Jinshan Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PGP-DiffSR is a lightweight diffusion method for image super-resolution that reduces computational costs by pruning redundant blocks and using phase information guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based super-resolution models rely on large backbones like SDXL and DiT, which cause excessive computational and memory costs during training and inference.

Method: Progressive pruning removes intra-block redundancy while preserving restoration capability, plus a phase-exchange adapter module that uses input phase information to guide the pruned diffusion model for better performance.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method achieves competitive restoration quality while significantly reducing computational load and memory consumption.

Conclusion: PGP-DiffSR provides an efficient diffusion-based super-resolution solution that maintains performance while dramatically reducing resource requirements.

Abstract: Although diffusion-based models have achieved impressive results in image super-resolution, they often rely on large-scale backbones such as Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) and Diffusion Transformers (DiT), which lead to excessive computational and memory costs during training and inference. To address this issue, we develop a lightweight diffusion method, PGP-DiffSR, by removing redundant information from diffusion models under the guidance of the phase information of inputs for efficient image super-resolution. We first identify the intra-block redundancy within the diffusion backbone and propose a progressive pruning approach that removes redundant blocks while reserving restoration capability. We note that the phase information of the restored images produced by the pruned diffusion model is not well estimated. To solve this problem, we propose a phase-exchange adapter module that explores the phase information of the inputs to guide the pruned diffusion model for better restoration performance. We formulate the progressive pruning approach and the phase-exchange adapter module into a unified model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive restoration quality while significantly reducing computational load and memory consumption.

*Mengchen Zhang,Qi Chen,Tong Wu,Zihan Liu,Dahua Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViSAudio is an end-to-end framework for generating binaural spatial audio directly from silent video, outperforming existing methods by eliminating the two-stage pipeline and achieving better spatio-temporal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-to-audio generation focuses on mono output, lacking spatial immersion. Existing binaural approaches use a two-stage pipeline (mono generation then spatialization) that causes error accumulation and spatio-temporal inconsistencies.

Method: Proposes ViSAudio: an end-to-end framework using conditional flow matching with a dual-branch audio generation architecture. Two dedicated branches model audio latent flows, integrated with a conditional spacetime module to balance consistency between channels while preserving spatial characteristics.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods across objective metrics and subjective evaluations. Generates high-quality binaural audio with spatial immersion that adapts to viewpoint changes, sound-source motion, and diverse acoustic environments.

Conclusion: ViSAudio successfully addresses limitations of existing binaural audio generation by introducing end-to-end training, supported by the BiAudio dataset, enabling more immersive spatial audio generation directly from video.

Abstract: Despite progress in video-to-audio generation, the field focuses predominantly on mono output, lacking spatial immersion. Existing binaural approaches remain constrained by a two-stage pipeline that first generates mono audio and then performs spatialization, often resulting in error accumulation and spatio-temporal inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of end-to-end binaural spatial audio generation directly from silent video. To support this task, we present the BiAudio dataset, comprising approximately 97K video-binaural audio pairs spanning diverse real-world scenes and camera rotation trajectories, constructed through a semi-automated pipeline. Furthermore, we propose ViSAudio, an end-to-end framework that employs conditional flow matching with a dual-branch audio generation architecture, where two dedicated branches model the audio latent flows. Integrated with a conditional spacetime module, it balances consistency between channels while preserving distinctive spatial characteristics, ensuring precise spatio-temporal alignment between audio and the input video. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ViSAudio outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, generating high-quality binaural audio with spatial immersion that adapts effectively to viewpoint changes, sound-source motion, and diverse acoustic environments.

*Huankun Sheng,Ming Li,Yixiang Wei,Yeying Fan,Yu-Hui Wen,Tieliang Gong,Yong-Jin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FASA is a two-stage foreground-aware slot attention method that explicitly separates foreground from background using dual-slot competition and pseudo-mask guidance to improve object discovery in real-world scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing slot attention methods treat foreground and background regions indiscriminately, leading to background interference and poor instance discovery performance on real-world data. There's a need for explicit foreground-background separation to enable precise object discovery.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Coarse scene decomposition with dual-slot competition to separate foreground from background using clustering-based initialization. 2) Masked slot attention where first slot captures background and remaining slots compete for foreground objects, guided by pseudo-masks from patch affinity graphs using self-supervised features.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show FASA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of explicit foreground modeling and pseudo-mask guidance for robust scene decomposition.

Conclusion: FASA demonstrates that explicit foreground modeling with pseudo-mask guidance enables more precise object discovery and object-coherent representations, addressing limitations of existing slot attention approaches for real-world scene decomposition.

Abstract: Recent advances in object-centric representation learning have shown that slot attention-based methods can effectively decompose visual scenes into object slot representations without supervision. However, existing approaches typically process foreground and background regions indiscriminately, often resulting in background interference and suboptimal instance discovery performance on real-world data. To address this limitation, we propose Foreground-Aware Slot Attention (FASA), a two-stage framework that explicitly separates foreground from background to enable precise object discovery. In the first stage, FASA performs a coarse scene decomposition to distinguish foreground from background regions through a dual-slot competition mechanism. These slots are initialized via a clustering-based strategy, yielding well-structured representations of salient regions. In the second stage, we introduce a masked slot attention mechanism where the first slot captures the background while the remaining slots compete to represent individual foreground objects. To further address over-segmentation of foreground objects, we incorporate pseudo-mask guidance derived from a patch affinity graph constructed with self-supervised image features to guide the learning of foreground slots. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FASA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of explicit foreground modeling and pseudo-mask guidance for robust scene decomposition and object-coherent representation. Code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: Video4Spatial shows video diffusion models can perform complex spatial tasks like navigation and object grounding using only visual data, without depth or pose inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether video generative models can exhibit visuospatial intelligence (central to human cognition) using only visual data, without auxiliary modalities like depth or poses.

Method: Video4Spatial framework uses video diffusion models conditioned solely on video-based scene context. Simple yet effective design choices in framework and data curation enable spatial understanding from video-only inputs.

Result: The model demonstrates strong spatial understanding: plans navigation and grounds target objects end-to-end, follows camera-pose instructions while maintaining spatial consistency, and generalizes to long contexts and out-of-domain environments.

Conclusion: These results advance video generative models toward general visuospatial reasoning, showing they can perform complex spatial tasks using only visual data.

Abstract: We investigate whether video generative models can exhibit visuospatial intelligence, a capability central to human cognition, using only visual data. To this end, we present Video4Spatial, a framework showing that video diffusion models conditioned solely on video-based scene context can perform complex spatial tasks. We validate on two tasks: scene navigation - following camera-pose instructions while remaining consistent with 3D geometry of the scene, and object grounding - which requires semantic localization, instruction following, and planning. Both tasks use video-only inputs, without auxiliary modalities such as depth or poses. With simple yet effective design choices in the framework and data curation, Video4Spatial demonstrates strong spatial understanding from video context: it plans navigation and grounds target objects end-to-end, follows camera-pose instructions while maintaining spatial consistency, and generalizes to long contexts and out-of-domain environments. Taken together, these results advance video generative models toward general visuospatial reasoning.

*Yuxing Liu,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ClimaDrive is a semantics-guided image-to-image framework for generating realistic out-of-distribution driving data with weather diversity, and ClimaOoD is a large-scale benchmark that improves anomaly segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly segmentation is crucial for safe autonomous driving, but limited anomaly data diversity constrains model generalization. Existing synthetic data generation methods lack contextual coherence and physical realism.

Method: ClimaDrive unifies structure-guided multi-weather generation with prompt-driven anomaly inpainting to create semantically coherent, weather-diverse, and physically plausible OoD driving data.

Result: Training with ClimaOoD benchmark shows robust improvements across four state-of-the-art methods: AUROC, AP, and FPR95 show notable gains, with FPR95 dropping from 3.97 to 3.52 for RbA on Fishyscapes LAF.

Conclusion: ClimaOoD enhances model robustness and offers valuable training data for better generalization in open-world anomaly detection, demonstrating the effectiveness of semantics-guided, weather-diverse synthetic data generation.

Abstract: Anomaly segmentation seeks to detect and localize unknown or out-of-distribution (OoD) objects that fall outside predefined semantic classes a capability essential for safe autonomous driving. However, the scarcity and limited diversity of anomaly data severely constrain model generalization in open-world environments. Existing approaches mitigate this issue through synthetic data generation, either by copy-pasting external objects into driving scenes or by leveraging text-to-image diffusion models to inpaint anomalous regions. While these methods improve anomaly diversity, they often lack contextual coherence and physical realism, resulting in domain gaps between synthetic and real data. In this paper, we present ClimaDrive, a semantics-guided image-to-image framework for synthesizing semantically coherent, weather-diverse, and physically plausible OoD driving data. ClimaDrive unifies structure-guided multi-weather generation with prompt-driven anomaly inpainting, enabling the creation of visually realistic training data. Based on this framework, we construct ClimaOoD, a large-scale benchmark spanning six representative driving scenarios under both clear and adverse weather conditions. Extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art methods show that training with ClimaOoD leads to robust improvements in anomaly segmentation. Across all methods, AUROC, AP, and FPR95 show notable gains, with FPR95 dropping from 3.97 to 3.52 for RbA on Fishyscapes LAF. These results demonstrate that ClimaOoD enhances model robustness, offering valuable training data for better generalization in open-world anomaly detection.

TL;DR: PPTArena is a benchmark for PowerPoint editing that evaluates reliable slide modifications via natural language instructions, while PPTPilot is a structure-aware editing agent that outperforms existing systems but still struggles with long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PowerPoint editing benchmarks focus on image-PDF renderings or text-to-slide generation, lacking evaluation of in-place editing capabilities across real slides with natural language instructions.

Method: PPTArena includes 100 decks, 2125 slides, and 800+ targeted edits covering various slide elements. It uses a dual VLM-as-judge pipeline with structural diffs and slide images. PPTPilot is a structure-aware agent that plans edit sequences, routes between programmatic tools and XML operations, and uses iterative plan-edit-check loops.

Result: PPTPilot outperforms proprietary agents and frontier VLM systems by over 10 percentage points on compound, layout-sensitive, and cross-slide edits, with particularly large gains in visual fidelity and deck-wide consistency.

Conclusion: Despite PPTPilot's improvements, existing agents still underperform on long-horizon, document-scale tasks in PPTArena, highlighting remaining challenges in reliable PowerPoint editing.

Abstract: We introduce PPTArena, a benchmark for PowerPoint editing that measures reliable modifications to real slides under natural-language instructions. In contrast to image-PDF renderings or text-to-slide generation, PPTArena focuses on in-place editing across 100 decks, 2125 slides, and over 800 targeted edits covering text, charts, tables, animations, and master-level styles. Each case includes a ground-truth deck, a fully specified target outcome, and a dual VLM-as-judge pipeline that separately scores instruction following and visual quality using both structural diffs and slide images. Building on this setting, we propose PPTPilot, a structure-aware slide-editing agent that plans semantic edit sequences, routes between high-level programmatic tools and deterministic XML operations for precise control, and verifies outputs through an iterative plan-edit-check loop against task-specific constraints. In our experiments, PPTPilot outperforms strong proprietary agents and frontier VLM systems by over 10 percentage points on compound, layout-sensitive, and cross-slide edits, with particularly large gains in visual fidelity and deck-wide consistency. Despite these improvements, existing agents still underperform on long-horizon, document-scale tasks in PPTArena, highlighting the remaining challenges in reliable PPT editing.

*Zixuan Song,Jing Zhang,Di Wang,Zidie Zhou,Wenbin Liu,Haonan Guo,En Wang,Bo Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoBridge is a foundation model for cross-view geo-localization using semantic anchors to bridge multi-view features through textual descriptions, trained on the new GeoLoc dataset of 50K+ multi-view image pairs with text descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional satellite-centric geo-localization is limited by availability of high-resolution/up-to-date satellite imagery and fails to exploit complementary cues across different views (drone, satellite, street) and modalities (language, image).

Method: Proposes GeoBridge with semantic-anchor mechanism that bridges multi-view features through textual descriptions, enabling bidirectional matching across views and language-to-image retrieval. Uses the GeoLoc dataset (50K+ drone/street/satellite image pairs with text) for pre-training.

Result: GeoLoc pre-training significantly improves geo-location accuracy for GeoBridge while promoting cross-domain generalization and cross-modal knowledge transfer. The model outperforms traditional approaches.

Conclusion: GeoBridge addresses limitations of satellite-centric geo-localization by leveraging multi-view and multi-modal data through semantic anchors, with the GeoLoc dataset enabling robust, flexible localization across diverse geographic contexts.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization infers a location by retrieving geo-tagged reference images that visually correspond to a query image. However, the traditional satellite-centric paradigm limits robustness when high-resolution or up-to-date satellite imagery is unavailable. It further underexploits complementary cues across views (e.g., drone, satellite, and street) and modalities (e.g., language and image). To address these challenges, we propose GeoBridge, a foundation model that performs bidirectional matching across views and supports language-to-image retrieval. Going beyond traditional satellite-centric formulations, GeoBridge builds on a novel semantic-anchor mechanism that bridges multi-view features through textual descriptions for robust, flexible localization. In support of this task, we construct GeoLoc, the first large-scale, cross-modal, and multi-view aligned dataset comprising over 50,000 pairs of drone, street-view panorama, and satellite images as well as their textual descriptions, collected from 36 countries, ensuring both geographic and semantic alignment. We performed broad evaluations across multiple tasks. Experiments confirm that GeoLoc pre-training markedly improves geo-location accuracy for GeoBridge while promoting cross-domain generalization and cross-modal knowledge transfer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLM-Pruner is a training-free token pruning method for vision-language models that balances redundancy reduction with spatial coverage to preserve object details while achieving high compression rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pruning methods for VLMs either overlook inter-token redundancy (keeping duplicates) or ignore spatial relationships (leading to sparse coverage of target objects), limiting deployment on mobile devices due to high computational costs.

Method: Proposes centrifugal token pruning (near-to-far selection), Buffering for Spatial Sparsity criterion (defers distant token selection), parallel greedy strategy for efficiency, and selective fusion of salient information from discarded tokens into retained ones.

Result: Consistently outperforms strong baselines across five VLMs with 88.9% pruning rate while delivering end-to-end inference speedup.

Conclusion: VLM-Pruner effectively addresses limitations of existing pruning methods by balancing redundancy and spatial sparsity, enabling efficient VLM deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image understanding tasks, but the large number of visual tokens imposes significant computational costs, hindering deployment on mobile devices. Many pruning methods rely solely on token importance and thus overlook inter-token redundancy, retaining numerous duplicated tokens and wasting capacity. Although some redundancy-aware approaches have been proposed, they often ignore the spatial relationships among visual tokens. This can lead to overly sparse selections of retained tokens that fail to adequately cover the regions of target objects. To address these limitations, we propose VLM-Pruner, a training-free token pruning algorithm that explicitly balances redundancy and spatial sparsity. We introduce a centrifugal token pruning paradigm that enables near-to-far selection while prioritizing the preservation of fine-grained object details. Moreover, we design a Buffering for Spatial Sparsity (BSS) criterion that defers the selection of spatially distant tokens. We further adopt a parallel greedy strategy to conduct token selection efficiently. To mitigate information loss from pruning, we selectively fuse salient information from the discarded tokens into the retained ones. Comprehensive comparisons demonstrate that VLM-Pruner consistently outperforms strong baselines across five VLMs with an 88.9\% pruning rate, while delivering an end-to-end inference speedup.

TL;DR: Sex-stratified whole-body MR image registration using adipose tissue and muscle masks improves registration accuracy for UK Biobank data compared to intensity-only and other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable body-wide spatial standardization and correlation analysis of non-imaging data with image-derived parameters in UK Biobank whole-body MR images through robust inter-subject registration.

Method: Sex-stratified registration approach using subcutaneous adipose tissue- and muscle-masks from VIBESegmentator to augment intensity-based graph-cut registration.

Result: Proposed method achieved mean Dice scores of 0.77/0.75 (males/females), outperforming intensity-only (6pp higher), uniGradICON (9pp/8pp higher), and MIRTK (12pp/13pp higher). Age-correlation maps were less noisy and better aligned anatomically.

Conclusion: Using two tissue masks improves whole-body registration of UK Biobank images, enabling more reliable medical research applications.

Abstract: The UK Biobank is a large-scale study collecting whole-body MR imaging and non-imaging health data. Robust and accurate inter-subject image registration of these whole-body MR images would enable their body-wide spatial standardization, and region-/voxel-wise correlation analysis of non-imaging data with image-derived parameters (e.g., tissue volume or fat content). We propose a sex-stratified inter-subject whole-body MR image registration approach that uses subcutaneous adipose tissue- and muscle-masks from the state-of-the-art VIBESegmentator method to augment intensity-based graph-cut registration. The proposed method was evaluated on a subset of 4000 subjects by comparing it to an intensity-only method as well as two previously published registration methods, uniGradICON and MIRTK. The evaluation comprised overlap measures applied to the 71 VIBESegmentator masks: 1) Dice scores, and 2) voxel-wise label error frequency. Additionally, voxel-wise correlation between age and each of fat content and tissue volume was studied to exemplify the usefulness for medical research. The proposed method exhibited a mean dice score of 0.77 / 0.75 across the cohort and the 71 masks for males/females, respectively. When compared to the intensity-only registration, the mean values were 6 percentage points (pp) higher for both sexes, and the label error frequency was decreased in most tissue regions. These differences were 9pp / 8pp against uniGradICON and 12pp / 13pp against MIRTK. Using the proposed method, the age-correlation maps were less noisy and showed higher anatomical alignment. In conclusion, the image registration method using two tissue masks improves whole-body registration of UK Biobank images.

TL;DR: GeoViS is a geospatially rewarded visual search framework that reformulates remote sensing visual grounding as a progressive search-and-reasoning process, outperforming existing methods on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transferring multimodal LLM capabilities to remote sensing imagery is challenging due to extremely small targets in kilometer-scale scenes and complex geospatial relations involving relative positions, spatial hierarchies, and contextual dependencies across distant objects.

Method: GeoViS reformulates remote sensing visual grounding as a progressive search-and-reasoning process. Instead of direct single-step prediction, it actively explores the global image through tree-structured visual cues, integrating multimodal perception, spatial reasoning, and reward-guided exploration to iteratively refine geospatial hypotheses.

Result: Extensive experiments on five remote sensing grounding benchmarks demonstrate that GeoViS achieves precise geospatial understanding and consistently surpasses existing methods across key visual grounding metrics.

Conclusion: GeoViS effectively addresses remote sensing visual grounding challenges by enabling detection of subtle small-scale targets while maintaining holistic scene awareness, showing strong cross-domain generalization and interpretability.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models(MLLMs) have led to remarkable progress in visual grounding, enabling fine-grained cross-modal alignment between textual queries and image regions. However, transferring such capabilities to remote sensing imagery remains challenging, as targets are often extremely small within kilometer-scale scenes, and queries typically involve intricate geospatial relations such as relative positions, spatial hierarchies, or contextual dependencies across distant objects. To address these challenges, we propose GeoViS, a Geospatially Rewarded Visual Search framework that reformulates remote sensing visual grounding as a progressive search-and-reasoning process. Rather than directly predicting the target location in a single step, GeoViS actively explores the global image through a tree-structured sequence of visual cues, integrating multimodal perception, spatial reasoning, and reward-guided exploration to refine geospatial hypotheses iteratively. This design enables the model to detect subtle small-scale targets while maintaining holistic scene awareness. Extensive experiments on five remote sensing grounding benchmarks demonstrate that GeoViS achieves precise geospatial understanding and consistently surpasses existing methods across key visual grounding metrics, highlighting its strong cross-domain generalization and interpretability.

Motivation: Current UAV localization methods require expensive paired UAV-satellite datasets for training, which are costly and often unavailable, limiting practical deployment in GNSS-denied environments.

Method: Proposes CAEVL model that learns directly from satellite-view reference images using dedicated augmentation strategy to simulate domain shift between satellite and UAV views, eliminating need for UAV imagery during training.

Result: Achieves competitive performance compared to approaches trained with paired data on ViLD dataset (new real-world UAV image dataset released), demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The training paradigm that removes UAV imagery requirement during training is effective, enabling practical UAV localization in GNSS-denied environments without costly paired datasets.

Abstract: Image-based localization in GNSS-denied environments is critical for UAV autonomy. Existing state-of-the-art approaches rely on matching UAV images to geo-referenced satellite images; however, they typically require large-scale, paired UAV-satellite datasets for training. Such data are costly to acquire and often unavailable, limiting their applicability. To address this challenge, we adopt a training paradigm that removes the need for UAV imagery during training by learning directly from satellite-view reference images. This is achieved through a dedicated augmentation strategy that simulates the visual domain shift between satellite and real-world UAV views. We introduce CAEVL, an efficient model designed to exploit this paradigm, and validate it on ViLD, a new and challenging dataset of real-world UAV images that we release to the community. Our method achieves competitive performance compared to approaches trained with paired data, demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: AttMetNet is an attention-enhanced deep learning framework for methane plume detection using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, combining NDMI with attention mechanisms to improve accuracy and reduce false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas contributing to global warming, and accurate detection is crucial for timely climate action. Traditional methods require expert verification due to high false positives, while existing deep learning approaches lack mechanisms to prioritize methane-specific features.

Method: AttMetNet introduces a methane-aware architecture that fuses the Normalized Difference Methane Index (NDMI) with an attention-enhanced U-Net. It uses attention mechanisms to selectively amplify methane absorption features while suppressing background noise, and employs focal loss to address class imbalance from limited positive samples and sparse plume pixels.

Result: Extensive experiments show AttMetNet surpasses recent methods in methane plume detection with lower false positive rate, better precision-recall balance, and higher IoU. The model is trained on real methane plume datasets for practical robustness.

Conclusion: AttMetNet establishes a first-of-its-kind architecture tailored for robust methane plume detection in real satellite imagery, providing an effective solution for accurate methane emission monitoring to support climate change mitigation efforts.

Abstract: Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes significantly to global warming. Accurate detection of methane emissions is the key to taking timely action and minimizing their impact on climate change. We present AttMetNet, a novel attention-enhanced deep learning framework for methane plume detection with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The major challenge in developing a methane detection model is to accurately identify methane plumes from Sentinel-2's B11 and B12 bands while suppressing false positives caused by background variability and diverse land cover types. Traditional detection methods typically depend on the differences or ratios between these bands when comparing the scenes with and without plumes. However, these methods often require verification by a domain expert because they generate numerous false positives. Recent deep learning methods make some improvements using CNN-based architectures, but lack mechanisms to prioritize methane-specific features. AttMetNet introduces a methane-aware architecture that fuses the Normalized Difference Methane Index (NDMI) with an attention-enhanced U-Net. By jointly exploiting NDMI's plume-sensitive cues and attention-driven feature selection, AttMetNet selectively amplifies methane absorption features while suppressing background noise. This integration establishes a first-of-its-kind architecture tailored for robust methane plume detection in real satellite imagery. Additionally, we employ focal loss to address the severe class imbalance arising from both limited positive plume samples and sparse plume pixels within imagery. Furthermore, AttMetNet is trained on the real methane plume dataset, making it more robust to practical scenarios. Extensive experiments show that AttMetNet surpasses recent methods in methane plume detection with a lower false positive rate, better precision recall balance, and higher IoU.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in quality evaluations and shows superior generalization across multiple downstream surgical tasks.

Conclusion: STANet effectively addresses smoke-type-specific desmoking challenges, improving laparoscopic visualization and surgical task performance through smoke-type-aware processing.

Abstract: Electrocautery or lasers will inevitably generate surgical smoke, which hinders the visual guidance of laparoscopic videos for surgical procedures. The surgical smoke can be classified into different types based on its motion patterns, leading to distinctive spatio-temporal characteristics across smoky laparoscopic videos. However, existing desmoking methods fail to account for such smoke-type-specific distinctions. Therefore, we propose the first Smoke-Type-Aware Laparoscopic Video Desmoking Network (STANet) by introducing two smoke types: Diffusion Smoke and Ambient Smoke. Specifically, a smoke mask segmentation sub-network is designed to jointly conduct smoke mask and smoke type predictions based on the attention-weighted mask aggregation, while a smokeless video reconstruction sub-network is proposed to perform specially desmoking on smoky features guided by two types of smoke mask. To address the entanglement challenges of two smoke types, we further embed a coarse-to-fine disentanglement module into the mask segmentation sub-network, which yields more accurate disentangled masks through the smoke-type-aware cross attention between non-entangled and entangled regions. In addition, we also construct the first large-scale synthetic video desmoking dataset with smoke type annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in quality evaluations, but also exhibits superior generalization across multiple downstream surgical tasks.

*Xu Han,Biao Zhang,Xiangjun Tang,Xianzhi Li,Peter Wonka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LumiX is a structured diffusion framework that jointly generates multiple intrinsic scene properties (albedo, irradiance, normal, depth, color) from text prompts with physical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable coherent text-to-intrinsic generation that produces comprehensive, physically consistent scene descriptions with multiple intrinsic properties, addressing the need for structured scene understanding beyond simple color generation.

Method: Uses a structured diffusion framework with two key innovations: 1) Query-Broadcast Attention that shares queries across all maps in self-attention blocks for structural consistency, and 2) Tensor LoRA for parameter-efficient modeling of cross-map relations during joint training.

Result: Achieves 23% higher alignment and better preference scores (0.19 vs. -0.41) compared to state-of-the-art methods, producing coherent and physically meaningful results, and can also perform image-conditioned intrinsic decomposition.

Conclusion: LumiX enables stable joint diffusion training and unified generation of multiple intrinsic properties, providing a structured and physically consistent approach to text-to-intrinsic scene generation.

Abstract: We present LumiX, a structured diffusion framework for coherent text-to-intrinsic generation. Conditioned on text prompts, LumiX jointly generates a comprehensive set of intrinsic maps (e.g., albedo, irradiance, normal, depth, and final color), providing a structured and physically consistent description of an underlying scene. This is enabled by two key contributions: 1) Query-Broadcast Attention, a mechanism that ensures structural consistency by sharing queries across all maps in each self-attention block. 2) Tensor LoRA, a tensor-based adaptation that parameter-efficiently models cross-map relations for efficient joint training. Together, these designs enable stable joint diffusion training and unified generation of multiple intrinsic properties. Experiments show that LumiX produces coherent and physically meaningful results, achieving 23% higher alignment and a better preference score (0.19 vs. -0.41) compared to the state of the art, and it can also perform image-conditioned intrinsic decomposition within the same framework.

### [97] [TrackNetV5: Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement and Motion Direction Decoupling for Fast Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02789)
*Tang Haonan,Chen Yanjun,Jiang Lezhi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrackNetV5 introduces motion direction decoupling and spatio-temporal refinement to overcome occlusion and directional ambiguity limitations in previous versions, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous TrackNet versions (V1-V3) struggle with occlusions due to reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4 suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity information.

Method: Two novel mechanisms: 1) Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module that decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields to encode both movement occurrence and trajectory direction, and 2) Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head, a Transformer-based module using factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate corrective residuals for recovering occluded targets.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and accuracy of 0.9733 on TrackNetV2 dataset, significantly outperforming previous versions with only 3.7% increase in FLOPs compared to V4, maintaining real-time inference capabilities.

Conclusion: TrackNetV5 successfully addresses the limitations of previous versions by explicitly modeling motion direction and refining spatio-temporal contexts, delivering superior tracking precision for fast-moving small objects in sports while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: The TrackNet series has established a strong baseline for fast-moving small object tracking in sports. However, existing iterations face significant limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to a reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4, despite introducing motion inputs, suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose TrackNetV5, a robust architecture integrating two novel mechanisms. First, to recover lost directional priors, we introduce the Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module. Unlike V4, MDD decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields, explicitly encoding both movement occurrence and trajectory direction. Second, we propose the Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head. Operating on a coarse-to-fine paradigm, this Transformer-based module leverages factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate a corrective residual, effectively recovering occluded targets. Extensive experiments on the TrackNetV2 dataset demonstrate that TrackNetV5 achieves a new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and an accuracy of 0.9733, significantly outperforming previous versions. Notably, this performance leap is achieved with a marginal 3.7% increase in FLOPs compared to V4, maintaining real-time inference capabilities while delivering superior tracking precision.

*Keming Ye,Zhipeng Huang,Canmiao Fu,Qingyang Liu,Jiani Cai,Zheqi Lv,Chen Li,Jing Lyu,Zhou Zhao,Shengyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UnicEdit-10M, a 10M-scale multimodal image editing dataset, and UnicBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating model weaknesses across diverse editing behaviors, addressing the data scarcity and evaluation limitations in open-source multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widening performance gap between closed-source (GPT-4o, Nano Banana, Seedream 4.0) and open-source multimodal models in image editing, primarily due to scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data and comprehensive benchmarks that can diagnose model weaknesses across diverse editing behaviors.

Method: 1) A lightweight data pipeline replacing multi-toolchains with end-to-end model and unified post-verification; 2) Training a 7B dual-task expert model (Qwen-Verify) for efficient failure detection and instruction recaptioning; 3) Creating UnicEdit-10M dataset spanning diverse editing tasks; 4) Proposing UnicBench benchmark with novel metrics including Non-edit Consistency and Reasoning Accuracy.

Result: Generated UnicEdit-10M (10M-scale dataset) and UnicBench benchmark that extends beyond basic edits to assess spatial and knowledge-driven reasoning. Analysis of mainstream models on UnicBench reveals their limitations and provides clear directions for future research.

Conclusion: The proposed data pipeline and benchmark address the scale-quality trade-off in multimodal image editing data construction, enabling better training and evaluation of open-source models while providing diagnostic insights into model weaknesses across diverse editing behaviors.

Abstract: With the rapid advances of powerful multimodal models such as GPT-4o, Nano Banana, and Seedream 4.0 in Image Editing, the performance gap between closed-source and open-source models is widening, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data and comprehensive benchmarks capable of diagnosing model weaknesses across diverse editing behaviors. Existing data construction methods face a scale-quality trade-off: human annotations are high-quality but not scalable, while automated pipelines suffer from error propagation and noise. To address this, we introduce a lightweight data pipeline that replaces multi-toolchains with an end-to-end model and a unified post-verification stage. For scalable quality control, we train a 7B dual-task expert model, \textbf{Qwen-Verify}, for efficient failure detection and instruction recaptioning. This pipeline yields \textbf{UnicEdit-10M}, a 10M-scale dataset spanning diverse basic and complex editing tasks. We also propose \textbf{UnicBench}, a general benchmark that extends beyond basic edits to explicitly assess spatial and knowledge-driven reasoning. To enable fine-grained diagnosis, we introduce novel metrics, including \textit{Non-edit Consistency} and \textit{Reasoning Accuracy}. Our analysis of mainstream models on UnicBench reveals their limitations and provides clear directions for future research.

### [99] [HUD: Hierarchical Uncertainty-Aware Disambiguation Network for Composed Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02792)
*Zhiwei Chen,Yupeng Hu,Zixu Li,Zhiheng Fu,Haokun Wen,Weili Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HUD is a novel hierarchical uncertainty-aware disambiguation network for composed video retrieval that addresses modality information density disparity to improve multi-modal query understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous CVR models overlook the disparity in information density between video (richer semantics) and text modalities, leading to modification subject referring ambiguity and limited detailed semantic focus, degrading performance.

Method: HUD leverages modality information density disparity through three components: Holistic Pronoun Disambiguation, Atomistic Uncertainty Modeling, and Holistic-to-Atomistic Alignment, enabling effective object disambiguation and fine-grained semantic alignment.

Result: HUD achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets for both Composed Video Retrieval (CVR) and Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed HUD framework effectively addresses modality disparity issues in multi-modal queries, enabling precise composed feature learning and demonstrating strong generalization to both video and image retrieval tasks.

Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CVR) is a challenging video retrieval task that utilizes multi-modal queries, consisting of a reference video and modification text, to retrieve the desired target video. The core of this task lies in understanding the multi-modal composed query and achieving accurate composed feature learning. Within multi-modal queries, the video modality typically carries richer semantic content compared to the textual modality. However, previous works have largely overlooked the disparity in information density between these two modalities. This limitation can lead to two critical issues: 1) modification subject referring ambiguity and 2) limited detailed semantic focus, both of which degrade the performance of CVR models. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel CVR framework, namely the Hierarchical Uncertainty-aware Disambiguation network (HUD). HUD is the first framework that leverages the disparity in information density between video and text to enhance multi-modal query understanding. It comprises three key components: (a) Holistic Pronoun Disambiguation, (b) Atomistic Uncertainty Modeling, and (c) Holistic-to-Atomistic Alignment. By exploiting overlapping semantics through holistic cross-modal interaction and fine-grained semantic alignment via atomistic-level cross-modal interaction, HUD enables effective object disambiguation and enhances the focus on detailed semantics, thereby achieving precise composed feature learning. Moreover, our proposed HUD is also applicable to the Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) task and achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets for both CVR and CIR tasks. The codes are available on https://zivchen-ty.github.io/HUD.github.io/.

*Fan Wu,Jiacheng Wei,Ruibo Li,Yi Xu,Junyou Li,Deheng Ye,Guosheng Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IC-World is a novel framework for shared world modeling that generates multiple videos from input images showing the same world from different camera poses, using in-context generation with large video models and reinforcement learning for consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the problem of shared world modeling, where a model needs to generate multiple videos from input images that represent the same underlying world but from different camera poses. This is important for creating consistent, dynamic visual environments that maintain both scene-level geometry and object-level motion coherence across different viewpoints.

Method: IC-World leverages the inherent in-context generation capability of large video models to enable parallel generation for all input images. The framework is further fine-tuned using reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization, along with two novel reward models: one for enforcing scene-level geometry consistency and another for object-level motion consistency among the generated videos.

Result: Extensive experiments show that IC-World substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both geometry and motion consistency metrics. The paper presents the first systematic exploration of the shared world modeling problem using video-based world models.

Conclusion: IC-World represents a significant advancement in shared world modeling, successfully addressing the challenge of generating consistent multi-view videos from input images. The combination of in-context generation with large video models and reinforcement learning with specialized reward models proves effective for maintaining both scene geometry and object motion coherence across different camera perspectives.

Abstract: Video-based world models have recently garnered increasing attention for their ability to synthesize diverse and dynamic visual environments. In this paper, we focus on shared world modeling, where a model generates multiple videos from a set of input images, each representing the same underlying world in different camera poses. We propose IC-World, a novel generation framework, enabling parallel generation for all input images via activating the inherent in-context generation capability of large video models. We further finetune IC-World via reinforcement learning, Group Relative Policy Optimization, together with two proposed novel reward models to enforce scene-level geometry consistency and object-level motion consistency among the set of generated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IC-World substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both geometry and motion consistency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically explore the shared world modeling problem with video-based world models.

*Fan Wu,Cheng Chen,Zhoujie Fu,Jiacheng Wei,Yi Xu,Deheng Ye,Guosheng Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhyCustom is a fine-tuning framework with two regularization losses (isometric and decouple) that enables diffusion models to accurately customize physical concepts, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image customization methods fail to accurately reflect physical properties even when physics-related words appear in prompts, due to lack of explicit physical knowledge during training.

Method: Proposes PhyCustom framework with two novel regularization losses: isometric loss to activate learning of physical concepts, and decouple loss to eliminate mixture learning of independent concepts.

Result: Outperforms previous state-of-the-art and popular methods in physical customization both quantitatively and qualitatively on diverse datasets.

Conclusion: PhyCustom successfully enables diffusion models to perform accurate physical customization by explicitly introducing physical knowledge through specialized regularization losses.

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based text-to-image customization methods have achieved significant success in understanding concrete concepts to control generation processes, such as styles and shapes. However, few efforts dive into the realistic yet challenging customization of physical concepts. The core limitation of current methods arises from the absence of explicitly introducing physical knowledge during training. Even when physics-related words appear in the input text prompts, our experiments consistently demonstrate that these methods fail to accurately reflect the corresponding physical properties in the generated results. In this paper, we propose PhyCustom, a fine-tuning framework comprising two novel regularization losses to activate diffusion model to perform physical customization. Specifically, the proposed isometric loss aims at activating diffusion models to learn physical concepts while decouple loss helps to eliminate the mixture learning of independent concepts. Experiments are conducted on a diverse dataset and our benchmark results demonstrate that PhyCustom outperforms previous state-of-the-art and popular methods in terms of physical customization quantitatively and qualitatively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AAG enables competitive action anticipation using just a single video frame combined with depth cues and contextual priors, challenging conventional temporal aggregation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans can predict upcoming actions from single moments with sufficient context, but conventional methods rely on temporal video aggregation. The paper investigates whether models can achieve similar single-frame anticipation competence.

Method: Introduces AAG (Action Anticipation at a Glimpse) that combines RGB features with depth cues from a single frame, and incorporates prior action information as long-term context obtained from either textual summaries by Vision-Language Models or predictions from a single-frame action recognizer.

Result: AAG performs competitively compared to both temporally aggregated video baselines and state-of-the-art methods across three instructional activity datasets: IKEA-ASM, Meccano, and Assembly101.

Conclusion: Multimodal single-frame action anticipation can effectively replace video aggregation in certain scenarios, demonstrating that sufficient context from alternative modalities enables competent action prediction from glimpses.

Abstract: Anticipating actions before they occur is a core challenge in action understanding research. While conventional methods rely on extracting and aggregating temporal information from videos, as humans we can often predict upcoming actions by observing a single moment from a scene, when given sufficient context. Can a model achieve this competence? The short answer is yes, although its effectiveness depends on the complexity of the task. In this work, we investigate to what extent video aggregation can be replaced with alternative modalities. To this end, based on recent advances in visual feature extraction and language-based reasoning, we introduce AAG, a method for Action Anticipation at a Glimpse. AAG combines RGB features with depth cues from a single frame for enhanced spatial reasoning, and incorporates prior action information to provide long-term context. This context is obtained either through textual summaries from Vision-Language Models, or from predictions generated by a single-frame action recognizer. Our results demonstrate that multimodal single-frame action anticipation using AAG can perform competitively compared to both temporally aggregated video baselines and state-of-the-art methods across three instructional activity datasets: IKEA-ASM, Meccano, and Assembly101.

*Vishal Dubey,Pallavi Tyagi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First systematic study of identity-preserving AI-generated content detection for Indian/South-Asian faces shows fine-tuned detectors overfit to training data and fail to generalize to new identity-preserving generators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern image editors create identity-preserving AI-generated content (IP-AIGC) where the same person appears with new attributes, but detector robustness and fairness for under-represented populations like Indian/South-Asian faces remains unclear.

Method: Assembled Indian-focused training splits from FairFD and HAV-DF datasets, created two held-out IP-AIGC test sets using commercial generators (Gemini, ChatGPT) with identity-preserving prompts, evaluated two SOTA detectors (AIDE, Effort) under pretrained and fine-tuned regimes.

Result: Fine-tuning yields strong in-domain gains but consistently degrades performance on held-out IP-AIGC for Indian cohorts (e.g., AIDE AUC drops from 0.923 to 0.563), indicating overfitting to training-generator cues. Non-IP images maintain high performance, showing specific brittleness to identity-preserving edits.

Conclusion: IP-AIGC detection for Indian faces is a challenging, practically relevant scenario that requires representation-preserving adaptation and India-aware benchmark curation to address generalization gaps in AIGC detection.

Abstract: Modern image editors can produce identity-preserving AIGC (IP-AIGC), where the same person appears with new attire, background, or lighting. The robustness and fairness of current detectors in this regime remain unclear, especially for under-represented populations. We present what we believe is the first systematic study of IP-AIGC detection for Indian and South-Asian faces, quantifying cross-generator generalization and intra-population performance. We assemble Indian-focused training splits from FairFD and HAV-DF, and construct two held-out IP-AIGC test sets (HIDF-img-ip-genai and HIDF-vid-ip-genai) using commercial web-UI generators (Gemini and ChatGPT) with identity-preserving prompts. We evaluate two state-of-the-art detectors (AIDE and Effort) under pretrained (PT) and fine-tuned (FT) regimes and report AUC, AP, EER, and accuracy. Fine-tuning yields strong in-domain gains (for example, Effort AUC 0.739 to 0.944 on HAV-DF-test; AIDE EER 0.484 to 0.259), but consistently degrades performance on held-out IP-AIGC for Indian cohorts (for example, AIDE AUC 0.923 to 0.563 on HIDF-img-ip-genai; Effort 0.740 to 0.533), which indicates overfitting to training-generator cues. On non-IP HIDF images, PT performance remains high, which suggests a specific brittleness to identity-preserving edits rather than a generic distribution shift. Our study establishes IP-AIGC-Indian as a challenging and practically relevant scenario and motivates representation-preserving adaptation and India-aware benchmark curation to close generalization gaps in AIGC detection.

Motivation: Annotated data scarcity in digital dentistry (CBCT and IOS) limits automated solutions for pulp canal segmentation and cross-modal registration, creating a need for semi-supervised learning benchmarks.

Method: Organized STSR 2025 Challenge with two tasks: (1) semi-supervised segmentation of teeth/pulp canals in CBCT, and (2) semi-supervised rigid registration of CBCT and IOS. Provided 60 labeled + 640 unlabeled IOS samples and 30 labeled + 250 unlabeled CBCT scans with varying resolutions/FOVs.

Conclusion: The challenge demonstrated effective SSL solutions for dental imaging with limited labels, with all data and code made publicly available to ensure reproducibility and advance the field of digital dentistry.

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Intraoral Scanning (IOS) are essential for digital dentistry, but annotated data scarcity limits automated solutions for pulp canal segmentation and cross-modal registration. To benchmark semi-supervised learning (SSL) in this domain, we organized the STSR 2025 Challenge at MICCAI 2025, featuring two tasks: (1) semi-supervised segmentation of teeth and pulp canals in CBCT, and (2) semi-supervised rigid registration of CBCT and IOS. We provided 60 labeled and 640 unlabeled IOS samples, plus 30 labeled and 250 unlabeled CBCT scans with varying resolutions and fields of view. The challenge attracted strong community participation, with top teams submitting open-source deep learning-based SSL solutions. For segmentation, leading methods used nnU-Net and Mamba-like State Space Models with pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization, achieving a Dice score of 0.967 and Instance Affinity of 0.738 on the hidden test set. For registration, effective approaches combined PointNetLK with differentiable SVD and geometric augmentation to handle modality gaps; hybrid neural-classical refinement enabled accurate alignment despite limited labels.

TL;DR: Online RL post-training framework for video diffusion models improves camera control accuracy through geometry-based rewards and segment-level feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most video diffusion models rely only on supervised fine-tuning for camera control, leaving online reinforcement learning post-training underexplored despite its potential for better optimization.

Method: Developed online RL post-training framework with verifiable geometry reward that provides dense segment-level feedback. Estimates 3D camera trajectories, divides into segments, computes segment-wise relative poses, and compares generated-reference pairs for alignment scores.

Result: Outperforms SFT baselines across multiple aspects including camera-control accuracy, geometric consistency, and visual quality. Demonstrates superiority in advancing camera-controlled video generation.

Conclusion: Online RL post-training with geometry-based rewards effectively improves camera control in video generation, addressing limitations of supervised fine-tuning alone.

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have remarkably improved camera-controlled video generation, but most methods rely solely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), leaving online reinforcement learning (RL) post-training largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce an online RL post-training framework that optimizes a pretrained video generator for precise camera control. To make RL effective in this setting, we design a verifiable geometry reward that delivers dense segment-level feedback to guide model optimization. Specifically, we estimate the 3D camera trajectories for both generated and reference videos, divide each trajectory into short segments, and compute segment-wise relative poses. The reward function then compares each generated-reference segment pair and assigns an alignment score as the reward signal, which helps alleviate reward sparsity and improve optimization efficiency. Moreover, we construct a comprehensive dataset featuring diverse large-amplitude camera motions and scenes with varied subject dynamics. Extensive experiments show that our online RL post-training clearly outperforms SFT baselines across multiple aspects, including camera-control accuracy, geometric consistency, and visual quality, demonstrating its superiority in advancing camera-controlled video generation.

(2) A collaborative curriculum supervised fine-tuning approach that balances the injection of domain-specific knowledge with the preservation of general capabilities. (3) A hybrid reinforcement learning paradigm that enhances reasoning ability while simultaneously addressing multi-objective optimization such as diversity exploration, maintenance of multimodal perception, and response conciseness. Moreover, we implement a series of infrastructure optimizations, such as 5D parallel training, operator optimization, and inference quantization to enhance training and inference efficiency while reducing the cost of domain adaptation. Experimental results demonstrate that the MindGPT-4ov model outperforms state-of-the-art models on benchmarks such as MMBench, MMStar, MathVision, and MathVista. In addition, MindGPT-4ov also demonstrates superior user experience in vertical domain tasks, enabling a seamless transition from academic research to industrial deployment.

*Zhuobai Dong,Rui Zhao,Songjie Wu,Junchao Yi,Linjie Li,Zhengyuan Yang,Lijuan Wang,Alex Jinpeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Phase-aware acceleration of diffusion models using specialized LoRA adapters (Slow-LoRA and Fast-LoRA) that apply different speedups to different denoising phases, achieving 5× acceleration with minimal training cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have high computational costs and require many inference steps. Previous distillation methods suffer from heavy retraining costs and degraded generalization. The authors propose a smarter acceleration approach that treats different denoising phases differently rather than applying uniform speedups.

Method: Instead of training compact student models, the method equips the base diffusion model with two lightweight LoRA adapters: Slow-LoRA for early semantic stages (smaller speedups) and Fast-LoRA for later redundant phases (larger speedups). This phase-aware strategy allows specialized handling of different denoising phases with minimal training overhead.

Result: Achieves up to 5× acceleration over the base model while maintaining comparable visual quality across diverse benchmarks. Remarkably, the LoRA experts require only 1% of samples and train within one hour on a single V100 GPU, yet generalize well to unseen prompts.

Conclusion: Phase-aware acceleration with specialized LoRA adapters provides an efficient and effective approach to accelerate diffusion models, overcoming limitations of previous distillation methods by achieving both strong acceleration and generalization with minimal training cost.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation, yet their deployment remains constrained by the heavy computational cost and the need for numerous inference steps. Previous efforts on fewer-step distillation attempt to skip redundant steps by training compact student models, yet they often suffer from heavy retraining costs and degraded generalization. In this work, we take a different perspective: we accelerate smartly, not evenly, applying smaller speedups to early semantic stages and larger ones to later redundant phases. We instantiate this phase-aware strategy with two experts that specialize in slow and fast denoising phases. Surprisingly, instead of investing massive effort in retraining student models, we find that simply equipping the base model with lightweight LoRA adapters achieves both efficient acceleration and strong generalization. We refer to these two adapters as Slow-LoRA and Fast-LoRA. Through extensive experiments, our method achieves up to 5 acceleration over the base model while maintaining comparable visual quality across diverse benchmarks. Remarkably, the LoRA experts are trained with only 1 samples on a single V100 within one hour, yet the resulting models generalize strongly on unseen prompts.

TL;DR: DiverseAR improves sample diversity in bitwise autoregressive image generation by addressing binary classification limitations and sharp logits distributions through adaptive scaling and energy-based path search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the underexplored challenge of limited sample diversity in autoregressive generative models with bitwise visual tokenizers, identifying that binary classification nature and overly sharp logits distributions restrict prediction space and cause sampling collapse.

Method: Proposes DiverseAR with two key components: (1) adaptive logits distribution scaling mechanism that dynamically adjusts binary output distribution sharpness during sampling, and (2) energy-based generation path search algorithm that avoids sampling low-confidence tokens to preserve visual quality.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiverseAR substantially improves sample diversity in bitwise autoregressive image generation without sacrificing visual quality.

Conclusion: DiverseAR provides a principled and effective solution to enhance diversity in bitwise AR models by addressing fundamental limitations in binary prediction spaces and logits distributions while maintaining high visual fidelity.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the underexplored challenge of sample diversity in autoregressive (AR) generative models with bitwise visual tokenizers. We first analyze the factors that limit diversity in bitwise AR models and identify two key issues: (1) the binary classification nature of bitwise modeling, which restricts the prediction space, and (2) the overly sharp logits distribution, which causes sampling collapse and reduces diversity. Building on these insights, we propose DiverseAR, a principled and effective method that enhances image diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive logits distribution scaling mechanism that dynamically adjusts the sharpness of the binary output distribution during sampling, resulting in smoother predictions and greater diversity. To mitigate potential fidelity loss caused by distribution smoothing, we further develop an energy-based generation path search algorithm that avoids sampling low-confidence tokens, thereby preserving high visual quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiverseAR substantially improves sample diversity in bitwise autoregressive image generation.

Motivation: Existing jailbreak attacks on MLLMs primarily focus on text-image interplay and treat visual modality as secondary prompts, underutilizing images' potential to carry complex contextual information for attacks.

Method: Proposes Contextual Image Attack (CIA) using a multi-agent system to embed harmful queries into benign visual contexts with four visualization strategies, plus contextual element enhancement and automatic toxicity obfuscation techniques.

Result: On MMSafetyBench-tiny dataset, CIA achieves toxicity scores of 4.73 and 4.83 against GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-VL-72B respectively, with Attack Success Rates of 86.31% and 91.07%, significantly outperforming prior work.

Conclusion: The visual modality itself is a potent vector for jailbreaking advanced MLLMs, demonstrating that image-centric attacks can effectively bypass safety alignments.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show remarkable capabilities, their safety alignments are susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Existing attack methods typically focus on text-image interplay, treating the visual modality as a secondary prompt. This approach underutilizes the unique potential of images to carry complex, contextual information. To address this gap, we propose a new image-centric attack method, Contextual Image Attack (CIA), which employs a multi-agent system to subtly embeds harmful queries into seemingly benign visual contexts using four distinct visualization strategies. To further enhance the attack's efficacy, the system incorporate contextual element enhancement and automatic toxicity obfuscation techniques. Experimental results on the MMSafetyBench-tiny dataset show that CIA achieves high toxicity scores of 4.73 and 4.83 against the GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-VL-72B models, respectively, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) reaching 86.31\% and 91.07\%.

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical challenge in large language models (LLMs), hindering the development of reliable multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Existing solutions often rely on human intervention or underutilize the agent's ability to autonomously mitigate hallucination. To address these limitations, we draw inspiration from how humans make reliable decisions in the real world. They begin with introspective reasoning to reduce uncertainty and form an initial judgment, then rely on external verification from diverse perspectives to reach a final decision. Motivated by this cognitive paradigm, we propose InEx, a training-free, multi-agent framework designed to autonomously mitigate hallucination. InEx introduces internal introspective reasoning, guided by entropy-based uncertainty estimation, to improve the reliability of the decision agent's reasoning process. The agent first generates a response, which is then iteratively verified and refined through external cross-modal multi-agent collaboration with the editing agent and self-reflection agents, further enhancing reliability and mitigating hallucination.

Conclusion: DynamicVerse bridges the gap in physical-scale 4D world modeling for dynamic real-world videos, enabling more accurate interpretation of real-world dynamics and supporting human-agent interaction and embodied agent capabilities.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamic physical world, characterized by its evolving 3D structure, real-world motion, and semantic content with textual descriptions, is crucial for human-agent interaction and enables embodied agents to perceive and act within real environments with human-like capabilities. However, existing datasets are often derived from limited simulators or utilize traditional Structurefrom-Motion for up-to-scale annotation and offer limited descriptive captioning, which restricts the capacity of foundation models to accurately interpret real-world dynamics from monocular videos, commonly sourced from the internet. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DynamicVerse, a physical-scale, multimodal 4D world modeling framework for dynamic real-world video. We employ large vision, geometric, and multimodal models to interpret metric-scale static geometry, real-world dynamic motion, instance-level masks, and holistic descriptive captions. By integrating window-based Bundle Adjustment with global optimization, our method converts long real-world video sequences into a comprehensive 4D multimodal format. DynamicVerse delivers a large-scale dataset consists of 100K+ videos with 800K+ annotated masks and 10M+ frames from internet videos. Experimental evaluations on three benchmark tasks, namely video depth estimation, camera pose estimation, and camera intrinsics estimation, demonstrate that our 4D modeling achieves superior performance in capturing physical-scale measurements with greater global accuracy than existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for dynamic driving scene reconstruction rely on per-scene optimization, known camera calibration, or short frame windows, making them slow and impractical for scalable autonomous driving training and evaluation.

Method: Unified framework that reformulates camera pose as model output rather than input, jointly predicts per-frame 3D Gaussian maps and camera parameters, uses lightweight dynamic head for motion disentanglement, lifespan head for temporal consistency, and diffusion-based rendering refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Waymo, nuScenes, and Argoverse2 benchmarks, both in dataset-specific training and zero-shot cross-dataset transfer, with good scalability as input frames increase.

Conclusion: DGGT provides a practical, scalable solution for pose-free dynamic scene reconstruction that outperforms prior methods in speed and quality while supporting arbitrary numbers of views for long sequences.

Abstract: Autonomous driving needs fast, scalable 4D reconstruction and re-simulation for training and evaluation, yet most methods for dynamic driving scenes still rely on per-scene optimization, known camera calibration, or short frame windows, making them slow and impractical. We revisit this problem from a feedforward perspective and introduce \textbf{Driving Gaussian Grounded Transformer (DGGT)}, a unified framework for pose-free dynamic scene reconstruction. We note that the existing formulations, treating camera pose as a required input, limit flexibility and scalability. Instead, we reformulate pose as an output of the model, enabling reconstruction directly from sparse, unposed images and supporting an arbitrary number of views for long sequences. Our approach jointly predicts per-frame 3D Gaussian maps and camera parameters, disentangles dynamics with a lightweight dynamic head, and preserves temporal consistency with a lifespan head that modulates visibility over time. A diffusion-based rendering refinement further reduces motion/interpolation artifacts and improves novel-view quality under sparse inputs. The result is a single-pass, pose-free algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art performance and speed. Trained and evaluated on large-scale driving benchmarks (Waymo, nuScenes, Argoverse2), our method outperforms prior work both when trained on each dataset and in zero-shot transfer across datasets, and it scales well as the number of input frames increases.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frame-based networks applied to video suffer from temporal inconsistency (flickering outputs), especially when inputs contain time-varying corruptions. Existing methods lack a unified approach for both temporal stability and corruption robustness.

Method: Introduces stability adapters that can be inserted into any architecture, with resource-efficient training using frozen base networks. Proposes a unified accuracy-stability-robustness loss framework and analyzes its theoretical properties for well-behaved stabilizer training.

Result: Method improves temporal stability and robustness against various image corruptions (compression artifacts, noise, adverse weather) while preserving or improving prediction quality across multiple vision tasks including denoising, image enhancement, depth estimation, and semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: The approach provides a general, effective solution for adapting frame-based models to achieve stable and robust video inference, addressing both temporal inconsistency and corruption sensitivity through a unified framework.

Abstract: When applied sequentially to video, frame-based networks often exhibit temporal inconsistency - for example, outputs that flicker between frames. This problem is amplified when the network inputs contain time-varying corruptions. In this work, we introduce a general approach for adapting frame-based models for stable and robust inference on video. We describe a class of stability adapters that can be inserted into virtually any architecture and a resource-efficient training process that can be performed with a frozen base network. We introduce a unified conceptual framework for describing temporal stability and corruption robustness, centered on a proposed accuracy-stability-robustness loss. By analyzing the theoretical properties of this loss, we identify the conditions where it produces well-behaved stabilizer training. Our experiments validate our approach on several vision tasks including denoising (NAFNet), image enhancement (HDRNet), monocular depth (Depth Anything v2), and semantic segmentation (DeepLabv3+). Our method improves temporal stability and robustness against a range of image corruptions (including compression artifacts, noise, and adverse weather), while preserving or improving the quality of predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct end-to-end generation of B-Reps with precise geometry and watertight topology remains challenging despite recent progress in CAD modeling.

Method: Uses unified tokenization encoding geometric primitives as latent tokens and topological relationships as reference tokens, with sequence order following B-Rep face adjacency graph breadth-first traversal. Autoregressive Transformer generates neighboring faces and edges progressively.

Result: Outperforms baselines in quality and watertightness, scales well to complex solids with good fidelity and inference speed, and natively supports autocompletion for user-controllable CAD generation.

Conclusion: AutoBrep demonstrates effective B-Rep generation through unified representation and next-token prediction, enabling high-quality, valid CAD model generation with autocompletion capabilities.

Abstract: The boundary representation (B-Rep) is the standard data structure used in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) for defining solid models. Despite recent progress, directly generating B-Reps end-to-end with precise geometry and watertight topology remains a challenge. This paper presents AutoBrep, a novel Transformer model that autoregressively generates B-Reps with high quality and validity. AutoBrep employs a unified tokenization scheme that encodes both geometric and topological characteristics of a B-Rep model as a sequence of discrete tokens. Geometric primitives (i.e., surfaces and curves) are encoded as latent geometry tokens, and their structural relationships are defined as special topological reference tokens. Sequence order in AutoBrep naturally follows a breadth first traversal of the B-Rep face adjacency graph. At inference time, neighboring faces and edges along with their topological structure are progressively generated. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of our unified representation when coupled with next-token prediction for B-Rep generation. AutoBrep outperforms baselines with better quality and watertightness. It is also highly scalable to complex solids with good fidelity and inference speed. We further show that autocompleting B-Reps is natively supported through our unified tokenization, enabling user-controllable CAD generation with minimal changes.

TL;DR: FLAT connects unrolled networks to flow ODEs for stable, efficient MRI reconstruction with fewer iterations than diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI acquisition is slow, limiting clinical utility. While unrolled networks are efficient for accelerated MRI reconstruction, they suffer from unstable evolution due to freely-learnable parameters. Diffusion models offer theoretical stability but are computationally expensive.

Method: Proves unrolled networks are discrete implementations of conditional probability flow ODEs, then proposes Flow-Aligned Training (FLAT) that derives unrolled parameters from ODE discretization and aligns intermediate reconstructions with ideal ODE trajectory.

Result: FLAT achieves high-quality reconstructions with up to 3× fewer iterations than diffusion-based generative models and significantly greater stability than unrolled networks across three MRI datasets.

Conclusion: Connecting unrolled networks to flow ODEs provides theoretical foundation for stable MRI reconstruction, with FLAT offering both computational efficiency and improved stability over existing methods.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers excellent soft-tissue contrast without ionizing radiation, but its long acquisition time limits clinical utility. Recent methods accelerate MRI by under-sampling $k$-space and reconstructing the resulting images using deep learning. Unrolled networks have been widely used for the reconstruction task due to their efficiency, but suffer from unstable evolving caused by freely-learnable parameters in intermediate steps. In contrast, diffusion models based on stochastic differential equations offer theoretical stability in both medical and natural image tasks but are computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce flow ODEs to MRI reconstruction by theoretically proving that unrolled networks are discrete implementations of conditional probability flow ODEs. This connection provides explicit formulations for parameters and clarifies how intermediate states should evolve. Building on this insight, we propose Flow-Aligned Training (FLAT), which derives unrolled parameters from the ODE discretization and aligns intermediate reconstructions with the ideal ODE trajectory to improve stability and convergence. Experiments on three MRI datasets show that FLAT achieves high-quality reconstructions with up to $3\times$ fewer iterations than diffusion-based generative models and significantly greater stability than unrolled networks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches focus on non-interactive systems and produce constrained, unnatural human speech. The challenges include effectively integrating understanding and generation capabilities, achieving seamless multimodal audio-video fusion, and generating long videos with consistent identity, timbre, and tone.

Method: Proposes a Conductor-Creator architecture: 1) Conductor handles understanding, reasoning, and generates instructions broken into motion and speech components for fine-grained control. 2) Creator delivers interactive responses based on instructions, using a hybrid autoregressive-diffusion model structure (AR for audio, diffusion for video). Also includes a novel fusion module to enhance connections between consecutive clips and modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework can generate vivid and contextually coherent long-duration dialogue interactions and accurately interpret users' multimodal queries.

Conclusion: MAViD successfully addresses the challenges of multimodal audio-visual dialogue by separating understanding and generation tasks, using specialized models for different modalities, and enabling synchronized long-duration content generation with consistent characteristics.

Abstract: We propose MAViD, a novel Multimodal framework for Audio-Visual Dialogue understanding and generation. Existing approaches primarily focus on non-interactive systems and are limited to producing constrained and unnatural human speech.The primary challenge of this task lies in effectively integrating understanding and generation capabilities, as well as achieving seamless multimodal audio-video fusion. To solve these problems, we propose a Conductor-Creator architecture that divides the dialogue system into two primary components.The Conductor is tasked with understanding, reasoning, and generating instructions by breaking them down into motion and speech components, thereby enabling fine-grained control over interactions. The Creator then delivers interactive responses based on these instructions.Furthermore, to address the difficulty of generating long videos with consistent identity, timbre, and tone using dual DiT structures, the Creator adopts a structure that combines autoregressive (AR) and diffusion models. The AR model is responsible for audio generation, while the diffusion model ensures high-quality video generation.Additionally, we propose a novel fusion module to enhance connections between contextually consecutive clips and modalities, enabling synchronized long-duration audio-visual content generation.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can generate vivid and contextually coherent long-duration dialogue interactions and accurately interpret users' multimodal queries.

Method: Extends pretrained single-shot model with two novel RoPE variants: Multi-Shot Narrative RoPE for shot transitions and narrative order, and Spatiotemporal Position-Aware RoPE for reference injection. Uses automated data annotation pipeline to extract multi-shot videos, captions, grounding signals, and reference images.

Conclusion: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance and outstanding controllability for narrative multi-shot video generation.

Abstract: Current video generation techniques excel at single-shot clips but struggle to produce narrative multi-shot videos, which require flexible shot arrangement, coherent narrative, and controllability beyond text prompts. To tackle these challenges, we propose MultiShotMaster, a framework for highly controllable multi-shot video generation. We extend a pretrained single-shot model by integrating two novel variants of RoPE. First, we introduce Multi-Shot Narrative RoPE, which applies explicit phase shift at shot transitions, enabling flexible shot arrangement while preserving the temporal narrative order. Second, we design Spatiotemporal Position-Aware RoPE to incorporate reference tokens and grounding signals, enabling spatiotemporal-grounded reference injection. In addition, to overcome data scarcity, we establish an automated data annotation pipeline to extract multi-shot videos, captions, cross-shot grounding signals and reference images. Our framework leverages the intrinsic architectural properties to support multi-shot video generation, featuring text-driven inter-shot consistency, customized subject with motion control, and background-driven customized scene. Both shot count and duration are flexibly configurable. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and outstanding controllability of our framework.

TL;DR: OneThinker is a unified multimodal reasoning model that combines image and video understanding across 10 fundamental visual tasks using a multi-task RL approach with EMA-GRPO for reward balancing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL approaches for MLLMs train separate models for different tasks and treat image/video reasoning as disjoint domains, limiting scalability and preventing knowledge sharing across tasks and modalities. The goal is to create a multimodal reasoning generalist.

Method: Constructed OneThinker-600k training corpus covering diverse visual tasks, used commercial models for CoT annotation to create OneThinker-SFT-340k for SFT cold start, and proposed EMA-GRPO (Exponential Moving Average Generalized Reward Policy Optimization) to handle reward heterogeneity in multi-task RL by tracking task-wise moving averages of reward standard deviations.

Result: OneThinker delivers strong performance on 31 benchmarks across 10 fundamental visual understanding tasks, exhibits effective knowledge transfer between certain tasks, and shows preliminary zero-shot generalization ability.

Conclusion: OneThinker represents a step toward a unified multimodal reasoning generalist by unifying image and video understanding across diverse tasks, with all code, model, and data released for community use.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently achieved remarkable success in eliciting visual reasoning within Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing approaches typically train separate models for different tasks and treat image and video reasoning as disjoint domains. This results in limited scalability toward a multimodal reasoning generalist, which restricts practical versatility and hinders potential knowledge sharing across tasks and modalities. To this end, we propose OneThinker, an all-in-one reasoning model that unifies image and video understanding across diverse fundamental visual tasks, including question answering, captioning, spatial and temporal grounding, tracking, and segmentation. To achieve this, we construct the OneThinker-600k training corpus covering all these tasks and employ commercial models for CoT annotation, resulting in OneThinker-SFT-340k for SFT cold start. Furthermore, we propose EMA-GRPO to handle reward heterogeneity in multi-task RL by tracking task-wise moving averages of reward standard deviations for balanced optimization. Extensive experiments on diverse visual benchmarks show that OneThinker delivers strong performance on 31 benchmarks, across 10 fundamental visual understanding tasks. Moreover, it exhibits effective knowledge transfer between certain tasks and preliminary zero-shot generalization ability, marking a step toward a unified multimodal reasoning generalist. All code, model, and data are released.

TL;DR: CAMEO is a training technique that supervises attention maps in multi-view diffusion models using geometric correspondence to improve view consistency and training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-view diffusion models show view consistency but the underlying mechanism is unclear. The authors found that attention maps acquire geometric correspondence during training, but this signal is incomplete and degrades with large viewpoint changes.

Method: CAMEO directly supervises attention maps using geometric correspondence during training. The key insight is that supervising just a single attention layer is sufficient to guide the model toward learning precise correspondences, preserving geometry and structure of reference images.

Result: CAMEO reduces training iterations required for convergence by half while achieving superior performance at the same iteration counts. It accelerates convergence and improves novel view synthesis performance.

Conclusion: CAMEO is a simple yet effective, model-agnostic training technique that enhances multi-view diffusion models by supervising attention maps with geometric correspondence, improving both training efficiency and generation quality.

Abstract: Multi-view diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for novel view synthesis, yet the underlying mechanism that enables their view-consistency remains unclear. In this work, we first verify that the attention maps of these models acquire geometric correspondence throughout training, attending to the geometrically corresponding regions across reference and target views for view-consistent generation. However, this correspondence signal remains incomplete, with its accuracy degrading under large viewpoint changes. Building on these findings, we introduce CAMEO, a simple yet effective training technique that directly supervises attention maps using geometric correspondence to enhance both the training efficiency and generation quality of multi-view diffusion models. Notably, supervising a single attention layer is sufficient to guide the model toward learning precise correspondences, thereby preserving the geometry and structure of reference images, accelerating convergence, and improving novel view synthesis performance. CAMEO reduces the number of training iterations required for convergence by half while achieving superior performance at the same iteration counts. We further demonstrate that CAMEO is model-agnostic and can be applied to any multi-view diffusion model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion transformers use singular, monolithic prompts that fail to disentangle distinct user intentions for content, position, and appearance, creating a gap between semantic generation power and granular control.

Method: Deconstructs creative intent into a stack of controllable visual cues: content layer (what to create), spatial layer (where to place it), structural layer (how it's shaped), and color layer (palette). Includes specialized data generation pipeline for context-aware content integration, unified control module to process all visual cues, and fine-tuned spatial branch for precise local editing including object removal.

Result: Extensive experiments validate that the layered approach effectively resolves the user intention gap, granting creators direct, intuitive control over the generative process.

Conclusion: MagicQuill V2 successfully bridges the gap between diffusion models' semantic power and traditional graphics software's granular control through its novel layered composition paradigm, enabling more precise and intuitive generative image editing.

Abstract: We propose MagicQuill V2, a novel system that introduces a \textbf{layered composition} paradigm to generative image editing, bridging the gap between the semantic power of diffusion models and the granular control of traditional graphics software.

Motivation: Traditional hand-coded methods are ineffective for complex manipulation in unstructured environments, while standard RL lacks safety guarantees and struggles with sim-to-real transfer, posing safety threats.

Method: Introduces force and haptic perception into reinforcement learning framework to enhance safety and reliability, leveraging force/tactile sensing for dynamic control and human-robot interaction.

Result: Force-based RL method shows better adaptation to environment, especially in sim-to-real transfer; experiments in object pushing task demonstrate safer and more efficient performance in both simulation and real world.

Conclusion: Force-based reinforcement learning holds prospects for wide variety of robotic applications by improving safety, reliability, and sim-to-real transfer capabilities.

Abstract: For the task with complicated manipulation in unstructured environments, traditional hand-coded methods are ineffective, while reinforcement learning can provide more general and useful policy. Although the reinforcement learning is able to obtain impressive results, its stability and reliability is hard to guarantee, which would cause the potential safety threats. Besides, the transfer from simulation to real world also will lead in unpredictable situations. To enhance the safety and reliability of robots, we introduce the force and haptic perception into reinforcement learning. Force and tactual sensation play key roles in robotic dynamic control and human-robot interaction. We demonstrate that the force-based reinforcement learning method can be more adaptive to environment, especially in sim-to-real transfer. Experimental results show in object pushing task, our strategy is safer and more efficient in both simulation and real world, thus it holds prospects for a wide variety of robotic applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emergency response communications during wildfires require reliable networks, but UAVs can fail in extreme environments, potentially disrupting critical communications between responders and command centers.

Method: Introduces Robust Task Networking Under Attrition (RTNUA) problem and ΦIREMAN algorithm using physics-inspired potential fields for proactive redundancy and attrition recovery in multi-UAV networks.

Result: ΦIREMAN outperforms DCCRS baseline in simulations across 25 configurations, maintaining >99.9% task uptime with up to 100 tasks and 500 drones despite substantial attrition.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses UAV attrition in extreme environments, enabling scalable and robust emergency communication networks with high reliability.

Abstract: Fast, efficient, robust communication during wildfire and other emergency responses is critical. One way to achieve this is by coordinating swarms of autonomous aerial vehicles carrying communications equipment to form an ad-hoc network connecting emergency response personnel to both each other and central command. However, operating in such extreme environments may lead to individual networking agents being damaged or rendered inoperable, which could bring down the network and interrupt communications.
  To overcome this challenge and enable multi-agent UAV networking in difficult environments, this paper introduces and formalizes the problem of Robust Task Networking Under Attrition (RTNUA), which extends connectivity maintenance in multi-robot systems to explicitly address proactive redundancy and attrition recovery. We introduce Physics-Informed Robust Employment of Multi-Agent Networks ($Φ$IREMAN), a topological algorithm leveraging physics-inspired potential fields to solve this problem. Through simulation across 25 problem configurations, $Φ$IREMAN consistently outperforms the DCCRS baseline, and on large-scale problems with up to 100 tasks and 500 drones, maintains $>99.9\%$ task uptime despite substantial attrition, demonstrating both effectiveness and scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing world models for autonomous driving jointly learn ego-vehicle dynamics and environmental transition dynamics from image inputs, leading to inefficiencies and lack of robustness to variations in vehicle dynamics.

Method: Proposes Vehicle Dynamics embedded Dreamer (VDD) method that decouples ego-vehicle dynamics modeling from environmental transition dynamics, plus Policy Adjustment during Deployment (PAD) and Policy Augmentation during Training (PAT) strategies.

Result: Comprehensive experiments in simulated environments demonstrate significant improvements in both driving performance and robustness to variations in vehicle dynamics, outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: Decoupling ego-vehicle dynamics from environmental dynamics enables world models to generalize effectively across vehicles with diverse parameters, enhancing autonomous driving robustness.

Abstract: World models have gained significant attention as a promising approach for autonomous driving. By emulating human-like perception and decision-making processes, these models can predict and adapt to dynamic environments. Existing methods typically map high-dimensional observations into compact latent spaces and learn optimal policies within these latent representations. However, prior work usually jointly learns ego-vehicle dynamics and environmental transition dynamics from the image input, leading to inefficiencies and a lack of robustness to variations in vehicle dynamics. To address these issues, we propose the Vehicle Dynamics embedded Dreamer (VDD) method, which decouples the modeling of ego-vehicle dynamics from environmental transition dynamics. This separation allows the world model to generalize effectively across vehicles with diverse parameters. Additionally, we introduce two strategies to further enhance the robustness of the learned policy: Policy Adjustment during Deployment (PAD) and Policy Augmentation during Training (PAT). Comprehensive experiments in simulated environments demonstrate that the proposed model significantly improves both driving performance and robustness to variations in vehicle dynamics, outperforming existing approaches.

TL;DR: AID is a decentralized multi-agent informative path planning framework that uses diffusion models to generate long-term trajectories non-autoregressively, achieving faster execution and higher information gain than existing planners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent informative path planning (MAIPP) for large-scale/time-critical scenarios requires effective coordination under budget constraints. Existing learning-based approaches use computationally expensive autoregressive intent predictors prone to compounding errors.

Method: AID uses diffusion models to generate long-term trajectories non-autoregressively. It first performs behavior cloning on trajectories from existing MAIPP planners, then fine-tunes via reinforcement learning using Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization (DPPO).

Result: AID consistently improves upon the MAIPP planners it's trained from, achieving up to 4x faster execution and 17% increased information gain, while scaling effectively to larger numbers of agents.

Conclusion: Diffusion models provide an effective approach for decentralized MAIPP, enabling non-autoregressive long-horizon trajectory generation that improves both computational efficiency and coordination performance.

Abstract: Information gathering in large-scale or time-critical scenarios (e.g., environmental monitoring, search and rescue) requires broad coverage within limited time budgets, motivating the use of multi-agent systems. These scenarios are commonly formulated as multi-agent informative path planning (MAIPP), where multiple agents must coordinate to maximize information gain while operating under budget constraints. A central challenge in MAIPP is ensuring effective coordination while the belief over the environment evolves with incoming measurements. Recent learning-based approaches address this by using distributions over future positions as "intent" to support coordination. However, these autoregressive intent predictors are computationally expensive and prone to compounding errors. Inspired by the effectiveness of diffusion models as expressive, long-horizon policies, we propose AID, a fully decentralized MAIPP framework that leverages diffusion models to generate long-term trajectories in a non-autoregressive manner. AID first performs behavior cloning on trajectories produced by existing MAIPP planners and then fine-tunes the policy using reinforcement learning via Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization (DPPO). This two-stage pipeline enables the policy to inherit expert behavior while learning improved coordination through online reward feedback. Experiments demonstrate that AID consistently improves upon the MAIPP planners it is trained from, achieving up to 4x faster execution and 17% increased information gain, while scaling effectively to larger numbers of agents. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/marmotlab/AID.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current human-robot collaboration design is too monodisciplinary, overlooking interdisciplinary knowledge and workers' experiential knowledge, creating a gap in effectively integrating robots into workplaces.

Method: Developed a robotic capabilities framework through reflexive, iterative processes; validated it by having roboticists describe commercial robots using the vocabulary and conducting design activities with robotics students.

Result: The framework serves as an intermediate-level knowledge artifact and boundary object that bridges technical and experiential domains, enabling meaningful dialogue about task delegation between humans and robots.

Conclusion: The framework supports transdisciplinary collaboration, guides designers, empowers workers, and contributes to more just and collaborative futures of work by focusing on high-level capabilities rather than technical implementation details.

Abstract: As robots become more adaptable, responsive, and capable of interacting with humans, the design of effective human-robot collaboration becomes critical. Yet, this design process is typically led by monodisciplinary approaches, often overlooking interdisciplinary knowledge and the experiential knowledge of workers who will ultimately share tasks with these systems. To address this gap, we introduce the robotic capabilities framework, a vocabulary that enables transdisciplinary collaborations to meaningfully shape the future of work when robotic systems are integrated into the workplace. Rather than focusing on the internal workings of robots, the framework centers discussion on high-level capabilities, supporting dialogue around which elements of a task should remain human-led and which can be delegated to robots. We developed the framework through reflexive and iterative processes, and applied it in two distinct settings: by engaging roboticists in describing existing commercial robots using its vocabulary, and through a design activity with students working on robotics-related projects. The framework emerges as an intermediate-level knowledge artifact and a boundary object that bridges technical and experiential domains, guiding designers, empowering workers, and contributing to more just and collaborative futures of work.

TL;DR: SAM2Grasp solves multimodal imitation learning for robotic grasping by using SAM2's visual tracking with a prompt-conditioned action head to predict unambiguous grasp trajectories for specific objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard imitation learning fails in cluttered scenes with multiple valid grasp targets because it averages conflicting demonstrations into invalid actions, creating the multimodal problem.

Method: Leverages frozen SAM2 model for visual temporal tracking, adds lightweight trainable action head that operates in parallel with SAM2's segmentation head, uses prompt conditioning (e.g., bounding box) to specify target object, and relies on SAM2's built-in temporal tracking for continuous prediction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in cluttered, multi-object grasping tasks by effectively eliminating ambiguity from the visuomotor policy.

Conclusion: SAM2Grasp successfully resolves the multimodal problem in imitation learning for robotic grasping through temporal-prompted conditioning and leverages powerful pre-trained visual models for robust performance in complex environments.

Abstract: Imitation learning for robotic grasping is often plagued by the multimodal problem: when a scene contains multiple valid targets, demonstrations of grasping different objects create conflicting training signals. Standard imitation learning policies fail by averaging these distinct actions into a single, invalid action. In this paper, we introduce SAM2Grasp, a novel framework that resolves this issue by reformulating the task as a uni-modal, prompt-conditioned prediction problem. Our method leverages the frozen SAM2 model to use its powerful visual temporal tracking capability and introduces a lightweight, trainable action head that operates in parallel with its native segmentation head. This design allows for training only the small action head on pre-computed temporal-visual features from SAM2. During inference, an initial prompt, such as a bounding box provided by an upstream object detection model, designates the specific object to be grasped. This prompt conditions the action head to predict a unique, unambiguous grasp trajectory for that object alone. In all subsequent video frames, SAM2's built-in temporal tracking capability automatically maintains stable tracking of the selected object, enabling our model to continuously predict the grasp trajectory from the video stream without further external guidance. This temporal-prompted approach effectively eliminates ambiguity from the visuomotor policy. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that SAM2Grasp achieves state-of-the-art performance in cluttered, multi-object grasping tasks.

Motivation: To create a lightweight, scalable alternative to teleoperation for robotic learning by leveraging human demonstration videos as supervision, enabling cross-embodiment training with minimal hardware requirements.

Method: Uses monocular RGB/RGB-D input, performs high-precision HOI reconstruction with RL optimization for physical plausibility, retargets to various robot embodiments, and scales via simulation-augmented framework with domain randomization in Isaac Sim.

Result: Produces stable trajectories comparable to teleoperation, yields continual performance gains for VLA and imitation learning models, and demonstrates first quantitative evidence that HOI modalities can effectively supervise robotic learning.

Conclusion: Robowheel provides a universal, embodiment-agnostic motion representation from simple monocular cameras that can be flexibly retargeted across robot morphologies, offering a scalable alternative to teleoperation for robotic learning.

Abstract: We introduce Robowheel, a data engine that converts human hand object interaction (HOI) videos into training-ready supervision for cross morphology robotic learning. From monocular RGB or RGB-D inputs, we perform high precision HOI reconstruction and enforce physical plausibility via a reinforcement learning (RL) optimizer that refines hand object relative poses under contact and penetration constraints. The reconstructed, contact rich trajectories are then retargeted to cross-embodiments, robot arms with simple end effectors, dexterous hands, and humanoids, yielding executable actions and rollouts. To scale coverage, we build a simulation-augmented framework on Isaac Sim with diverse domain randomization (embodiments, trajectories, object retrieval, background textures, hand motion mirroring), which enriches the distributions of trajectories and observations while preserving spatial relationships and physical plausibility. The entire data pipeline forms an end to end pipeline from video,reconstruction,retargeting,augmentation data acquisition. We validate the data on mainstream vision language action (VLA) and imitation learning architectures, demonstrating that trajectories produced by our pipeline are as stable as those from teleoperation and yield comparable continual performance gains. To our knowledge, this provides the first quantitative evidence that HOI modalities can serve as effective supervision for robotic learning. Compared with teleoperation, Robowheel is lightweight, a single monocular RGB(D) camera is sufficient to extract a universal, embodiment agnostic motion representation that could be flexibly retargeted across embodiments. We further assemble a large scale multimodal dataset combining multi-camera captures, monocular videos, and public HOI corpora for training and evaluating embodied models.

Conclusion: CogDrive combines cognitive multimodal prediction with safety-oriented planning to offer an interpretable and reliable paradigm for safe autonomy in complex traffic, addressing limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Safe autonomous driving in mixed traffic requires a unified understanding of multimodal interactions and dynamic planning under uncertainty. Existing learning based approaches struggle to capture rare but safety critical behaviors, while rule based systems often lack adaptability in complex interactions. To address these limitations, CogDrive introduces a cognition driven multimodal prediction and planning framework that integrates explicit modal reasoning with safety aware trajectory optimization. The prediction module adopts cognitive representations of interaction modes based on topological motion semantics and nearest neighbor relational encoding. With a differentiable modal loss and multimodal Gaussian decoding, CogDrive learns sparse and unbalanced interaction behaviors and improves long horizon trajectory prediction. The planning module incorporates an emergency response concept and optimizes safety stabilized trajectories, where short term consistent branches ensure safety during replanning cycles and long term branches support smooth and collision free motion under low probability switching modes. Experiments on Argoverse2 and INTERACTION datasets show that CogDrive achieves strong performance in trajectory accuracy and miss rate, while closed loop simulations confirm adaptive behavior in merge and intersection scenarios. By combining cognitive multimodal prediction with safety oriented planning, CogDrive offers an interpretable and reliable paradigm for safe autonomy in complex traffic.

Method: Developed ViFailback framework with explicit visual symbols for efficient annotation, created large-scale real-world VQA dataset (58,126 pairs), established benchmark with 11 fine-grained VQA tasks, built ViFailback-8B VLM model, and integrated it with VLA models for robotic experiments.

Result: ViFailback-8B achieves significant performance improvement on the benchmark, generates visual symbols for corrective guidance, and successfully assists VLA models in recovering from failures in real-world robotic experiments.

Conclusion: ViFailback addresses key limitations in robotic manipulation by enabling failure diagnosis and correction through a comprehensive framework, dataset, benchmark, and model that bridges the gap between simulation and real-world applications.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently achieved remarkable progress in robotic manipulation, yet they remain limited in failure diagnosis and learning from failures. Additionally, existing failure datasets are mostly generated programmatically in simulation, which limits their generalization to the real world. In light of these, we introduce ViFailback, a framework designed to diagnose robotic manipulation failures and provide both textual and visual correction guidance. Our framework utilizes explicit visual symbols to enhance annotation efficiency. We further release the ViFailback dataset, a large-scale collection of 58,126 Visual Question Answering (VQA) pairs along with their corresponding 5,202 real-world manipulation trajectories. Based on the dataset, we establish ViFailback-Bench, a benchmark of 11 fine-grained VQA tasks designed to assess the failure diagnosis and correction abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), featuring ViFailback-Bench Lite for closed-ended and ViFailback-Bench Hard for open-ended evaluation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we built the ViFailback-8B VLM, which not only achieves significant overall performance improvement on ViFailback-Bench but also generates visual symbols for corrective action guidance. Finally, by integrating ViFailback-8B with a VLA model, we conduct real-world robotic experiments demonstrating its ability to assist the VLA model in recovering from failures.

*Shyam prasad reddy Kaitha,Hongrui Yu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LTAA is an LLM-driven framework for multi-robot task allocation in construction that outperforms traditional optimization methods while reducing computational costs by 94.6% token usage and 86% allocation time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-robot task allocation in construction relies on optimization methods like Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning, but recent LLM approaches lack rigorous validation and benchmarking against established algorithms.

Method: LangGraph-based Task Allocation Agent (LTAA) integrates phase-adaptive allocation strategies, multi-stage validation with hierarchical retries, dynamic prompting, and Self-Corrective Agent Architecture for efficient robot coordination.

Result: LTAA achieves 77% task completion with superior workload balance in Heavy Excels setting, outperforming Dynamic Programming, Q-learning, and DQN baselines while reducing token usage by 94.6% and allocation time by 86%.

Conclusion: LLM-based reasoning with structured validation can match established optimization algorithms while offering interpretability, adaptability, and the ability to update task logic without retraining.

Abstract: Multi-robot task allocation in construction automation has traditionally relied on optimization methods such as Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning. This research introduces the LangGraph-based Task Allocation Agent (LTAA), an LLM-driven framework that integrates phase-adaptive allocation strategies, multi-stage validation with hierarchical retries, and dynamic prompting for efficient robot coordination. Although recent LLM approaches show potential for construction robotics, they largely lack rigorous validation and benchmarking against established algorithms. This paper presents the first systematic comparison of LLM-based task allocation with traditional methods in construction scenarios.The study validates LLM feasibility through SMART-LLM replication and addresses implementation challenges using a Self-Corrective Agent Architecture. LTAA leverages natural-language reasoning combined with structured validation mechanisms, achieving major computational gains reducing token usage by 94.6% and allocation time by 86% through dynamic prompting. The framework adjusts its strategy across phases: emphasizing execution feasibility early and workload balance in later allocations.The authors evaluate LTAA against Dynamic Programming, Q-learning, and Deep Q-Network (DQN) baselines using construction operations from the TEACh human-robot collaboration dataset. In the Heavy Excels setting, where robots have strong task specializations, LTAA achieves 77% task completion with superior workload balance, outperforming all traditional methods. These findings show that LLM-based reasoning with structured validation can match established optimization algorithms while offering additional advantages such as interpretability, adaptability, and the ability to update task logic without retraining.

*Siyuan Yang,Yang Zhang,Haoran He,Ling Pan,Xiu Li,Chenjia Bai,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TACO improves VLA model stability by using test-time scaling with pseudo-count verification to select optimal action chunks, preventing distribution shift without RL updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action models suffer from inference-time fragility after fine-tuning due to distribution shift between VLA policies and optimal task success modes, caused by redundant action modes in suboptimal demonstration data.

Method: TACO (Test-time-scaling framework) applies lightweight pseudo-count estimator as verifier to select action chunks with maximum pseudo-count from sampled options, gradient-free approach inspired by anti-exploration in offline RL.

Result: Extensive experiments across four simulation benchmarks and dual-arm platform show significant improvements in inference stability and success rates for downstream-task adaptations.

Conclusion: TACO effectively prevents distribution shift while preserving VLA generalization, offering computational benefits over RL updates for flow/diffusion-based models through gradient-free test-time scaling.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, trained via flow-matching or diffusion objectives, excel at learning complex behaviors from large-scale, multi-modal datasets (e.g., human teleoperation, scripted policies). However, since VLAs incorporate diverse data modes in the pre-training stage, and the finetuning dataset often contains demonstration data collected in a kinematically suboptimal or undesirable way, it exists redundant action modes that are irrelevant to the success action modes of the downstream task. Specifically, we observe a critical inference-time fragility among various sampled noises after supervised finetuning of pre-trained VLAs. In this paper, we attribute this instability to the distribution shift between the VLA policy and the policy induced by stable success modes of the downstream task dataset. Thus, we propose \textbf{TACO}, a test-time-scaling (TTS) framework that applies a lightweight pseudo-count estimator as a high-fidelity verifier of action chunks. The VLA models integrated with TACO can execute the actions with maximum pseudo-count from all sampled action chunks, thereby preventing distribution shifts while preserving the generalization ability of VLAs since the constraint is applied only during inference. Our method resembles the classical anti-exploration principle in offline reinforcement learning (RL), and being gradient-free, it incurs significant computational benefits compared to RL update, especially for flow or diffusion-based VLAs which are difficult to perform RL update due to denoising process. Extensive experiments across four simulation benchmarks (RoboTwin2.0, Robotwin, LIBERO, SimplerEnv) and a dual-arm platform demonstrate that our method significantly improves the inference stability and success rates in downstream-task adaptations.

### [139] [VLM as Strategist: Adaptive Generation of Safety-critical Testing Scenarios via Guided Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02844)
*Xinzheng Wu,Junyi Chen,Naiting Zhong,Yong Shen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework combining Vision Language Models and adaptive guided diffusion to generate realistic, interactive safety-critical scenarios for autonomous driving testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety-critical scenarios for autonomous driving testing are sparse in real world, and existing methods lack real-time dynamic response capabilities, fidelity, criticality, and interactivity.

Method: Three-layer hierarchical architecture: strategic layer (VLM determines scenario objectives), tactical layer (formulates guidance functions), operational layer (executes guided diffusion). Uses adaptive guided diffusion with real-time control of background vehicles in closed-loop simulation.

Result: Method efficiently generates realistic, diverse, and highly interactive safety-critical testing scenarios, with demonstrated adaptability and VLM-directed generation performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses challenges in safety-critical scenario generation by integrating VLM semantic understanding with fine-grained diffusion control, enabling effective testing of autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: The safe deployment of autonomous driving systems (ADSs) relies on comprehensive testing and evaluation. However, safety-critical scenarios that can effectively expose system vulnerabilities are extremely sparse in the real world. Existing scenario generation methods face challenges in efficiently constructing long-tail scenarios that ensure fidelity, criticality, and interactivity, while particularly lacking real-time dynamic response capabilities to the vehicle under test (VUT). To address these challenges, this paper proposes a safety-critical testing scenario generation framework that integrates the high-level semantic understanding capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) with the fine-grained generation capabilities of adaptive guided diffusion models. The framework establishes a three-layer hierarchical architecture comprising a strategic layer for VLM-directed scenario generation objective determination, a tactical layer for guidance function formulation, and an operational layer for guided diffusion execution. We first establish a high-quality fundamental diffusion model that learns the data distribution of real driving scenarios. Next, we design an adaptive guided diffusion method that enables real-time, precise control of background vehicles (BVs) in closed-loop simulation. The VLM is then incorporated to autonomously generate scenario generation objectives and guidance functions through deep scenario understanding and risk reasoning, ultimately guiding the diffusion model to achieve VLM-directed scenario generation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently generate realistic, diverse, and highly interactive safety-critical testing scenarios. Furthermore, case studies validate the adaptability and VLM-directed generation performance of the proposed method.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SwarmDiffusion: A lightweight diffusion model that jointly predicts traversability and generates feasible trajectories from single RGB images, eliminating need for hand-crafted prompts and external planners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM-based traversability estimation methods rely on hand-crafted prompts, generalize poorly across different robot platforms, and only output traversability maps requiring slow external planners for trajectory generation.

Method: End-to-end diffusion model that jointly predicts traversability and generates trajectories. Uses planner-free trajectory construction with randomized waypoint sampling, Bezier smoothing, and regularization for connectivity, safety, directionality, and path thinness. Leverages VLM-derived supervision without prompt engineering and conditions diffusion on compact embodiment state.

Result: Achieves 80-100% navigation success across indoor environments with quadruped and aerial robots, 0.09s inference time. Adapts to new robot with only 500 additional visual samples. Generalizes reliably to unseen environments in simulation and real-world trials.

Conclusion: SwarmDiffusion offers a scalable, prompt-free approach to unified traversability reasoning and trajectory generation that transfers across different robot platforms with minimal additional data.

Abstract: Visual traversability estimation is critical for autonomous navigation, but existing VLM-based methods rely on hand-crafted prompts, generalize poorly across embodiments, and output only traversability maps, leaving trajectory generation to slow external planners. We propose SwarmDiffusion, a lightweight end-to-end diffusion model that jointly predicts traversability and generates a feasible trajectory from a single RGB image. To remove the need for annotated or planner-produced paths, we introduce a planner-free trajectory construction pipeline based on randomized waypoint sampling, Bezier smoothing, and regularization enforcing connectivity, safety, directionality, and path thinness. This enables learning stable motion priors without demonstrations. SwarmDiffusion leverages VLM-derived supervision without prompt engineering and conditions the diffusion process on a compact embodiment state, producing physically consistent, traversable paths that transfer across different robot platforms. Across indoor environments and two embodiments (quadruped and aerial), the method achieves 80-100\% navigation success and 0.09 s inference, and adapts to a new robot using only-500 additional visual samples. It generalizes reliably to unseen environments in simulation and real-world trials, offering a scalable, prompt-free approach to unified traversability reasoning and trajectory generation.

*Weiqi Li,Quande Zhang,Ruifeng Zhai,Liang Lin,Guangrun Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: One-shot adaptation framework with lightweight visual recalibration (FTM and FLA methods) dramatically improves VLA model robustness to novel camera viewpoints, revealing untapped generalization potential in pretrained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language-action (VLA) models perform well in-distribution but degrade sharply under novel camera viewpoints and visual perturbations. The authors identify that this brittleness stems from misalignment in Spatial Modeling rather than Physical Modeling.

Method: Proposed a one-shot adaptation framework with two lightweight methods: 1) Feature Token Modulation (FTM) applies global affine transformation to visual tokens (4K parameters), and 2) Feature Linear Adaptation (FLA) introduces low-rank updates to ViT encoder (4.7M parameters). Both methods recalibrate visual representations through minimal learnable updates.

Result: FTM improved Libero viewpoint accuracy from 48.5% to 87.1% with only 4K parameters. FLA achieved 90.8% success with 4.7M parameters, matching LoRA-scale finetuning at far lower cost. Both methods dramatically restore viewpoint generalization.

Conclusion: Substantial untapped robustness exists in pretrained VLA models, and targeted, minimal visual adaptation is sufficient to restore viewpoint generalization. The work reveals that spatial modeling misalignment is the primary bottleneck for robustness.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models achieve strong in-distribution performance but degrade sharply under novel camera viewpoints and visual perturbations. We show that this brittleness primarily arises from misalignment in Spatial Modeling, rather than Physical Modeling. To address this, we propose a one-shot adaptation framework that recalibrates visual representations through lightweight, learnable updates. Our first method, Feature Token Modulation (FTM), applies a global affine transformation to visual tokens and improves Libero viewpoint accuracy from 48.5% to 87.1% with only 4K parameters. Building on this, Feature Linear Adaptation (FLA) introduces low-rank updates to the ViT encoder, achieving 90.8% success with 4.7M parameters -- matching LoRA-scale finetuning at far lower cost. Together, these results reveal substantial untapped robustness in pretrained VLA models and demonstrate that targeted, minimal visual adaptation is sufficient to restore viewpoint generalization.

TL;DR: First systematic demonstration of precise millimeter-level task-space trajectory tracking in a linkage-driven robotic finger using resolved motion rate control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Task-space control is essential for dexterous manipulation since manipulation objectives are naturally specified in fingertip motions and forces, but precise task-space tracking in compact robotic fingers has been scarce compared to arm-scale manipulators.

Method: Developed a 3-DoF linkage-driven series-parallel robotic finger with analytic forward kinematics and closed-form Jacobian, then implemented resolved motion rate control (RMRC) for closed-loop task-space trajectory tracking.

Result: Achieved millimeter-level fingertip tracking accuracy across various trajectories including straight lines, circles, and complex curves, providing one of the first systematic experimental demonstrations of precise task-space tracking in linkage-driven fingers.

Conclusion: This work establishes a benchmark for future robotic finger designs aimed at dexterous in-hand manipulation by demonstrating precise task-space control capabilities in a compact, multi-DoF finger mechanism.

Abstract: Task-space control of robotic fingers is a critical enabler of dexterous manipulation, as manipulation objectives are most naturally specified in terms of fingertip motions and applied forces rather than individual joint angles. While task-space planning and control have been extensively studied for larger, arm-scale manipulators, demonstrations of precise task-space trajectory tracking in compact, multi-DoF robotic fingers remain scarce. In this paper, we present the physical prototyping and experimental characterization of a three-degree-of-freedom, linkage-driven, series-parallel robotic finger with analytic forward kinematics and a closed-form Jacobian. A resolved motion rate control (RMRC) scheme is implemented to achieve closed-loop task-space trajectory tracking. We experimentally evaluate the fingertip tracking performance across a variety of trajectories, including straight lines, circles, and more complex curves, and report millimeter-level accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides one of the first systematic experimental demonstrations of precise task-space trajectory tracking in a linkage-driven robotic finger, thereby establishing a benchmark for future designs aimed at dexterous in-hand manipulation.

TL;DR: Video2Act: A framework that extracts motion-aware representations from video diffusion models to guide robotic action learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using video diffusion models for robotic policies overlook coherent motion representations across frames, failing to leverage physically consistent motion information that could enhance action learning.

Method: Extracts foreground boundaries and inter-frame motion variations from VDM representations, filters out background noise, and uses these as conditioning inputs to a diffusion transformer action head with asynchronous dual-system design (VDM as slow System 2, DiT as fast System 1).

Result: Surpasses previous state-of-the-art VLA methods by 7.7% in simulation and 21.7% in real-world tasks in average success rate, with strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: Explicitly integrating spatial and motion-aware representations from video diffusion models significantly improves robotic action learning efficiency and performance while maintaining stable manipulation.

Abstract: Robust perception and dynamics modeling are fundamental to real-world robotic policy learning. Recent methods employ video diffusion models (VDMs) to enhance robotic policies, improving their understanding and modeling of the physical world. However, existing approaches overlook the coherent and physically consistent motion representations inherently encoded across frames in VDMs. To this end, we propose Video2Act, a framework that efficiently guides robotic action learning by explicitly integrating spatial and motion-aware representations. Building on the inherent representations of VDMs, we extract foreground boundaries and inter-frame motion variations while filtering out background noise and task-irrelevant biases. These refined representations are then used as additional conditioning inputs to a diffusion transformer (DiT) action head, enabling it to reason about what to manipulate and how to move. To mitigate inference inefficiency, we propose an asynchronous dual-system design, where the VDM functions as the slow System 2 and the DiT head as the fast System 1, working collaboratively to generate adaptive actions. By providing motion-aware conditions to System 1, Video2Act maintains stable manipulation even with low-frequency updates from the VDM. For evaluation, Video2Act surpasses previous state-of-the-art VLA methods by 7.7% in simulation and 21.7% in real-world tasks in terms of average success rate, further exhibiting strong generalization capabilities.

*PIerre Dantas,Lucas Cordeiro,Youcheng Sun,Waldir Junior*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-Verifier Convergence Theorem provides provable guarantees for termination and convergence in LLM-assisted formal verification, with empirical validation across 90,000+ trials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-assisted formal verification methods lack theoretical foundations, leading to unreliable refinement processes that can wander, loop, or diverge without guarantees.

Method: Model LLM-verifier interaction as discrete-time Markov Chain with error-reduction probability (δ), develop convergence theorem with termination guarantees, and validate through extensive empirical testing (90,000+ trials).

Result: Proved termination for any δ>0 with expected iteration bound 𝔼[n] ≤ 4/δ; empirical results show 100% verification success with convergence factor Cf≈1.0, enabling identification of three operational zones (marginal, practical, high-performance).

Conclusion: Provides first formal framework with provable guarantees for LLM-assisted verification, enabling predictable resource planning and performance budgeting for safety-critical software deployment.

Abstract: The idea of using Formal Verification tools with large language models (LLMs) has enabled scaling software verification beyond manual workflows. However, current methods remain unreliable. Without a solid theoretical footing, the refinement process can wander; sometimes it settles, sometimes it loops back, and sometimes it breaks away from any stable trajectory. This work bridges this critical gap by developing an LLM-Verifier Convergence Theorem, providing the first formal framework with provable guarantees for termination and convergence. We model the interaction between the LLM and the verifier as a discrete-time Markov Chain, with state transitions determined by a key parameter: the error-reduction probability ($δ$). The procedure reaching the Verified state almost surely demonstrates that the program terminates for any $δ> 0$, with an expected iteration count bounded by $\mathbb{E}[n] \leq 4/δ$. We then stress-tested this prediction in an extensive empirical campaign comprising more than 90,000 trials. The empirical results match the theory with striking consistency. Every single run reached verification, and the convergence factor clustered tightly around $C_f\approx$ 1.0. Consequently, the bound mirrors the system's actual behavior. The evidence is sufficiently robust to support dividing the workflow into three distinct operating zones: marginal, practical, and high-performance. Consequently, we establish the design thresholds with absolute confidence. Together, the theoretical guarantee and the experimental evidence provide a clearer architectural foundation for LLM-assisted verification. Heuristic tuning no longer has to be carried out by the system. Engineers gain a framework that supports predictable resource planning and performance budgeting, precisely what is needed before deploying these pipelines into safety-critical software environments.

Unlike prior image-to-diagram tools, our approach produces a structured, version-controllable textual representation that remains synchronized with the rendered diagram. We further introduce evaluation metrics to assess structural accuracy, flow correctness, syntax validity, and completeness across multiple models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Realistic world models for AI training have high computational demands, but real-world scenarios often involve modular interactions that can be exploited for efficient modeling.

Method: Developed a framework for decomposing complex world models represented by transducers (generalizing POMDPs) into sub-transducers operating on distinct input-output subspaces.

Result: Clarified how to invert the composition process of transducers, enabling parallelizable and interpretable alternatives to monolithic world modeling that support distributed inference.

Conclusion: The results lay groundwork for bridging structural transparency (needed for AI safety) with computational efficiency (required for real-world inference).

Abstract: World models have been recently proposed as sandbox environments in which AI agents can be trained and evaluated before deployment. Although realistic world models often have high computational demands, efficient modelling is usually possible by exploiting the fact that real-world scenarios tend to involve subcomponents that interact in a modular manner. In this paper, we explore this idea by developing a framework for decomposing complex world models represented by transducers, a class of models generalising POMDPs. Whereas the composition of transducers is well understood, our results clarify how to invert this process, deriving sub-transducers operating on distinct input-output subspaces, enabling parallelizable and interpretable alternatives to monolithic world modelling that can support distributed inference. Overall, these results lay a groundwork for bridging the structural transparency demanded by AI safety and the computational efficiency required for real-world inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid shift from stateless LLMs to autonomous agents raises questions about when agentic AI is truly necessary, as indiscriminate deployment leads to higher cost, complexity, and risk.

Method: STRIDE framework integrates structured task decomposition, dynamism attribution, and self-reflection requirement analysis to produce an Agentic Suitability Score, recommending between direct LLM calls, guided AI assistants, or fully autonomous agents.

Result: Achieved 92% accuracy in modality selection across 30 real-world tasks, reduced unnecessary agent deployments by 45%, and cut resource costs by 37% in SRE, compliance, and enterprise automation domains.

Conclusion: Reframes agent adoption as a necessity-driven design decision, ensuring autonomy is applied only when its benefits justify the costs, with practical utility validated by domain specialists over six months.

Abstract: The rapid shift from stateless large language models (LLMs) to autonomous, goal-driven agents raises a central question: When is agentic AI truly necessary? While agents enable multi-step reasoning, persistent memory, and tool orchestration, deploying them indiscriminately leads to higher cost, complexity, and risk.
  We present STRIDE (Systematic Task Reasoning Intelligence Deployment Evaluator), a framework that provides principled recommendations for selecting between three modalities: (i) direct LLM calls, (ii) guided AI assistants, and (iii) fully autonomous agentic AI. STRIDE integrates structured task decomposition, dynamism attribution, and self-reflection requirement analysis to produce an Agentic Suitability Score, ensuring that full agentic autonomy is reserved for tasks with inherent dynamism or evolving context.
  Evaluated across 30 real-world tasks spanning SRE, compliance, and enterprise automation, STRIDE achieved 92% accuracy in modality selection, reduced unnecessary agent deployments by 45%, and cut resource costs by 37%. Expert validation over six months in SRE and compliance domains confirmed its practical utility, with domain specialists agreeing that STRIDE effectively distinguishes between tasks requiring simple LLM calls, guided assistants, or full agentic autonomy. This work reframes agent adoption as a necessity-driven design decision, ensuring autonomy is applied only when its benefits justify the costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite digital collaboration tools, routine financial processes still suffer from human error and delay; need to assess if general LLM agents can handle assistant-level wealth management work accurately and cost-effectively.

Method: Extended TheAgentCompany with finance environment, created synthetic domain data, enriched colleague simulations, prototyped automatic task-generation pipeline, and built benchmark of 12 wealth management task-pairs with explicit acceptance criteria and deterministic graders.

Result: Agents limited more by end-to-end workflow reliability than mathematical reasoning; autonomy level significantly affects performance; current model evaluation methods hinder accurate benchmarking.

Conclusion: LLM agents show promise for wealth management but face workflow reliability challenges; proper evaluation benchmarks with varied autonomy levels are needed to accurately assess fitness for financial assistant work.

Abstract: Modern work relies on an assortment of digital collaboration tools, yet routine processes continue to suffer from human error and delay. To address this gap, this dissertation extends TheAgentCompany with a finance-focused environment and investigates whether a general purpose LLM agent can complete representative wealth-management tasks both accurately and economically. This study introduces synthetic domain data, enriches colleague simulations, and prototypes an automatic task-generation pipeline. The study aims to create and assess an evaluation set that can meaningfully measure an agent's fitness for assistant-level wealth management work. We construct a benchmark of 12 task-pairs for wealth management assistants spanning retrieval, analysis, and synthesis/communication, with explicit acceptance criteria and deterministic graders. We seeded a set of new finance-specific data and introduced a high vs. low-autonomy variant of every task. The paper concluded that agents are limited less by mathematical reasoning and more so by end-to-end workflow reliability, and meaningfully affected by autonomy level, and that incorrect evaluation of models have hindered benchmarking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based trading agents are increasingly deployed in real financial markets, but their reliability and robustness under adversarial or faulty conditions remain largely unexamined despite operating in high-risk, irreversible financial environments.

Method: Proposes TradeTrap, a unified evaluation framework that systematically stress-tests both adaptive and procedural autonomous trading agents by targeting four core components: market intelligence, strategy formulation, portfolio/ledger handling, and trade execution, evaluating robustness under controlled system-level perturbations in closed-loop historical backtesting on real US equity market data.

Result: Small perturbations at a single component can propagate through the agent decision loop and induce extreme concentration, runaway exposure, and large portfolio drawdowns across both agent types, demonstrating that current autonomous trading agents can be systematically misled at the system level.

Conclusion: Current autonomous trading agents are vulnerable to systematic manipulation at the system level, highlighting the need for robust testing frameworks like TradeTrap to ensure reliability in real-world financial environments.

Abstract: LLM-based trading agents are increasingly deployed in real-world financial markets to perform autonomous analysis and execution. However, their reliability and robustness under adversarial or faulty conditions remain largely unexamined, despite operating in high-risk, irreversible financial environments. We propose TradeTrap, a unified evaluation framework for systematically stress-testing both adaptive and procedural autonomous trading agents. TradeTrap targets four core components of autonomous trading agents: market intelligence, strategy formulation, portfolio and ledger handling, and trade execution, and evaluates their robustness under controlled system-level perturbations. All evaluations are conducted in a closed-loop historical backtesting setting on real US equity market data with identical initial conditions, enabling fair and reproducible comparisons across agents and attacks. Extensive experiments show that small perturbations at a single component can propagate through the agent decision loop and induce extreme concentration, runaway exposure, and large portfolio drawdowns across both agent types, demonstrating that current autonomous trading agents can be systematically misled at the system level.

TL;DR: Current AI systems lack self-monitoring, self-correction, and autonomous regulation capabilities, with seven core deficiencies preventing robust generalization and real-world autonomy. The paper advocates for cognitively grounded AI architectures that mirror neurocognitive principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite rapid AI advances in perception, language, and reasoning, modern systems remain fundamentally limited in self-monitoring, self-correction, and autonomous behavior regulation. These limitations prevent robust generalization, lifelong adaptability, and real-world autonomy that current scaling approaches cannot resolve.

Method: Comparative analysis of artificial systems and biological cognition, integrating insights from AI research, cognitive science, and neuroscience. Identifies seven core deficiencies in contemporary AI models and outlines how neurocognitive principles could address them.

Result: Identifies seven critical deficiencies: absence of intrinsic self-monitoring, lack of meta-cognitive awareness, fixed learning mechanisms, inability to restructure goals, lack of representational maintenance, insufficient embodied feedback, and absence of intrinsic agency. Shows these prevent robust generalization despite scaling.

Conclusion: Advocates for a paradigmatic shift toward cognitively grounded AI (cognitive autonomy) with self-directed adaptation, dynamic representation management, and intentional goal-oriented behavior, paired with reformative oversight mechanisms to ensure interpretability, governability, and human value alignment.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced rapidly across perception, language, reasoning, and multimodal domains. Yet despite these achievements, modern AI systems remain fundamentally limited in their ability to self-monitor, self-correct, and regulate their behavior autonomously in dynamic contexts. This paper identifies and analyzes seven core deficiencies that constrain contemporary AI models: the absence of intrinsic self-monitoring, lack of meta-cognitive awareness, fixed and non-adaptive learning mechanisms, inability to restructure goals, lack of representational maintenance, insufficient embodied feedback, and the absence of intrinsic agency. Alongside identifying these limitations, we also outline a forward-looking perspective on how AI may evolve beyond them through architectures that mirror neurocognitive principles. We argue that these structural limitations prevent current architectures, including deep learning and transformer-based systems, from achieving robust generalization, lifelong adaptability, and real-world autonomy. Drawing on a comparative analysis of artificial systems and biological cognition [7], and integrating insights from AI research, cognitive science, and neuroscience, we outline how these capabilities are absent in current models and why scaling alone cannot resolve them. We conclude by advocating for a paradigmatic shift toward cognitively grounded AI (cognitive autonomy) capable of self-directed adaptation, dynamic representation management, and intentional, goal-oriented behavior, paired with reformative oversight mechanisms [8] that ensure autonomous systems remain interpretable, governable, and aligned with human values.

### [151] [DialogGuard: Multi-Agent Psychosocial Safety Evaluation of Sensitive LLM Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02282)
*Han Luo,Guy Laban*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DialogGuard is a multi-agent framework for assessing psychosocial risks in LLM responses across five dimensions, using various LLM-as-a-judge pipelines to improve detection accuracy over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in mental-health and emotionally sensitive services, but their psychosocial safety remains poorly understood and weakly evaluated, creating potential risks for vulnerable users.

Method: Multi-agent framework with four LLM-as-a-judge pipelines (single-agent scoring, dual-agent correction, multi-agent debate, stochastic majority voting) using a shared three-level rubric to assess five psychosocial risk dimensions.

Result: Multi-agent mechanisms detect psychosocial risks more accurately than non-LLM baselines and single-agent judging; dual-agent correction and majority voting provide best trade-off between accuracy, human alignment, and robustness.

Conclusion: DialogGuard provides an effective open-source framework for assessing LLM psychosocial safety, supporting prompt design, auditing, and supervision of web-facing applications for vulnerable populations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now mediate many web-based mental-health, crisis, and other emotionally sensitive services, yet their psychosocial safety in these settings remains poorly understood and weakly evaluated. We present DialogGuard, a multi-agent framework for assessing psychosocial risks in LLM-generated responses along five high-severity dimensions: privacy violations, discriminatory behaviour, mental manipulation, psychological harm, and insulting behaviour. DialogGuard can be applied to diverse generative models through four LLM-as-a-judge pipelines, including single-agent scoring, dual-agent correction, multi-agent debate, and stochastic majority voting, grounded in a shared three-level rubric usable by both human annotators and LLM judges. Using PKU-SafeRLHF with human safety annotations, we show that multi-agent mechanisms detect psychosocial risks more accurately than non-LLM baselines and single-agent judging; dual-agent correction and majority voting provide the best trade-off between accuracy, alignment with human ratings, and robustness, while debate attains higher recall but over-flags borderline cases. We release Dialog-Guard as open-source software with a web interface that provides per-dimension risk scores and explainable natural-language rationales. A formative study with 12 practitioners illustrates how it supports prompt design, auditing, and supervision of web-facing applications for vulnerable users.

Method: Proposes MERINDA framework that replaces iterative neural ODE solvers with a parallelizable neural architecture equivalent to NODEs, specifically designed for FPGA acceleration to overcome memory and energy constraints.

Result: Achieves nearly 11x lower DRAM usage and 2.2x faster runtime compared to mobile GPUs, with experiments revealing an inverse relationship between memory and energy at fixed accuracy.

Conclusion: MERINDA demonstrates suitability for resource-constrained, real-time mission-critical autonomous systems by providing efficient FPGA-accelerated Model Recovery with significant memory and speed improvements.

Abstract: Model Recovery (MR) enables safe, explainable decision making in mission-critical autonomous systems (MCAS) by learning governing dynamical equations, but its deployment on edge devices is hindered by the iterative nature of neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), which are inefficient on FPGAs. Memory and energy consumption are the main concerns when applying MR on edge devices for real-time operation. We propose MERINDA, a novel FPGA-accelerated MR framework that replaces iterative solvers with a parallelizable neural architecture equivalent to NODEs. MERINDA achieves nearly 11x lower DRAM usage and 2.2x faster runtime compared to mobile GPUs. Experiments reveal an inverse relationship between memory and energy at fixed accuracy, highlighting MERINDA's suitability for resource-constrained, real-time MCAS.

*Varun Kumar Dasoju,Qingsu Cheng,Zeyun Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Achieves 95.5% Dice score for breast cell segmentation using only 599 training images with quantum-inspired edge enhancement and adaptive loss functions to handle severe class imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image annotation requires extensive time and expertise from pathologists, creating a bottleneck in clinical AI development. The paper addresses the challenge of limited annotated data for breast cell segmentation where breast tissue represents only 4% of pixels and 60% of images contain no breast regions.

Method: Uses quantum-inspired edge enhancement via multi-scale Gabor filters to create a fourth input channel, stabilized multi-component loss function with adaptive Dice loss and boundary-aware terms, complexity-based weighted sampling, EfficientNet-B7/UNet++ architecture with 4-to-3 channel projection, and robust validation with exponential moving averaging and statistical outlier detection.

Result: Achieves 95.5% Dice score +/- 0.3% and 91.2% IoU +/- 0.4%. Quantum-based enhancement improves boundary accuracy by 2.1%, while weighted sampling increases small lesion detection by 3.8%.

Conclusion: The framework significantly reduces medical expert time required for dataset creation by achieving state-of-the-art performance with limited annotations, addressing a fundamental bottleneck in clinical perception AI development.

Abstract: Annotating medical images demands significant time and expertise, often requiring pathologists to invest hundreds of hours in labeling mammary epithelial nuclei datasets. We address this critical challenge by achieving 95.5% Dice score using just 599 training images for breast cell segmentation, where just 4% of pixels represent breast tissue and 60% of images contain no breast regions. Our framework uses quantum-inspired edge enhancement via multi-scale Gabor filters creating a fourth input channel, enhancing boundary detection where inter-annotator variations reach +/- 3 pixels. We present a stabilized multi-component loss function that integrates adaptive Dice loss with boundary-aware terms and automatic positive weighting to effectively address severe class imbalance, where mammary epithelial cell regions comprise only 0.1%-20% of the total image area. Additionally, a complexity-based weighted sampling strategy is introduced to prioritize the challenging mammary epithelial cell regions. The model employs an EfficientNet-B7/UNet++ architecture with a 4-to-3 channel projection, enabling the use of pretrained weights despite limited medical imaging data. Finally, robust validation is achieved through exponential moving averaging and statistical outlier detection, ensuring reliable performance estimates on a small validation set (129 images). Our framework achieves a Dice score of 95.5% +/- 0.3% and an IoU of 91.2% +/- 0.4%. Notably, quantum-based enhancement contributes to a 2.1% improvement in boundary accuracy, while weighted sampling increases small lesion detection by 3.8%. By achieving groundbreaking performance with limited annotations, our approach significantly reduces the medical expert time required for dataset creation, addressing a fundamental bottleneck in clinical perception AI development.

*Boyu Zhu,Xiaofei Wen,Wenjie Jacky Mo,Tinghui Zhu,Yanan Xie,Peng Qi,Muhao Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OmniGuard is a family of omni-modal guardrails for large language models that performs safeguarding across text, images, videos, and audio with reasoning ability, trained on a comprehensive 210K+ multimodal safety dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety guardrails are mostly unimodal and use binary classification, which lacks robustness across diverse modalities and tasks in omni-modal LLMs that process text, images, videos, and audio.

Method: Proposed OmniGuard, the first family of omni-modal guardrails with deliberate reasoning ability. Created a large omni-modal safety dataset (210K+ samples) covering all modalities through unimodal and cross-modal samples, annotated with structured safety labels and expert model critiques via targeted distillation.

Result: Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks show OmniGuard achieves strong effectiveness and generalization across wide range of multimodal safety scenarios.

Conclusion: OmniGuard provides a unified framework for enforcing policies and mitigating risks across all modalities, paving the way for more robust omnimodal safeguarding systems.

Abstract: Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs) that process text, images, videos, and audio introduce new challenges for safety and value guardrails in human-AI interaction. Prior guardrail research largely targets unimodal settings and typically frames safeguarding as binary classification, which limits robustness across diverse modalities and tasks. To address this gap, we propose OmniGuard, the first family of omni-modal guardrails that performs safeguarding across all modalities with deliberate reasoning ability. To support the training of OMNIGUARD, we curate a large, comprehensive omni-modal safety dataset comprising over 210K diverse samples, with inputs that cover all modalities through both unimodal and cross-modal samples. Each sample is annotated with structured safety labels and carefully curated safety critiques from expert models through targeted distillation. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks show that OmniGuard achieves strong effectiveness and generalization across a wide range of multimodal safety scenarios. Importantly, OmniGuard provides a unified framework that enforces policies and mitigates risks in omni-modalities, paving the way toward building more robust and capable omnimodal safeguarding systems.

*Qiyao Xue,Weichen Liu,Shiqi Wang,Haoming Wang,Yuyang Wu,Wei Gao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VLMs struggle with multi-view spatial reasoning due to poor cross-view consistency and geometric coherence, prompting creation of ReMindView-Bench for systematic evaluation and revealing progressive information loss during reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models fail to maintain geometric coherence and cross-view consistency in spatial reasoning tasks, lacking benchmarks that isolate multi-view reasoning from single-view perception and temporal factors.

Method: Created ReMindView-Bench benchmark with systematic variation of viewpoint spatial patterns and query types, evaluated 15 VLMs using explicit phase-wise analysis (LLM-as-a-judge, self-consistency) and implicit analysis (linear probing, entropy dynamics).

Result: VLMs perform well on in-frame perception but degrade sharply when integrating information across views, showing consistent failures in cross-view alignment and perspective-taking, with progressive loss of task-relevant information and uncertainty separation.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides cognitive diagnosis of VLM spatial reasoning limitations, revealing how multi-view spatial mental models degrade across reasoning phases, with implications for improving geometric reasoning in vision-language models.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a core aspect of human intelligence that allows perception, inference and planning in 3D environments. However, current vision-language models (VLMs) struggle to maintain geometric coherence and cross-view consistency for spatial reasoning in multi-view settings. We attribute this gap to the lack of fine-grained benchmarks that isolate multi-view reasoning from single-view perception and temporal factors. To address this, we present ReMindView-Bench, a cognitively grounded benchmark for evaluating how VLMs construct, align and maintain spatial mental models across complementary viewpoints. ReMindView-Bench systematically varies viewpoint spatial pattern and query type to probe key factors of spatial cognition. Evaluations of 15 current VLMs reveals consistent failures in cross-view alignment and perspective-taking in multi-view spatial reasoning, motivating deeper analysis on the reasoning process. Explicit phase-wise analysis using LLM-as-a-judge and self-consistency prompting shows that VLMs perform well on in-frame perception but degrade sharply when integrating information across views. Implicit analysis, including linear probing and entropy dynamics, further show progressive loss of task-relevant information and uncertainty separation between correct and incorrect trajectories. These results provide a cognitively grounded diagnosis of VLM spatial reasoning and reveal how multi-view spatial mental models are formed, degraded and destabilized across reasoning phases. The ReMindView-Bench benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Xue0823/ReMindView-Bench, and the source codes of benchmark construction and VLM reasoning analysis are available at https://github.com/pittisl/ReMindView-Bench.

*Ran Zhang,Kun Ouyang,Tiancheng Ma,Yida Yang,Dong Fang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-powered generative agents simulate MMO player behavior for cost-effective game system optimization without disrupting real players.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MMO optimization methods (large-scale online experiments, parameter tuning) are costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to player experience, while simplified offline simulations lack fidelity to real player reasoning.

Method: Develop generative agent-based MMO simulation using LLMs fine-tuned with SFT and RL on real player data, combined with data-driven environment models trained on gameplay logs.

Result: System shows strong consistency with real-world player behaviors and plausible causal responses under interventions, providing reliable simulation for optimization.

Conclusion: LLM-powered generative agents offer a reliable, interpretable, and cost-efficient framework for data-driven numerical design optimization in MMOs.

Abstract: Optimizing numerical systems and mechanism design is crucial for enhancing player experience in Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) games. Traditional optimization approaches rely on large-scale online experiments or parameter tuning over predefined statistical models, which are costly, time-consuming, and may disrupt player experience. Although simplified offline simulation systems are often adopted as alternatives, their limited fidelity prevents agents from accurately mimicking real player reasoning and reactions to interventions. To address these limitations, we propose a generative agent-based MMO simulation system empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs). By applying Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on large-scale real player behavioral data, we adapt LLMs from general priors to game-specific domains, enabling realistic and interpretable player decision-making. In parallel, a data-driven environment model trained on real gameplay logs reconstructs dynamic in-game systems. Experiments demonstrate strong consistency with real-world player behaviors and plausible causal responses under interventions, providing a reliable, interpretable, and cost-efficient framework for data-driven numerical design optimization.

### [157] [Synthetic Error Injection Fails to Elicit Self-Correction In Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02389)
*David X. Wu,Shreyas Kapur,Anant Sahai,Stuart Russell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Supervised learning with synthetic error injection fails to induce effective self-correction in language models, unlike successful RL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To find computationally cheaper alternatives to reinforcement learning for developing self-correction capabilities in language models, inspired by techniques from autonomous driving and robotics.

Method: Inject artificial errors into reasoning chains, mask them, and use supervised learning to train models to recognize and correct these synthetic mistakes.

Result: The approach fails to significantly improve performance even on simple synthetic tasks, and models often parrot original mistakes even when catching errors. Distribution shift from synthetic to on-policy errors degrades correction capabilities.

Conclusion: Synthetic error injection via supervised learning is ineffective for self-correction, explaining why on-policy reinforcement learning methods remain uniquely effective for this task.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become the dominant paradigm for eliciting reasoning and self-correction capabilities in large language models, but its computational expense motivates exploration of alternatives. Inspired by techniques from autonomous driving and robotics, we investigate whether supervised learning with synthetic error injection can induce self-correction abilities in language models. Our approach inserts artificial errors into reasoning chains, masks them, and supervises the model to recognize and correct these mistakes. Despite the intuitive appeal of this method, we find that it fails to significantly improve performance even on simple synthetic tasks across multiple models. Moreover, even when the model catches its own error, it often parrots the original mistake. We find that the distribution shift of synthetic errors to on-policy errors significantly degrades the error-correction capabilities of the fine-tuned model, even with good synthetic coverage of on-policy errors. Our results help explain why on-policy reinforcement learning methods have proven uniquely effective for eliciting self-correction.

*Agostino Capponi,Alfio Gliozzo,Brian Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI agent pipeline identifies hidden relationships between prediction markets using NLP, achieving 60-70% accuracy and enabling trading strategies with ~20% returns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prediction markets suffer from fragmentation with overlapping questions, implicit equivalences, and hidden contradictions across different markets, making it difficult to identify relationships between seemingly unrelated contracts.

Method: An agentic AI pipeline that: (1) clusters markets into topical groups using natural-language understanding of contract text and metadata, and (2) identifies market pairs with strong outcome dependencies (correlated or anti-correlated) within clusters.

Result: The agent achieves 60-70% accuracy in predicting market relationships. Trading strategies based on these relationships earn about 20% average returns over week-long horizons on historical Polymarket data.

Conclusion: Agentic AI and large language models can effectively uncover latent semantic structure in prediction markets, transforming discovered relationships into actionable trading signals with significant financial returns.

Abstract: Prediction markets allow users to trade on outcomes of real-world events, but are prone to fragmentation through overlapping questions, implicit equivalences, and hidden contradictions across markets. We present an agentic AI pipeline that autonomously (i) clusters markets into coherent topical groups using natural-language understanding over contract text and metadata, and (ii) identifies within-cluster market pairs whose resolved outcomes exhibit strong dependence, including same-outcome (correlated) and different-outcome (anti-correlated) relationships. Using a historical dataset of resolved markets on Polymarket, we evaluate the accuracy of the agent's relational predictions. We then translate discovered relationships into a simple trading strategy to quantify how these relationships map to actionable signals. Results show that agent-identified relationships achieve roughly 60-70% accuracy, and their induced trading strategies earn about 20% average returns over week-long horizons, highlighting the ability of agentic AI and large language models to uncover latent semantic structure in prediction markets.

*Wenhao Yu,Zhenwen Liang,Chengsong Huang,Kishan Panaganti,Tianqing Fang,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: R-Few introduces a guided Self-Play Challenger-Solver framework with lightweight human oversight to enable stable AI self-evolution, achieving iterative improvements on reasoning benchmarks while using significantly less human data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI self-evolution systems often plateau or degrade due to concept drift, diversity collapse, and mis-evolution, where models reinforce their own biases. The goal is to enable stable, controllable self-evolution with minimal human supervision.

Method: R-Few uses a guided Self-Play Challenger-Solver framework: Challenger samples human-labeled examples to guide synthetic question generation, while Solver jointly trains on human and synthetic examples under an online, difficulty-based curriculum.

Result: Qwen3-8B-Base improves by +3.0 points over R-Zero on math tasks and achieves performance on par with General-Reasoner, despite using 20x less human data. The framework mitigates drift and yields stable co-evolutionary dynamics.

Conclusion: R-Few demonstrates that guided self-play with lightweight human oversight enables stable, iterative self-evolution, achieving strong performance with minimal human data while avoiding common pitfalls of unguided self-evolving systems.

Abstract: AI self-evolution has long been envisioned as a path toward superintelligence, where models autonomously acquire, refine, and internalize knowledge from their own learning experiences. Yet in practice, unguided self-evolving systems often plateau quickly or even degrade as training progresses. These failures arise from issues such as concept drift, diversity collapse, and mis-evolution, as models reinforce their own biases and converge toward low-entropy behaviors. To enable models to self-evolve in a stable and controllable manner while minimizing reliance on human supervision, we introduce R-Few, a guided Self-Play Challenger-Solver framework that incorporates lightweight human oversight through in-context grounding and mixed training. At each iteration, the Challenger samples a small set of human-labeled examples to guide synthetic question generation, while the Solver jointly trains on human and synthetic examples under an online, difficulty-based curriculum. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Few achieves consistent and iterative improvements. For example, Qwen3-8B-Base improves by +3.0 points over R-Zero on math tasks and achieves performance on par with General-Reasoner, despite the latter being trained on 20 times more human data. Ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of grounded challenger training and curriculum-based solver training, and further analysis shows that R-Few mitigates drift, yielding more stable and controllable co-evolutionary dynamics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: COPE, a Chain-of-Thought enhanced LLM framework using LLaMA-3-8B, predicts 90-day functional outcomes after acute ischemic stroke from clinical notes with accuracy comparable to GPT-4.1 and superior to traditional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical notes contain rich contextual information for stroke outcome prediction but their unstructured nature limits use in traditional predictive models, creating a need for advanced NLP approaches.

Method: Two-step Chain-of-Thought framework using sequential LLaMA-3-8B models: first generates clinical reasoning, second outputs mRS prediction; compared against GPT-4.1, ClinicalBERT, structured ML model, and single-step LLM.

Result: COPE achieved MAE of 1.01, +/-1 accuracy of 74.4%, exact accuracy of 32.8%, comparable to GPT-4.1 and superior to ClinicalBERT (MAE 1.24), Clinical ML (MAE 1.28), and single-step LLM (MAE 1.20).

Conclusion: COPE provides an accurate, lightweight, interpretable, privacy-preserving open-source solution for stroke outcome prediction from unstructured clinical text, demonstrating practical clinical utility.

Abstract: Predicting outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) guides clinical decision-making, patient counseling, and resource allocation. Clinical notes contain rich contextual information, but their unstructured nature limits their use in traditional predictive models. We developed and evaluated the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Outcome Prediction Engine (COPE), a reasoning-enhanced large language model framework, for predicting 90-day functional outcomes after AIS from unstructured clinical notes. This study included 464 AIS patients with discharge summaries and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. COPE uses a two-step CoT framework based on sequential open-source LLaMA-3-8B models: the first generates clinical reasoning, and the second outputs an mRS prediction. We compared COPE with GPT-4.1, ClinicalBERT, a structured variable-based machine learning model (Clinical ML), and a single-step LLM without CoT. Performance was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), accuracy within +/-1 mRS point, and exact accuracy. COPE achieved an MAE of 1.01 (95% CI 0.92-1.11), +/-1 accuracy of 74.4% (69.9, 78.8%), and exact accuracy of 32.8% (28.0, 37.6%), comparable to GPT-4.1 and superior to ClinicalBERT [MAE 1.24 (1.13-1.36)], Clinical ML [1.28 (1.18-1.39)], and the single-step LLM [1.20 (1.09-1.33)]. Subgroup analyses showed consistent performance across sex and age, with slightly higher error among older patients, those undergoing thrombectomy, and those with longer summaries. These findings demonstrate that COPE, a lightweight, interpretable, and privacy-preserving open-source framework, provides an accurate and practical solution for outcome prediction from unstructured clinical text.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current content moderation systems have limitations in identifying implicit risks and lack interpretable judgment processes, especially as digital content grows exponentially.

Method: Proposes Aetheria framework with five core agents that use multi-agent debate and collaboration with RAG-based knowledge retrieval for dynamic, mutually persuasive analysis of multimodal content.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on AIR-Bench benchmark show Aetheria generates detailed traceable audit reports and outperforms baselines in overall content safety accuracy, especially for implicit risk identification.

Conclusion: Aetheria establishes a transparent and interpretable paradigm that significantly advances trustworthy AI content moderation through its collaborative multi-agent debate approach.

Abstract: The exponential growth of digital content presents significant challenges for content safety. Current moderation systems, often based on single models or fixed pipelines, exhibit limitations in identifying implicit risks and providing interpretable judgment processes. To address these issues, we propose Aetheria, a multimodal interpretable content safety framework based on multi-agent debate and collaboration.Employing a collaborative architecture of five core agents, Aetheria conducts in-depth analysis and adjudication of multimodal content through a dynamic, mutually persuasive debate mechanism, which is grounded by RAG-based knowledge retrieval.Comprehensive experiments on our proposed benchmark (AIR-Bench) validate that Aetheria not only generates detailed and traceable audit reports but also demonstrates significant advantages over baselines in overall content safety accuracy, especially in the identification of implicit risks. This framework establishes a transparent and interpretable paradigm, significantly advancing the field of trustworthy AI content moderation.

### [162] [Empathy Level Prediction in Multi-Modal Scenario with Supervisory Documentation Assistance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02558)
*Yufei Xiao,Shangfei Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multi-modal empathy prediction method using video, audio, and text with supervisory document-assisted training that outperforms existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current empathy prediction methods focus on single modalities (usually text) and ignore multi-modal processing capabilities and privileged information that could contain additional empathetic content.

Method: Multi-modal empathy prediction network using pre-trained models to extract video, audio, and text features with cross-modal fusion. Supervisory documents (counseling topics and empathy displays) are used as privileged information during training via Latent Dirichlet Allocation to constrain text features.

Result: Experimental results on multi-modal and dialogue empathy datasets show the approach is superior to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-modal empathy prediction method with supervisory document-assisted training effectively leverages privileged information during training to improve empathy prediction performance across multiple modalities.

Abstract: Prevalent empathy prediction techniques primarily concentrate on a singular modality, typically textual, thus neglecting multi-modal processing capabilities. They also overlook the utilization of certain privileged information, which may encompass additional empathetic content. In response, we introduce an advanced multi-modal empathy prediction method integrating video, audio, and text information. The method comprises the Multi-Modal Empathy Prediction and Supervisory Documentation Assisted Training. We use pre-trained networks in the empathy prediction network to extract features from various modalities, followed by a cross-modal fusion. This process yields a multi-modal feature representation, which is employed to predict empathy labels. To enhance the extraction of text features, we incorporate supervisory documents as privileged information during the assisted training phase. Specifically, we apply the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to identify potential topic distributions to constrain text features. These supervisory documents, created by supervisors, focus on the counseling topics and the counselor's display of empathy. Notably, this privileged information is only available during training and is not accessible during the prediction phase. Experimental results on the multi-modal and dialogue empathy datasets demonstrate that our approach is superior to the existing methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PaperDebugger is an in-editor, multi-agent academic writing assistant that integrates LLM-driven reasoning directly into LaTeX editors like Overleaf, overcoming technical challenges of editor synchronization and state management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM writing assistants remain external to editors, preventing deep interaction with document state, structure, and revision history, making it impossible to support agentic, context-aware operations directly within LaTeX editors.

Method: A Chrome-approved extension with Kubernetes-native orchestration layer and Model Context Protocol (MCP) toolchain that integrates literature search, reference lookup, document scoring, and revision pipelines, enabling bidirectional editor synchronization, fine-grained version control, and multi-agent scheduling.

Result: A fully integrated workflow with localized edits, structured reviews, parallel agent execution, and diff-based updates in a minimal-intrusion UI, with early aggregated analytics showing active user engagement.

Conclusion: PaperDebugger demonstrates the practicality of an editor-native, agentic writing assistant that brings LLM-driven reasoning directly into academic writing environments, validated by user engagement metrics.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly embedded into academic writing workflows, yet existing assistants remain external to the editor, preventing deep interaction with document state, structure, and revision history. This separation makes it impossible to support agentic, context-aware operations directly within LaTeX editors such as Overleaf. We present PaperDebugger, an in-editor, multi-agent, and plugin-based academic writing assistant that brings LLM-driven reasoning directly into the writing environment. Enabling such in-editor interaction is technically non-trivial: it requires reliable bidirectional synchronization with the editor, fine-grained version control and patching, secure state management, multi-agent scheduling, and extensible communication with external tools. PaperDebugger addresses these challenges through a Chrome-approved extension, a Kubernetes-native orchestration layer, and a Model Context Protocol (MCP) toolchain that integrates literature search, reference lookup, document scoring, and revision pipelines. Our demo showcases a fully integrated workflow, including localized edits, structured reviews, parallel agent execution, and diff-based updates, encapsulated within a minimal-intrusion user interface (UI). Early aggregated analytics demonstrate active user engagement and validate the practicality of an editor-native, agentic writing assistant.

### [164] [IACT: A Self-Organizing Recursive Model for General AI Agents: A Technical White Paper on the Architecture Behind kragent.ai](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02605)
*Pengju Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IACT is a dynamic agent workflow model that grows recursive agent topologies from user dialogue instead of requiring pre-defined graphs, enabling runtime error correction through bidirectional dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of static, hard-coded agent workflows that require pre-defined graphs and specialized programming, and to address error propagation in unidirectional function calls.

Method: Interactive Agents Call Tree (IACT) model that autonomously grows dynamic, recursive agent topologies from user dialogue, using bidirectional stateful dialogues instead of rigid invocations for interactional redundancy.

Result: Successfully deployed in production (kragent.ai system) with qualitative evidence from real-world workflows showing ability to scale organizational complexity and handle runtime error correction.

Conclusion: IACT provides a general-purpose autonomous system that dynamically adapts to problem structures through dialogue-driven agent topology growth, enabling more flexible and robust agent workflows than traditional static approaches.

Abstract: This technical white paper introduces the Interactive Agents Call Tree (IACT), a computational model designed to address the limitations of static, hard-coded agent workflows. Unlike traditional systems that require pre-defined graphs or specialized programming, IACT operates as a general-purpose autonomous system driven purely by user dialogue. Given a high-level objective, the system autonomously grows a dynamic, recursive agent topology incrementally tailored to the problem's structure. This allows it to scale its organizational complexity to match open-ended tasks. To mitigate the error propagation inherent in unidirectional function calls, IACT introduces interactional redundancy by replacing rigid invocations with bidirectional, stateful dialogues. This mechanism enables runtime error correction and ambiguity resolution. We describe the architecture, design principles, and practical lessons behind the production deployment of this model in the kragent.ai system, presenting qualitative evidence from real-world workflows rather than exhaustive benchmark results.

### [165] [Target-specific Adaptation and Consistent Degradation Alignment for Cross-Domain Remaining Useful Life Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02610)
*Yubo Hou,Mohamed Ragab,Min Wu,Chee-Keong Kwoh,Xiaoli Li,Zhenghua Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TACDA is a novel domain adaptation method for cross-domain RUL prediction that addresses domain discrepancy by combining target domain reconstruction with consistent degradation stage alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional data-driven RUL prediction methods assume training and testing data come from the same distribution, which doesn't hold in real industrial settings. Existing adversarial domain adaptation methods overlook target-specific information and degradation stage inconsistencies, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: TACDA proposes: 1) Target domain reconstruction strategy within adversarial adaptation to retain target-specific information while learning domain-invariant features; 2) Novel clustering and pairing strategy for consistent alignment between similar degradation stages.

Result: Extensive experiments show TACDA achieves remarkable performance, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches on two different evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: TACDA effectively addresses domain discrepancy in cross-domain RUL prediction by preserving target-specific information and ensuring consistent degradation stage alignment, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) in machinery can significantly diminish maintenance costs, enhance equipment up-time, and mitigate adverse outcomes. Data-driven RUL prediction techniques have demonstrated commendable performance. However, their efficacy often relies on the assumption that training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution or domain, which does not hold in real industrial settings. To mitigate this domain discrepancy issue, prior adversarial domain adaptation methods focused on deriving domain-invariant features. Nevertheless, they overlook target-specific information and inconsistency characteristics pertinent to the degradation stages, resulting in suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel domain adaptation approach for cross-domain RUL prediction named TACDA. Specifically, we propose a target domain reconstruction strategy within the adversarial adaptation process, thereby retaining target-specific information while learning domain-invariant features. Furthermore, we develop a novel clustering and pairing strategy for consistent alignment between similar degradation stages. Through extensive experiments, our results demonstrate the remarkable performance of our proposed TACDA method, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches with regard to two different evaluation metrics.

*Mattia Giuri,Mathias Jackermeier,Alessandro Abate*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes GNN-based method for RL agents to follow LTL instructions in environments with simultaneous, interacting events by conditioning policies on Boolean formula sequences aligned with automaton transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LTL-to-automata approaches for RL fail in environments where multiple atomic propositions can be true simultaneously and interact complexly, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios.

Method: Conditions policy on sequences of Boolean formulae aligned with automaton transitions, encoded via graph neural network (GNN) to create structured task representations that handle simultaneous events.

Result: Experiments in complex chess-based environment demonstrate advantages over existing approaches in handling environments with multiple simultaneous, interacting events.

Conclusion: The proposed GNN-based approach successfully addresses limitations of previous LTL instruction-following methods by better handling environments with complex simultaneous event interactions.

Abstract: Linear temporal logic (LTL) is a compelling framework for specifying complex, structured tasks for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Recent work has shown that interpreting LTL instructions as finite automata, which can be seen as high-level programs monitoring task progress, enables learning a single generalist policy capable of executing arbitrary instructions at test time. However, existing approaches fall short in environments where multiple high-level events (i.e., atomic propositions) can be true at the same time and potentially interact in complicated ways. In this work, we propose a novel approach to learning a multi-task policy for following arbitrary LTL instructions that addresses this shortcoming. Our method conditions the policy on sequences of simple Boolean formulae, which directly align with transitions in the automaton, and are encoded via a graph neural network (GNN) to yield structured task representations. Experiments in a complex chess-based environment demonstrate the advantages of our approach.

*Zhiyuan He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Standard transformers struggle with recursive reasoning depth generalization, so authors propose a looped locate-and-replace pipeline using specialized models to decompose and solve nested problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face challenges with recursive reasoning problems involving nested hierarchical structures, particularly depth generalization (handling deeper recursion than seen in training), which is distinct from length generalization and stems from transformers' inability to maintain stack-like behavior for tracking nested dependencies.

Method: Developed a novel looped locate-and-replace pipeline that decomposes recursive problems using two specialized models: a locator that identifies solvable subexpressions and a replacer that evaluates these components while preserving overall structure.

Result: The method effectively alleviates performance decay when tested on out-of-distribution recursion depth across three domains: Boolean algebra, recursive arithmetic, and propositional logic, each with controllable depth of recursion.

Conclusion: The proposed approach addresses transformers' architectural limitations in handling recursive reasoning depth generalization by decomposing complex nested problems into manageable subcomponents through specialized pipeline design.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across many tasks, yet face significant challenges when dealing with recursive reasoning problems, those requiring the resolution of nested hierarchical structures. While prior research has extensively studied length generalization (a model's ability to handle longer sequences than seen during training), we investigate a distinct and underexplored limitation: depth generalization. Here, depth refers to the number of nested levels in a hierarchical problem, such as the layers of parentheses in a mathematical expression or the nesting of logical clauses in a Boolean formula. Our work reveals that standard transformer architectures struggle with problems involving deeper recursion than encountered during training, even when they perform well on longer but non-nested sequences. This limitation stems from their inability to maintain stack-like behavior, the capacity to track and resolve multiple levels of nested dependencies. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate how this architectural constraint leads to rapid performance decay as the depth of the recursion increases. To address this challenge, we develop a novel looped locate-and-replace pipeline that decomposes recursive problems into manageable subcomponents. The approach employs two specialized models: a locator that identifies solvable subexpressions and a replacer that evaluates these components while preserving the overall structure. We evaluated this method in three carefully designed domains: Boolean algebra, recursive arithmetic, and propositional logic, each with a controllable depth of recursion. We show that our method effectively alleviates the performance decay when tested on out-of-distribution recursion depth.

*Hyeongseop Rha,Jeong Hun Yeo,Junil Won,Se Jin Park,Yong Man Ro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MIGR framework improves multimodal emotion understanding by identifying emotion-dominant modality and reorganizing reasoning sequences to start from that modality, reducing reasoning drift and improving explanation reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal emotion understanding methods suffer from reasoning drift where models gradually rely on generated text over multimodal evidence, and explanations become overly shaped by visually initiated reasoning paths rather than emotion-dominant cues.

Method: Introduces Modality Importance (MI) mechanism to identify emotion-dominant modality, then reorganizes reasoning sequences to start explanations from that modality. Uses two-stage framework: modality-aligned supervised fine-tuning and modality-aware reward optimization to generate emotionally grounded, causally relevant explanations.

Result: On DFEW benchmark, MIGR substantially improves reasoning reliability, decreasing instances of correct predictions with emotionally inconsistent explanations from 18.10% to 7.37%.

Conclusion: Starting reasoning from the emotion-dominant modality significantly improves reliability of multimodal emotion understanding, confirming the benefit of modality-guided reasoning sequences.

Abstract: In this paper, we present Modality-Importance-Guided Reasoning (MIGR), a framework designed to improve the reliability of reasoning-based multimodal emotion understanding in multimodal large language models. Although existing methods have advanced emotion understanding, they often suffer from reasoning drift: models gradually rely on their own generated text instead of multimodal evidence, and their explanations are overly shaped by visually initiated reasoning paths. To address these issues, we introduce Modality Importance (MI), a simple yet effective mechanism for identifying the emotion-dominant modality. Using MI, MIGR reorganizes reasoning sequences so that explanations begin from the modality most critical to the target emotion, preventing early reasoning from being misled by less informative cues. Our two-stage framework-comprising modality-aligned supervised fine-tuning and modality-aware reward optimization-encourages models to generate emotionally grounded, causally relevant, and coherence-preserving explanations. Experimental results on the DFEW benchmark show that MIGR substantially improves reasoning reliability, decreasing instances of correct predictions accompanied by emotionally inconsistent explanations from 18.10% to 7.37%. These results confirm the benefit of initiating reasoning from the emotion-dominant modality.

TL;DR: Framework uses multimodal LLMs to extract ontology-aligned knowledge graphs from images, enabling tracing of training data influences on generative model outputs for copyright analysis and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address growing concerns about transparency, accountability, and copyright violations in generative AI by developing methods to understand how specific training data contributes to model outputs.

Method: Uses multimodal large language models to extract structured triples from images, constructing ontology-aligned knowledge graphs. Compares KGs of generated images with training images to trace potential influences.

Result: Validated through experiments on locally trained models via unlearning and on large-scale models through style-specific experiments. Framework enables copyright analysis, dataset transparency, and interpretable AI.

Conclusion: The framework supports development of AI systems that foster human collaboration, creativity, and curiosity by providing interpretability and traceability for generative model outputs.

Abstract: As generative models become powerful, concerns around transparency, accountability, and copyright violations have intensified. Understanding how specific training data contributes to a model's output is critical. We introduce a framework for interpreting generative outputs through the automatic construction of ontologyaligned knowledge graphs (KGs). While automatic KG construction from natural text has advanced, extracting structured and ontology-consistent representations from visual content remains challenging -- due to the richness and multi-object nature of images. Leveraging multimodal large language models (LLMs), our method extracts structured triples from images, aligned with a domain-specific ontology. By comparing the KGs of generated and training images, we can trace potential influences, enabling copyright analysis, dataset transparency, and interpretable AI. We validate our method through experiments on locally trained models via unlearning, and on large-scale models through a style-specific experiment. Our framework supports the development of AI systems that foster human collaboration, creativity and stimulate curiosity.

Abstract: Mental health conditions affect hundreds of millions globally, yet early detection remains limited. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in mental health applications, their size and computational demands hinder practical deployment. Small language models (SLMs) offer a lightweight alternative, but their use for social media--based mental health prediction remains largely underexplored. In this study, we introduce Menta, the first optimized SLM fine-tuned specifically for multi-task mental health prediction from social media data. Menta is jointly trained across six classification tasks using a LoRA-based framework, a cross-dataset strategy, and a balanced accuracy--oriented loss. Evaluated against nine state-of-the-art SLM baselines, Menta achieves an average improvement of 15.2\% across tasks covering depression, stress, and suicidality compared with the best-performing non--fine-tuned SLMs. It also achieves higher accuracy on depression and stress classification tasks compared to 13B-parameter LLMs, while being approximately 3.25x smaller. Moreover, we demonstrate real-time, on-device deployment of Menta on an iPhone 15 Pro Max, requiring only approximately 3GB RAM. Supported by a comprehensive benchmark against existing SLMs and LLMs, Menta highlights the potential for scalable, privacy-preserving mental health monitoring.

TL;DR: StockMem: A dual-layer memory framework for stock prediction that structures news into events, tracks their evolution, and builds causal knowledge bases to improve forecasting accuracy and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stock prediction is difficult due to market volatility and sensitivity to real-time events. LLMs face challenges with noisy financial news data and lack explicit answers in text. Existing memory architectures fail to identify key price movement drivers.

Method: Proposes StockMem, an event-reflection dual-layer memory framework that structures news into events with horizontal consolidation (daily event integration) and longitudinal tracking (event evolution). Builds temporal event knowledge base and reflection knowledge base of causal experiences by analyzing event-price dynamics.

Result: Experiments show StockMem outperforms existing memory architectures and provides superior, explainable reasoning by tracing the information chain affecting prices, enhancing decision transparency in financial forecasting.

Conclusion: StockMem effectively addresses challenges in financial forecasting by structuring event information, tracking evolution, and building causal knowledge, resulting in improved prediction performance and explainable reasoning for better decision transparency.

Abstract: Stock price prediction is challenging due to market volatility and its sensitivity to real-time events. While large language models (LLMs) offer new avenues for text-based forecasting, their application in finance is hindered by noisy news data and the lack of explicit answers in text. General-purpose memory architectures struggle to identify the key drivers of price movements. To address this, we propose StockMem, an event-reflection dual-layer memory framework. It structures news into events and mines them along two dimensions: horizontal consolidation integrates daily events, while longitudinal tracking captures event evolution to extract incremental information reflecting market expectation discrepancies. This builds a temporal event knowledge base. By analyzing event-price dynamics, the framework further forms a reflection knowledge base of causal experiences. For prediction, it retrieves analogous historical scenarios and reasons with current events, incremental data, and past experiences. Experiments show StockMem outperforms existing memory architectures and provides superior, explainable reasoning by tracing the information chain affecting prices, enhancing decision transparency in financial forecasting.

TL;DR: Extends psychometric battery framework to dynamical systems, formalizing agents as flows parameterized by computational resources with a Generator-Verifier-Updater operator, deriving a Variance Inequality for stable self-improvement, and unifying various self-improvement architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the static AAI capability score framework to dynamical systems where agents improve over time, providing a mathematical foundation for understanding self-improvement mechanisms in AI systems.

Method: Formalizes agents as flows ν_r parameterized by computational resource r using a recursive Generator-Verifier-Updater (GVU) operator, proves this generates a vector field on parameter manifold Θ, identifies self-improvement coefficient κ as Lie derivative, and derives Variance Inequality spectral condition for stability.

Result: Derives sufficient condition for positive self-improvement (κ>0): combined noise of generation and verification must be small enough (accounting for curvature and step-size effects). Shows that architectures like STaR, SPIN, Reflexion, GANs, and AlphaZero are specific topological realizations of GVU operator satisfying Variance Inequality.

Conclusion: Provides a unified mathematical framework for understanding self-improvement in AI systems, connecting various architectures through the GVU operator and Variance Inequality, offering theoretical foundations for analyzing and designing self-improving agents.

Abstract: We extend the moduli-theoretic framework of psychometric batteries to the domain of dynamical systems. While previous work established the AAI capability score as a static functional on the space of agent representations, this paper formalizes the agent as a flow $ν_r$ parameterized by computational resource $r$, governed by a recursive Generator-Verifier-Updater (GVU) operator. We prove that this operator generates a vector field on the parameter manifold $Θ$, and we identify the coefficient of self-improvement $κ$ as the Lie derivative of the capability functional along this flow.
  The central contribution of this work is the derivation of the Variance Inequality, a spectral condition that is sufficient (under mild regularity) for the stability of self-improvement. We show that a sufficient condition for $κ> 0$ is that, up to curvature and step-size effects, the combined noise of generation and verification must be small enough.
  We then apply this formalism to unify the recent literature on Language Self-Play (LSP), Self-Correction, and Synthetic Data bootstrapping. We demonstrate that architectures such as STaR, SPIN, Reflexion, GANs and AlphaZero are specific topological realizations of the GVU operator that satisfy the Variance Inequality through filtration, adversarial discrimination, or grounding in formal systems.

Motivation: To create post-hoc XAI explanations that are both understandable (using clear concept vocabulary) and faithful to the model being explained, addressing the gap between interpretability needs and complex model behavior.

Method: Concept-based causal framework using probability of sufficiency calculations for concept interventions to generate local and global explanations. Implemented as proof-of-concept model on CelebA dataset classifiers.

Result: Demonstrated understandability through concept-based vocabulary with implicit causal interpretation, and addressed fidelity by highlighting framework assumptions and alignment between explanation interpretation and generation contexts.

Conclusion: Proposed causal concept-based XAI framework successfully balances understandability and fidelity requirements, though careful attention to framework assumptions and context alignment is crucial for valid explanations.

Abstract: This work presents a conceptual framework for causal concept-based post-hoc Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), based on the requirements that explanations for non-interpretable models should be understandable as well as faithful to the model being explained. Local and global explanations are generated by calculating the probability of sufficiency of concept interventions. Example explanations are presented, generated with a proof-of-concept model made to explain classifiers trained on the CelebA dataset. Understandability is demonstrated through a clear concept-based vocabulary, subject to an implicit causal interpretation. Fidelity is addressed by highlighting important framework assumptions, stressing that the context of explanation interpretation must align with the context of explanation generation.

TL;DR: Proposes a prompt-free collaborative agent framework for automated paper reproduction that uses verification and refinement agents to improve code generation quality without manual prompt engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated paper reproduction frameworks lack verification mechanisms at each generation step and rely heavily on manually designed prompts for self-refinement, limiting adaptability and scalability.

Method: Uses two collaborative agents: a verification agent that checks outputs against system prompt requirements, and a refinement agent that revises outputs based on identified issues. The framework operates without human-crafted refinement prompts, using only original system prompts.

Result: Achieves 15% improvement in accuracy and 13% improvement in completeness of reproduced code compared to baseline without agents. Outperforms Self-Refine approach across PaperBench Code-Dev and Paper2CodeBench datasets.

Conclusion: The prompt-free collaborative agent framework significantly enhances automated paper-to-code generation quality, demonstrating robustness and consistency while eliminating the need for manual prompt engineering.

Abstract: Automated paper reproduction has emerged as a promising approach to accelerate scientific research, employing multi-step workflow frameworks to systematically convert academic papers into executable code. However, existing frameworks often lack mechanisms to verify and refine the outputs at each generation step, or rely heavily on manually designed prompts for self-refinement, which limits their adaptability and scalability. To address these limitations, we propose a prompt-free collaborative agent framework that automatically enhances the quality of paper-to-code generation. Our approach employs two collaborative agents: a verification agent that examines whether the outputs at each step satisfy the requirements specified in the corresponding system prompt, and a refinement agent that revises the outputs based on the identified issues. Unlike previous methods that require human experts to craft specific refinement prompts for each step, our framework achieves automatic verification and improvement by leveraging only the original system prompts. We integrate our collaborative agents into the Paper2Code framework and conduct comprehensive experiments on PaperBench Code-Dev and Paper2CodeBench datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the accuracy and completeness of reproduced code, achieving performance gains of approximately 15\% and 13\%, respectively, compared to the baseline without our agents. Furthermore, comparative experiments against Self-Refine validate the robustness and consistency of our prompt-free approach across different datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated radiology reporting tools focus only on report generation and neglect quality control, which is critical but tedious. There's a need for comprehensive AI support that mimics the full radiologist workflow including quality assurance.

Method: Agentic AI system using LLMs as reasoning backbone with orchestrated tools: region localization, think-with-image region analysis planning, strategic template selection, quality assessment, and feedback-driven adaptive refinement for quality control.

Result: Experimental results show Radiologist Copilot significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in radiology reporting performance.

Conclusion: Radiologist Copilot provides comprehensive AI assistance for accurate, complete, and efficient radiology reporting by automating both generation and quality control, improving clinical efficiency.

Abstract: Radiology reporting is an essential yet time-consuming and error-prone task for radiologists in clinical examinations, especially for volumetric medical images. Rigorous quality control is also critical but tedious, ensuring that the final report meets clinical standards. Existing automated approaches, including radiology report generation methods and medical vision-language models, focus mainly on the report generation phase and neglect the crucial quality control procedure, limiting their capability to provide comprehensive support to radiologists. We propose Radiologist Copilot, an agentic AI assistant equipped with orchestrated tools designed for automated radiology reporting with quality control. Leveraging large language models as the reasoning backbone, the agentic system autonomously selects tools, plans, and executes actions, emulating the behavior of radiologists throughout the holistic radiology reporting process. The orchestrated tools include region localization, think with image paradigm directed region analysis planning, strategic template selection for report generation, quality assessment and feedback-driven adaptive refinement for quality control. Therefore, Radiologist Copilot facilitates accurate, complete, and efficient radiology reporting, assisting radiologists and improving clinical efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that Radiologist Copilot significantly surpasses other state-of-the-art methods in radiology reporting. The source code will be released upon acceptance.

### [178] [Martingale Score: An Unsupervised Metric for Bayesian Rationality in LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02914)
*Zhonghao He,Tianyi Qiu,Hirokazu Shirado,Maarten Sap*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM reasoning often shows belief entrenchment where current beliefs predict future updates, violating Bayesian principles and indicating confirmation bias rather than truth-seeking behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in LLM reasoning, there's concern that iterative reasoning may promote belief entrenchment and confirmation bias rather than improving truth-seeking. The authors want to systematically evaluate whether LLMs exhibit rational belief updating or show biased reasoning patterns.

Method: Proposed a framework using the Martingale property from Bayesian statistics, which states that under rational updating, future beliefs should be unpredictable from current beliefs. Developed an unsupervised, regression-based Martingale Score to measure violations of this property, indicating belief entrenchment. Tested across open-ended domains including event forecasting, value-laden questions, and academic paper review.

Result: Found widespread violations of the Martingale property across models and setups, where current beliefs positively predict future belief updates (belief entrenchment). Identified which models, reasoning techniques, and domains are more prone to this bias. Validated the Martingale Score by showing it predicts ground-truth accuracy where labels are available.

Conclusion: LLM reasoning often exhibits belief entrenchment rather than rational Bayesian updating, and the proposed Martingale Score serves as an effective unsupervised proxy for evaluating truth-seeking ability in reasoning processes, even in domains without ground truth.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning techniques have substantially improved the performance of large language models (LLMs), raising expectations for their ability to provide accurate, truthful, and reliable information. However, emerging evidence suggests that iterative reasoning may foster belief entrenchment and confirmation bias, rather than enhancing truth-seeking behavior. In this study, we propose a systematic evaluation framework for belief entrenchment in LLM reasoning by leveraging the Martingale property from Bayesian statistics. This property implies that, under rational belief updating, the expected value of future beliefs should remain equal to the current belief, i.e., belief updates are unpredictable from the current belief. We propose the unsupervised, regression-based Martingale Score to measure violations of this property, which signal deviation from the Bayesian ability of updating on new evidence. In open-ended problem domains including event forecasting, value-laden questions, and academic paper review, we find such violations to be widespread across models and setups, where the current belief positively predicts future belief updates, a phenomenon which we term belief entrenchment. We identify the models, reasoning techniques, and domains more prone to belief entrenchment. Finally, we validate the Martingale Score by showing that it predicts ground-truth accuracy on problem domains where ground truth labels are available. This indicates that, while designed as an unsupervised metric that operates even in domains without access to ground truth, the Martingale Score is a useful proxy of the truth-seeking ability of a reasoning process.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM security methods (preference training, prompting, filtering) still leave models vulnerable to abuse, especially in long-context scenarios where jailbreak probability increases. Need robust security guarantees for long-context LLMs.

Method: Invasive Context Engineering - inserting control sentences directly into the LLM context as a form of context engineering. This approach can be generalized to Chain-of-Thought processes to prevent scheming. Method doesn't require LLM training, avoiding data shortage issues in long-context training.

Result: Not specified in abstract, but the approach is presented as a partial solution to the long-context LLM security problem.

Conclusion: Invasive Context Engineering offers a training-free approach to improve LLM security in long-context situations, addressing limitations of current methods and avoiding data shortage problems associated with training for long contexts.

Abstract: Current research on operator control of Large Language Models improves model robustness against adversarial attacks and misbehavior by training on preference examples, prompting, and input/output filtering. Despite good results, LLMs remain susceptible to abuse, and jailbreak probability increases with context length. There is a need for robust LLM security guarantees in long-context situations. We propose control sentences inserted into the LLM context as invasive context engineering to partially solve the problem. We suggest this technique can be generalized to the Chain-of-Thought process to prevent scheming. Invasive Context Engineering does not rely on LLM training, avoiding data shortage pitfalls which arise in training models for long context situations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can mediate online conflicts through judgment and steering tasks, with API models outperforming open-source ones, showing promise but limitations for social mediation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs increasingly mediate online communication, there's a need to explore their potential beyond content moderation to actually foster empathy and constructive dialogue in online conflicts.

Method: Framework decomposes mediation into judgment (evaluating fairness/emotional dynamics) and steering (generating empathetic messages). Uses Reddit-based dataset and multi-stage evaluation pipeline with principle-based scoring, user simulation, and human comparison.

Result: API-based models outperform open-source counterparts in both reasoning and intervention alignment for mediation tasks.

Conclusion: Current LLMs show both promise and limitations as emerging agents for online social mediation, highlighting the frontier for responsible AI research.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities for AI for good applications. As LLMs increasingly mediate online communication, their potential to foster empathy and constructive dialogue becomes an important frontier for responsible AI research. This work explores whether LLMs can serve not only as moderators that detect harmful content, but as mediators capable of understanding and de-escalating online conflicts. Our framework decomposes mediation into two subtasks: judgment, where an LLM evaluates the fairness and emotional dynamics of a conversation, and steering, where it generates empathetic, de-escalatory messages to guide participants toward resolution. To assess mediation quality, we construct a large Reddit-based dataset and propose a multi-stage evaluation pipeline combining principle-based scoring, user simulation, and human comparison. Experiments show that API-based models outperform open-source counterparts in both reasoning and intervention alignment when doing mediation. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current LLMs as emerging agents for online social mediation.
