Abstract: We present CageDroneRF (CDRF), a large-scale benchmark for Radio-Frequency (RF) drone detection and identification built from real-world captures and systematically generated synthetic variants. CDRF addresses the scarcity and limited diversity of existing RF datasets by coupling extensive raw recordings with a principled augmentation pipeline that (i) precisely controls Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), (ii) injects interfering emitters, and (iii) applies frequency shifts with label-consistent bounding-box transformations for detection. This dataset spans a wide range of contemporary drone models, many unavailable in current public datasets, and acquisition conditions, derived from data collected at the Rowan University campus and within a controlled RF-cage facility. CDRF is released with interoperable open-source tools for data generation, preprocessing, augmentation, and evaluation that also operate on existing public benchmarks. CDRF enables standardized benchmarking for classification, open-set recognition, and object detection, supporting rigorous comparisons and reproducible pipelines. By releasing this comprehensive benchmark and tooling, CDRF aims to accelerate progress toward robust, generalizable RF perception models.

### [3] [Mass Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models with Concept Hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03305)
*Jiahang Tu,Ye Li,Yiming Wu,Hanbin Zhao,Chao Zhang,Hui Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes SuPLoRA: a hierarchical concept erasure method for diffusion models that groups related concepts under supertypes and uses shared parameters for efficient multi-concept suppression while preserving generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current concept erasure methods become inefficient and ineffective as the number of erased concepts grows, requiring separate fine-tuned parameters for each concept and degrading overall generation quality.

Method: Introduces a supertype-subtype concept hierarchy where related concepts are grouped under parent nodes. Uses Supertype-Preserving Low-Rank Adaptation (SuPLoRA) that encodes supertype information in frozen down-projection matrices and only updates up-projection matrices during erasure, with diffusion regularization for unmasked regions.

Result: Theoretical analysis demonstrates effectiveness in mitigating generation degradation. A more challenging benchmark is constructed for simultaneous erasure across diverse domains (celebrities, objects, pornographic content).

Conclusion: SuPLoRA provides an effective and efficient group-wise suppression method for concept erasure in diffusion models that maintains generation quality while handling multiple related concepts through hierarchical organization.

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has raised concerns about the generation of unsafe or harmful content, prompting concept erasure approaches that fine-tune modules to suppress specific concepts while preserving general generative capabilities. However, as the number of erased concepts grows, these methods often become inefficient and ineffective, since each concept requires a separate set of fine-tuned parameters and may degrade the overall generation quality. In this work, we propose a supertype-subtype concept hierarchy that organizes erased concepts into a parent-child structure. Each erased concept is treated as a child node, and semantically related concepts (e.g., macaw, and bald eagle) are grouped under a shared parent node, referred to as a supertype concept (e.g., bird). Rather than erasing concepts individually, we introduce an effective and efficient group-wise suppression method, where semantically similar concepts are grouped and erased jointly by sharing a single set of learnable parameters. During the erasure phase, standard diffusion regularization is applied to preserve denoising process in unmasked regions. To mitigate the degradation of supertype generation caused by excessive erasure of semantically related subtypes, we propose a novel method called Supertype-Preserving Low-Rank Adaptation (SuPLoRA), which encodes the supertype concept information in the frozen down-projection matrix and updates only the up-projection matrix during erasure. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of SuPLoRA in mitigating generation performance degradation. We construct a more challenging benchmark that requires simultaneous erasure of concepts across diverse domains, including celebrities, objects, and pornographic content.

### [4] [VLM4VLA: Revisiting Vision-Language-Models in Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03309)
*Jianke Zhang,Xiaoyu Chen,Qiuyue Wang,Mingsheng Li,Yanjiang Guo,Yucheng Hu,Jiajun Zhang,Shuai Bai,Junyang Lin,Jianyu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLM capabilities don't predict VLA performance; vision module is bottleneck; control-relevant supervision helps even with frozen encoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically study how VLM choice and competence translate to downstream VLA policy performance, challenging common assumptions about VLM capabilities predicting embodied control effectiveness.

Method: Introduces VLM4VLA, a minimal adaptation pipeline that converts general-purpose VLMs into VLA policies using only a small set of new learnable parameters for fair comparison. Conducts extensive empirical studies across three benchmarks and investigates impact of specific embodied capabilities through fine-tuning on seven auxiliary embodied tasks.

Result: VLM initialization helps but general VLM capabilities are poor predictors of downstream task performance. Improving VLM's performance on specific embodied skills doesn't guarantee better control. Visual module in VLM is the primary bottleneck, and injecting control-relevant supervision into vision encoder yields consistent gains even with frozen encoder.

Conclusion: Standard VLM competence is necessary but insufficient for effective embodied control, revealing a persistent domain gap between current VLM pretraining objectives and embodied action-planning requirements.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which integrate pretrained large Vision-Language Models (VLM) into their policy backbone, are gaining significant attention for their promising generalization capabilities. This paper revisits a fundamental yet seldom systematically studied question: how VLM choice and competence translate to downstream VLA policies performance? We introduce VLM4VLA, a minimal adaptation pipeline that converts general-purpose VLMs into VLA policies using only a small set of new learnable parameters for fair and efficient comparison. Despite its simplicity, VLM4VLA proves surprisingly competitive with more sophisticated network designs. Through extensive empirical studies on various downstream tasks across three benchmarks, we find that while VLM initialization offers a consistent benefit over training from scratch, a VLM's general capabilities are poor predictors of its downstream task performance. This challenges common assumptions, indicating that standard VLM competence is necessary but insufficient for effective embodied control. We further investigate the impact of specific embodied capabilities by fine-tuning VLMs on seven auxiliary embodied tasks (e.g., embodied QA, visual pointing, depth estimation). Contrary to intuition, improving a VLM's performance on specific embodied skills does not guarantee better downstream control performance. Finally, modality-level ablations identify the visual module in VLM, rather than the language component, as the primary performance bottleneck. We demonstrate that injecting control-relevant supervision into the vision encoder of the VLM yields consistent gains, even when the encoder remains frozen during downstream fine-tuning. This isolates a persistent domain gap between current VLM pretraining objectives and the requirements of embodied action-planning.

### [5] [Deep Learning-Based Image Recognition for Soft-Shell Shrimp Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03317)
*Yun-Hao Zhang,I-Hsien Ting,Dario Liberona,Yun-Hsiu Liu,Kazunori Minetaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning-based CNN model automates white shrimp classification post-harvest to improve freshness and prevent head-body separation issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Consumer demand for high-quality aquatic products is rising, with freshness and appearance integrity being key concerns. Shrimp freshness declines rapidly post-harvest, and soft-shell shrimp often suffer from head-body separation after cooking/freezing, affecting product appearance and consumer perception.

Method: Leverages deep learning-based image recognition with a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to replace manual sorting for automated classification of white shrimp immediately after harvest.

Result: Enhances classification accuracy, efficiency, and consistency while reducing processing time, helping maintain freshness and ensuring shrimp transportation businesses meet customer demands more effectively.

Conclusion: Automated deep learning classification of white shrimp post-harvest addresses freshness and quality issues, improving product appearance and meeting consumer demands through technology integration in aquaculture.

Abstract: With the integration of information technology into aquaculture, production has become more stable and continues to grow annually. As consumer demand for high-quality aquatic products rises, freshness and appearance integrity are key concerns. In shrimp-based processed foods, freshness declines rapidly post-harvest, and soft-shell shrimp often suffer from head-body separation after cooking or freezing, affecting product appearance and consumer perception. To address these issues, this study leverages deep learning-based image recognition for automated classification of white shrimp immediately after harvest. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model replaces manual sorting, enhancing classification accuracy, efficiency, and consistency. By reducing processing time, this technology helps maintain freshness and ensures that shrimp transportation businesses meet customer demands more effectively.

### [6] [Higher order PCA-like rotation-invariant features for detailed shape descriptors modulo rotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03326)
*Jarek Duda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Extension of PCA to higher-order tensors for rotation-invariant shape descriptors with arbitrarily high accuracy


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PCA's covariance matrix only approximates shapes as ellipsoids, which is insufficient for complex real shapes. Need more sophisticated rotation-invariant descriptors for accurate shape representation.

Method: Extend PCA to higher-order central moment tensors (order-3 or higher) and polynomial times Gaussian descriptors. These provide rotation invariants through traces of powers and other tensor operations.

Result: Creates decodable shape descriptors of arbitrarily high accuracy with rotation invariants. Enables shape representation modulo rotation without costly optimization over rotations.

Conclusion: Higher-order tensor extensions of PCA provide powerful rotation-invariant shape descriptors for complex shapes, with applications in molecular shape analysis, object recognition, and shape similarity metrics.

Abstract: PCA can be used for rotation invariant features, describing a shape with its $p_{ab}=E[(x_i-E[x_a])(x_b-E[x_b])]$ covariance matrix approximating shape by ellipsoid, allowing for rotation invariants like its traces of powers. However, real shapes are usually much more complicated, hence there is proposed its extension to e.g. $p_{abc}=E[(x_a-E[x_a])(x_b-E[x_b])(x_c-E[x_c])]$ order-3 or higher tensors describing central moments, or polynomial times Gaussian allowing decodable shape descriptors of arbitrarily high accuracy, and their analogous rotation invariants. Its practical applications could be rotation-invariant features to include shape modulo rotation e.g. for molecular shape descriptors, or for up to rotation object recognition in 2D images/3D scans, or shape similarity metric allowing their inexpensive comparison (modulo rotation) without costly optimization over rotations.

### [7] [MMErroR: A Benchmark for Erroneous Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03331)
*Yang Shi,Yifeng Xie,Minzhe Guo,Liangsi Lu,Mingxuan Huang,Jingchao Wang,Zhihong Zhu,Boyan Xu,Zhiqi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMErroR is a multi-modal benchmark with 2,013 samples containing reasoning errors across 24 subdomains, designed to evaluate VLMs' ability to detect incorrect reasoning and classify error types, not just answer correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if Vision-Language Models truly understand content by testing their ability to detect when reasoning processes are wrong and identify specific error types, moving beyond simple answer correctness evaluation.

Method: Created MMErroR benchmark with 2,013 samples embedding single coherent reasoning errors across 6 domains and 24 subdomains, then evaluated 20 advanced VLMs on their error detection and classification capabilities.

Result: Even the best model (Gemini-3.0-Pro) only classified errors correctly in 66.47% of cases, showing VLMs struggle significantly with identifying erroneous reasoning processes.

Conclusion: Current VLMs have limited ability to detect and classify reasoning errors, highlighting the need for process-level evaluation and suggesting error identification provides valuable insights into multi-modal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have improved performance in multi-modal learning, raising the question of whether these models truly understand the content they process. Crucially, can VLMs detect when a reasoning process is wrong and identify its error type? To answer this, we present MMErroR, a multi-modal benchmark of 2,013 samples, each embedding a single coherent reasoning error. These samples span 24 subdomains across six top-level domains, ensuring broad coverage and taxonomic richness. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on answer correctness, MMErroR targets a process-level, error-centric evaluation that requires models to detect incorrect reasoning and classify the error type within both visual and linguistic contexts. We evaluate 20 advanced VLMs, even the best model (Gemini-3.0-Pro) classifies the error in only 66.47\% of cases, underscoring the challenge of identifying erroneous reasoning. Furthermore, the ability to accurately identify errors offers valuable insights into the capabilities of multi-modal reasoning models. Project Page: https://mmerror-benchmark.github.io

### [8] [RelightAnyone: A Generalized Relightable 3D Gaussian Head Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03357)
*Yingyan Xu,Pramod Rao,Sebastian Weiss,Gaspard Zoss,Markus Gross,Christian Theobalt,Marc Habermann,Derek Bradley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage 3D Gaussian Splatting model for relightable head avatars that works from single/multi-view images without requiring OLAT capture data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing high-quality relighting methods require complex OLAT capture setups, limiting practical applications. Need a method that can relight avatars from standard captures without specialized lighting data.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Learn flat-lit 3DGS avatars from diverse multi-view datasets without OLAT, using dataset-specific lighting codes for self-supervised alignment. 2) Learn mapping from flat-lit avatars to physically-based reflectance parameters using a smaller OLAT dataset.

Result: Model generalizes well to relight any subject from standard captures as if they were captured under OLAT lighting. Can fit to unseen subjects from single images, enabling novel view synthesis and relighting applications.

Conclusion: Proposed method enables high-quality relightable 3D head avatars without requiring complex OLAT capture setups, making relightable avatar creation more accessible and practical.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a standard approach to reconstruct and render photorealistic 3D head avatars. A major challenge is to relight the avatars to match any scene illumination. For high quality relighting, existing methods require subjects to be captured under complex time-multiplexed illumination, such as one-light-at-a-time (OLAT). We propose a new generalized relightable 3D Gaussian head model that can relight any subject observed in a single- or multi-view images without requiring OLAT data for that subject. Our core idea is to learn a mapping from flat-lit 3DGS avatars to corresponding relightable Gaussian parameters for that avatar. Our model consists of two stages: a first stage that models flat-lit 3DGS avatars without OLAT lighting, and a second stage that learns the mapping to physically-based reflectance parameters for high-quality relighting. This two-stage design allows us to train the first stage across diverse existing multi-view datasets without OLAT lighting ensuring cross-subject generalization, where we learn a dataset-specific lighting code for self-supervised lighting alignment. Subsequently, the second stage can be trained on a significantly smaller dataset of subjects captured under OLAT illumination. Together, this allows our method to generalize well and relight any subject from the first stage as if we had captured them under OLAT lighting. Furthermore, we can fit our model to unseen subjects from as little as a single image, allowing several applications in novel view synthesis and relighting for digital avatars.

### [9] [Guardians of the Hair: Rescuing Soft Boundaries in Depth, Stereo, and Novel Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03362)
*Xiang Zhang,Yang Zhang,Lukas Mehl,Markus Gross,Christopher Schroers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HairGuard is a framework that recovers fine-grained soft boundary details in 3D vision tasks like thin hairs, using depth refinement and generative inpainting to handle ambiguous foreground-background mixing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft boundaries like thin hairs are common in natural and computer-generated imagery but remain challenging for 3D vision due to ambiguous mixing of foreground and background cues, requiring specialized handling.

Method: Proposes a data curation pipeline using image matting datasets, a depth fixer network with gated residual module for soft boundary refinement, depth-based forward warping for view synthesis, generative scene painter for disoccluded regions, and adaptive color fuser.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across monocular depth estimation, stereo image/video conversion, and novel view synthesis with significant improvements in soft boundary regions.

Conclusion: HairGuard effectively addresses soft boundary challenges in 3D vision through specialized depth refinement and generative inpainting, enabling high-quality reconstruction of fine details like hairs.

Abstract: Soft boundaries, like thin hairs, are commonly observed in natural and computer-generated imagery, but they remain challenging for 3D vision due to the ambiguous mixing of foreground and background cues. This paper introduces Guardians of the Hair (HairGuard), a framework designed to recover fine-grained soft boundary details in 3D vision tasks. Specifically, we first propose a novel data curation pipeline that leverages image matting datasets for training and design a depth fixer network to automatically identify soft boundary regions. With a gated residual module, the depth fixer refines depth precisely around soft boundaries while maintaining global depth quality, allowing plug-and-play integration with state-of-the-art depth models. For view synthesis, we perform depth-based forward warping to retain high-fidelity textures, followed by a generative scene painter that fills disoccluded regions and eliminates redundant background artifacts within soft boundaries. Finally, a color fuser adaptively combines warped and inpainted results to produce novel views with consistent geometry and fine-grained details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HairGuard achieves state-of-the-art performance across monocular depth estimation, stereo image/video conversion, and novel view synthesis, with significant improvements in soft boundary regions.

### [10] [RiskCueBench: Benchmarking Anticipatory Reasoning from Early Risk Cues in Video-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03369)
*Sha Luo,Yogesh Prabhu,Tim Ossowski,Kaiping Chen,Junjie Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces RiskCueBench, a new video risk assessment benchmark that focuses on identifying early risk signals before accidents occur, revealing current models' limitations in anticipating risky events from early visual cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video risk assessment datasets often include the full accident sequence, making the task artificially easy. Real-world safety applications require anticipating risks from early visual signals before accidents happen, which current benchmarks don't adequately address.

Method: Created RiskCueBench with carefully annotated videos that identify a "risk signal clip" - the earliest moment indicating potential safety concerns. This benchmark requires models to interpret evolving situations and anticipate future risks from early visual cues rather than observing full accident sequences.

Result: Experimental results show significant performance gaps in current systems' ability to interpret evolving situations and anticipate future risky events from early visual signals, highlighting practical deployment challenges.

Conclusion: RiskCueBench better reflects real-world conditions for video risk assessment and reveals important limitations in current models' ability to anticipate safety concerns from early visual cues, pointing to critical challenges for practical deployment of video risk prediction systems.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of video centered social media, the ability to anticipate risky events from visual data is a promising direction for ensuring public safety and preventing real world accidents. Prior work has extensively studied supervised video risk assessment across domains such as driving, protests, and natural disasters. However, many existing datasets provide models with access to the full video sequence, including the accident itself, which substantially reduces the difficulty of the task. To better reflect real world conditions, we introduce a new video understanding benchmark RiskCueBench in which videos are carefully annotated to identify a risk signal clip, defined as the earliest moment that indicates a potential safety concern. Experimental results reveal a significant gap in current systems ability to interpret evolving situations and anticipate future risky events from early visual signals, highlighting important challenges for deploying video risk prediction models in practice.

### [11] [A Novel Unified Approach to Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03382)
*Lord Sen,Shyamapada Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel deepfake detection architecture using cross-attention between spatial/frequency features and blood detection achieves SOTA results (99.80-99.88% AUC) on FF++ and Celeb-DF datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake synthesis and misuse pose significant threats to digital trust, necessitating effective detection and tagging methods to combat AI-generated fake content.

Method: Proposes unified architecture with cross-attention between spatial and frequency domain features, plus a blood detection module, using Swin Transformer/BERT or EfficientNet-B4/BERT combinations.

Result: Achieves 99.80% AUC on FF++ and 99.88% on Celeb-DF with Swin Transformer/BERT; 99.55% and 99.38% with EfficientNet-B4/BERT. Shows strong cross-dataset generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture outperforms state-of-the-art methods and generalizes well across datasets, providing an effective solution for deepfake detection in images and videos.

Abstract: The advancements in the field of AI is increasingly giving rise to various threats. One of the most prominent of them is the synthesis and misuse of Deepfakes. To sustain trust in this digital age, detection and tagging of deepfakes is very necessary. In this paper, a novel architecture for Deepfake detection in images and videos is presented. The architecture uses cross attention between spatial and frequency domain features along with a blood detection module to classify an image as real or fake. This paper aims to develop a unified architecture and provide insights into each step. Though this approach we achieve results better than SOTA, specifically 99.80%, 99.88% AUC on FF++ and Celeb-DF upon using Swin Transformer and BERT and 99.55, 99.38 while using EfficientNet-B4 and BERT. The approach also generalizes very well achieving great cross dataset results as well.

### [12] [Better, But Not Sufficient: Testing Video ANNs Against Macaque IT Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03392)
*Matteo Dunnhofer,Christian Micheloni,Kohitij Kar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Current video-based ANN models show modest improvements over static models in predicting primate IT cortex responses to naturalistic videos, but fail to capture appearance-invariant motion processing that IT exhibits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While feedforward ANNs dominate ventral stream modeling, they're limited to static computations. Primate IT cortex processes dynamic visual information including object motion, raising questions about whether IT's temporal responses reflect simple frame-by-frame processing or richer dynamic computations.

Method: Compared macaque IT responses during naturalistic videos against static, recurrent, and video-based ANN models. Used a stress test with "appearance-free" variants that preserve motion but remove shape/texture to probe generalization.

Result: Video models provided modest improvements in neural predictivity, especially at later response stages. IT population activity generalized across appearance-free manipulations, but all ANN classes failed to generalize, showing they capture appearance-bound rather than appearance-invariant dynamics.

Conclusion: Current video models better capture appearance-bound dynamics rather than the appearance-invariant temporal computations in IT, highlighting the need for new objectives that encode biological temporal statistics and invariances.

Abstract: Feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained on static images remain the dominant models of the the primate ventral visual stream, yet they are intrinsically limited to static computations. The primate world is dynamic, and the macaque ventral visual pathways, specifically the inferior temporal (IT) cortex not only supports object recognition but also encodes object motion velocity during naturalistic video viewing. Does IT's temporal responses reflect nothing more than time-unfolded feedforward transformations, framewise features with shallow temporal pooling, or do they embody richer dynamic computations? We tested this by comparing macaque IT responses during naturalistic videos against static, recurrent, and video-based ANN models. Video models provided modest improvements in neural predictivity, particularly at later response stages, raising the question of what kind of dynamics they capture. To probe this, we applied a stress test: decoders trained on naturalistic videos were evaluated on "appearance-free" variants that preserve motion but remove shape and texture. IT population activity generalized across this manipulation, but all ANN classes failed. Thus, current video models better capture appearance-bound dynamics rather than the appearance-invariant temporal computations expressed in IT, underscoring the need for new objectives that encode biological temporal statistics and invariances.

### [13] [Eye-Q: A Multilingual Benchmark for Visual Word Puzzle Solving and Image-to-Phrase Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03400)
*Ali Najar,Alireza Mirrokni,Arshia Izadyari,Sadegh Mohammadian,Amir Homayoon Sharifizade,Asal Meskin,Mobin Bagherian,Ehsaneddin Asgari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Eye-Q is a multilingual visual word puzzle benchmark requiring complex reasoning beyond surface-level recognition, where VLMs struggle with abstract and cross-lingual puzzles, achieving only 60.27% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs often rely on surface-level recognition rather than deeper reasoning, and existing benchmarks don't adequately test complex visual understanding involving implicit cues, hypothesis generation, and non-literal concept mapping.

Method: Created Eye-Q benchmark with 1,343 multilingual puzzles (English, Persian, Arabic) featuring conceptually dense scenes with brief descriptions requiring target word/phrase inference. Puzzles are unstructured, cue-implicit with distractors. Evaluated VLMs using open-ended, human-aligned protocol probing hypothesis formation and revision under lightweight assistance.

Result: Substantial performance gaps revealed, especially on abstract and cross-lingual puzzles. Maximum accuracy reached only 60.27%, highlighting limitations in current models' ability to construct and search over appropriate conceptual representations for flexible image-to-phrase inference.

Conclusion: Visual word puzzles like Eye-Q expose critical limitations in current VLMs' reasoning capabilities, particularly for abstract thinking and cross-lingual understanding, pointing to the need for more sophisticated reasoning mechanisms beyond literal grounding and retrieval-style matching.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved strong performance on standard vision-language benchmarks, yet often rely on surface-level recognition rather than deeper reasoning. We propose visual word puzzles as a challenging alternative, as they require discovering implicit visual cues, generating and revising hypotheses, and mapping perceptual evidence to non-literal concepts in ways that are difficult to solve via literal grounding, OCR-heavy shortcuts, or simple retrieval-style matching. We introduce Eye-Q, a multilingual benchmark designed to assess this form of complex visual understanding. Eye-Q contains 1,343 puzzles in which a model observes a conceptually dense scene with a brief description and must infer a specific target word or phrase. The puzzles are intentionally unstructured and cue-implicit, with distractors and contextual relationships that demand selective attention, abstraction, and associative inference. The benchmark spans English, Persian, Arabic, and cross-lingual puzzles. We evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs using an open-ended, human-aligned protocol that probes hypothesis formation and revision under lightweight assistance. Results reveal substantial performance gaps, especially on abstract and cross-lingual puzzles, highlighting limitations in current models' ability to construct and search over appropriate conceptual representations for flexible image-to-phrase inference; maximum accuracy reaches only 60.27%.

### [14] [GAMBIT: A Gamified Jailbreak Framework for Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03416)
*Xiangdong Hu,Yangyang Jiang,Qin Hu,Xiaojun Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAMBIT is a novel multimodal jailbreak framework that uses gamified scenes to exploit MLLMs' reasoning incentives, achieving high attack success rates by making models proactively complete harmful queries through structured reasoning chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal jailbreak attacks underperform on reasoning models because they don't leverage the model's own reasoning incentives. The authors propose that if models can think like humans, we can influence their cognitive-stage decisions to make them proactively complete jailbreaks.

Method: GAMBIT decomposes and reassembles harmful visual semantics, constructs gamified scenes that drive models to explore, reconstruct intent, and answer as part of winning a game. This creates structured reasoning chains that increase task complexity in both vision and text domains.

Result: GAMBIT achieves high Attack Success Rates: 92.13% on Gemini 2.5 Flash, 91.20% on QvQ-MAX, and 85.87% on GPT-4o, significantly outperforming baseline methods on both reasoning and non-reasoning MLLMs.

Conclusion: The gamified approach effectively exploits reasoning models' cognitive processes, demonstrating that structured reasoning chains can bypass safety mechanisms by positioning the model as a participant whose goal pursuit reduces safety attention.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become widely deployed, yet their safety alignment remains fragile under adversarial inputs. Previous work has shown that increasing inference steps can disrupt safety mechanisms and lead MLLMs to generate attacker-desired harmful content. However, most existing attacks focus on increasing the complexity of the modified visual task itself and do not explicitly leverage the model's own reasoning incentives. This leads to them underperforming on reasoning models (Models with Chain-of-Thoughts) compared to non-reasoning ones (Models without Chain-of-Thoughts). If a model can think like a human, can we influence its cognitive-stage decisions so that it proactively completes a jailbreak? To validate this idea, we propose GAMBI} (Gamified Adversarial Multimodal Breakout via Instructional Traps), a novel multimodal jailbreak framework that decomposes and reassembles harmful visual semantics, then constructs a gamified scene that drives the model to explore, reconstruct intent, and answer as part of winning the game. The resulting structured reasoning chain increases task complexity in both vision and text, positioning the model as a participant whose goal pursuit reduces safety attention and induces it to answer the reconstructed malicious query. Extensive experiments on popular reasoning and non-reasoning MLLMs demonstrate that GAMBIT achieves high Attack Success Rates (ASR), reaching 92.13% on Gemini 2.5 Flash, 91.20% on QvQ-MAX, and 85.87% on GPT-4o, significantly outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: WeedRepFormer successfully addresses the efficiency-accuracy tradeoff for agricultural vision tasks, enabling simultaneous segmentation and gender classification of waterhemp plants with real-time performance.

Abstract: We present WeedRepFormer, a lightweight multi-task Vision Transformer designed for simultaneous waterhemp segmentation and gender classification. Existing agricultural models often struggle to balance the fine-grained feature extraction required for biological attribute classification with the efficiency needed for real-time deployment. To address this, WeedRepFormer systematically integrates structural reparameterization across the entire architecture - comprising a Vision Transformer backbone, a Lite R-ASPP decoder, and a novel reparameterizable classification head - to decouple training-time capacity from inference-time latency. We also introduce a comprehensive waterhemp dataset containing 10,264 annotated frames from 23 plants. On this benchmark, WeedRepFormer achieves 92.18% mIoU for segmentation and 81.91% accuracy for gender classification using only 3.59M parameters and 3.80 GFLOPs. At 108.95 FPS, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art iFormer-T by 4.40% in classification accuracy while maintaining competitive segmentation performance and significantly reducing parameter count by 1.9x.

*Zeyu Dong,Yimin Zhu,Yu Wu,Yu Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FROST-Drive: A novel end-to-end autonomous driving model that keeps the vision encoder frozen to preserve VLM generalization capabilities, outperforming fully fine-tuned models on challenging long-tail scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current E2E autonomous driving models suffer from poor generalization to novel/complex scenarios because fully fine-tuning vision encoders causes over-specialization to training data, losing the broad world knowledge from pretrained VLMs.

Method: Proposes FROST-Drive architecture with frozen pretrained VLM vision encoder, transformer-based adapter for multimodal fusion, GRU-based decoder for waypoint generation, and custom loss function optimized for Rater Feedback Score (RFS).

Result: Extensive experiments on Waymo Open E2E Dataset show frozen-encoder approach significantly outperforms full fine-tuning models, demonstrating better generalization on long-tail scenarios.

Conclusion: Preserving VLM knowledge through frozen encoders is more effective for robust, generalizable driving performance than domain-specific adaptation, offering new pathway for real-world vision-based models.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) models in autonomous driving aim to directly map sensor inputs to control commands, but their ability to generalize to novel and complex scenarios remains a key challenge. The common practice of fully fine-tuning the vision encoder on driving datasets potentially limits its generalization by causing the model to specialize too heavily in the training data. This work challenges the necessity of this training paradigm. We propose FROST-Drive, a novel E2E architecture designed to preserve and leverage the powerful generalization capabilities of a pretrained vision encoder from a Vision-Language Model (VLM). By keeping the encoder's weights frozen, our approach directly transfers the rich, generalized world knowledge from the VLM to the driving task. Our model architecture combines this frozen encoder with a transformer-based adapter for multimodal fusion and a GRU-based decoder for smooth waypoint generation. Furthermore, we introduce a custom loss function designed to directly optimize for Rater Feedback Score (RFS), a metric that prioritizes robust trajectory planning. We conduct extensive experiments on Waymo Open E2E Dataset, a large-scale datasets deliberately curated to capture the long-tail scenarios, demonstrating that our frozen-encoder approach significantly outperforms models that employ full fine-tuning. Our results provide substantial evidence that preserving the broad knowledge of a capable VLM is a more effective strategy for achieving robust, generalizable driving performance than intensive domain-specific adaptation. This offers a new pathway for developing vision-based models that can better handle the complexities of real-world application domains.

Abstract: Scalability and data sparsity remain critical bottlenecks for collaborative filtering on massive interaction datasets. This work investigates the latent geometry of user preferences using the MovieLens 32M dataset, implementing a high-performance, parallelized Alternating Least Squares (ALS) framework. Through extensive hyperparameter optimization, we demonstrate that constrained low-rank models significantly outperform higher dimensional counterparts in generalization, achieving an optimal balance between Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and ranking precision. We visualize the learned embedding space to reveal the unsupervised emergence of semantic genre clusters, confirming that the model captures deep structural relationships solely from interaction data. Finally, we validate the system's practical utility in a cold-start scenario, introducing a tunable scoring parameter to manage the trade-off between popularity bias and personalized affinity effectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ThinkRL-Edit is a reasoning-centric RL framework that improves image editing by decoupling visual reasoning from synthesis, using CoT-based reasoning sampling, unbiased reward grouping, and binary checklist rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instruction-driven image editing models have limited visual reasoning capabilities, leading to poor performance on reasoning-centric edits. Existing RL approaches face challenges with limited reasoning exploration, biased reward fusion, and unstable VLM-based instruction rewards.

Method: Proposes ThinkRL-Edit with three key innovations: (1) CoT-based reasoning sampling with planning and reflection stages before generation, (2) unbiased chain preference grouping across reward dimensions instead of weighted aggregation, and (3) binary checklist rewards replacing interval-based VLM scores for more precise and interpretable feedback.

Result: The method significantly outperforms prior work on reasoning-centric image editing, producing instruction-faithful, visually coherent, and semantically grounded edits.

Conclusion: ThinkRL-Edit successfully addresses key challenges in RL-based image editing by expanding reasoning exploration beyond denoising stochasticity, providing unbiased reward fusion, and using more stable, interpretable reward mechanisms for complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Instruction-driven image editing with unified multimodal generative models has advanced rapidly, yet their underlying visual reasoning remains limited, leading to suboptimal performance on reasoning-centric edits. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been investigated for improving the quality of image editing, but it faces three key challenges: (1) limited reasoning exploration confined to denoising stochasticity, (2) biased reward fusion, and (3) unstable VLM-based instruction rewards. In this work, we propose ThinkRL-Edit, a reasoning-centric RL framework that decouples visual reasoning from image synthesis and expands reasoning exploration beyond denoising. To the end, we introduce Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based reasoning sampling with planning and reflection stages prior to generation in online sampling, compelling the model to explore multiple semantic hypotheses and validate their plausibility before committing to a visual outcome. To avoid the failures of weighted aggregation, we propose an unbiased chain preference grouping strategy across multiple reward dimensions. Moreover, we replace interval-based VLM scores with a binary checklist, yielding more precise, lower-variance, and interpretable rewards for complex reasoning. Experiments show our method significantly outperforms prior work on reasoning-centric image editing, producing instruction-faithful, visually coherent, and semantically grounded edits.

*Yunqi Hong,Kuei-Chun Kao,Hengguang Zhou,Cho-Jui Hsieh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight artifact reward model to combat reward hacking in RL post-training for text-to-image generation, where models exploit imperfect reward functions to generate unrealistic images that score high.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward functions in RL post-training for text-to-image models are imperfect proxies for human judgment, leading to reward hacking where models generate unrealistic or low-quality images that still achieve high reward scores.

Method: The authors systematically analyze reward hacking behaviors, investigate how aesthetic/human preference and prompt-image consistency rewards contribute to hacking, and propose a lightweight adaptive artifact reward model trained on a small curated dataset of artifact-free and artifact-containing samples that can be integrated into existing RL pipelines as a regularizer.

Result: Experiments show that incorporating the artifact reward significantly improves visual realism and reduces reward hacking across multiple text-to-image RL setups, demonstrating effectiveness as a safeguard against reward hacking.

Conclusion: A lightweight artifact reward model can effectively serve as a regularizer to mitigate reward hacking in RL post-training for text-to-image generation, improving visual realism while maintaining the benefits of existing reward models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a standard approach for post-training large language models and, more recently, for improving image generation models, which uses reward functions to enhance generation quality and human preference alignment. However, existing reward designs are often imperfect proxies for true human judgment, making models prone to reward hacking--producing unrealistic or low-quality images that nevertheless achieve high reward scores. In this work, we systematically analyze reward hacking behaviors in text-to-image (T2I) RL post-training. We investigate how both aesthetic/human preference rewards and prompt-image consistency rewards individually contribute to reward hacking and further show that ensembling multiple rewards can only partially mitigate this issue. Across diverse reward models, we identify a common failure mode: the generation of artifact-prone images. To address this, we propose a lightweight and adaptive artifact reward model, trained on a small curated dataset of artifact-free and artifact-containing samples. This model can be integrated into existing RL pipelines as an effective regularizer for commonly used reward models. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating our artifact reward significantly improves visual realism and reduces reward hacking across multiple T2I RL setups, demonstrating the effectiveness of lightweight reward augment serving as a safeguard against reward hacking.

*Yuzhe Sun,Zhe Dong,Haochen Jiang,Tianzhu Liu,Yanfeng Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an uncertainty-guided framework for referring remote sensing image segmentation that uses pixel-wise uncertainty maps to adaptively modulate language fusion and refinement based on spatial ambiguity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use uniform fusion/refinement across entire images, which introduces unnecessary linguistic noise in clear regions while failing to disambiguate confused areas, due to spatial non-uniformity in cross-modal alignment reliability caused by scale variations, dense distractors, and complex boundaries.

Method: Introduces a Referring Uncertainty Scorer (RUS) trained via online error-consistency supervision to predict spatial ambiguity. Uses this uncertainty map to guide two plug-and-play modules: Uncertainty-Gated Fusion (UGF) dynamically modulates language injection strength, and Uncertainty-Driven Local Refinement (UDLR) focuses refinement on error-prone boundaries using uncertainty-derived soft masks.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method significantly improves robustness and geometric fidelity in complex remote sensing scenes without altering backbone architecture, functioning as a unified plug-and-play solution.

Conclusion: The uncertainty-guided framework effectively addresses spatial non-uniformity in cross-modal alignment by adaptively orchestrating inference based on predicted referential ambiguity, enhancing performance in challenging remote sensing scenarios.

Abstract: Referring remote sensing image segmentation aims to localize specific targets described by natural language within complex overhead imagery. However, due to extreme scale variations, dense similar distractors, and intricate boundary structures, the reliability of cross-modal alignment exhibits significant \textbf{spatial non-uniformity}. Existing methods typically employ uniform fusion and refinement strategies across the entire image, which often introduces unnecessary linguistic perturbations in visually clear regions while failing to provide sufficient disambiguation in confused areas. To address this, we propose an \textbf{uncertainty-guided framework} that explicitly leverages a pixel-wise \textbf{referring uncertainty map} as a spatial prior to orchestrate adaptive inference. Specifically, we introduce a plug-and-play \textbf{Referring Uncertainty Scorer (RUS)}, which is trained via an online error-consistency supervision strategy to interpretably predict the spatial distribution of referential ambiguity. Building on this prior, we design two plug-and-play modules: 1) \textbf{Uncertainty-Gated Fusion (UGF)}, which dynamically modulates language injection strength to enhance constraints in high-uncertainty regions while suppressing noise in low-uncertainty ones; and 2) \textbf{Uncertainty-Driven Local Refinement (UDLR)}, which utilizes uncertainty-derived soft masks to focus refinement on error-prone boundaries and fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method functions as a unified, plug-and-play solution that significantly improves robustness and geometric fidelity in complex remote sensing scenes without altering the backbone architecture.

*Yuxuan Xia,Siheng Wang,Peng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDCD is a training-free method that reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs by disrupting structural information to suppress texture-driven visual biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object hallucination remains a critical challenge in LVLMs, and existing approaches overlook internal complexities of visual encoding. The paper identifies visual statistical bias from Vision Encoders' Bag-of-Patches behavior under weak structural supervision as a key contributing factor to hallucinations.

Method: Structure-Disrupted Contrastive Decoding (SDCD) - a training-free algorithm that performs contrastive calibration of output distributions by introducing shuffled structure-disrupted views. It penalizes tokens that maintain high confidence under structure-less views to suppress texture-driven bias.

Result: SDCD significantly mitigates hallucinations across multiple benchmarks and enhances overall multimodal capabilities of LVLMs.

Conclusion: Addressing visual statistical bias through structure disruption effectively reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs, and SDCD provides a practical training-free solution for improving multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate significant progress in multimodal understanding and reasoning, yet object hallucination remains a critical challenge. While existing research focuses on mitigating language priors or high-level statistical biases, they often overlook the internal complexities of the visual encoding process. We identify that visual statistical bias, arising from the inherent Bag-of-Patches behavior of Vision Encoders under weak structural supervision, acts as a contributing factor of object hallucinations. Under this bias, models prioritize local texture features within individual patches over holistic geometric structures. This tendency may induce spurious visual confidence and result in hallucinations. To address this, we introduce a training-free algorithm called Structure-Disrupted Contrastive Decoding (SDCD), which performs contrastive calibration of the output distribution by introducing a shuffled structure-disrupted view. By penalizing tokens that maintain high confidence under this structure-less view, SDCD effectively suppresses the texture-driven bias. Experimental results demonstrate that SDCD significantly mitigates hallucinations across multiple benchmarks and enhances the overall multimodal capabilities of LVLMs.

TL;DR: G2P transfers appearance-aware attributes from 3D Gaussian Splatting to point clouds for better semantic segmentation by addressing geometry-appearance misalignment and geometric ambiguity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point clouds are sparse and irregular, providing limited appearance evidence. Geometry-only features are insufficient to distinguish objects with similar shapes but different appearances (color, texture, material).

Method: Gaussian-to-Point (G2P) transfers appearance-aware attributes from 3D Gaussian Splatting to point clouds. It establishes point-wise correspondences to address misalignment between optimized Gaussians and original point geometry, uses Gaussian opacity attributes to resolve geometric ambiguity, and leverages Gaussian scale attributes for precise boundary localization.

Result: Achieves superior performance on standard benchmarks with significant improvements on geometrically challenging classes, all without any 2D or language supervision.

Conclusion: G2P enables more discriminative and appearance-consistent segmentation of point clouds by effectively transferring appearance-aware attributes from 3D Gaussian Splatting, overcoming limitations of geometry-only approaches.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation on point clouds is critical for 3D scene understanding. However, sparse and irregular point distributions provide limited appearance evidence, making geometry-only features insufficient to distinguish objects with similar shapes but distinct appearances (e.g., color, texture, material). We propose Gaussian-to-Point (G2P), which transfers appearance-aware attributes from 3D Gaussian Splatting to point clouds for more discriminative and appearance-consistent segmentation. Our G2P address the misalignment between optimized Gaussians and original point geometry by establishing point-wise correspondences. By leveraging Gaussian opacity attributes, we resolve the geometric ambiguity that limits existing models. Additionally, Gaussian scale attributes enable precise boundary localization in complex 3D scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on standard benchmarks and shows significant improvements on geometrically challenging classes, all without any 2D or language supervision.

### [25] [Semantic Belief-State World Model for 3D Human Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03517)
*Sarim Chaudhry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SBWM reframes human motion prediction as latent dynamical simulation on the human body manifold using belief-state world models, enabling stable long-horizon rollouts with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sequence regression approaches for human motion prediction suffer from compounding drift, mean-pose collapse, and poorly calibrated uncertainty when rolled forward beyond training. These methods don't separate observation reconstruction from dynamics modeling and lack explicit representation of latent causes governing motion.

Method: SBWM maintains a recurrent probabilistic belief state whose evolution is learned independently of pose reconstruction and explicitly aligned with SMPL-X anatomical parameterization. This creates a structural information bottleneck that forces the latent state to capture motion dynamics, intent, and control-relevant structure rather than static geometry or noise. The approach adapts stochastic latent transitions and rollout-centric training from belief-state world models in reinforcement learning.

Result: SBWM demonstrates coherent long-horizon rollouts and competitive accuracy at substantially lower computational cost compared to RSSM-based, transformer, and diffusion approaches optimized for reconstruction fidelity.

Conclusion: Treating the human body as part of the world model's state space rather than its output fundamentally changes how motion is simulated and predicted, enabling stable forward simulation and better separation of dynamics from observation.

Abstract: Human motion prediction has traditionally been framed as a sequence regression problem where models extrapolate future joint coordinates from observed pose histories. While effective over short horizons this approach does not separate observation reconstruction with dynamics modeling and offers no explicit representation of the latent causes governing motion. As a result, existing methods exhibit compounding drift, mean-pose collapse, and poorly calibrated uncertainty when rolled forward beyond the training regime. Here we propose a Semantic Belief-State World Model (SBWM) that reframes human motion prediction as latent dynamical simulation on the human body manifold. Rather than predicting poses directly, SBWM maintains a recurrent probabilistic belief state whose evolution is learned independently of pose reconstruction and explicitly aligned with the SMPL-X anatomical parameterization. This alignment imposes a structural information bottleneck that prevents the latent state from encoding static geometry or sensor noise, forcing it to capture motion dynamics, intent, and control-relevant structure. Inspired by belief-state world models developed for model-based reinforcement learning, SBWM adapts stochastic latent transitions and rollout-centric training to the domain of human motion. In contrast to RSSM-based, transformer, and diffusion approaches optimized for reconstruction fidelity, SBWM prioritizes stable forward simulation. We demonstrate coherent long-horizon rollouts, and competitive accuracy at substantially lower computational cost. These results suggest that treating the human body as part of the world models state space rather than its output fundamentally changes how motion is simulated, and predicted.

*Samson Oseiwe Ajadalu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Monocular 3D detection using pseudo-LiDAR shows that depth backbone choice (NeWCRFs vs Depth Anything V2) dominates performance, with geometric fidelity being more important than appearance or semantic feature injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D object detection is cheaper than LiDAR but less accurate due to depth estimation challenges. The paper aims to systematically evaluate how depth backbones and feature engineering affect pseudo-LiDAR pipelines.

Method: Systematic evaluation comparing NeWCRFs (supervised metric depth) against Depth Anything V2 Metric-Outdoor in identical pseudo-LiDAR pipeline with PointRCNN detection. Tested point-cloud augmentations using grayscale intensity and semantic cues (instance segmentation confidence), and conducted depth-accuracy-versus-distance diagnostic using ground-truth 2D boxes.

Result: NeWCRFs outperforms Depth Anything V2, achieving 10.50% AP₃D at IoU=0.7 on KITTI Moderate split. Appearance and semantic features provide only marginal gains, and mask-based sampling can degrade performance. Depth backbone choice and geometric fidelity dominate over secondary feature injection.

Conclusion: Under off-the-shelf LiDAR detectors, depth-backbone selection and geometric fidelity are the primary performance drivers for monocular 3D detection, outweighing secondary feature engineering like appearance or semantic cues.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection offers a low-cost alternative to LiDAR, yet remains less accurate due to the difficulty of estimating metric depth from a single image. We systematically evaluate how depth backbones and feature engineering affect a monocular Pseudo-LiDAR pipeline on the KITTI validation split. Specifically, we compare NeWCRFs (supervised metric depth) against Depth Anything V2 Metric-Outdoor (Base) under an identical pseudo-LiDAR generation and PointRCNN detection protocol. NeWCRFs yields stronger downstream 3D detection, achieving 10.50\% AP$_{3D}$ at IoU$=0.7$ on the Moderate split using grayscale intensity (Exp~2). We further test point-cloud augmentations using appearance cues (grayscale intensity) and semantic cues (instance segmentation confidence). Contrary to the expectation that semantics would substantially close the gap, these features provide only marginal gains, and mask-based sampling can degrade performance by removing contextual geometry. Finally, we report a depth-accuracy-versus-distance diagnostic using ground-truth 2D boxes (including Ped/Cyc), highlighting that coarse depth correctness does not fully predict strict 3D IoU. Overall, under an off-the-shelf LiDAR detector, depth-backbone choice and geometric fidelity dominate performance, outweighing secondary feature injection.

TL;DR: PCNet improves thermal UAV image super-resolution using optical guidance with physics-constrained thermal conduction to prevent artifacts and preserve high-frequency details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing optical-guided thermal super-resolution methods compress optical features, losing high-frequency information and causing physically inconsistent artifacts like texture distortions and edge blurring due to ignoring imaging physics differences between modalities.

Method: Proposes PCNet with three key components: 1) Cross-Resolution Mutual Enhancement Module (CRME) for joint optimization of thermal super-resolution and optical-to-thermal conversion with bidirectional feature interaction; 2) Physics-Driven Thermal Conduction Module (PDTM) incorporating 2D heat conduction into optical guidance; 3) Temperature consistency loss enforcing regional distribution consistency and boundary gradient smoothness.

Result: Extensive experiments on VGTSR2.0 and DroneVehicle datasets show PCNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both reconstruction quality and downstream tasks including semantic segmentation and object detection.

Conclusion: PCNet successfully addresses limitations of existing optical-guided thermal super-resolution methods by incorporating physics constraints through thermal conduction modeling, achieving robust performance while preventing physically inconsistent artifacts.

Abstract: Optics-guided thermal UAV image super-resolution has attracted significant research interest due to its potential in all-weather monitoring applications. However, existing methods typically compress optical features to match thermal feature dimensions for cross-modal alignment and fusion, which not only causes the loss of high-frequency information that is beneficial for thermal super-resolution, but also introduces physically inconsistent artifacts such as texture distortions and edge blurring by overlooking differences in the imaging physics between modalities. To address these challenges, we propose PCNet to achieve cross-resolution mutual enhancement between optical and thermal modalities, while physically constraining the optical guidance process via thermal conduction to enable robust thermal UAV image super-resolution. In particular, we design a Cross-Resolution Mutual Enhancement Module (CRME) to jointly optimize thermal image super-resolution and optical-to-thermal modality conversion, facilitating effective bidirectional feature interaction across resolutions while preserving high-frequency optical priors. Moreover, we propose a Physics-Driven Thermal Conduction Module (PDTM) that incorporates two-dimensional heat conduction into optical guidance, modeling spatially-varying heat conduction properties to prevent inconsistent artifacts. In addition, we introduce a temperature consistency loss that enforces regional distribution consistency and boundary gradient smoothness to ensure generated thermal images align with real-world thermal radiation principles. Extensive experiments on VGTSR2.0 and DroneVehicle datasets demonstrate that PCNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both reconstruction quality and downstream tasks including semantic segmentation and object detection.

Conclusion: MDENeRF effectively combines monocular depth estimation with NeRF-based refinement to produce depth maps with both global structure and fine geometric details.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation has applications in many fields, such as autonomous navigation and extended reality, making it an essential computer vision task. However, current methods often produce smooth depth maps that lack the fine geometric detail needed for accurate scene understanding. We propose MDENeRF, an iterative framework that refines monocular depth estimates using depth information from Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). MDENeRF consists of three components: (1) an initial monocular estimate for global structure, (2) a NeRF trained on perturbed viewpoints, with per-pixel uncertainty, and (3) Bayesian fusion of the noisy monocular and NeRF depths. We derive NeRF uncertainty from the volume rendering process to iteratively inject high-frequency fine details. Meanwhile, our monocular prior maintains global structure. We demonstrate superior performance on key metrics and experiments using indoor scenes from the SUN RGB-D dataset.

Motivation: Pixel-level annotation for cloud detection is expensive, creating a need for semi-supervised approaches that can effectively utilize abundant unlabeled remote sensing imagery.

Method: Generates three augmented views per unlabeled image: one weakly augmented view plus two strongly augmented views using inter-scene mixing (for contextual variety) and intra-scene mixing (for semantic coherence), then enforces prediction consistency across these views for pseudolabel generation.

Result: Extensive experiments show CloudMatch achieves good performance, demonstrating effective utilization of unlabeled data and advancing semi-supervised cloud detection.

Conclusion: CloudMatch successfully leverages unlabeled remote sensing imagery through view-consistency learning with scene-mixing augmentations, capturing structural diversity and contextual richness of cloud patterns for improved semi-supervised cloud detection.

Abstract: Due to the high cost of annotating accurate pixel-level labels, semi-supervised learning has emerged as a promising approach for cloud detection. In this paper, we propose CloudMatch, a semi-supervised framework that effectively leverages unlabeled remote sensing imagery through view-consistency learning combined with scene-mixing augmentations. An observation behind CloudMatch is that cloud patterns exhibit structural diversity and contextual variability across different scenes and within the same scene category. Our key insight is that enforcing prediction consistency across diversely augmented views, incorporating both inter-scene and intra-scene mixing, enables the model to capture the structural diversity and contextual richness of cloud patterns. Specifically, CloudMatch generates one weakly augmented view along with two complementary strongly augmented views for each unlabeled image: one integrates inter-scene patches to simulate contextual variety, while the other employs intra-scene mixing to preserve semantic coherence. This approach guides pseudolabel generation and enhances generalization. Extensive experiments show that CloudMatch achieves good performance, demonstrating its capability to utilize unlabeled data efficiently and advance semi-supervised cloud detection.

*Yanzhe Lyu,Chen Geng,Karthik Dharmarajan,Yunzhi Zhang,Hadi Alzayer,Shangzhe Wu,Jiajun Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CHORD is a universal generative pipeline for synthesizing 4D dynamic scenes by distilling Lagrangian motion information from 2D videos, enabling category-agnostic generation of diverse multi-body dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule-based graphics pipelines for creating dynamic scenes are labor-intensive and category-specific, while learning-based methods require large datasets that may not cover all object categories of interest. There's a need for a universal, scalable approach to generate diverse 4D scene dynamics.

Method: Proposes a distillation-based pipeline that extracts rich Lagrangian motion information from Eulerian representations in 2D videos, leveraging video generative models for universality. The approach is category-agnostic and versatile.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness in generating diverse multi-body 4D dynamics, shows advantages over existing methods, and proves applicability in generating robotics manipulation policies.

Conclusion: CHORD provides a universal, versatile, and category-agnostic solution for generating 4D dynamic scenes, overcoming limitations of traditional rule-based and learning-based approaches while enabling practical applications like robotics manipulation.

Abstract: Dynamic objects in our physical 4D (3D + time) world are constantly evolving, deforming, and interacting with other objects, leading to diverse 4D scene dynamics. In this paper, we present a universal generative pipeline, CHORD, for CHOReographing Dynamic objects and scenes and synthesizing this type of phenomena. Traditional rule-based graphics pipelines to create these dynamics are based on category-specific heuristics, yet are labor-intensive and not scalable. Recent learning-based methods typically demand large-scale datasets, which may not cover all object categories in interest. Our approach instead inherits the universality from the video generative models by proposing a distillation-based pipeline to extract the rich Lagrangian motion information hidden in the Eulerian representations of 2D videos. Our method is universal, versatile, and category-agnostic. We demonstrate its effectiveness by conducting experiments to generate a diverse range of multi-body 4D dynamics, show its advantage compared to existing methods, and demonstrate its applicability in generating robotics manipulation policies.

### [31] [EASLT: Emotion-Aware Sign Language Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03549)
*Guobin Tu,Di Weng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EASLT is an emotion-aware sign language translation framework that treats facial expressions as semantic anchors rather than auxiliary information, using emotional encoding and adaptive fusion to resolve ambiguities when different concepts share identical manual gestures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current gloss-free SLT methods focus on manual signals but overlook facial expressions, causing semantic ambiguity when different concepts have identical manual articulations. Facial affect is crucial for disambiguation but is often treated as secondary information.

Method: EASLT incorporates a dedicated emotional encoder to capture continuous affective dynamics, integrated via an Emotion-Aware Fusion (EAF) module that adaptively recalibrates spatio-temporal sign features based on affective context to resolve semantic ambiguities.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on PHOENIX14T (BLEU-4: 26.15, BLEURT: 61.0) and CSL-Daily (BLEU-4: 22.80, BLEURT: 57.8) benchmarks among gloss-free methods. Ablation studies confirm emotion modeling effectively decouples affective semantics from manual dynamics.

Conclusion: Treating facial affect as a semantic anchor rather than auxiliary information significantly enhances translation fidelity in sign language translation by resolving ambiguities that arise when distinct concepts share identical manual articulations.

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a complex cross-modal task requiring the integration of Manual Signals (MS) and Non-Manual Signals (NMS). While recent gloss-free SLT methods have made strides in translating manual gestures, they frequently overlook the semantic criticality of facial expressions, resulting in ambiguity when distinct concepts share identical manual articulations. To address this, we present **EASLT** (**E**motion-**A**ware **S**ign **L**anguage **T**ranslation), a framework that treats facial affect not as auxiliary information, but as a robust semantic anchor. Unlike methods that relegate facial expressions to a secondary role, EASLT incorporates a dedicated emotional encoder to capture continuous affective dynamics. These representations are integrated via a novel *Emotion-Aware Fusion* (EAF) module, which adaptively recalibrates spatio-temporal sign features based on affective context to resolve semantic ambiguities. Extensive evaluations on the PHOENIX14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks demonstrate that EASLT establishes advanced performance among gloss-free methods, achieving BLEU-4 scores of 26.15 and 22.80, and BLEURT scores of 61.0 and 57.8, respectively. Ablation studies confirm that explicitly modeling emotion effectively decouples affective semantics from manual dynamics, significantly enhancing translation fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpatiaLoc: A coarse-to-fine framework for cross-modal localization using text and point clouds that emphasizes spatial relationships at instance and global levels, outperforming SOTA methods on KITTI360Pose.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-modal localization using text and point clouds enables robots to localize via natural language descriptions, crucial for autonomous navigation and human-robot interaction. Since objects often recur across modalities, spatial relationships become the most discriminative cues for accurate localization.

Method: SpatiaLoc uses a coarse-to-fine strategy: 1) Coarse stage: BEOSE models instance-level spatial relationships using quadratic Bezier curves, while FAE generates global-level spatial representations in frequency domain. 2) Fine stage: UGFL regresses 2D positions by modeling predictions as Gaussian distributions with uncertainty-aware loss function.

Result: Extensive experiments on KITTI360Pose demonstrate that SpatiaLoc significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SpatiaLoc effectively addresses cross-modal localization by emphasizing spatial relationships at both instance and global levels through a coarse-to-fine approach, achieving superior performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Cross-modal localization using text and point clouds enables robots to localize themselves via natural language descriptions, with applications in autonomous navigation and interaction between humans and robots. In this task, objects often recur across text and point clouds, making spatial relationships the most discriminative cues for localization. Given this characteristic, we present SpatiaLoc, a framework utilizing a coarse-to-fine strategy that emphasizes spatial relationships at both the instance and global levels. In the coarse stage, we introduce a Bezier Enhanced Object Spatial Encoder (BEOSE) that models spatial relationships at the instance level using quadratic Bezier curves. Additionally, a Frequency Aware Encoder (FAE) generates spatial representations in the frequency domain at the global level. In the fine stage, an Uncertainty Aware Gaussian Fine Localizer (UGFL) regresses 2D positions by modeling predictions as Gaussian distributions with a loss function aware of uncertainty. Extensive experiments on KITTI360Pose demonstrate that SpatiaLoc significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MPFT with Texture-Aware Masking to fine-tune CLIP-ViT for detecting AI-generated images, achieving state-of-the-art generalization with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated images pose misinformation risks, requiring detection methods that generalize to unseen generative models. Current CLIP-based approaches underutilize the image encoder's potential.

Method: Masking-based Pre-trained model Fine-Tuning (MPFT) with Texture-Aware Masking (TAM) that masks textured areas containing generative patterns, forcing CLIP-ViT to learn distributional deviations from real images.

Result: Achieves 98.2% average accuracy on GenImage and 94.6% on UniversalFakeDetect datasets, significantly outperforming existing methods with minimal training images.

Conclusion: The proposed MPFT strategy effectively enhances CLIP-ViT's ability to detect AI-generated images by focusing on distributional deviations, achieving superior generalization with limited data.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has significantly enhanced the quality of AI-generated images, raising concerns about misinformation and the erosion of public trust. Detecting AI-generated images has thus become a critical challenge, particularly in terms of generalizing to unseen generative models. Existing methods using frozen pre-trained CLIP models show promise in generalization but treat the image encoder as a basic feature extractor, failing to fully exploit its potential. In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of the frozen CLIP image encoder (CLIP-ViT), revealing that it effectively clusters real images in a high-level, abstract feature space. However, it does not truly possess the ability to distinguish between real and AI-generated images. Based on this analysis, we propose a Masking-based Pre-trained model Fine-Tuning (MPFT) strategy, which introduces a Texture-Aware Masking (TAM) mechanism to mask textured areas containing generative model-specific patterns during fine-tuning. This approach compels CLIP-ViT to attend to the "distributional deviations"from authentic images for AI-generated image detection, thereby achieving enhanced generalization performance. Extensive experiments on the GenImage and UniversalFakeDetect datasets demonstrate that our method, fine-tuned with only a minimal number of images, significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 98.2% and 94.6% average accuracy on the two datasets, respectively.

TL;DR: SiT-Bench is a text-only benchmark for evaluating spatial intelligence in LLMs using coordinate-aware textual descriptions of scenes, revealing a "spatial gap" in global consistency despite proficiency in localized tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether spatial understanding in AI systems originates from visual encoders or reasoning backbones, by testing LLMs' spatial intelligence without visual inputs.

Method: Created SiT-Bench with 3,800+ expert-annotated items across 5 categories and 17 subtasks, converting single/multi-view scenes into high-fidelity textual descriptions with coordinates to test symbolic textual reasoning.

Result: SOTA LLMs show proficiency in localized semantic tasks but significant "spatial gap" in global consistency; explicit spatial reasoning boosts performance, revealing latent world-modeling potential.

Conclusion: SiT-Bench serves as foundational resource for developing spatially-grounded LLM backbones for future VLMs and embodied agents, demonstrating LLMs' potential for spatial reasoning without visual inputs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Spatial Intelligence (SI) have predominantly relied on Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yet a critical question remains: does spatial understanding originate from visual encoders or the fundamental reasoning backbone? Inspired by this question, we introduce SiT-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the SI performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) without pixel-level input, comprises over 3,800 expert-annotated items across five primary categories and 17 subtasks, ranging from egocentric navigation and perspective transformation to fine-grained robotic manipulation. By converting single/multi-view scenes into high-fidelity, coordinate-aware textual descriptions, we challenge LLMs to perform symbolic textual reasoning rather than visual pattern matching. Evaluation results of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs reveals that while models achieve proficiency in localized semantic tasks, a significant "spatial gap" remains in global consistency. Notably, we find that explicit spatial reasoning significantly boosts performance, suggesting that LLMs possess latent world-modeling potential. Our proposed dataset SiT-Bench serves as a foundational resource to foster the development of spatially-grounded LLM backbones for future VLMs and embodied agents. Our code and benchmark will be released at https://github.com/binisalegend/SiT-Bench .

*Qianyu Guo,Jingrong Wu,Jieji Ren,Weifeng Ge,Wenqiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Adaptive Attention Distillation (AAD) for environment-robust few-shot segmentation, improving performance on challenging real-world scenarios with complex environmental factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot segmentation models fail in real-world deployment due to overlooking complex environmental factors like illumination, background, camera viewpoint, motion blur, small objects, and camouflaged targets that increase test difficulty.

Method: Introduces environment-robust FSS setting and benchmark (ER-FSS) with 8 real-world datasets. Proposes Adaptive Attention Distillation (AAD) that repeatedly contrasts and distills key shared semantics between support and query images to derive class-specific attention for novel categories.

Result: AAD improves mIoU by 3.3% - 8.5% across all datasets and settings, demonstrating superior performance and strong generalization in complex environments.

Conclusion: The proposed environment-robust FSS setting and AAD method effectively enhance model robustness for practical deployment in real-world scenarios with challenging environmental conditions.

Abstract: Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to rapidly learn novel class concepts from limited examples to segment specific targets in unseen images, and has been widely applied in areas such as medical diagnosis and industrial inspection. However, existing studies largely overlook the complex environmental factors encountered in real world scenarios-such as illumination, background, and camera viewpoint-which can substantially increase the difficulty of test images. As a result, models trained under laboratory conditions often fall short of practical deployment requirements. To bridge this gap, in this paper, an environment-robust FSS setting is introduced that explicitly incorporates challenging test cases arising from complex environments-such as motion blur, small objects, and camouflaged targets-to enhance model's robustness under realistic, dynamic conditions. An environment robust FSS benchmark (ER-FSS) is established, covering eight datasets across multiple real world scenarios. In addition, an Adaptive Attention Distillation (AAD) method is proposed, which repeatedly contrasts and distills key shared semantics between known (support) and unknown (query) images to derive class-specific attention for novel categories. This strengthens the model's ability to focus on the correct targets in complex environments, thereby improving environmental robustness. Comparative experiments show that AAD improves mIoU by 3.3% - 8.5% across all datasets and settings, demonstrating superior performance and strong generalization.

*Pratyush Jena,Amal Joseph,Arnav Sharma,Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A robust patching strategy and Attention U-Net for binarizing challenging stone inscriptions, with strong generalization across scripts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stone inscription images are extremely challenging for binarization due to poor contrast, surface degradation, artifacts, and variable layouts, causing existing methods to fail at isolating coherent character regions.

Method: Developed a robust adaptive patching strategy with dynamic sampling and patch selection, used to train an Attention U-Net that focuses on subtle structural cues while overcoming surface noise and layout irregularities.

Result: The novel patching mechanism significantly boosts binarization performance across classical and deep learning baselines, and despite training only on single script Indic data, shows strong zero-shot generalization to other Indic and non-Indic scripts.

Conclusion: The method produces clean, structured representations of inscription content, laying foundation for downstream tasks like script identification, OCR, and historical text analysis, demonstrating robust script-agnostic generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Binarization is a popular first step towards text extraction in historical artifacts. Stone inscription images pose severe challenges for binarization due to poor contrast between etched characters and the stone background, non-uniform surface degradation, distracting artifacts, and highly variable text density and layouts. These conditions frequently cause existing binarization techniques to fail and struggle to isolate coherent character regions. Many approaches sub-divide the image into patches to improve text fragment resolution and improve binarization performance. With this in mind, we present a robust and adaptive patching strategy to binarize challenging Indic inscriptions. The patches from our approach are used to train an Attention U-Net for binarization. The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on subtle structural cues, while our dynamic sampling and patch selection method ensures that the model learns to overcome surface noise and layout irregularities. We also introduce a carefully annotated, pixel-precise dataset of Indic stone inscriptions at the character-fragment level. We demonstrate that our novel patching mechanism significantly boosts binarization performance across classical and deep learning baselines. Despite training only on single script Indic dataset, our model exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to other Indic and non-indic scripts, highlighting its robustness and script-agnostic generalization capabilities. By producing clean, structured representations of inscription content, our method lays the foundation for downstream tasks such as script identification, OCR, and historical text analysis.

### [37] [Shape Classification using Approximately Convex Segment Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03625)
*Bimal Kumar Ray*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes object classification without alignment by sorting boundary segments by length and using bag of features (segment length, extreme points, area, base, width) for similarity measurement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing object classification methods require object alignment to compute similarity, which can be limiting. The paper aims to eliminate this alignment requirement.

Method: Normalize object boundary, segment into approximately convex parts, sort segments by length (descending), extract bag of features (length, extreme points, area, base, width), and use these features for similarity measurement.

Result: Tested on datasets and observed acceptable classification results without requiring object alignment.

Conclusion: Proposed method successfully replaces object alignment with feature sorting, enabling object classification without alignment constraints while maintaining acceptable performance.

Abstract: The existing object classification techniques based on descriptive features rely on object alignment to compute the similarity of objects for classification. This paper replaces the necessity of object alignment through sorting of feature. The object boundary is normalized and segmented into approximately convex segments and the segments are then sorted in descending order of their length. The segment length, number of extreme points in segments, area of segments, the base and the width of the segments - a bag of features - is used to measure the similarity between image boundaries. The proposed method is tested on datasets and acceptable results are observed.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MFC-RFNet: A generative framework for radar precipitation nowcasting that integrates multi-scale communication, spatial alignment, and frequency-aware fusion with rectified flow training for stable few-step sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate high-resolution precipitation nowcasting from radar echo sequences is crucial for disaster mitigation but challenging due to complex multi-scale evolution, inter-frame feature misalignment from displacement, and difficulty capturing long-range spatiotemporal context without sacrificing spatial fidelity.

Method: MFC-RFNet uses: 1) Wavelet-Guided Skip Connection (WGSC) to preserve high-frequency details, 2) Feature Communication Module (FCM) for bidirectional cross-scale interaction, 3) Condition-Guided Spatial Transform Fusion (CGSTF) to align shallow features using learned spatial transforms, 4) Rectified flow training for near-linear probability-flow trajectories enabling few-step sampling, and 5) Lightweight Vision-RWKV blocks at key positions to capture long-range dependencies efficiently.

Result: Evaluations on four public datasets (SEVIR, MeteoNet, Shanghai, and CIKM) show consistent improvements over strong baselines, producing clearer echo morphology at higher rain-rate thresholds and sustained skill at longer lead times.

Conclusion: The synergy of rectified flow training with scale-aware communication, spatial alignment, and frequency-aware fusion presents an effective and robust approach for radar-based precipitation nowcasting.

Abstract: Accurate and high-resolution precipitation nowcasting from radar echo sequences is crucial for disaster mitigation and economic planning, yet it remains a significant challenge. Key difficulties include modeling complex multi-scale evolution, correcting inter-frame feature misalignment caused by displacement, and efficiently capturing long-range spatiotemporal context without sacrificing spatial fidelity. To address these issues, we present the Multi-scale Feature Communication Rectified Flow (RF) Network (MFC-RFNet), a generative framework that integrates multi-scale communication with guided feature fusion. To enhance multi-scale fusion while retaining fine detail, a Wavelet-Guided Skip Connection (WGSC) preserves high-frequency components, and a Feature Communication Module (FCM) promotes bidirectional cross-scale interaction. To correct inter-frame displacement, a Condition-Guided Spatial Transform Fusion (CGSTF) learns spatial transforms from conditioning echoes to align shallow features. The backbone adopts rectified flow training to learn near-linear probability-flow trajectories, enabling few-step sampling with stable fidelity. Additionally, lightweight Vision-RWKV (RWKV) blocks are placed at the encoder tail, the bottleneck, and the first decoder layer to capture long-range spatiotemporal dependencies at low spatial resolutions with moderate compute. Evaluations on four public datasets (SEVIR, MeteoNet, Shanghai, and CIKM) demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines, yielding clearer echo morphology at higher rain-rate thresholds and sustained skill at longer lead times. These results suggest that the proposed synergy of RF training with scale-aware communication, spatial alignment, and frequency-aware fusion presents an effective and robust approach for radar-based nowcasting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrackSegFlow: A controllable flow-matching framework for generating photorealistic crack images with strict mask-image alignment to address domain shift and label scarcity in crack segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical deployment of automated crack segmentation is limited by scarce pixel-level labels and severe domain shift across sensors, illumination, textures, and annotation conventions.

Method: Uses controllable flow-matching synthesis with topology-preserving mask injection and boundary-gated modulation to generate crack images conditioned on binary masks. Includes a second class-conditional flow-matching model for mask synthesis with explicit crack coverage control, and injects crack masks into crack-free backgrounds to diversify artifacts.

Result: Improves in-domain performance by 5.37 mIoU and 5.13 F1 on average, and cross-domain synthesis yields average gains of 13.12 mIoU and 14.82 F1. Provides faster deterministic sampling than diffusion-based methods with better fidelity and mask-image alignment for thin structures.

Conclusion: CrackSegFlow effectively addresses domain shift and label scarcity in crack segmentation through controllable synthesis, and releases CSF-50K dataset of 50,000 paired crack images and masks for large-scale benchmarking.

Abstract: Automated crack segmentation is essential for scalable condition assessment of pavements and civil infrastructure, yet practical deployment is limited by scarce pixel-level labels and severe domain shift across sensors, illumination, textures, and annotation conventions. This paper presents CrackSegFlow, a controllable flow-matching synthesis framework that generates photorealistic crack images conditioned on binary masks while preserving strict mask-image alignment. The generator combines topology-preserving mask injection with boundary-gated modulation to maintain thin-structure continuity and suppress texture-driven false positives. A second class-conditional flow-matching model synthesizes crack masks with explicit control over crack coverage, enabling balanced, topology-diverse paired data without additional manual annotation. We further inject crack masks into crack-free backgrounds to diversify illumination and surface artifacts and reduce false positives caused by shadows, joints, and pavement markings. Experiments on five benchmarks spanning four asphalt datasets and the crack class of a concrete-domain dataset demonstrate consistent improvements under an established hybrid CNN--Transformer segmentation backbone and a fixed training protocol. With real plus synthesized pairs, in-domain performance improves on average by 5.37 mIoU and 5.13 F1, and target-guided cross-domain synthesis yields average gains of 13.12 mIoU and 14.82 F1 using only limited target mask statistics. Compared with diffusion-based semantic synthesis, CrackSegFlow provides substantially faster deterministic sampling and improves fidelity and mask-image alignment for thin-structure crack geometry. Finally, we release CSF-50K, a public dataset of 50,000 paired crack images and pixel-accurate masks for large-scale benchmarking of generalizable crack segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation models fail to maintain consistent entity identity and appearance when scenes change or entities reappear after long temporal gaps, which is crucial for narrative storytelling.

Method: Multi-agent system decomposes narrative scripts into shots, retrieves entity representations from a Dynamic Memory Bank (storing visual/semantic descriptors), synthesizes keyframes/videos conditioned on retrieved states, and updates memory after each shot to reflect story-driven changes.

Result: Achieves strong entity-level coherence and high perceptual quality across diverse narrative sequences, validated on a 54-case multi-shot consistency benchmark covering character-, prop-, and background-persistent scenarios.

Conclusion: VideoMemory's retrieval-update mechanism enables consistent portrayal of entities across distant shots and supports coherent long-form narrative video generation.

Abstract: Maintaining consistent characters, props, and environments across multiple shots is a central challenge in narrative video generation. Existing models can produce high-quality short clips but often fail to preserve entity identity and appearance when scenes change or when entities reappear after long temporal gaps. We present VideoMemory, an entity-centric framework that integrates narrative planning with visual generation through a Dynamic Memory Bank. Given a structured script, a multi-agent system decomposes the narrative into shots, retrieves entity representations from memory, and synthesizes keyframes and videos conditioned on these retrieved states. The Dynamic Memory Bank stores explicit visual and semantic descriptors for characters, props, and backgrounds, and is updated after each shot to reflect story-driven changes while preserving identity. This retrieval-update mechanism enables consistent portrayal of entities across distant shots and supports coherent long-form generation. To evaluate this setting, we construct a 54-case multi-shot consistency benchmark covering character-, prop-, and background-persistent scenarios. Extensive experiments show that VideoMemory achieves strong entity-level coherence and high perceptual quality across diverse narrative sequences.

Result: Extensive experiments show MGPC consistently outperforms prior baselines and exhibits strong generalization under real-world conditions.

Conclusion: MGPC provides a robust, scalable multimodal framework for point cloud completion that significantly improves generalization to novel objects and real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to recover complete 3D geometry from partial observations caused by limited viewpoints and occlusions. Existing learning-based works, including 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based, point-based, and Transformer-based methods, have achieved strong performance on synthetic benchmarks. However, due to the limitations of modality, scalability, and generative capacity, their generalization to novel objects and real-world scenarios remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MGPC, a generalizable multimodal point cloud completion framework that integrates point clouds, RGB images, and text within a unified architecture. MGPC introduces an innovative modality dropout strategy, a Transformer-based fusion module, and a novel progressive generator to improve robustness, scalability, and geometric modeling capability. We further develop an automatic data generation pipeline and construct MGPC-1M, a large-scale benchmark with over 1,000 categories and one million training pairs. Extensive experiments on MGPC-1M and in-the-wild data demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms prior baselines and exhibits strong generalization under real-world conditions.

Conclusion: The work establishes a proof-of-concept framework for physics-aware video generation, showing that joint training of physics priors with diffusion models is technically feasible and stable, paving the way for improved physical realism in generated videos.

Abstract: Current video generation models produce high-quality aesthetic videos but often struggle to learn representations of real-world physics dynamics, resulting in artifacts such as unnatural object collisions, inconsistent gravity, and temporal flickering. In this work, we propose PhysVideoGenerator, a proof-of-concept framework that explicitly embeds a learnable physics prior into the video generation process. We introduce a lightweight predictor network, PredictorP, which regresses high-level physical features extracted from a pre-trained Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA 2) directly from noisy diffusion latents. These predicted physics tokens are injected into the temporal attention layers of a DiT-based generator (Latte) via a dedicated cross-attention mechanism.

Motivation: Existing egocentric action recognition methods rely on RGB appearance, human pose, or their combination, but motion cues from point tracking are underutilized and could provide lightweight yet effective representations.

Method: Track randomly sampled image points across video frames using CoTracker, then use resulting trajectories with corresponding image frames as input to a Transformer-based recognition model, without detecting hands, objects, or interaction regions.

Result: Method achieves notable performance gains even with only initial frame and associated point tracks, and consistently outperforms same model trained without motion information.

Conclusion: 2D point tracks serve as a lightweight yet effective motion representation for egocentric action understanding, offering substantial accuracy improvements without complex hand/object detection.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for egocentric action recognition that leverages 2D point tracks as an additional motion cue. While most existing methods rely on RGB appearance, human pose estimation, or their combination, our work demonstrates that tracking randomly sampled image points across video frames can substantially improve recognition accuracy. Unlike prior approaches, we do not detect hands, objects, or interaction regions. Instead, we employ CoTracker to follow a set of randomly initialized points through each video and use the resulting trajectories, together with the corresponding image frames, as input to a Transformer-based recognition model. Surprisingly, our method achieves notable gains even when only the initial frame and its associated point tracks are provided, without incorporating the full video sequence. Experimental results confirm that integrating 2D point tracks consistently enhances performance compared to the same model trained without motion information, highlighting their potential as a lightweight yet effective representation for egocentric action understanding.

TL;DR: BREATH-VL integrates vision-language models with geometric registration for 6-DoF endoscopic camera localization, using the new BREATH dataset and lightweight temporal context learning to outperform vision-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address three key challenges in applying VLMs to endoscopic localization: lack of large-scale medical vision-language datasets, limited fine-grained pose regression capability, and high computational latency for temporal feature extraction.

Method: 1) Construct BREATH dataset - largest in-vivo endoscopic localization dataset; 2) Propose BREATH-VL hybrid framework integrating VLM semantic cues with vision-based registration geometric information; 3) Introduce lightweight context-learning mechanism encoding motion history as linguistic prompts for efficient temporal reasoning.

Result: BREATH-VL outperforms state-of-the-art vision-only localization methods in accuracy and generalization, reducing translational error by 25.5% compared to best-performing baseline while achieving competitive computational latency.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach combining VLM semantic understanding with geometric registration provides accurate 6-DoF endoscopic camera localization, with the lightweight temporal context mechanism enabling efficient performance in challenging surgical scenes.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable performance in navigation and localization tasks by leveraging large-scale pretraining for semantic understanding. However, applying VLMs to 6-DoF endoscopic camera localization presents several challenges: 1) the lack of large-scale, high-quality, densely annotated, and localization-oriented vision-language datasets in real-world medical settings; 2) limited capability for fine-grained pose regression; and 3) high computational latency when extracting temporal features from past frames. To address these issues, we first construct BREATH dataset, the largest in-vivo endoscopic localization dataset to date, collected in the complex human airway. Building on this dataset, we propose BREATH-VL, a hybrid framework that integrates semantic cues from VLMs with geometric information from vision-based registration methods for accurate 6-DoF pose estimation. Our motivation lies in the complementary strengths of both approaches: VLMs offer generalizable semantic understanding, while registration methods provide precise geometric alignment. To further enhance the VLM's ability to capture temporal context, we introduce a lightweight context-learning mechanism that encodes motion history as linguistic prompts, enabling efficient temporal reasoning without expensive video-level computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the vision-language module delivers robust semantic localization in challenging surgical scenes. Building on this, our BREATH-VL outperforms state-of-the-art vision-only localization methods in both accuracy and generalization, reducing translational error by 25.5% compared with the best-performing baseline, while achieving competitive computational latency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DA3 uses domain adaptation with minimal unlabeled real data to bridge simulation-reality gap for active alignment, achieving 46% accuracy improvement over simulation-only methods with 98.7% reduction in data collection time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active alignment is crucial for automated optical assembly, but simulation-trained models suffer from domain gap with real-world images, limiting generalization. Current approaches require extensive labeled real-world data which is time-consuming and expensive.

Method: Proposes Domain Adaptive Active Alignment (DA3) using autoregressive domain transformation generator and adversarial feature alignment strategy with self-supervised learning. Uses minimal unlabeled real-world images captured at random misalignment positions to distill real-world domain information and extract domain-invariant degradation features.

Result: DA3 improves accuracy by 46% over purely simulation pipeline. Approaches performance of precisely labeled real-world data from 3 lens samples while reducing on-device data collection time by 98.7%. Validated on two lens types.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation effectively enables simulation-trained models to achieve robust real-world performance, validating digital-twin pipeline as practical solution to significantly enhance efficiency of large-scale optical assembly.

Abstract: Active Alignment (AA) is a key technology for the large-scale automated assembly of high-precision optical systems. Compared with labor-intensive per-model on-device calibration, a digital-twin pipeline built on optical simulation offers a substantial advantage in generating large-scale labeled data. However, complex imaging conditions induce a domain gap between simulation and real-world images, limiting the generalization of simulation-trained models. To address this, we propose augmenting a simulation baseline with minimal unlabeled real-world images captured at random misalignment positions, mitigating the gap from a domain adaptation perspective. We introduce Domain Adaptive Active Alignment (DA3), which utilizes an autoregressive domain transformation generator and an adversarial-based feature alignment strategy to distill real-world domain information via self-supervised learning. This enables the extraction of domain-invariant image degradation features to facilitate robust misalignment prediction. Experiments on two lens types reveal that DA3 improves accuracy by 46% over a purely simulation pipeline. Notably, it approaches the performance achieved with precisely labeled real-world data collected on 3 lens samples, while reducing on-device data collection time by 98.7%. The results demonstrate that domain adaptation effectively endows simulation-trained models with robust real-world performance, validating the digital-twin pipeline as a practical solution to significantly enhance the efficiency of large-scale optical assembly.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CSMCIR: A unified symmetric framework for composed image retrieval that addresses representation space fragmentation through multimodal captioning, shared-parameter architecture, and dynamic memory bank.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CIR methods suffer from representation space fragmentation where queries (image+text) and targets (images) use different encoders, creating misaligned feature spaces that limit retrieval performance. This manifests as three separate clusters in feature space.

Method: Three components: 1) MCoT prompting for MLLMs to generate discriminative captions for target images, 2) symmetric dual-tower architecture with shared-parameter Q-Former for both query and target encoding, 3) entropy-based dynamic memory bank for high-quality negative samples.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets with superior training efficiency. Ablation studies validate effectiveness of each component.

Conclusion: CSMCIR solves representation space fragmentation in CIR through unified symmetric design, enabling better query-target alignment and improved retrieval performance.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) enables users to search for target images using both a reference image and manipulation text, offering substantial advantages over single-modality retrieval systems. However, existing CIR methods suffer from representation space fragmentation: queries and targets comprise heterogeneous modalities and are processed by distinct encoders, forcing models to bridge misaligned representation spaces only through post-hoc alignment, which fundamentally limits retrieval performance. This architectural asymmetry manifests as three distinct, well-separated clusters in the feature space, directly demonstrating how heterogeneous modalities create fundamentally misaligned representation spaces from initialization. In this work, we propose CSMCIR, a unified representation framework that achieves efficient query-target alignment through three synergistic components. First, we introduce a Multi-level Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting strategy that guides Multimodal Large Language Models to generate discriminative, semantically compatible captions for target images, establishing modal symmetry. Building upon this, we design a symmetric dual-tower architecture where both query and target sides utilize the identical shared-parameter Q-Former for cross-modal encoding, ensuring consistent feature representations and further reducing the alignment gap. Finally, this architectural symmetry enables an entropy-based, temporally dynamic Memory Bank strategy that provides high-quality negative samples while maintaining consistency with the evolving model state. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our CSMCIR achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior training efficiency. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each proposed component.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing marine animal classification methods overlook contextual interactions from the surrounding environment and insufficiently incorporate hierarchical taxonomic structure, limiting their effectiveness for fine-grained classification.

Method: Proposes MATANet with two key components: Multi-Context Environmental Attention Module (MCEAM) learns relationships between animal regions and their environments, and Hierarchical Separation-Induced Learning Module (HSLM) encodes taxonomic hierarchy into feature space.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on FathomNet2025, FAIR1M, and LifeCLEF2015-Fish datasets, demonstrating effectiveness for fine-grained marine species classification.

Conclusion: MATANet successfully combines environmental context and taxonomic structure to enhance fine-grained marine species classification, mimicking expert strategies for interpreting ambiguous underwater animal features.

Abstract: Fine-grained classification of marine animals supports ecology, biodiversity and habitat conservation, and evidence-based policy-making. However, existing methods often overlook contextual interactions from the surrounding environment and insufficiently incorporate the hierarchical structure of marine biological taxonomy. To address these challenges, we propose MATANet (Multi-context Attention and Taxonomy-Aware Network), a novel model designed for fine-grained marine species classification. MATANet mimics expert strategies by using taxonomy and environmental context to interpret ambiguous features of underwater animals. It consists of two key components: a Multi-Context Environmental Attention Module (MCEAM), which learns relationships between regions of interest (ROIs) and their surrounding environments, and a Hierarchical Separation-Induced Learning Module (HSLM), which encodes taxonomic hierarchy into the feature space. MATANet combines instance and environmental features with taxonomic structure to enhance fine-grained classification. Experiments on the FathomNet2025, FAIR1M, and LifeCLEF2015-Fish datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: RadDiff is a multimodal AI system that performs radiologist-style comparative analysis of paired radiology studies, incorporating medical knowledge, multimodal reasoning, iterative refinement, and targeted visual search to identify clinically meaningful differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding differences between radiology image sets is critical for clinical insights and interpreting medical AI systems, but current methods lack comprehensive comparative reasoning capabilities.

Method: RadDiff uses a proposer-ranker framework with four innovations: 1) medical knowledge injection via domain-adapted vision-language models, 2) multimodal reasoning integrating images with clinical reports, 3) iterative hypothesis refinement across multiple rounds, and 4) targeted visual search that localizes and zooms on salient regions.

Result: On RadDiffBench (57 expert-validated study pairs), RadDiff achieves 47% accuracy (50% with ground-truth reports), significantly outperforming the VisDiff baseline. It demonstrates versatility across COVID-19 phenotype comparison, racial subgroup analysis, and survival-related imaging feature discovery.

Conclusion: RadDiff and RadDiffBench provide the first method-and-benchmark foundation for systematically uncovering meaningful differences in radiological data, advancing comparative analysis capabilities in medical imaging.

Abstract: Understanding how two radiology image sets differ is critical for generating clinical insights and for interpreting medical AI systems. We introduce RadDiff, a multimodal agentic system that performs radiologist-style comparative reasoning to describe clinically meaningful differences between paired radiology studies. RadDiff builds on a proposer-ranker framework from VisDiff, and incorporates four innovations inspired by real diagnostic workflows: (1) medical knowledge injection through domain-adapted vision-language models; (2) multimodal reasoning that integrates images with their clinical reports; (3) iterative hypothesis refinement across multiple reasoning rounds; and (4) targeted visual search that localizes and zooms in on salient regions to capture subtle findings. To evaluate RadDiff, we construct RadDiffBench, a challenging benchmark comprising 57 expert-validated radiology study pairs with ground-truth difference descriptions. On RadDiffBench, RadDiff achieves 47% accuracy, and 50% accuracy when guided by ground-truth reports, significantly outperforming the general-domain VisDiff baseline. We further demonstrate RadDiff's versatility across diverse clinical tasks, including COVID-19 phenotype comparison, racial subgroup analysis, and discovery of survival-related imaging features. Together, RadDiff and RadDiffBench provide the first method-and-benchmark foundation for systematically uncovering meaningful differences in radiological data.

TL;DR: Introduces HyperCOD, the first large-scale hyperspectral camouflaged object detection benchmark, and HSC-SAM, a novel method adapting SAM for hyperspectral data by decoupling spatial and spectral information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-based camouflaged object detection fails in real-world scenarios with ambiguous color/texture cues. Hyperspectral imaging offers better spectral signatures but lacks dedicated large-scale benchmarks, hindering progress in hyperspectral camouflaged object detection (HCOD).

Method: Proposes HyperSpectral Camouflage-aware SAM (HSC-SAM) that adapts Segment Anything Model for HCOD by decoupling hyperspectral images into: 1) spatial map for SAM's image encoder, and 2) spectral saliency map as adaptive prompt, effectively bridging modality gap.

Result: HSC-SAM achieves new state-of-the-art on the HyperCOD benchmark (350 high-resolution hyperspectral images) and demonstrates robust generalization to other public HSI datasets.

Conclusion: The HyperCOD dataset and HSC-SAM baseline provide a solid foundation for future research in hyperspectral camouflaged object detection, addressing the critical need for dedicated benchmarks in this emerging field.

Abstract: RGB-based camouflaged object detection struggles in real-world scenarios where color and texture cues are ambiguous. While hyperspectral image offers a powerful alternative by capturing fine-grained spectral signatures, progress in hyperspectral camouflaged object detection (HCOD) has been critically hampered by the absence of a dedicated, large-scale benchmark. To spur innovation, we introduce HyperCOD, the first challenging benchmark for HCOD. Comprising 350 high-resolution hyperspectral images, It features complex real-world scenarios with minimal objects, intricate shapes, severe occlusions, and dynamic lighting to challenge current models. The advent of foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) presents a compelling opportunity. To adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for HCOD, we propose HyperSpectral Camouflage-aware SAM (HSC-SAM). HSC-SAM ingeniously reformulates the hyperspectral image by decoupling it into a spatial map fed to SAM's image encoder and a spectral saliency map that serves as an adaptive prompt. This translation effectively bridges the modality gap. Extensive experiments show that HSC-SAM sets a new state-of-the-art on HyperCOD and generalizes robustly to other public HSI datasets. The HyperCOD dataset and our HSC-SAM baseline provide a robust foundation to foster future research in this emerging area.

TL;DR: I2E introduces a "Decompose-then-Action" paradigm for compositional image editing, using object decomposition and physics-aware agents to handle complex spatial reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pixel-level inpainting methods struggle with compositional editing requiring precise local control and multi-object spatial reasoning due to implicit planning-execution coupling, lack of object-level control, and unstructured pixel-centric modeling.

Method: I2E uses a Decomposer to transform images into discrete object layers, then employs a physics-aware Vision-Language-Action Agent with Chain-of-Thought reasoning to parse instructions into atomic actions within a structured environment.

Result: I2E significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on I2E-Bench and public benchmarks in handling complex compositional instructions, maintaining physical plausibility, and ensuring multi-turn editing stability.

Conclusion: The "Decompose-then-Action" paradigm effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by introducing structured object-level control and explicit reasoning for compositional image editing.

Abstract: Existing text-guided image editing methods primarily rely on end-to-end pixel-level inpainting paradigm. Despite its success in simple scenarios, this paradigm still significantly struggles with compositional editing tasks that require precise local control and complex multi-object spatial reasoning. This paradigm is severely limited by 1) the implicit coupling of planning and execution, 2) the lack of object-level control granularity, and 3) the reliance on unstructured, pixel-centric modeling. To address these limitations, we propose I2E, a novel "Decompose-then-Action" paradigm that revisits image editing as an actionable interaction process within a structured environment. I2E utilizes a Decomposer to transform unstructured images into discrete, manipulable object layers and then introduces a physics-aware Vision-Language-Action Agent to parse complex instructions into a series of atomic actions via Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Further, we also construct I2E-Bench, a benchmark designed for multi-instance spatial reasoning and high-precision editing. Experimental results on I2E-Bench and multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that I2E significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in handling complex compositional instructions, maintaining physical plausibility, and ensuring multi-turn editing stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning post-training for VideoLLMs optimizes for visual-semantic tasks like captioning/VideoQA, enhancing perception but lacking explicit supervision for temporal coherence and inter-frame correlations. This limits models' ability to capture intricate dynamics and fine-grained visual causality.

Method: Proposes Masked Video Prediction (MVP) objective requiring models to reconstruct masked continuous segments from challenging distractors. Introduces scalable data synthesis pipeline to transform arbitrary video corpora into MVP training samples, and employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with fine-grained reward function.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that MVP enhances video reasoning capabilities by directly reinforcing temporal reasoning and causal understanding.

Conclusion: MVP effectively bridges the gap in temporal reasoning for VideoLLMs by providing explicit supervision for sequential logic and temporal context, leading to improved video reasoning capabilities through enhanced temporal and causal understanding.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning based post-training paradigms for Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have achieved significant success by optimizing for visual-semantic tasks such as captioning or VideoQA. However, while these approaches effectively enhance perception abilities, they primarily target holistic content understanding, often lacking explicit supervision for intrinsic temporal coherence and inter-frame correlations. This tendency limits the models' ability to capture intricate dynamics and fine-grained visual causality. To explicitly bridge this gap, we propose a novel post-training objective: Masked Video Prediction (MVP). By requiring the model to reconstruct a masked continuous segment from a set of challenging distractors, MVP forces the model to attend to the sequential logic and temporal context of events. To support scalable training, we introduce a scalable data synthesis pipeline capable of transforming arbitrary video corpora into MVP training samples, and further employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a fine-grained reward function to enhance the model's understanding of video context and temporal properties. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that MVP enhances video reasoning capabilities by directly reinforcing temporal reasoning and causal understanding.

TL;DR: Using synthetic data generation techniques to train AI object detection models for stone-potato separation in agriculture, where CAD models are unavailable, showing that representative 3D models plus finetuning on small real datasets achieves good performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI vision systems in manufacturing need large annotated datasets, but agricultural applications lack readily available CAD models for synthetic data generation, creating a data acquisition challenge for object detection tasks like separating stones from potatoes.

Method: Developed techniques to substitute CAD files for synthetic dataset creation, including using highly representative 3D models acquired through scanning or image-to-3D approaches, then training object detection models and finetuning on small real datasets.

Result: Demonstrated that representative 3D models can effectively generate synthetic training data, and finetuning on small real datasets significantly improves model performance, achieving similar results even with less representative models.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generation using alternative 3D modeling approaches is viable for agricultural object detection when CAD models are unavailable, especially when combined with limited real data finetuning.

Abstract: In the manufacturing industry, computer vision systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) are widely used to reduce costs and increase production. Training these AI models requires a large amount of training data that is costly to acquire and annotate, especially in high-variance, low-volume manufacturing environments. A popular approach to reduce the need for real data is the use of synthetic data that is generated by leveraging computer-aided design (CAD) models available in the industry. However, in the agricultural industry these models are not readily available, increasing the difficulty in leveraging synthetic data. In this paper, we present different techniques for substituting CAD files to create synthetic datasets. We measure their relative performance when used to train an AI object detection model to separate stones and potatoes in a bin picking environment. We demonstrate that using highly representative 3D models acquired by scanning or using image-to-3D approaches can be used to generate synthetic data for training object detection models. Finetuning on a small real dataset can significantly improve the performance of the models and even get similar performance when less representative models are used.

TL;DR: IDESplat improves 3D Gaussian Splatting by iteratively boosting depth probability estimation through cascaded warp operations, enabling more accurate Gaussian mean prediction and better scene reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting rely on single-warp depth estimation, which fails to fully leverage cross-view geometric cues, resulting in unstable and coarse depth maps that hinder accurate Gaussian mean prediction.

Method: Proposes IDESplat with Depth Probability Boosting Unit (DPBU) that integrates epipolar attention maps from cascaded warp operations multiplicatively. Uses iterative depth estimation by stacking multiple DPBUs to progressively refine depth candidates and boost depth probability estimates.

Result: Outperforms DepthSplat by 0.33 dB PSNR on RealEstate10K using only 10.7% parameters and 70% memory. Achieves 2.95 dB PSNR improvement over DepthSplat on DTU in cross-dataset experiments. Demonstrates state-of-the-art reconstruction quality with real-time efficiency.

Conclusion: IDESplat's iterative depth probability boosting approach enables more accurate Gaussian mean prediction, leading to superior reconstruction quality, strong generalization ability, and efficient performance in generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting.

Abstract: Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting aims to directly predict Gaussian parameters using a feed-forward network for scene reconstruction. Among these parameters, Gaussian means are particularly difficult to predict, so depth is usually estimated first and then unprojected to obtain the Gaussian sphere centers. Existing methods typically rely solely on a single warp to estimate depth probability, which hinders their ability to fully leverage cross-view geometric cues, resulting in unstable and coarse depth maps. To address this limitation, we propose IDESplat, which iteratively applies warp operations to boost depth probability estimation for accurate Gaussian mean prediction. First, to eliminate the inherent instability of a single warp, we introduce a Depth Probability Boosting Unit (DPBU) that integrates epipolar attention maps produced by cascading warp operations in a multiplicative manner. Next, we construct an iterative depth estimation process by stacking multiple DPBUs, progressively identifying potential depth candidates with high likelihood. As IDESplat iteratively boosts depth probability estimates and updates the depth candidates, the depth map is gradually refined, resulting in accurate Gaussian means. We conduct experiments on RealEstate10K, ACID, and DL3DV. IDESplat achieves outstanding reconstruction quality and state-of-the-art performance with real-time efficiency. On RE10K, it outperforms DepthSplat by 0.33 dB in PSNR, using only 10.7% of the parameters and 70% of the memory. Additionally, our IDESplat improves PSNR by 2.95 dB over DepthSplat on the DTU dataset in cross-dataset experiments, demonstrating its strong generalization ability.

TL;DR: LLMs can autonomously engineer optimal code transformations by learning from empirical performance feedback without reinforcement learning or symbolic rewards, achieving 600x fewer evaluations than brute-force search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data-aware augmentation for code synthesis relies on heuristic design or brute-force approaches, which are inefficient and don't leverage LLMs' potential for autonomous optimization based on performance feedback.

Method: Fine-tune LLMs with Low-Rank Adaptation on a repository of 6,000+ empirically evaluated PyTorch augmentation functions annotated by downstream accuracy. Use pairwise performance ordering (better-worse transformations) to align models through empirical feedback without reinforcement learning or symbolic objectives.

Result: Achieves up to 600x fewer evaluated candidates than brute-force discovery while maintaining competitive peak accuracy. Models shift from random synthesis to task-aligned design and internalize semantic performance cues rather than memorizing syntax.

Conclusion: LLMs can exhibit task-level reasoning through non-textual feedback loops, bypassing explicit symbolic rewards, enabling autonomous engineering of optimal code transformations based on empirical performance cues.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved notable performance in code synthesis; however, data-aware augmentation remains a limiting factor, handled via heuristic design or brute-force approaches. We introduce a performance-aware, closed-loop solution in the NNGPT ecosystem of projects that enables LLMs to autonomously engineer optimal transformations by internalizing empirical performance cues. We fine-tune LLMs with Low-Rank Adaptation on a novel repository of more than 6,000 empirically evaluated PyTorch augmentation functions, each annotated solely by downstream model accuracy. Training uses pairwise performance ordering (better-worse transformations), enabling alignment through empirical feedback without reinforcement learning, reward models, or symbolic objectives. This reduces the need for exhaustive search, achieving up to 600x times fewer evaluated candidates than brute-force discovery while maintaining competitive peak accuracy and shifting generation from random synthesis to task-aligned design. Ablation studies show that structured Chain-of-Thought prompting introduces syntactic noise and degrades performance, whereas direct prompting ensures stable optimization in performance-critical code tasks. Qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate that the model internalizes semantic performance cues rather than memorizing syntax. These results show that LLMs can exhibit task-level reasoning through non-textual feedback loops, bypassing explicit symbolic rewards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional manual flood damage surveys are slow and biased, while current satellite methods face limitations from cloud cover and low spatial resolution (10m Sentinel-2). There's a need for rapid, accurate, and cost-effective crop damage assessment for post-disaster agricultural management in India.

Method: FLNet is a novel deep learning architecture that first applies super-resolution to enhance Sentinel-2 satellite images from 10m to 3m spatial resolution, then performs damage classification on the enhanced images.

Result: On the Bihar Flood Impacted Croplands Dataset (BFCD-22), FLNet improved the critical "Full Damage" F1-score from 0.83 to 0.89, nearly matching the 0.89 score achieved using commercial high-resolution imagery.

Conclusion: FLNet provides a cost-effective and scalable solution for automated, high-fidelity crop damage assessment, enabling a nationwide shift from manual to automated damage assessment for post-flood agricultural management.

Abstract: Distributing government relief efforts after a flood is challenging. In India, the crops are widely affected by floods; therefore, making rapid and accurate crop damage assessment is crucial for effective post-disaster agricultural management. Traditional manual surveys are slow and biased, while current satellite-based methods face challenges like cloud cover and low spatial resolution. Therefore, to bridge this gap, this paper introduced FLNet, a novel deep learning based architecture that used super-resolution to enhance the 10 m spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 satellite images into 3 m resolution before classifying damage. We tested our model on the Bihar Flood Impacted Croplands Dataset (BFCD-22), and the results showed an improved critical "Full Damage" F1-score from 0.83 to 0.89, nearly matching the 0.89 score of commercial high-resolution imagery. This work presented a cost-effective and scalable solution, paving the way for a nationwide shift from manual to automated, high-fidelity damage assessment.

Abstract: Developing foundation models in medical imaging requires continuous monitoring of downstream performance. Researchers are burdened with tracking numerous experiments, design choices, and their effects on performance, often relying on ad-hoc, manual workflows that are inherently slow and error-prone. We introduce EvalBlocks, a modular, plug-and-play framework for efficient evaluation of foundation models during development. Built on Snakemake, EvalBlocks supports seamless integration of new datasets, foundation models, aggregation methods, and evaluation strategies. All experiments and results are tracked centrally and are reproducible with a single command, while efficient caching and parallel execution enable scalable use on shared compute infrastructure. Demonstrated on five state-of-the-art foundation models and three medical imaging classification tasks, EvalBlocks streamlines model evaluation, enabling researchers to iterate faster and focus on model innovation rather than evaluation logistics. The framework is released as open source software at https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/eval-blocks.

*Mingyu Ouyang,Kevin Qinghong Lin,Mike Zheng Shou,Hwee Tou Ng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FocusUI is an efficient UI grounding framework that reduces visual token overhead by selecting relevant patches while preserving positional continuity, achieving faster inference with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs for UI grounding process high-resolution screenshots with thousands of visual tokens, causing computational overhead and diluted attention, unlike humans who focus on regions of interest.

Method: Proposes FocusUI with two key innovations: (1) patch-level supervision fusing instruction-conditioned scores with UI-graph scores to select relevant tokens, and (2) PosPad strategy that compresses dropped token sequences into special markers to preserve positional continuity.

Result: Outperforms GUI-specific baselines on four grounding benchmarks; achieves 3.7% improvement over GUI-Actor-7B on ScreenSpot-Pro, with only 3.2% drop at 30% token retention while achieving 1.44x faster inference and 17% lower GPU memory.

Conclusion: FocusUI pioneers efficient UI grounding by addressing computational overhead through intelligent token selection while maintaining positional information, enabling practical deployment of VLMs for UI tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance in User Interface (UI) grounding tasks, driven by their ability to process increasingly high-resolution screenshots. However, screenshots are tokenized into thousands of visual tokens (e.g., about 4700 for 2K resolution), incurring significant computational overhead and diluting attention. In contrast, humans typically focus on regions of interest when interacting with UI. In this work, we pioneer the task of efficient UI grounding. Guided by practical analysis of the task's characteristics and challenges, we propose FocusUI, an efficient UI grounding framework that selects patches most relevant to the instruction while preserving positional continuity for precise grounding. FocusUI addresses two key challenges: (1) Eliminating redundant tokens in visual encoding. We construct patch-level supervision by fusing an instruction-conditioned score with a rule-based UI-graph score that down-weights large homogeneous regions to select distinct and instruction-relevant visual tokens. (2) Preserving positional continuity during visual token selection. We find that general visual token pruning methods suffer from severe accuracy degradation on UI grounding tasks due to broken positional information. We introduce a novel PosPad strategy, which compresses each contiguous sequence of dropped visual tokens into a single special marker placed at the sequence's last index to preserve positional continuity. Comprehensive experiments on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that FocusUI surpasses GUI-specific baselines. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, FocusUI-7B achieves a performance improvement of 3.7% over GUI-Actor-7B. Even with only 30% visual token retention, FocusUI-7B drops by only 3.2% while achieving up to 1.44x faster inference and 17% lower peak GPU memory.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LocalDPO is a novel post-training framework that aligns text-to-video diffusion models with human preferences using localized spatio-temporal region optimization, eliminating the need for external critic models or manual annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DPO methods for text-to-video diffusion models are inefficient and yield ambiguous global supervision because they rely on multi-sample ranking and task-specific critic models.

Method: Proposes LocalDPO with automated pipeline to collect preference pairs using real videos as positives and generating negatives by locally corrupting them with random spatio-temporal masks, then restoring only masked regions with frozen base model. Uses region-aware DPO loss that restricts preference learning to corrupted areas.

Result: Experiments on Wan2.1 and CogVideoX show LocalDPO consistently improves video fidelity, temporal coherence and human preference scores over other post-training approaches.

Conclusion: LocalDPO establishes a more efficient and fine-grained paradigm for video generator alignment through localized preference optimization at spatio-temporal region level.

Abstract: Aligning text-to-video diffusion models with human preferences is crucial for generating high-quality videos. Existing Direct Preference Otimization (DPO) methods rely on multi-sample ranking and task-specific critic models, which is inefficient and often yields ambiguous global supervision. To address these limitations, we propose LocalDPO, a novel post-training framework that constructs localized preference pairs from real videos and optimizes alignment at the spatio-temporal region level. We design an automated pipeline to efficiently collect preference pair data that generates preference pairs with a single inference per prompt, eliminating the need for external critic models or manual annotation. Specifically, we treat high-quality real videos as positive samples and generate corresponding negatives by locally corrupting them with random spatio-temporal masks and restoring only the masked regions using the frozen base model. During training, we introduce a region-aware DPO loss that restricts preference learning to corrupted areas for rapid convergence. Experiments on Wan2.1 and CogVideoX demonstrate that LocalDPO consistently improves video fidelity, temporal coherence and human preference scores over other post-training approaches, establishing a more efficient and fine-grained paradigm for video generator alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LMMs suffer from "textual inertia" where they blindly follow erroneous text in reasoning chains despite visual evidence; proposed training-free method improves self-correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Multimodal Models show impressive video reasoning via Chain-of-Thought, but their reasoning chains lack robustness - they exhibit "textual inertia" where once a textual hallucination occurs, models adhere to erroneous text while ignoring conflicting visual evidence.

Method: 1) LogicGraph Perturbation Protocol to systematically inject perturbations into reasoning chains of diverse LMMs; 2) Active Visual-Context Refinement - a training-free inference paradigm with active visual re-grounding for fine-grained verification and adaptive context refinement to summarize/denoise reasoning history.

Result: Models successfully self-correct in less than 10% of cases, predominantly succumbing to blind textual error propagation. The proposed approach significantly stifles hallucination propagation and enhances reasoning robustness.

Conclusion: LMMs have critical failure mode of textual inertia in reasoning chains, but training-free inference methods like Active Visual-Context Refinement can mitigate hallucination propagation and improve reasoning robustness.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in video reasoning via Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, the robustness of their reasoning chains remains questionable. In this paper, we identify a critical failure mode termed textual inertia, where once a textual hallucination occurs in the thinking process, models tend to blindly adhere to the erroneous text while neglecting conflicting visual evidence. To systematically investigate this, we propose the LogicGraph Perturbation Protocol that structurally injects perturbations into the reasoning chains of diverse LMMs spanning both native reasoning architectures and prompt-driven paradigms to evaluate their self-reflection capabilities. The results reveal that models successfully self-correct in less than 10% of cases and predominantly succumb to blind textual error propagation. To mitigate this, we introduce Active Visual-Context Refinement, a training-free inference paradigm which orchestrates an active visual re-grounding mechanism to enforce fine-grained verification coupled with an adaptive context refinement strategy to summarize and denoise the reasoning history. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly stifles hallucination propagation and enhances reasoning robustness.

TL;DR: Proposes PIMC, a multimodal self-supervision approach using 2D recurrence plots from pixel time series and remote sensing imagery for Earth observation tasks, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Satellites generate massive Earth observation data (SITS), but most deep learning models process either entire images or complete time series, lacking effective pixel-level feature extraction methods.

Method: Generates recurrence plots from pixel-based vegetation index time series (NDVI, EVI, SAVI) as 2D representations, and introduces PIxel-wise Multimodal Contrastive (PIMC) for self-supervised learning combining pixel time series and remote sensing imagery.

Result: 2D representations significantly enhance SITS feature extraction, contrastive learning improves both pixel time series and RSI representations, and the method outperforms SOTA on PASTIS (forecasting/classification) and EuroSAT (land cover classification) datasets.

Conclusion: The multimodal approach establishes a robust self-supervision framework for processing both SITS and RSI, demonstrating superior performance across various Earth observation tasks.

Abstract: Satellites continuously generate massive volumes of data, particularly for Earth observation, including satellite image time series (SITS). However, most deep learning models are designed to process either entire images or complete time series sequences to extract meaningful features for downstream tasks. In this study, we propose a novel multimodal approach that leverages pixel-wise two-dimensional (2D) representations to encode visual property variations from SITS more effectively. Specifically, we generate recurrence plots from pixel-based vegetation index time series (NDVI, EVI, and SAVI) as an alternative to using raw pixel values, creating more informative representations. Additionally, we introduce PIxel-wise Multimodal Contrastive (PIMC), a new multimodal self-supervision approach that produces effective encoders based on two-dimensional pixel time series representations and remote sensing imagery (RSI). To validate our approach, we assess its performance on three downstream tasks: pixel-level forecasting and classification using the PASTIS dataset, and land cover classification on the EuroSAT dataset. Moreover, we compare our results to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on all downstream tasks. Our experimental results show that the use of 2D representations significantly enhances feature extraction from SITS, while contrastive learning improves the quality of representations for both pixel time series and RSI. These findings suggest that our multimodal method outperforms existing models in various Earth observation tasks, establishing it as a robust self-supervision framework for processing both SITS and RSI.

TL;DR: Klear is a new audio-video joint generation model that addresses synchronization, alignment, and quality issues through unified architecture, progressive training, and large-scale dense-caption dataset curation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio-video generation approaches suffer from audio-visual asynchrony, poor lip-speech alignment, unimodal degradation, weak correspondence modeling, limited generalization, and scarce high-quality dense-caption data.

Method: Three-pronged approach: 1) Single-tower architecture with unified DiT blocks and Omni-Full Attention for tight alignment; 2) Progressive multitask training with random modality masking and multistage curriculum; 3) Novel automated pipeline for creating large-scale audio-video dataset with dense captions.

Result: Klear substantially outperforms prior methods by large margins, achieves performance comparable to Veo 3, delivers high-fidelity aligned generation in joint/unimodal settings, and generalizes robustly to out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: Klear offers a unified, scalable path toward next-generation audio-video synthesis by addressing core challenges through integrated architectural, training, and data innovations.

Abstract: Audio-video joint generation has progressed rapidly, yet substantial challenges still remain. Non-commercial approaches still suffer audio-visual asynchrony, poor lip-speech alignment, and unimodal degradation, which can be stemmed from weak audio-visual correspondence modeling, limited generalization, and scarce high-quality dense-caption data. To address these issues, we introduce Klear and delve into three axes--model architecture, training strategy, and data curation. Architecturally, we adopt a single-tower design with unified DiT blocks and an Omni-Full Attention mechanism, achieving tight audio-visual alignment and strong scalability. Training-wise, we adopt a progressive multitask regime--random modality masking to joint optimization across tasks, and a multistage curriculum, yielding robust representations, strengthening A-V aligned world knowledge, and preventing unimodal collapse. For datasets, we present the first large-scale audio-video dataset with dense captions, and introduce a novel automated data-construction pipeline which annotates and filters millions of diverse, high-quality, strictly aligned audio-video-caption triplets. Building on this, Klear scales to large datasets, delivering high-fidelity, semantically and temporally aligned, instruction-following generation in both joint and unimodal settings while generalizing robustly to out-of-distribution scenarios. Across tasks, it substantially outperforms prior methods by a large margin and achieves performance comparable to Veo 3, offering a unified, scalable path toward next-generation audio-video synthesis.

*Xu Zhang,Cheng Da,Huan Yang,Kun Gai,Ming Lu,Zhan Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResTok introduces a hierarchical residual visual tokenizer for autoregressive image generation, improving efficiency and quality over language-inspired approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 1D visual tokenizers follow language modeling principles, treating visual data as flat sequential tokens and ignoring vision's hierarchical nature, which limits representational capacity and generation efficiency.

Method: Proposes Residual Tokenizer (ResTok) with hierarchical residuals for both image and latent tokens, enabling cross-level feature fusion and preventing information overlap. Also introduces hierarchical AR generator that predicts entire levels of tokens at once.

Result: Achieves gFID of 2.34 on ImageNet-256 with only 9 sampling steps, significantly improving AR image generation efficiency and quality.

Conclusion: Restoring hierarchical residual priors in visual tokenization brings "vision" back to vision, enabling more efficient and higher-quality autoregressive image generation.

Abstract: Existing 1D visual tokenizers for autoregressive (AR) generation largely follow the design principles of language modeling, as they are built directly upon transformers whose priors originate in language, yielding single-hierarchy latent tokens and treating visual data as flat sequential token streams. However, this language-like formulation overlooks key properties of vision, particularly the hierarchical and residual network designs that have long been essential for convergence and efficiency in visual models. To bring "vision" back to vision, we propose the Residual Tokenizer (ResTok), a 1D visual tokenizer that builds hierarchical residuals for both image tokens and latent tokens. The hierarchical representations obtained through progressively merging enable cross-level feature fusion at each layer, substantially enhancing representational capacity. Meanwhile, the semantic residuals between hierarchies prevent information overlap, yielding more concentrated latent distributions that are easier for AR modeling. Cross-level bindings consequently emerge without any explicit constraints. To accelerate the generation process, we further introduce a hierarchical AR generator that substantially reduces sampling steps by predicting an entire level of latent tokens at once rather than generating them strictly token-by-token. Extensive experiments demonstrate that restoring hierarchical residual priors in visual tokenization significantly improves AR image generation, achieving a gFID of 2.34 on ImageNet-256 with only 9 sampling steps.

### [64] [FUSION: Full-Body Unified Motion Prior for Body and Hands via Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03959)
*Enes Duran,Nikos Athanasiou,Muhammed Kocabas,Michael J. Black,Omid Taheri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FUSION is the first diffusion-based unconditional full-body motion prior that jointly models body and hand motion, achieving state-of-the-art performance on motion synthesis benchmarks and enabling novel applications like object interaction and self-interaction generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human motion synthesis methods either ignore hand motions entirely or generate full-body motions only for narrowly scoped tasks under constrained settings. There's a lack of large-scale datasets that jointly capture diverse full-body motion with detailed hand articulation, which is essential since hands are central to interacting with surroundings and conveying gestures.

Method: Curated and unified existing hand motion datasets with large-scale body motion data to generate full-body sequences. Proposed FUSION, a diffusion-based unconditional full-body motion prior that jointly models body and hand motion. Developed an optimization pipeline that refines the latent space of the diffusion model to generate task-specific motions for applications like object interaction and self-interaction generation.

Result: FUSION surpasses state-of-the-art skeletal control models on the Keypoint Tracking task in HumanML3D dataset and achieves superior motion naturalness. Successfully demonstrated applications: (1) generating detailed full-body motion including fingers during object interaction, and (2) generating Self-Interaction motions using LLM to transform natural language cues into actionable motion constraints, with precise hand control while maintaining plausible full-body coordination.

Conclusion: FUSION represents a significant advancement in full-body motion synthesis by jointly modeling body and hand motion, overcoming previous limitations in dataset availability and model capability. The approach enables novel applications beyond standard benchmarks and demonstrates practical utility for generating realistic human interactions with objects and self-interactions from natural language.

Abstract: Hands are central to interacting with our surroundings and conveying gestures, making their inclusion essential for full-body motion synthesis. Despite this, existing human motion synthesis methods fall short: some ignore hand motions entirely, while others generate full-body motions only for narrowly scoped tasks under highly constrained settings. A key obstacle is the lack of large-scale datasets that jointly capture diverse full-body motion with detailed hand articulation. While some datasets capture both, they are limited in scale and diversity. Conversely, large-scale datasets typically focus either on body motion without hands or on hand motions without the body. To overcome this, we curate and unify existing hand motion datasets with large-scale body motion data to generate full-body sequences that capture both hand and body. We then propose the first diffusion-based unconditional full-body motion prior, FUSION, which jointly models body and hand motion. Despite using a pose-based motion representation, FUSION surpasses state-of-the-art skeletal control models on the Keypoint Tracking task in the HumanML3D dataset and achieves superior motion naturalness. Beyond standard benchmarks, we demonstrate that FUSION can go beyond typical uses of motion priors through two applications: (1) generating detailed full-body motion including fingers during interaction given the motion of an object, and (2) generating Self-Interaction motions using an LLM to transform natural language cues into actionable motion constraints. For these applications, we develop an optimization pipeline that refines the latent space of our diffusion model to generate task-specific motions. Experiments on these tasks highlight precise control over hand motion while maintaining plausible full-body coordination. The code will be public.

Abstract: Commercial-grade poster design demands the seamless integration of aesthetic appeal with precise, informative content delivery. Current automated poster generation systems face significant limitations, including incomplete design workflows, poor text rendering accuracy, and insufficient flexibility for commercial applications. To address these challenges, we propose PosterVerse, a full-workflow, commercial-grade poster generation method that seamlessly automates the entire design process while delivering high-density and scalable text rendering. PosterVerse replicates professional design through three key stages: (1) blueprint creation using fine-tuned LLMs to extract key design elements from user requirements, (2) graphical background generation via customized diffusion models to create visually appealing imagery, and (3) unified layout-text rendering with an MLLM-powered HTML engine to guarantee high text accuracy and flexible customization. In addition, we introduce PosterDNA, a commercial-grade, HTML-based dataset tailored for training and validating poster design models. To the best of our knowledge, PosterDNA is the first Chinese poster generation dataset to introduce HTML typography files, enabling scalable text rendering and fundamentally solving the challenges of rendering small and high-density text. Experimental results demonstrate that PosterVerse consistently produces commercial-grade posters with appealing visuals, accurate text alignment, and customizable layouts, making it a promising solution for automating commercial poster design.

*Onur Keleş,A. Murat Tekalp*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Paons (Padé neurons) are a novel non-linear neuron model based on Padé approximants that provide stronger non-linearity than traditional McCulloch-Pitts neurons, offering diversity of non-linearity and layer efficiency while encompassing previous neuron models as special cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional neural networks use McCulloch-Pitts neurons with linear models followed by point-wise non-linear activation, which has limited non-linearity. While various non-linear neuron models have been proposed, there's a need for a more powerful and flexible non-linear neuron model that can provide stronger non-linearity with fewer layers.

Method: Introduces Padé neurons (Paons) inspired by Padé approximants, which learn different non-linear functions of their inputs. Paons replace classic neurons in existing neural architectures (ResNet-based models for image super-resolution, compression, and classification), offering diversity of non-linearity and layer efficiency while including all previously proposed neuron models as special cases.

Result: Experimental results show that neural models built with Paons provide better or equal performance than their classic counterparts with a smaller number of layers. Paons demonstrate stronger non-linearity in fewer layers compared to piecewise linear approximation.

Conclusion: Paons represent a superior non-linear neuron model that offers enhanced performance and efficiency, with the flexibility to replace any existing neuron model while providing open-source implementation for broader adoption.

Abstract: Neural networks commonly employ the McCulloch-Pitts neuron model, which is a linear model followed by a point-wise non-linear activation. Various researchers have already advanced inherently non-linear neuron models, such as quadratic neurons, generalized operational neurons, generative neurons, and super neurons, which offer stronger non-linearity compared to point-wise activation functions. In this paper, we introduce a novel and better non-linear neuron model called Padé neurons (Paons), inspired by Padé approximants. Paons offer several advantages, such as diversity of non-linearity, since each Paon learns a different non-linear function of its inputs, and layer efficiency, since Paons provide stronger non-linearity in much fewer layers compared to piecewise linear approximation. Furthermore, Paons include all previously proposed neuron models as special cases, thus any neuron model in any network can be replaced by Paons. We note that there has been a proposal to employ the Padé approximation as a generalized point-wise activation function, which is fundamentally different from our model. To validate the efficacy of Paons, in our experiments, we replace classic neurons in some well-known neural image super-resolution, compression, and classification models based on the ResNet architecture with Paons. Our comprehensive experimental results and analyses demonstrate that neural models built by Paons provide better or equal performance than their classic counterparts with a smaller number of layers. The PyTorch implementation code for Paon is open-sourced at https://github.com/onur-keles/Paon.

TL;DR: REACT is a frame-level reward model that evaluates structural distortions in generative videos, trained on a large human-annotated dataset and using a two-stage framework with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video reward models focus on visual quality, motion quality, and text alignment but overlook structural distortions like abnormal object appearances and interactions, which degrade video quality.

Method: Developed REACT with a two-stage training framework: (1) supervised fine-tuning with masked loss for domain knowledge, (2) reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization and pairwise rewards. Created a large-scale human preference dataset with a structural distortion taxonomy, plus additional data from a Chain-of-Thought synthesis pipeline. During inference, uses dynamic sampling to focus on distortion-prone frames.

Result: REACT effectively complements existing reward models in assessing structural distortion, achieving accurate quantitative evaluations and interpretable attribution analysis. Also introduced REACT-Bench benchmark for generative video distortion evaluation.

Conclusion: REACT addresses the gap in structural distortion evaluation for generative videos, providing both quantitative assessment and interpretable analysis to improve video generation quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in video reward models and post-training strategies have improved text-to-video (T2V) generation. While these models typically assess visual quality, motion quality, and text alignment, they often overlook key structural distortions, such as abnormal object appearances and interactions, which can degrade the overall quality of the generative video. To address this gap, we introduce REACT, a frame-level reward model designed specifically for structural distortions evaluation in generative videos. REACT assigns point-wise scores and attribution labels by reasoning over video frames, focusing on recognizing distortions. To support this, we construct a large-scale human preference dataset, annotated based on our proposed taxonomy of structural distortions, and generate additional data using a efficient Chain-of-Thought (CoT) synthesis pipeline. REACT is trained with a two-stage framework: ((1) supervised fine-tuning with masked loss for domain knowledge injection, followed by (2) reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and pairwise rewards to enhance reasoning capability and align output scores with human preferences. During inference, a dynamic sampling mechanism is introduced to focus on frames most likely to exhibit distortion. We also present REACT-Bench, a benchmark for generative video distortion evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that REACT complements existing reward models in assessing structutal distortion, achieving both accurate quantitative evaluations and interpretable attribution analysis.

TL;DR: Annotation-efficient wind turbine blade segmentation using unsupervised region growing and binary classification instead of pixel-level deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wind turbine inspections require accurate blade segmentation, but traditional pixel-wise deep learning methods need extensive annotated datasets, creating scalability challenges.

Method: Reframes segmentation as binary region classification using unsupervised Modular Adaptive Region Growing with Adaptive Thresholding and Region Merging, plus RegionMix augmentation for robustness.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy and strong cross-site generalization across different windfarms.

Conclusion: Proposed annotation-efficient approach enables reliable turbine blade segmentation without extensive labeled data, improving inspection automation scalability.

Abstract: Reliable operation of wind turbines requires frequent inspections, as even minor surface damages can degrade aerodynamic performance, reduce energy output, and accelerate blade wear. Central to automating these inspections is the accurate segmentation of turbine blades from visual data. This task is traditionally addressed through dense, pixel-wise deep learning models. However, such methods demand extensive annotated datasets, posing scalability challenges. In this work, we introduce an annotation-efficient segmentation approach that reframes the pixel-level task into a binary region classification problem. Image regions are generated using a fully unsupervised, interpretable Modular Adaptive Region Growing technique, guided by image-specific Adaptive Thresholding and enhanced by a Region Merging process that consolidates fragmented areas into coherent segments. To improve generalization and classification robustness, we introduce RegionMix, an augmentation strategy that synthesizes new training samples by combining distinct regions. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy and strong cross-site generalization by consistently segmenting turbine blades across distinct windfarms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RS-VLMs suffer from logical hallucinations and positional shortcuts, undermining reliability in strategic spatial decision-making. There's a need to transition from perception-centric recognition to high-level deductive reasoning for better cognitive reliability.

Method: 1) Construct GeoReason-Bench dataset with 4,000 reasoning trajectories from geometric primitives and expert knowledge. 2) Two-stage training: Supervised Knowledge Initialization for reasoning syntax and domain expertise, and Consistency-Aware Reinforcement Learning with Logical Consistency Reward that penalizes logical drift via option permutation.

Result: The framework significantly enhances cognitive reliability and interpretability of RS-VLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to other advanced methods.

Conclusion: GeoReason successfully addresses logical hallucinations in RS-VLMs by synchronizing internal thinking with final decisions, improving both reliability and interpretability for complex spatial tasks.

Abstract: The evolution of Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models(RS-VLMs) emphasizes the importance of transitioning from perception-centric recognition toward high-level deductive reasoning to enhance cognitive reliability in complex spatial tasks. However, current models often suffer from logical hallucinations, where correct answers are derived from flawed reasoning chains or rely on positional shortcuts rather than spatial logic. This decoupling undermines reliability in strategic spatial decision-making. To address this, we present GeoReason, a framework designed to synchronize internal thinking with final decisions. We first construct GeoReason-Bench, a logic-driven dataset containing 4,000 reasoning trajectories synthesized from geometric primitives and expert knowledge. We then formulate a two-stage training strategy: (1) Supervised Knowledge Initialization to equip the model with reasoning syntax and domain expertise, and (2) Consistency-Aware Reinforcement Learning to refine deductive reliability. This second stage integrates a novel Logical Consistency Reward, which penalizes logical drift via an option permutation strategy to anchor decisions in verifiable reasoning traces. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the cognitive reliability and interpretability of RS-VLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to other advanced methods.

*Yifan Wang,Yanyu Li,Sergey Tulyakov,Yun Fu,Anil Kag*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion-DRF: A differentiable reward flow method that uses frozen VLMs as training-free critics to fine-tune video diffusion models without needing preference datasets or reward models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DPO methods for T2V generation rely on non-differentiable preference signals from human annotations or learned reward models, which makes training label-intensive, bias-prone, and susceptible to reward hacking and unstable training.

Method: Uses a frozen, off-the-shelf VLM as a training-free critic, directly backpropagating VLM feedback through the diffusion denoising chain. Converts logit-level responses into token-aware gradients for optimization. Includes automated aspect-structured prompting pipeline for reliable multi-dimensional VLM feedback and gradient checkpointing for efficient updates through final denoising steps.

Result: Improves video quality and semantic alignment while mitigating reward hacking and collapse. Works without additional reward models or preference datasets. Model-agnostic and generalizes to other diffusion-based generative tasks.

Conclusion: Diffusion-DRF provides a more stable, efficient, and generalizable approach to fine-tuning video diffusion models by leveraging frozen VLMs as differentiable critics, eliminating the need for preference datasets and learned reward models.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently improved Text-to-Video (T2V) generation by enhancing visual fidelity and text alignment. However, current methods rely on non-differentiable preference signals from human annotations or learned reward models. This reliance makes training label-intensive, bias-prone, and easy-to-game, which often triggers reward hacking and unstable training. We propose Diffusion-DRF, a differentiable reward flow for fine-tuning video diffusion models using a frozen, off-the-shelf Vision-Language Model (VLM) as a training-free critic. Diffusion-DRF directly backpropagates VLM feedback through the diffusion denoising chain, converting logit-level responses into token-aware gradients for optimization. We propose an automated, aspect-structured prompting pipeline to obtain reliable multi-dimensional VLM feedback, while gradient checkpointing enables efficient updates through the final denoising steps. Diffusion-DRF improves video quality and semantic alignment while mitigating reward hacking and collapse -- without additional reward models or preference datasets. It is model-agnostic and readily generalizes to other diffusion-based generative tasks.

*Vladimir Frants,Sos Agaian,Karen Panetta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToTMNet is a lightweight rPPG architecture using FFT-accelerated Toeplitz temporal mixing instead of attention, achieving strong heart-rate estimation with only 63k parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent deep rPPG models improve robustness but increase computational cost and parameters, with attention-based temporal modeling suffering from quadratic scaling with temporal length. Need for efficient long-range temporal filtering in rPPG.

Method: Proposes ToTMNet with FFT-accelerated Toeplitz temporal mixing layer replacing temporal attention. Uses circulant embedding and FFT-based convolution for near-linear time operation. Combines local depthwise temporal convolution with gated global Toeplitz mixing.

Result: On UBFC-rPPG: 1.055 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.996. Synthetic-to-real (SCAMPS to UBFC-rPPG): 1.582 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.994. Only 63k parameters total.

Conclusion: Toeplitz-structured temporal mixing is a practical and efficient alternative to attention for rPPG, enabling efficient long-range temporal filtering with compact design. Gating mechanism is important for effective global mixing, especially under domain shift.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) estimates a blood volume pulse (BVP) waveform from facial videos captured by commodity cameras. Although recent deep models improve robustness compared to classical signal-processing approaches, many methods increase computational cost and parameter count, and attention-based temporal modeling introduces quadratic scaling with respect to the temporal length. This paper proposes ToTMNet, a lightweight rPPG architecture that replaces temporal attention with an FFT-accelerated Toeplitz temporal mixing layer. The Toeplitz operator provides full-sequence temporal receptive field using a linear number of parameters in the clip length and can be applied in near-linear time using circulant embedding and FFT-based convolution. ToTMNet integrates the global Toeplitz temporal operator into a compact gated temporal mixer that combines a local depthwise temporal convolution branch with gated global Toeplitz mixing, enabling efficient long-range temporal filtering while only having 63k parameters. Experiments on two datasets, UBFC-rPPG (real videos) and SCAMPS (synthetic videos), show that ToTMNet achieves strong heart-rate estimation accuracy with a compact design. On UBFC-rPPG intra-dataset evaluation, ToTMNet reaches 1.055 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.996. In a synthetic-to-real setting (SCAMPS to UBFC-rPPG), ToTMNet reaches 1.582 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.994. Ablation results confirm that the gating mechanism is important for effectively using global Toeplitz mixing, especially under domain shift. The main limitation of this preprint study is the use of only two datasets; nevertheless, the results indicate that Toeplitz-structured temporal mixing is a practical and efficient alternative to attention for rPPG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual localization methods face trade-offs: 2D image-based approaches are easy to build/maintain but limited in geometric reasoning, while 3D structure-based methods achieve high accuracy but require centralized reconstruction and are difficult to update.

Method: Augment each image with estimated depth maps to capture geometric structure, supported by dense matchers. Use compact compression and GPU-accelerated LO-RANSAC for efficient storage and computation, allowing flexible trade-off between accuracy and memory efficiency.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy on various standard benchmarks and outperforms existing memory-efficient methods at comparable map sizes.

Conclusion: The proposed 2D image-based representation with depth augmentation provides the best of both worlds: easy maintenance like 2D methods while achieving highest accuracy like 3D methods, with efficient storage and computation.

Abstract: Existing visual localization methods are typically either 2D image-based, which are easy to build and maintain but limited in effective geometric reasoning, or 3D structure-based, which achieve high accuracy but require a centralized reconstruction and are difficult to update. In this work, we revisit visual localization with a 2D image-based representation and propose to augment each image with estimated depth maps to capture the geometric structure. Supported by the effective use of dense matchers, this representation is not only easy to build and maintain, but achieves highest accuracy in challenging conditions. With compact compression and a GPU-accelerated LO-RANSAC implementation, the whole pipeline is efficient in both storage and computation and allows for a flexible trade-off between accuracy and highest memory efficiency. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy on various standard benchmarks and outperforms existing memory-efficient methods at comparable map sizes.

Main category: eess.IV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noisy annotations in medical image segmentation due to complex organ structures and inter-annotator variability limit model efficacy. Medical annotators can correct errors using prior knowledge, motivating an automated approach to handle label noise.

Method: End-to-end staged reinforcement learning framework with: 1) Formulating noisy annotations as voxel-dependent problem with staged RL for robust convergence; 2) Voxel-level asynchronous advantage actor-critic (vA3C) where each voxel is an autonomous agent refining its state representation; 3) Novel action space and composite reward function combining Dice value and spatial continuity metric.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on three public medical image datasets under various experimental settings, with average improvement of over 3% in both Dice and IoU scores.

Conclusion: SVL-DRL effectively mitigates noisy annotation impact through voxel-level reinforcement learning, enabling robust medical image segmentation without manual intervention and achieving significant accuracy improvements.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved significant advancements in medical image segmentation. Currently, obtaining accurate segmentation outcomes is critically reliant on large-scale datasets with high-quality annotations. However, noisy annotations are frequently encountered owing to the complex morphological structures of organs in medical images and variations among different annotators, which can substantially limit the efficacy of segmentation models. Motivated by the fact that medical imaging annotator can correct labeling errors during segmentation based on prior knowledge, we propose an end-to-end Staged Voxel-Level Deep Reinforcement Learning (SVL-DRL) framework for robust medical image segmentation under noisy annotations. This framework employs a dynamic iterative update strategy to automatically mitigate the impact of erroneous labels without requiring manual intervention. The key advancements of SVL-DRL over existing works include: i) formulating noisy annotations as a voxel-dependent problem and addressing it through a novel staged reinforcement learning framework which guarantees robust model convergence; ii) incorporating a voxel-level asynchronous advantage actor-critic (vA3C) module that conceptualizes each voxel as an autonomous agent, which allows each agent to dynamically refine its own state representation during training, thereby directly mitigating the influence of erroneous labels; iii) designing a novel action space for the agents, along with a composite reward function that strategically combines the Dice value and a spatial continuity metric to significantly boost segmentation accuracy while maintain semantic integrity. Experiments on three public medical image datasets demonstrates State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance under various experimental settings, with an average improvement of over 3\% in both Dice and IoU scores.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous Go AI systems like AlphaGo rely on model-based Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which requires extensive search during training. The authors aim to demonstrate that model-free reinforcement learning can efficiently master complex games like Go without search.

Method: QZero uses entropy-regularized Q-learning with a single Q-value network that unifies policy evaluation and improvement. It learns through self-play and off-policy experience replay without any human data, starting from scratch (tabula rasa).

Result: Trained for 5 months with modest compute resources (7 GPUs), QZero achieved performance comparable to AlphaGo, demonstrating the efficiency of model-free RL for mastering Go.

Conclusion: This work shows for the first time that model-free reinforcement learning can efficiently master the game of Go, and demonstrates the feasibility of off-policy RL in solving large-scale, complex environments without search during training.

Abstract: The game of Go has long served as a benchmark for artificial intelligence, demanding sophisticated strategic reasoning and long-term planning. Previous approaches such as AlphaGo and its successors, have predominantly relied on model-based Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). In this work, we present QZero, a novel model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that forgoes search during training and learns a Nash equilibrium policy through self-play and off-policy experience replay. Built upon entropy-regularized Q-learning, QZero utilizes a single Q-value network to unify policy evaluation and improvement. Starting tabula rasa without human data and trained for 5 months with modest compute resources (7 GPUs), QZero achieved a performance level comparable to that of AlphaGo. This demonstrates, for the first time, the efficiency of using model-free reinforcement learning to master the game of Go, as well as the feasibility of off-policy reinforcement learning in solving large-scale and complex environments.

*Akarsh Kumar,Ryan Bahlous-Boldi,Prafull Sharma,Phillip Isola,Sebastian Risi,Yujin Tang,David Ha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DRQ is a self-play algorithm using LLMs to evolve Core War warriors through Red Queen dynamics, producing increasingly general and convergent strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most LLM-evolution frameworks use static optimization, missing the open-ended adversarial dynamics of real-world evolution. The paper aims to study Red Queen dynamics through continual adaptation to changing objectives.

Method: Digital Red Queen (DRQ) uses LLMs to evolve assembly-like programs (warriors) that compete in Core War. Each round evolves a new warrior to defeat all previous ones, creating a sequence of adapted warriors through self-play.

Result: Warriors become increasingly general (relative to held-out human warriors) and show reduced behavioral diversity across independent runs, indicating convergence toward general-purpose strategies similar to convergent evolution.

Conclusion: Shifting from static to dynamic Red Queen objectives has value. Core War serves as a rich sandbox for studying adversarial adaptation, and DRQ's simplicity suggests similar approaches could work in practical adversarial domains like cybersecurity.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to evolve solutions to problems in many domains, in a process inspired by biological evolution. However, unlike biological evolution, most LLM-evolution frameworks are formulated as static optimization problems, overlooking the open-ended adversarial dynamics that characterize real-world evolutionary processes. Here, we study Digital Red Queen (DRQ), a simple self-play algorithm that embraces these so-called "Red Queen" dynamics via continual adaptation to a changing objective. DRQ uses an LLM to evolve assembly-like programs, called warriors, which compete against each other for control of a virtual machine in the game of Core War, a Turing-complete environment studied in artificial life and connected to cybersecurity. In each round of DRQ, the model evolves a new warrior to defeat all previous ones, producing a sequence of adapted warriors. Over many rounds, we observe that warriors become increasingly general (relative to a set of held-out human warriors). Interestingly, warriors also become less behaviorally diverse across independent runs, indicating a convergence pressure toward a general-purpose behavioral strategy, much like convergent evolution in nature. This result highlights a potential value of shifting from static objectives to dynamic Red Queen objectives. Our work positions Core War as a rich, controllable sandbox for studying adversarial adaptation in artificial systems and for evaluating LLM-based evolution methods. More broadly, the simplicity and effectiveness of DRQ suggest that similarly minimal self-play approaches could prove useful in other more practical multi-agent adversarial domains, like real-world cybersecurity or combating drug resistance.

TL;DR: Multi-agent workflow decouples task description optimization from constraint refinement using quantitative feedback to improve LLM prompt compliance


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate conceptually correct content but fail to adhere to formal constraints, creating procedurally flawed outputs. Traditional prompt refinement focuses only on task description, ignoring granular constraints that serve as acceptance criteria.

Method: Novel multi-agentic workflow that separates optimization of primary task description from its constraints, using quantitative scores as feedback to iteratively rewrite and improve both components.

Result: Method produces revised prompts that yield significantly higher compliance scores from models like Llama 3.1 8B and Mixtral-8x 7B compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: Decoupling task description optimization from constraint refinement with quantitative feedback is an effective approach for improving LLM prompt compliance and addressing procedural flaws in generated content.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate substantively relevant content but fail to adhere to formal constraints, leading to outputs that are conceptually correct but procedurally flawed. Traditional prompt refinement approaches focus on rephrasing the description of the primary task an LLM has to perform, neglecting the granular constraints that function as acceptance criteria for its response. We propose a novel multi-agentic workflow that decouples optimization of the primary task description from its constraints, using quantitative scores as feedback to iteratively rewrite and improve them. Our evaluation demonstrates this method produces revised prompts that yield significantly higher compliance scores from models like Llama 3.1 8B and Mixtral-8x 7B.

Motivation: To advance Theory of Mind in AI by exploring self-awareness through how agents model their own internal mental states, inspired by biological pain as a learning signal.

Method: Introduce introspective exploration using hidden Markov models to infer "pain-belief" from online observations, integrated into subjective reward functions for RL agents in gridworld environments.

Result: Introspective agents significantly outperform standard baseline agents and can replicate complex human-like behaviors; framework also investigates differences between normal and chronic pain perception models.

Conclusion: Self-awareness through introspective pain-belief modeling enhances RL agent performance and provides computational framework for studying Theory of Mind and pain perception.

Abstract: Understanding how artificial agents model internal mental states is central to advancing Theory of Mind in AI. Evidence points to a unified system for self- and other-awareness. We explore this self-awareness by having reinforcement learning agents infer their own internal states in gridworld environments. Specifically, we introduce an introspective exploration component that is inspired by biological pain as a learning signal by utilizing a hidden Markov model to infer "pain-belief" from online observations. This signal is integrated into a subjective reward function to study how self-awareness affects the agent's learning abilities. Further, we use this computational framework to investigate the difference in performance between normal and chronic pain perception models. Results show that introspective agents in general significantly outperform standard baseline agents and can replicate complex human-like behaviors.

TL;DR: CPGPrompt: An auto-prompting system that converts narrative clinical guidelines into LLM-interpretable decision trees for patient case evaluation, achieving strong binary referral decisions but variable multi-class pathway performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) provide evidence-based care recommendations but are challenging to integrate into AI systems. Previous rule-based approaches suffer from poor interpretability, inconsistent guideline adherence, and narrow domain applicability.

Method: Developed CPGPrompt framework that translates narrative CPGs into structured decision trees and uses LLMs to dynamically navigate them for patient evaluation. Tested with synthetic vignettes across three domains (headache, lower back pain, prostate cancer) in four decision scenario categories.

Result: Binary specialty referral classification achieved strong performance across all domains (F1: 0.85-1.00) with perfect recall (1.00 ± 0.00). Multi-class pathway assignment showed reduced performance: headache (F1: 0.47), lower back pain (F1: 0.72), prostate cancer (F1: 0.77). Performance differences reflected guideline structure challenges.

Conclusion: CPGPrompt effectively translates CPGs into LLM-interpretable formats for binary decisions, but multi-class pathway classification faces domain-specific challenges related to guideline structure complexity, negation handling, temporal reasoning, and reliance on quantifiable data.

Abstract: Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) provide evidence-based recommendations for patient care; however, integrating them into Artificial Intelligence (AI) remains challenging. Previous approaches, such as rule-based systems, face significant limitations, including poor interpretability, inconsistent adherence to guidelines, and narrow domain applicability. To address this, we develop and validate CPGPrompt, an auto-prompting system that converts narrative clinical guidelines into large language models (LLMs).
  Our framework translates CPGs into structured decision trees and utilizes an LLM to dynamically navigate them for patient case evaluation. Synthetic vignettes were generated across three domains (headache, lower back pain, and prostate cancer) and distributed into four categories to test different decision scenarios. System performance was assessed on both binary specialty-referral decisions and fine-grained pathway-classification tasks.
  The binary specialty referral classification achieved consistently strong performance across all domains (F1: 0.85-1.00), with high recall (1.00 $\pm$ 0.00). In contrast, multi-class pathway assignment showed reduced performance, with domain-specific variations: headache (F1: 0.47), lower back pain (F1: 0.72), and prostate cancer (F1: 0.77). Domain-specific performance differences reflected the structure of each guideline. The headache guideline highlighted challenges with negation handling. The lower back pain guideline required temporal reasoning. In contrast, prostate cancer pathways benefited from quantifiable laboratory tests, resulting in more reliable decision-making.

*Stefan Konigorski,Johannes E. Vedder,Babajide Alamu Owoyele,İbrahim Özkan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LFMs can't replace N-of-1 trials for personalized medicine; they're complementary - LFMs generate hypotheses from population data, N-of-1 trials provide causal validation for individuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large foundation models (LFMs) are transforming healthcare AI but struggle with true personalization due to paradoxes like the generalizability paradox (high accuracy in one study but chance-level performance in others), privacy-performance paradox, scale-specificity paradox, and automation-empathy paradox. There's also uncertainty about whether LFMs' predictive capabilities can provide the causal understanding needed for personalized treatment.

Method: Proposes a hybrid framework combining LFMs and N-of-1 trials. LFMs generate ranked intervention candidates with uncertainty estimates from multimodal population data, while N-of-1 trials (crossover self-experiments) provide within-person causal validation for individual patients. This approach navigates the identified paradoxes by separating hypothesis generation from causal validation.

Result: The paper argues that LFMs cannot replace N-of-1 trials, which remain the gold standard for individual causal inference in personalized medicine. Instead, LFMs and N-of-1 trials are complementary: LFMs excel at rapid hypothesis generation from population patterns, while N-of-1 trials excel at causal validation for specific individuals.

Conclusion: A hybrid framework combining LFMs' predictive capabilities with N-of-1 trials' causal validation is essential for responsible AI integration in personalized medicine. Clarifying the boundary between prediction and causation, and explicitly addressing the paradoxical tensions, is crucial for achieving true personalization in healthcare AI.

Abstract: Large foundation models (LFMs) transform healthcare AI in prevention, diagnostics, and treatment. However, whether LFMs can provide truly personalized treatment recommendations remains an open question. Recent research has revealed multiple challenges for personalization, including the fundamental generalizability paradox: models achieving high accuracy in one clinical study perform at chance level in others, demonstrating that personalization and external validity exist in tension. This exemplifies broader contradictions in AI-driven healthcare: the privacy-performance paradox, scale-specificity paradox, and the automation-empathy paradox. As another challenge, the degree of causal understanding required for personalized recommendations, as opposed to mere predictive capacities of LFMs, remains an open question. N-of-1 trials -- crossover self-experiments and the gold standard for individual causal inference in personalized medicine -- resolve these tensions by providing within-person causal evidence while preserving privacy through local experimentation. Despite their impressive capabilities, this paper argues that LFMs cannot replace N-of-1 trials. We argue that LFMs and N-of-1 trials are complementary: LFMs excel at rapid hypothesis generation from population patterns using multimodal data, while N-of-1 trials excel at causal validation for a given individual. We propose a hybrid framework that combines the strengths of both to enable personalization and navigate the identified paradoxes: LFMs generate ranked intervention candidates with uncertainty estimates, which trigger subsequent N-of-1 trials. Clarifying the boundary between prediction and causation and explicitly addressing the paradoxical tensions are essential for responsible AI integration in personalized medicine.

Conclusion: PSN provides an effective framework for continual skill acquisition with learning dynamics that parallel neural network training, enabling scalable skill libraries in open-ended environments.

Abstract: We study continual skill acquisition in open-ended embodied environments where an agent must construct, refine, and reuse an expanding library of executable skills. We introduce the Programmatic Skill Network (PSN), a framework in which skills are executable symbolic programs forming a compositional network that evolves through experience. PSN defines three core mechanisms instantiated via large language models: (1)REFLECT for structured fault localization over skill compositions, (2) progressive optimization with maturity-aware update gating that stabilizes reliable skills while maintaining plasticity for uncertain ones, and (3) canonical structural refactoring under rollback validation that maintains network compactness. We further show that PSN's learning dynamics exhibit structural parallels to neural network training. Experiments on MineDojo and Crafter demonstrate robust skill reuse, rapid adaptation, and strong generalization across open-ended task distributions.\footnote{We plan to open-source the code.

### [83] [Variance Computation for Weighted Model Counting with Knowledge Compilation Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03523)
*Kengo Nakamura,Masaaki Nishino,Norihito Yasuda*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates the tractability of computing the variance of weighted model counting (WMC) to measure uncertainty in probabilistic inference outcomes when model parameters have uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In practical inference tasks, model parameters often have uncertainty because they are learned from data. To measure the uncertainty in inference outcomes, we need to compute the variance of WMC results when parameters are treated as random variables, but the tractability of such variance computation is largely unknown.

Method: The paper develops a polynomial-time algorithm for computing WMC variance when inputs are structured d-DNNFs, proves hardness results for structured DNNFs, d-DNNFs, and FBDDs, and applies the approach to Bayesian networks to measure uncertainty in marginal probabilities.

Result: The paper shows that WMC variance can be computed in polynomial time for structured d-DNNFs, but is hard for structured DNNFs, d-DNNFs, and FBDDs. The algorithm successfully evaluates variance of marginal probabilities on real-world Bayesian networks and analyzes parameter variance impact.

Conclusion: Computing WMC variance has mixed tractability: polynomial-time for structured d-DNNFs but hard for other common knowledge compilation forms. The approach provides a practical way to measure uncertainty in probabilistic inference when parameters have uncertainty.

Abstract: One of the most important queries in knowledge compilation is weighted model counting (WMC), which has been applied to probabilistic inference on various models, such as Bayesian networks. In practical situations on inference tasks, the model's parameters have uncertainty because they are often learned from data, and thus we want to compute the degree of uncertainty in the inference outcome. One possible approach is to regard the inference outcome as a random variable by introducing distributions for the parameters and evaluate the variance of the outcome. Unfortunately, the tractability of computing such a variance is hardly known. Motivated by this, we consider the problem of computing the variance of WMC and investigate this problem's tractability. First, we derive a polynomial time algorithm to evaluate the WMC variance when the input is given as a structured d-DNNF. Second, we prove the hardness of this problem for structured DNNFs, d-DNNFs, and FBDDs, which is intriguing because the latter two allow polynomial time WMC algorithms. Finally, we show an application that measures the uncertainty in the inference of Bayesian networks. We empirically show that our algorithm can evaluate the variance of the marginal probability on real-world Bayesian networks and analyze the impact of the variances of parameters on the variance of the marginal.

*Di Wu,Yanyan Zhao,Xin Lu,Mingzhe Li,Bing Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STAR-S is a self-taught reasoning framework that improves LLM safety by iteratively learning to reason about safety rules through a cycle of elicitation, reflection, and fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety approaches struggle to determine what form of safety reasoning effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, which is difficult to explicitly design or directly obtain.

Method: STAR-S integrates safety rule reasoning learning into a self-taught loop: eliciting reasoning and reflection guided by safety rules, then leveraging fine-tuning to enhance safety reasoning, creating a synergistic cycle.

Result: Experiments show STAR-S effectively defends against jailbreak attacks and outperforms baselines.

Conclusion: The self-taught reasoning framework provides an effective approach to improving LLM safety against jailbreak attacks through iterative learning of safety rule reasoning.

Abstract: Defending against jailbreak attacks is crucial for the safe deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent research has attempted to improve safety by training models to reason over safety rules before responding. However, a key issue lies in determining what form of safety reasoning effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, which is difficult to explicitly design or directly obtain. To address this, we propose \textbf{STAR-S} (\textbf{S}elf-\textbf{TA}ught \textbf{R}easoning based on \textbf{S}afety rules), a framework that integrates the learning of safety rule reasoning into a self-taught loop. The core of STAR-S involves eliciting reasoning and reflection guided by safety rules, then leveraging fine-tuning to enhance safety reasoning. Repeating this process creates a synergistic cycle. Improvements in the model's reasoning and interpretation of safety rules allow it to produce better reasoning data under safety rule prompts, which is then utilized for further training. Experiments show that STAR-S effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, outperforming baselines. Code is available at: https://github.com/pikepokenew/STAR_S.git.

*Zhizhang Fu,Yuancheng Gu,Chenkai Hu,Hanmeng Liu,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Test-time scaling improves LLM reasoning but current CoT evaluation can't distinguish between genuine reasoning and just generating more text. The paper proposes a neuro-symbolic framework for better process evaluation, identifies four reasoning prototypes, and finds that longer outputs don't guarantee better reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Chain-of-Thought evaluation methods are limited in distinguishing whether performance improvements come from actual reasoning capabilities or simply from generating more verbose outputs. This obscures understanding of true reasoning progress in LLMs.

Method: Proposes a novel neuro-symbolic framework for non-intrusive, comprehensive process-centric evaluation of reasoning. Uses this framework to analyze LLM reasoning behaviors, identify failure modes, and examine impacts of inference mode, training strategy, and model scale.

Result: Identifies four distinct behavioral prototypes in reasoning. Finds that extended token generation is not necessary for deep reasoning. Reveals critical constraints: mixing long and short CoT data in training causes premature saturation and collapse, while distillation into smaller models captures behavioral length but fails to replicate logical efficacy due to capacity limits.

Conclusion: The proposed neuro-symbolic evaluation framework provides better insights into reasoning quality beyond output length. Key findings show that more text doesn't equal better reasoning, and careful training data curation is crucial to avoid reasoning collapse. Model capacity fundamentally limits reasoning transfer via distillation.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex reasoning, yet the limitations of current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation obscures whether performance gains stem from genuine reasoning or mere verbosity. To address this, (1) we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework for the non-intrusive, comprehensive process-centric evaluation of reasoning. (2) Through this lens, we identify four distinct behavioral prototypes and diagnose the failure modes. (3) We examine the impact of inference mode, training strategy, and model scale. Our analysis reveals that extended token generation is not a prerequisite for deep reasoning. Furthermore, we reveal critical constraints: mixing long and short CoT data in training risks in premature saturation and collapse, while distillation into smaller models captures behavioral length but fails to replicate logical efficacy due to intrinsic capacity limits.

*Yuxuan Jiang,Francis Ferraro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SCRIBE is a reinforcement learning framework that uses skill-conditioned reward modeling with intermediate behavioral evaluation to improve credit assignment in multi-step reasoning tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on reasoning and tool-use benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based judges for process-level rewards produce noisy and inconsistent signals because they lack fine-grained, task-specific rubrics to distinguish high-level planning from low-level execution, making credit assignment in multi-step reasoning challenging.

Method: SCRIBE introduces a mid-level abstraction using a curated library of skill prototypes to ground reward modeling. It transforms open-ended LLM evaluation into a constrained verification problem by routing each subgoal to corresponding prototypes, providing precise structured rubrics that reduce reward variance.

Result: SCRIBE achieves state-of-the-art performance across reasoning and tool-use benchmarks, improving Qwen3-4B model's AIME25 accuracy from 43.3% to 63.3% and significantly increasing success rates in complex multi-turn tool interactions. Analysis shows co-evolution across abstraction levels where mid-level skill mastery precedes effective high-level planning.

Conclusion: SCRIBE provides a scalable and complementary pathway toward more autonomous and reliable tool-using agents by addressing credit assignment through skill-conditioned reward modeling with intermediate behavioral evaluation, and is additive to low-level tool optimizations.

Abstract: Training reliable tool-augmented agents remains a significant challenge, largely due to the difficulty of credit assignment in multi-step reasoning. While process-level reward models offer a promising direction, existing LLM-based judges often produce noisy and inconsistent signals because they lack fine-grained, task-specific rubrics to distinguish high-level planning from low-level execution. In this work, we introduce SCRIBE (Skill-Conditioned Reward with Intermediate Behavioral Evaluation), a reinforcement learning framework that intervenes at a novel mid-level abstraction. SCRIBE grounds reward modeling in a curated library of skill prototypes, transforming open-ended LLM evaluation into a constrained verification problem. By routing each subgoal to a corresponding prototype, the reward model is equipped with precise, structured rubrics that substantially reduce reward variance.
  Experimental results show that SCRIBE achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of reasoning and tool-use benchmarks. In particular, it improves the AIME25 accuracy of a Qwen3-4B model from 43.3% to 63.3%, and significantly increases success rates in complex multi-turn tool interactions.
  Further analysis of training dynamics reveals a co-evolution across abstraction levels, where mastery of mid-level skills consistently precedes the emergence of effective high-level planning behaviors. Finally, we demonstrate that SCRIBE is additive to low-level tool optimizations, providing a scalable and complementary pathway toward more autonomous and reliable tool-using agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAE-Steering uses sparse autoencoders to disentangle reasoning strategies in Large Reasoning Models, enabling precise control over reasoning paths and improving accuracy by 7%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LRMs autonomously select reasoning strategies, often leading to inefficient or erroneous reasoning paths. Existing methods struggle with fine-grained strategy control due to conceptual entanglement in hidden states.

Method: Proposes SAE-Steering: uses Sparse Autoencoders to disentangle strategy features, then a two-stage pipeline (keyword logit amplification filtering + control effectiveness ranking) to identify strategy-specific features for steering.

Result: Outperforms existing methods by over 15% in control effectiveness. Controlling reasoning strategies redirects LRMs from erroneous to correct paths, achieving 7% absolute accuracy improvement.

Conclusion: SAE-Steering enables reliable and flexible control over reasoning strategies in LRMs through disentangled feature space, significantly improving reasoning reliability and accuracy.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit human-like cognitive reasoning strategies (e.g. backtracking, cross-verification) during reasoning process, which improves their performance on complex tasks. Currently, reasoning strategies are autonomously selected by LRMs themselves. However, such autonomous selection often produces inefficient or even erroneous reasoning paths. To make reasoning more reliable and flexible, it is important to develop methods for controlling reasoning strategies. Existing methods struggle to control fine-grained reasoning strategies due to conceptual entanglement in LRMs' hidden states. To address this, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose strategy-entangled hidden states into a disentangled feature space. To identify the few strategy-specific features from the vast pool of SAE features, we propose SAE-Steering, an efficient two-stage feature identification pipeline. SAE-Steering first recalls features that amplify the logits of strategy-specific keywords, filtering out over 99\% of features, and then ranks the remaining features by their control effectiveness. Using the identified strategy-specific features as control vectors, SAE-Steering outperforms existing methods by over 15\% in control effectiveness. Furthermore, controlling reasoning strategies can redirect LRMs from erroneous paths to correct ones, achieving a 7\% absolute accuracy improvement.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PFUA is a tool-augmented protein reasoning agent that outperforms text-only LLMs by 103% on protein function prediction tasks by integrating domain-specific tools rather than relying on pure chain-of-thought reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct transfer of text-based chain-of-thought reasoning from domains like math/programming to protein function understanding is ineffective - reinforcement learning amplifies superficial keyword patterns without introducing new biological knowledge, leading to poor generalization. Protein function prediction requires external biological priors and computational tools rather than purely internal reasoning.

Method: Proposed PFUA (tool-augmented protein reasoning agent) that unifies problem decomposition, tool invocation, and grounded answer generation. Instead of long unconstrained reasoning traces, PFUA integrates domain-specific tools to produce verifiable intermediate evidence.

Result: Experiments on four benchmarks show PFUA consistently outperforms text-only reasoning models with an average performance improvement of 103%.

Conclusion: Protein function prediction is a knowledge-intensive scientific task that fundamentally requires external biological priors and computational tools rather than purely internal reasoning. Tool-augmented approaches like PFUA are necessary for effective protein function understanding.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the effectiveness of chain-of-thought reasoning in symbolic domains such as mathematics and programming. However, our study shows that directly transferring such text-based reasoning paradigms to protein function understanding is ineffective: reinforcement learning mainly amplifies superficial keyword patterns while failing to introduce new biological knowledge, resulting in limited generalization. We argue that protein function prediction is a knowledge-intensive scientific task that fundamentally relies on external biological priors and computational tools rather than purely internal reasoning. To address this gap, we propose PFUA, a tool-augmented protein reasoning agent that unifies problem decomposition, tool invocation, and grounded answer generation. Instead of relying on long unconstrained reasoning traces, PFUA integrates domain-specific tools to produce verifiable intermediate evidence. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that PFUA consistently outperforms text-only reasoning models with an average performance improvement of 103%.

Validation is demonstrated through a clinical trial matching case study.

Conclusion: The approach provides actionable guidance to practitioners while maintaining formal rigor essential for enterprise deployment in dynamic, multi-agent ecosystems, bridging the gap between practical implementation needs and formal verification requirements for production-grade AI systems.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLM) and subsequent Agentic AI technologies requires systematic architectural guidance for building sophisticated, production-grade systems. This paper presents an approach for architecting such systems using design patterns derived from enterprise distributed systems standards, formal methods, and industry practice. We classify these patterns into three tiers: LLM Agents (task-specific automation), Agentic AI (adaptive goal-seekers), and Agentic Communities (organizational frameworks where AI agents and human participants coordinate through formal roles, protocols, and governance structures). We focus on Agentic Communities - coordination frameworks encompassing LLM Agents, Agentic AI entities, and humans - most relevant for enterprise and industrial applications. Drawing on established coordination principles from distributed systems, we ground these patterns in a formal framework that specifies collaboration agreements where AI agents and humans fill roles within governed ecosystems. This approach provides both practical guidance and formal verification capabilities, enabling expression of organizational, legal, and ethical rules through accountability mechanisms that ensure operational and verifiable governance of inter-agent communication, negotiation, and intent modeling. We validate this framework through a clinical trial matching case study. Our goal is to provide actionable guidance to practitioners while maintaining the formal rigor essential for enterprise deployment in dynamic, multi-agent ecosystems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SafeRemind is a decoding-time defense method that injects safe-reminding phrases into thinking steps of Large Reasoning Models to prevent unsafe behavior amplification, improving safety by up to 45.5% without parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) use explicit thinking steps that can amplify unsafe behaviors, but conventional defenses overlook the unique reasoning dynamics of LRMs. The authors discovered that safe-reminding phrases within thinking steps are crucial for ensuring LRM safety.

Method: SafeRemind dynamically injects safe-reminding phrases into thinking steps using entropy triggers to intervene at decision-locking points. This decoding-time defense redirects potentially harmful trajectories toward safer outcomes without requiring any parameter updates.

Result: Extensive evaluations across five LRMs and six benchmarks show SafeRemind substantially enhances safety, achieving improvements of up to 45.5 percentage points while preserving core reasoning utility.

Conclusion: SafeRemind effectively addresses the novel safety risks introduced by explicit thinking steps in LRMs through targeted intervention in the reasoning process, offering a practical defense mechanism that maintains reasoning capabilities while significantly improving safety.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve remarkable success through explicit thinking steps, yet the thinking steps introduce a novel risk by potentially amplifying unsafe behaviors. Despite this vulnerability, conventional defense mechanisms remain ineffective as they overlook the unique reasoning dynamics of LRMs. In this work, we find that the emergence of safe-reminding phrases within thinking steps plays a pivotal role in ensuring LRM safety. Motivated by this finding, we propose SafeRemind, a decoding-time defense method that dynamically injects safe-reminding phrases into thinking steps. By leveraging entropy triggers to intervene at decision-locking points, SafeRemind redirects potentially harmful trajectories toward safer outcomes without requiring any parameter updates. Extensive evaluations across five LRMs and six benchmarks demonstrate that SafeRemind substantially enhances safety, achieving improvements of up to 45.5%p while preserving core reasoning utility.

*Chen Zhang,Kepu Zhang,Jiatong Zhang,Xiao Zhang,Jun Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SandwichR introduces an Answer-Reasoning-Answer paradigm with consistency-aware RL to enable low-latency query correction while maintaining reasoning-aware accuracy comparable to Chain-of-Thought.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Query correction requires high accuracy under real-time latency constraints. Chain-of-Thought reasoning improves accuracy but has prohibitive latency, while early answer approaches can't leverage reasoning to improve accuracy.

Method: SandwichR uses Answer-Reasoning-Answer paradigm with consistency-aware RL: dedicated consistency reward aligns initial and final corrections, and margin-based rejection sampling prioritizes borderline samples where reasoning has most impact.

Result: Achieves SOTA accuracy comparable to standard CoT while delivering 40-70% latency reduction, resolving the latency-accuracy trade-off in online search.

Conclusion: SandwichR enables low-latency query correction without sacrificing reasoning-aware accuracy by aligning fast initial answers with post-hoc reasoning through consistency-aware reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Query correction is a critical entry point in modern search pipelines, demanding high accuracy strictly within real-time latency constraints. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves accuracy but incurs prohibitive latency for real-time query correction. A potential solution is to output an answer before reasoning to reduce latency; however, under autoregressive decoding, the early answer is independent of subsequent reasoning, preventing the model from leveraging its reasoning capability to improve accuracy. To address this issue, we propose Sandwich Reasoning (SandwichR), a novel approach that explicitly aligns a fast initial answer with post-hoc reasoning, enabling low-latency query correction without sacrificing reasoning-aware accuracy. SandwichR follows an Answer-Reasoning-Answer paradigm, producing an initial correction, an explicit reasoning process, and a final refined correction. To align the initial answer with post-reasoning insights, we design a consistency-aware reinforcement learning (RL) strategy: a dedicated consistency reward enforces alignment between the initial and final corrections, while margin-based rejection sampling prioritizes borderline samples where reasoning drives the most impactful corrective gains. Additionally, we construct a high-quality query correction dataset, addressing the lack of specialized benchmarks for complex query correction. Experimental results demonstrate that SandwichR achieves SOTA accuracy comparable to standard CoT while delivering a 40-70% latency reduction, resolving the latency-accuracy trade-off in online search.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Using LLM-generated domain-specific heuristics with GBFS search dramatically scales up automated medication planning from 7 to 28+ medications, making it more clinically practical.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous automated medication planning using general domain-independent heuristics was limited to only 7 medications, which is insufficient for real clinical applications where patients often require more complex medication regimens.

Method: Programmatically specify the domain (initial state and successor generation), then use LLMs to generate problem-specific heuristics that work with a fixed GBFS (Greedy Best-First Search) algorithm instead of relying on general domain-independent heuristics.

Result: Dramatic improvements in coverage and planning time, scaling up the number of medications from 7 to at least 28, significantly advancing the practical applicability of automated medication planning.

Conclusion: LLM-generated domain-specific heuristics combined with general search algorithms can effectively scale up automated medication planning to clinically relevant levels, bringing the technology closer to practical clinical applications.

Abstract: Personalized medication planning involves selecting medications and determining a dosing schedule to achieve medical goals specific to each individual patient. Previous work successfully demonstrated that automated planners, using general domain-independent heuristics, are able to generate personalized treatments, when the domain and problems are modeled using a general domain description language (\pddlp). Unfortunately, this process was limited in practice to consider no more than seven medications. In clinical terms, this is a non-starter. In this paper, we explore the use of automatically-generated domain- and problem-specific heuristics to be used with general search, as a method of scaling up medication planning to levels allowing closer work with clinicians. Specifically, we specify the domain programmatically (specifying an initial state and a successor generation procedure), and use an LLM to generate a problem specific heuristic that can be used by a fixed search algorithm (GBFS). The results indicate dramatic improvements in coverage and planning time, scaling up the number of medications to at least 28, and bringing medication planning one step closer to practical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuning datasets for Chain-of-Thought reasoning often contain deceptive samples where correct final answers are derived from hallucinated, redundant, or logically invalid intermediate steps, which undermines the quality of supervision.

Method: 1) Entropy-based mechanism to segment reasoning traces at uncertain junctures; 2) Monte Carlo rollout-based mechanism to evaluate the marginal contribution of each step; 3) Filtering deceptive reasoning samples to construct high-quality dataset.

Result: Fine-tuning on EntroCoT-constructed subsets consistently outperforms full-dataset supervision baselines across mathematical benchmarks.

Conclusion: EntroCoT effectively addresses the "answer right but reasoning wrong" problem in CoT supervision, enabling creation of higher-quality training data that improves mathematical reasoning performance.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly enhanced the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models. We find existing fine-tuning datasets frequently suffer from the "answer right but reasoning wrong" probelm, where correct final answers are derived from hallucinated, redundant, or logically invalid intermediate steps. This paper proposes EntroCoT, a unified framework for automatically identifying and refining low-quality CoT supervision traces. EntroCoT first proposes an entropy-based mechanism to segment the reasoning trace into multiple steps at uncertain junctures, and then introduces a Monte Carlo rollout-based mechanism to evaluate the marginal contribution of each step. By accurately filtering deceptive reasoning samples, EntroCoT constructs a high-quality dataset where every intermediate step in each reasoning trace facilitates the final answer. Extensive experiments on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning on the subset constructed by EntroCoT consistently outperforms the baseslines of full-dataset supervision.

TL;DR: ROI-Reasoning enables LLMs to strategically allocate computation under token budgets by predicting task difficulty and optimizing resource allocation through meta-cognitive fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack inherent understanding of how much computation different tasks require, leading to inefficient resource usage under strict token constraints. The paper addresses the need for budgeted inference-time reasoning where models must strategically allocate limited computational resources across multiple tasks.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Meta-Cognitive Fine-Tuning teaches models to predict reasoning cost and expected utility before generation, enabling solve-or-skip decisions. 2) Rationality-Aware Reinforcement Learning optimizes sequential decision making under hard token budgets for long-horizon allocation strategies.

Result: ROI-Reasoning consistently improves overall score while substantially reducing regret under tight computation budgets across budgeted mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed ROI-Reasoning framework successfully endows LLMs with intrinsic, budget-aware rationality by formalizing the problem as OS-MCKP and implementing a two-stage approach that enables strategic computation allocation under token constraints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can achieve strong reasoning performance with sufficient computation, but they do not inherently know how much computation a task requires. We study budgeted inference-time reasoning for multiple tasks under a strict global token constraint and formalize it as a Ordered Stochastic Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem(OS-MCKP). This perspective highlights a meta-cognitive requirement -- anticipating task difficulty, estimating return over investment (ROI), and allocating computation strategically. We propose ROI-Reasoning, a two-stage framework that endows LLMs with intrinsic, budget-aware rationality. In the first stage, Meta-Cognitive Fine-Tuning teaches models to predict reasoning cost and expected utility before generation, enabling explicit solve-or-skip decisions. Next, Rationality-Aware Reinforcement Learning optimizes sequential decision making under a hard token budget, allowing models to learn long-horizon allocation strategies. Across budgeted mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ROI-Reasoning consistently improves overall score while substantially reducing regret under tight computation budgets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rational Closure (RC) is a key algorithm in KLM framework for defeasible reasoning, but existing implementations are imperative; ASP offers declarative approach with potential efficiency gains.

Method: Declarative ASP encoding for computing minimal ranked models from knowledge bases, with formal correctness proofs for RC computation and entailment checking.

Result: ASP implementation correctly computes RC, outperforms InfOCF solver in computational efficiency while maintaining theoretical correctness.

Conclusion: ASP provides effective declarative approach for RC computation with improved performance over imperative implementations, demonstrating practical viability for defeasible reasoning.

Abstract: Defeasible entailment is concerned with drawing plausible conclusions from incomplete information. A foundational framework for modelling defeasible entailment is the KLM framework. Introduced by Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor, the KLM framework outlines several key properties for defeasible entailment. One of the most prominent algorithms within this framework is Rational Closure (RC). This paper presents a declarative definition for computing RC using Answer Set Programming (ASP). Our approach enables the automatic construction of the minimal ranked model from a given knowledge base and supports entailment checking for specified queries. We formally prove the correctness of our ASP encoding and conduct empirical evaluations to compare the performance of our implementation with that of existing imperative implementations, specifically the InfOCF solver. The results demonstrate that our ASP-based approach adheres to RC's theoretical foundations and offers improved computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support legal experts during criminal trials by providing reasoning capabilities and possible legal outcomes, while also making judicial decision-making more interpretable through automated explainability.

Method: Analyzing and encoding Italian Criminal Code articles (including crimes against the person and property offenses) in Answer Set Programming (ASP), validating on previous verdicts, handling contradictions, and using inductive logic programming for ASP to generalize legal rules from case examples.

Result: Developed a tool that generates possible decisions for new cases, provides explanations through stable model "supportedness," and can automatically clarify the logic behind judicial decisions to improve interpretability.

Conclusion: ASP-based modeling of legal codes combined with inductive learning from judicial decisions creates a powerful tool for legal reasoning support that enhances both decision-making assistance and interpretability of legal processes.

Abstract: We propose an approach to model articles of the Italian Criminal Code (ICC), using Answer Set Programming (ASP), and to semi-automatically learn legal rules from examples based on prior judicial decisions. The developed tool is intended to support legal experts during the criminal trial phase by providing reasoning and possible legal outcomes. The methodology involves analyzing and encoding articles of the ICC in ASP, including "crimes against the person" and property offenses. The resulting model is validated on a set of previous verdicts and refined as necessary. During the encoding process, contradictions may arise; these are properly handled by the system, which also generates possible decisions for new cases and provides explanations through a tool that leverages the "supportedness" of stable models. The automatic explainability offered by the tool can also be used to clarify the logic behind judicial decisions, making the decision-making process more interpretable. Furthermore, the tool integrates an inductive logic programming system for ASP, which is employed to generalize legal rules from case examples.

Conclusion: ASP-based approach provides a flexible framework for generating multiple explanation types for decision tree models, addressing interpretability needs in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Decision tree models, including random forests and gradient-boosted decision trees, are widely used in machine learning due to their high predictive performance.  However, their complex structures often make them difficult to interpret, especially in safety-critical applications where model decisions require formal justification.  Recent work has demonstrated that logical and abductive explanations can be derived through automated reasoning techniques.  In this paper, we propose a method for generating various types of explanations, namely, sufficient, contrastive, majority, and tree-specific explanations, using Answer Set Programming (ASP).  Compared to SAT-based approaches, our ASP-based method offers greater flexibility in encoding user preferences and supports enumeration of all possible explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing xAI methods like SHAP, rule extraction, and counterfactuals focus on input-output relationships but neglect the internal network structure in explanation generation. There's a need for global explanations that capture the network's architecture.

Method: Proposes xDNN(ASP) system that extracts logic programs under answer set semantics from neural networks and training data. The extracted program ideally represents the trained model with one-to-one correspondence between answer sets and input-output pairs.

Result: Experimental evaluation on synthetic datasets shows the extracted logic program maintains high prediction accuracy while providing valuable model understanding: feature importance, impact of hidden nodes on predictions, and guidance for network optimization by reducing hidden nodes.

Conclusion: xDNN(ASP) successfully generates global explanations that capture both input-output relationships and network structure, offering interpretable logic programs that maintain model accuracy while providing insights for network optimization.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) has gained significant attention in recent years. Among other things, explainablility for deep neural networks has been a topic of intensive research due to the meteoric rise in prominence of deep neural networks and their "black-box" nature. xAI approaches can be characterized along different dimensions such as their scope (global versus local explanations) or underlying methodologies (statistic-based versus rule-based strategies). Methods generating global explanations aim to provide reasoning process applicable to all possible output classes while local explanation methods focus only on a single, specific class. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a well-known statistical technique, identifies important features of a network. Deep neural network rule extraction method constructs IF-THEN rules that link input conditions to a class. Another approach focuses on generating counterfactuals which help explain how small changes to an input can affect the model's predictions. However, these techniques primarily focus on the input-output relationship and thus neglect the structure of the network in explanation generation.   In this work, we propose xDNN(ASP), an explanation generation system for deep neural networks that provides global explanations. Given a neural network model and its training data, xDNN(ASP) extracts a logic program under answer set semantics that-in the ideal case-represents the trained model, i.e., answer sets of the extracted program correspond one-to-one to input-output pairs of the network. We demonstrate experimentally, using two synthetic datasets, that not only the extracted logic program maintains a high-level of accuracy in the prediction task, but it also provides valuable information for the understanding of the model such as the importance of features as well as the impact of hidden nodes on the prediction. The latter can be used as a guide for reducing the number of nodes used in hidden layers, i.e., providing a means for optimizing the network.

*Veronika Semmelrock,Gerhard Friedrich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASP faces scaling challenges for large configuration problems with 30k+ components; incremental solving helps but memory limits remain; constraint-aware guessing reduces memory needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether current ASP solving techniques can scale for large configuration problems, specifically electronic systems with over 30,000 components, and to address the grounding bottleneck where memory demands increase sharply with problem size.

Method: Investigated incremental solving approach and developed constraint-aware guessing method based on grounding analysis to reduce memory requirements.

Result: Incremental solving proved effective but still faced significant memory limits; constraint-aware guessing significantly reduced memory needs for large configuration problems.

Conclusion: While ASP has realized the AI vision in many domains, scaling for large configuration problems requires addressing memory limitations through techniques like constraint-aware guessing, which shows promise for pushing the limits of current ASP technology.

Abstract: Answer set programming (ASP) aims to realize the AI vision: The user specifies the problem, and the computer solves it. Indeed, ASP has made this vision true in many application domains. However, will current ASP solving techniques scale up for large configuration problems? As a benchmark for such problems, we investigated the configuration of electronic systems, which may comprise more than 30,000 components. We show the potential and limits of current ASP technology, focusing on methods that address the so-called grounding bottleneck, i.e., the sharp increase of memory demands in the size of the problem instances. To push the limits, we investigated the incremental solving approach, which proved effective in practice. However, even in the incremental approach, memory demands impose significant limits. Based on an analysis of grounding, we developed the method constraint-aware guessing, which significantly reduced the memory need.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Current AI agents struggle to effectively use generative world models for future simulation, often misusing or ignoring them, leading to degraded performance rather than enhanced cognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As agents face more tasks requiring long-term reasoning and anticipation of future states, generative world models could serve as external simulators to enhance agent cognition, but it's unclear whether current agents can effectively leverage them.

Method: Empirical examination across diverse agentic and visual question answering tasks, analyzing how agents interact with world models, including invocation frequency, misuse of predicted rollouts, and performance impact when simulation is available or enforced.

Result: Agents rarely invoke simulation (<1%), frequently misuse predicted rollouts (~15%), and often show inconsistent or degraded performance (up to 5%) when simulation is available. The main bottleneck is agents' inability to decide when to simulate, interpret outcomes, and integrate foresight into reasoning.

Conclusion: Current agents lack the capacity to strategically interact with world models, highlighting the need for mechanisms that foster calibrated, strategic use of simulation for reliable anticipatory cognition in future agent systems.

Abstract: Agents built on vision-language models increasingly face tasks that demand anticipating future states rather than relying on short-horizon reasoning. Generative world models offer a promising remedy: agents could use them as external simulators to foresee outcomes before acting. This paper empirically examines whether current agents can leverage such world models as tools to enhance their cognition. Across diverse agentic and visual question answering tasks, we observe that some agents rarely invoke simulation (fewer than 1%), frequently misuse predicted rollouts (approximately 15%), and often exhibit inconsistent or even degraded performance (up to 5%) when simulation is available or enforced. Attribution analysis further indicates that the primary bottleneck lies in the agents' capacity to decide when to simulate, how to interpret predicted outcomes, and how to integrate foresight into downstream reasoning. These findings underscore the need for mechanisms that foster calibrated, strategic interaction with world models, paving the way toward more reliable anticipatory cognition in future agent systems.

TL;DR: Trade-R1: RL framework for financial decision-making that addresses noisy market rewards via process-level reasoning verification using triangular consistency metrics and semantic rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL works well in domains with verifiable rewards (math, coding) but fails in financial markets where rewards are verifiable but noisy, leading to reward hacking. Need to bridge verifiable rewards to stochastic financial environments.

Method: Proposes Trade-R1 framework with key innovation: verification method transforming evaluation of reasoning over financial documents into structured RAG task. Uses triangular consistency metric assessing alignment between retrieved evidence, reasoning chains, and decisions as validity filter for noisy market returns. Implements two reward strategies: Fixed-effect Semantic Reward (FSR) for stable alignment, and Dynamic-effect Semantic Reward (DSR) for coupled magnitude optimization.

Result: Experiments on different country asset selection show paradigm reduces reward hacking, with DSR achieving superior cross-market generalization while maintaining highest reasoning consistency.

Conclusion: Trade-R1 successfully bridges verifiable rewards to stochastic financial environments through process-level reasoning verification, addressing the reward hacking problem in financial RL applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve remarkable reasoning in domains like mathematics and coding, where verifiable rewards provide clear signals. However, extending this paradigm to financial decision is challenged by the market's stochastic nature: rewards are verifiable but inherently noisy, causing standard RL to degenerate into reward hacking. To address this, we propose Trade-R1, a model training framework that bridges verifiable rewards to stochastic environments via process-level reasoning verification. Our key innovation is a verification method that transforms the problem of evaluating reasoning over lengthy financial documents into a structured Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) task. We construct a triangular consistency metric, assessing pairwise alignment between retrieved evidence, reasoning chains, and decisions to serve as a validity filter for noisy market returns. We explore two reward integration strategies: Fixed-effect Semantic Reward (FSR) for stable alignment signals, and Dynamic-effect Semantic Reward (DSR) for coupled magnitude optimization. Experiments on different country asset selection demonstrate that our paradigm reduces reward hacking, with DSR achieving superior cross-market generalization while maintaining the highest reasoning consistency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DOT method reduces unnecessary reasoning tokens by 78% while improving accuracy through dynamic truncation of redundant tokens during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning models with RL enhancement generate excessive verbosity on simple queries, incurring high deployment costs. Existing methods using length penalties create optimization conflicts and don't address the underlying generative mechanisms causing overthinking.

Method: Dynamic Outlier Truncation (DOT) - training-time intervention that selectively suppresses redundant tokens by targeting only extreme tail of response lengths within fully correct rollout groups. Combined with auxiliary KL regularization and predictive dynamic sampling for stable convergence.

Result: Significantly pushes efficiency-performance Pareto frontier outward. On AIME-24, reduces inference token usage by 78% while simultaneously increasing accuracy compared to initial policy and surpassing state-of-the-art efficient reasoning methods.

Conclusion: DOT effectively addresses the length shift phenomenon where models generate unnecessary reasoning on trivial inputs, achieving substantial efficiency gains while maintaining or improving performance on complex problems.

Abstract: Large reasoning models enhanced by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards have achieved significant performance gains by extending their chain-of-thought. However, this paradigm incurs substantial deployment costs as models often exhibit excessive verbosity on simple queries. Existing efficient reasoning methods relying on explicit length penalties often introduce optimization conflicts and leave the generative mechanisms driving overthinking largely unexamined. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon termed length shift where models increasingly generate unnecessary reasoning on trivial inputs during training. To address this, we introduce Dynamic Outlier Truncation (DOT), a training-time intervention that selectively suppresses redundant tokens. This method targets only the extreme tail of response lengths within fully correct rollout groups while preserving long-horizon reasoning capabilities for complex problems. To complement this intervention and ensure stable convergence, we further incorporate auxiliary KL regularization and predictive dynamic sampling. Experimental results across multiple model scales demonstrate that our approach significantly pushes the efficiency-performance Pareto frontier outward. Notably, on the AIME-24, our method reduces inference token usage by 78% while simultaneously increasing accuracy compared to the initial policy and surpassing state-of-the-art efficient reasoning methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing mobile GUI agents are reactive, making decisions only from current screens, which limits their performance on long-horizon tasks. Building a world model from interactions enables forecasting action outcomes and supports better decision making.

Method: Proposes MobileDreamer with two key components: 1) Textual sketch world model that forecasts post-action states by transforming digital images into key task-related sketches using order-invariant learning to preserve spatial information, and 2) Rollout imagination strategy that optimizes action-selection by leveraging world model predictions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Android World, improving task success by 5.25%. World model evaluations verify that textual sketch modeling accurately forecasts key GUI elements.

Conclusion: MobileDreamer successfully addresses the challenge of building efficient world models for mobile GUI agents, enabling better long-horizon task performance through future imagination and spatial-aware state prediction.

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents have shown strong potential in real-world automation and practical applications. However, most existing agents remain reactive, making decisions mainly from current screen, which limits their performance on long-horizon tasks. Building a world model from repeated interactions enables forecasting action outcomes and supports better decision making for mobile GUI agents. This is challenging because the model must predict post-action states with spatial awareness while remaining efficient enough for practical deployment. In this paper, we propose MobileDreamer, an efficient world-model-based lookahead framework to equip the GUI agents based on the future imagination provided by the world model. It consists of textual sketch world model and rollout imagination for GUI agent. Textual sketch world model forecasts post-action states through a learning process to transform digital images into key task-related sketches, and designs a novel order-invariant learning strategy to preserve the spatial information of GUI elements. The rollout imagination strategy for GUI agent optimizes the action-selection process by leveraging the prediction capability of world model. Experiments on Android World show that MobileDreamer achieves state-of-the-art performance and improves task success by 5.25%. World model evaluations further verify that our textual sketch modeling accurately forecasts key GUI elements.

Abstract: AI-generated content has progressed from monolithic models to modular workflows, especially on platforms like ComfyUI, allowing users to customize complex creative pipelines. However, the large number of components in ComfyUI and the difficulty of maintaining long-horizon structural consistency under strict graph constraints frequently lead to low pass rates and workflows of limited quality.

TL;DR: This paper introduces "agent drift" in multi-agent LLM systems - the progressive degradation of agent behavior over time - and proposes a framework to measure and mitigate it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent LLM systems are powerful for complex tasks but their long-term behavioral stability is unexamined, creating reliability risks for enterprise deployment.

Method: Developed theoretical framework for agent drift with three manifestations, created Agent Stability Index (ASI) with 12 dimensions to quantify drift, and proposed three mitigation strategies through simulation and theoretical modeling.

Result: Unchecked agent drift leads to reduced task completion accuracy and increased human intervention; proposed mitigation strategies can significantly reduce drift-related errors while maintaining system throughput.

Conclusion: Establishes foundational methodology for monitoring, measuring, and mitigating agent drift in production agentic AI systems, with implications for enterprise reliability and AI safety.

Abstract: Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems have emerged as powerful architectures for complex task decomposition and collaborative problem-solving. However, their long-term behavioral stability remains largely unexamined. This study introduces the concept of agent drift, defined as the progressive degradation of agent behavior, decision quality, and inter-agent coherence over extended interaction sequences. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding drift phenomena, proposing three distinct manifestations: semantic drift (progressive deviation from original intent), coordination drift (breakdown in multi-agent consensus mechanisms), and behavioral drift (emergence of unintended strategies).
  We introduce the Agent Stability Index (ASI), a novel composite metric framework for quantifying drift across twelve dimensions, including response consistency, tool usage patterns, reasoning pathway stability, and inter-agent agreement rates. Through simulation-based analysis and theoretical modeling, we demonstrate how unchecked agent drift can lead to substantial reductions in task completion accuracy and increased human intervention requirements.
  We propose three mitigation strategies: episodic memory consolidation, drift-aware routing protocols, and adaptive behavioral anchoring. Theoretical analysis suggests these approaches can significantly reduce drift-related errors while maintaining system throughput. This work establishes a foundational methodology for monitoring, measuring, and mitigating agent drift in production agentic AI systems, with direct implications for enterprise deployment reliability and AI safety research.

### [106] [Revisiting Continuous-Time Trajectory Estimation via Gaussian Processes and the Magnus Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03360)
*Timothy Barfoot,Cedric Le Gentil,Sven Lilge*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Continuous-time state estimation using Gaussian processes on Lie groups with LTV SDE kernels via Magnus expansion, offering more elegant solution than patchwork local GPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing continuous-time trajectory estimation on Lie groups uses patchwork of local GPs with linear time-invariant SDE kernels, which works in practice but lacks theoretical elegance and generality.

Method: Revisits full linear time-varying (LTV) Gaussian process approach using Magnus expansion to derive global GP prior on Lie groups, providing more elegant mathematical formulation.

Result: Presents numerical comparison between patchwork local GP approach and new global LTV GP approach using Magnus expansion, discussing their relative merits.

Conclusion: The Magnus expansion-based LTV GP approach offers a more elegant and general solution for continuous-time trajectory estimation on Lie groups compared to previous patchwork methods.

Abstract: Continuous-time state estimation has been shown to be an effective means of (i) handling asynchronous and high-rate measurements, (ii) introducing smoothness to the estimate, (iii) post hoc querying the estimate at times other than those of the measurements, and (iv) addressing certain observability issues related to scanning-while-moving sensors. A popular means of representing the trajectory in continuous time is via a Gaussian process (GP) prior, with the prior's mean and covariance functions generated by a linear time-varying (LTV) stochastic differential equation (SDE) driven by white noise. When the state comprises elements of Lie groups, previous works have resorted to a patchwork of local GPs each with a linear time-invariant SDE kernel, which while effective in practice, lacks theoretical elegance. Here we revisit the full LTV GP approach to continuous-time trajectory estimation, deriving a global GP prior on Lie groups via the Magnus expansion, which offers a more elegant and general solution. We provide a numerical comparison between the two approaches and discuss their relative merits.

TL;DR: Lidar Teach and Repeat enables autonomous cargo transport on lunar surfaces by learning safe paths and repeating them with precision for cargo pickup/delivery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Future lunar operations require automated vehicles to transport cargo between locations while navigating precisely in safe regions, avoiding hazards, and parking within small tolerances for successful cargo handling.

Method: Lidar Teach and Repeat system where a one-tonne rover is driven semi-autonomously to create a network of safe paths, then repeats the entire network autonomously while carrying cargo. Tested in a two-week deployment at CSA's Analogue Terrain.

Result: The system demonstrated successful cargo collection and delivery in harsh environmental conditions with closed-loop performance accurate enough to align the vehicle to cargo for pickup.

Conclusion: Lidar Teach and Repeat provides an ideal autonomy solution for lunar cargo transport, enabling precise navigation and cargo handling in challenging lunar-like environments.

Abstract: In future operations on the lunar surface, automated vehicles will be required to transport cargo between known locations. Such vehicles must be able to navigate precisely in safe regions to avoid natural hazards, human-constructed infrastructure, and dangerous dark shadows. Rovers must be able to park their cargo autonomously within a small tolerance to achieve a successful pickup and delivery. In this field test, Lidar Teach and Repeat provides an ideal autonomy solution for transporting cargo in this way. A one-tonne path-to-flight rover was driven in a semi-autonomous remote-control mode to create a network of safe paths. Once the route was taught, the rover immediately repeated the entire network of paths autonomously while carrying cargo. The closed-loop performance is accurate enough to align the vehicle to the cargo and pick it up. This field report describes a two-week deployment at the Canadian Space Agency's Analogue Terrain, culminating in a simulated lunar operation to evaluate the system's capabilities. Successful cargo collection and delivery were demonstrated in harsh environmental conditions.

Motivation: Address the Zero-Knowledge Task Planning (ZKTP) problem - planning actions to achieve goals without task-specific knowledge, which is challenging for traditional planning systems

Method: Uses LLM to decompose natural language instructions into subtasks and generate behavior trees (BTs) for execution, with refinement loop where LLM adjusts BTs when errors occur during execution

Result: Experimental validation in AI2-THOR simulator shows improved task performance compared to alternative approaches using task-specific knowledge

Conclusion: LLMs show potential for addressing ZKTP problem, providing robust framework for automated behavior generation without task-specific setup

Abstract: In this work, we introduce and formalize the Zero-Knowledge Task Planning (ZKTP) problem, i.e., formulating a sequence of actions to achieve some goal without task-specific knowledge. Additionally, we present a first investigation and approach for ZKTP that leverages a large language model (LLM) to decompose natural language instructions into subtasks and generate behavior trees (BTs) for execution. If errors arise during task execution, the approach also uses an LLM to adjust the BTs on-the-fly in a refinement loop. Experimental validation in the AI2-THOR simulator demonstrate our approach's effectiveness in improving overall task performance compared to alternative approaches that leverage task-specific knowledge. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLMs to effectively address several aspects of the ZKTP problem, providing a robust framework for automated behavior generation with no task-specific setup.

Motivation: Wildfire monitoring requires autonomous systems that can handle extreme visual degradation, rapidly changing fire dynamics, and limited real-world training data. Existing UAV approaches use simplified simulators and lack embodied agents in realistic fire environments.

Method: Created GIS-to-simulation pipeline for wildfire digital twins using USGS DEM terrain, LANDFIRE fuel data, and semi-physical fire-spread solvers. Trained PPO agent with dual-view UAV sensing guided by CLIP-style VLM, using wildfire-specific semantic alignment scores from single prompt as reward shaping signals.

Result: VLM-guided policy reduces time-to-detection by up to 6 times, increases time-in-FOV across five digital-twin evaluation tasks. First RL-based UAV wildfire monitoring system demonstrated in kilometer-scale, physics-grounded digital-twin fires.

Conclusion: FIRE-VLM successfully integrates VLM guidance with RL in high-fidelity wildfire digital twins, enabling effective UAV firefront tracking with significant performance improvements over existing approaches.

Abstract: Wildfire monitoring demands autonomous systems capable of reasoning under extreme visual degradation, rapidly evolving physical dynamics, and scarce real-world training data. Existing UAV navigation approaches rely on simplified simulators and supervised perception pipelines, and lack embodied agents interacting with physically realistic fire environments. We introduce FIRE-VLM, the first end-to-end vision-language model (VLM) guided reinforcement learning (RL) framework trained entirely within a high-fidelity, physics-grounded wildfire digital twin. Built from USGS Digital Elevation Model (DEM) terrain, LANDFIRE fuel inventories, and semi-physical fire-spread solvers, this twin captures terrain-induced runs, wind-driven acceleration, smoke plume occlusion, and dynamic fuel consumption. Within this environment, a PPO agent with dual-view UAV sensing is guided by a CLIP-style VLM. Wildfire-specific semantic alignment scores, derived from a single prompt describing active fire and smoke plumes, are integrated as potential-based reward shaping signals. Our contributions are: (1) a GIS-to-simulation pipeline for constructing wildfire digital twins; (2) a VLM-guided RL agent for UAV firefront tracking; and (3) a wildfire-aware reward design that combines physical terms with VLM semantics. Across five digital-twin evaluation tasks, our VLM-guided policy reduces time-to-detection by up to 6 times, increases time-in-FOV, and is, to our knowledge, the first RL-based UAV wildfire monitoring system demonstrated in kilometer-scale, physics-grounded digital-twin fires.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional off-road trajectory planning approaches have limited adaptability in dynamic environments and suffer from insufficient spatial perception and unstable reasoning in visual-language-action models.

Method: Proposes OFF-EMMA with two key components: 1) Visual prompt block using semantic segmentation masks as visual prompts to enhance spatial understanding, and 2) Chain-of-thought with self-consistency (COT-SC) reasoning strategy using multi-path reasoning to mitigate outlier errors.

Result: On RELLIS-3D off-road dataset, OFF-EMMA reduces average L2 error of Qwen backbone model by 13.3% and decreases failure rate from 16.52% to 6.56%, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: OFF-EMMA effectively addresses spatial perception and reasoning limitations in off-road autonomous driving through visual prompting and enhanced reasoning strategies, demonstrating superior trajectory planning performance.

Abstract: Efficient trajectory planning in off-road terrains presents a formidable challenge for autonomous vehicles, often necessitating complex multi-step pipelines. However, traditional approaches exhibit limited adaptability in dynamic environments. To address these limitations, this paper proposes OFF-EMMA, a novel end-to-end multimodal framework designed to overcome the deficiencies of insufficient spatial perception and unstable reasoning in visual-language-action (VLA) models for off-road autonomous driving scenarios. The framework explicitly annotates input images through the design of a visual prompt block and introduces a chain-of-thought with self-consistency (COT-SC) reasoning strategy to enhance the accuracy and robustness of trajectory planning. The visual prompt block utilizes semantic segmentation masks as visual prompts, enhancing the spatial understanding ability of pre-trained visual-language models for complex terrains. The COT- SC strategy effectively mitigates the error impact of outliers on planning performance through a multi-path reasoning mechanism. Experimental results on the RELLIS-3D off-road dataset demonstrate that OFF-EMMA significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing the average L2 error of the Qwen backbone model by 13.3% and decreasing the failure rate from 16.52% to 6.56%.

Motivation: Existing robotic cellists rely on expensive motion capture and fail to sightread music naturally. Need for precise bow control without motion capture and human-like musical expression.

Method: Novel end-to-end pipeline converting MIDI scores directly to collision-aware bowing motions using UR5e robot with Universal Robot Freedrive feature. Records live joint data via RTDE and introduces Musical Turing Test with 132 participants for evaluation.

Result: Released labeled robotic playing data from five standard pieces and human reference recordings. Established first benchmark for robotic cello performance through Musical Turing Test evaluation.

Conclusion: Proposed pipeline enables human-like robotic cello performance without motion capture. Introduced evaluation benchmark and outlined residual reinforcement learning for future improvements in string-crossing efficiency and sound quality.

Abstract: Robot musicians require precise control to obtain proper note accuracy, sound quality, and musical expression. Performance of string instruments, such as violin and cello, presents a significant challenge due to the precise control required over bow angle and pressure to produce the desired sound. While prior robotic cellists focus on accurate bowing trajectories, these works often rely on expensive motion capture techniques, and fail to sightread music in a human-like way.
  We propose a novel end-to-end MIDI score to robotic motion pipeline which converts musical input directly into collision-aware bowing motions for a UR5e robot cellist. Through use of Universal Robot Freedrive feature, our robotic musician can achieve human-like sound without the need for motion capture. Additionally, this work records live joint data via Real-Time Data Exchange (RTDE) as the robot plays, providing labeled robotic playing data from a collection of five standard pieces to the research community. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in comparison to human performers, we introduce the Musical Turing Test, in which a collection of 132 human participants evaluate our robot's performance against a human baseline. Human reference recordings are also released, enabling direct comparison for future studies. This evaluation technique establishes the first benchmark for robotic cello performance. Finally, we outline a residual reinforcement learning methodology to improve upon baseline robotic controls, highlighting future opportunities for improved string-crossing efficiency and sound quality.

Motivation: Natural bipeds use hands, knees, and elbows for stability in complex environments, but most humanoid locomotion methods focus only on leg-based gaits. There's a need for systems that can handle extremely challenging terrains like low-clearance spaces, walls, platforms, and steep stairs.

Method: Combines physics-grounded keyframe animation with reinforcement learning in a hierarchical framework. Keyframes encode human knowledge of motor skills, while RL transforms them into robust motions.

Result: Real-world experiments show robust whole-body locomotion that generalizes across obstacle sizes, instances, and terrain sequences, enabling navigation through challenging environments like under chairs, over walls, and on steep stairs.

Conclusion: The Locomotion Beyond Feet system successfully enables humanoid robots to use whole-body locomotion for navigating extremely challenging terrains, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining human knowledge (via keyframes) with reinforcement learning in a hierarchical framework.

Abstract: Most locomotion methods for humanoid robots focus on leg-based gaits, yet natural bipeds frequently rely on hands, knees, and elbows to establish additional contacts for stability and support in complex environments. This paper introduces Locomotion Beyond Feet, a comprehensive system for whole-body humanoid locomotion across extremely challenging terrains, including low-clearance spaces under chairs, knee-high walls, knee-high platforms, and steep ascending and descending stairs. Our approach addresses two key challenges: contact-rich motion planning and generalization across diverse terrains. To this end, we combine physics-grounded keyframe animation with reinforcement learning. Keyframes encode human knowledge of motor skills, are embodiment-specific, and can be readily validated in simulation or on hardware, while reinforcement learning transforms these references into robust, physically accurate motions. We further employ a hierarchical framework consisting of terrain-specific motion-tracking policies, failure recovery mechanisms, and a vision-based skill planner. Real-world experiments demonstrate that Locomotion Beyond Feet achieves robust whole-body locomotion and generalizes across obstacle sizes, obstacle instances, and terrain sequences.

*Lina Zhu,Jiyu Cheng,Yuehu Liu,Wei Zhang*

TL;DR: DA-HGNN uses dual-attention heterogeneous graph neural network with reinforcement learning to balance exploration and coverage in multi-robot area search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-robot area search methods use homogeneous graphs that fail to properly model and balance the distinct objectives of exploring unknown areas and covering specific rescue targets.

Method: Proposes Dual-Attention Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (DA-HGNN) trained with deep reinforcement learning. Constructs heterogeneous graph with robot nodes, frontier nodes, and interesting nodes. Uses dual-attention mechanism: relational-aware attention for spatio-temporal relationships, and type-aware attention to separately compute relevance between robots and each goal type (frontiers vs points of interest).

Result: Extensive experiments in iGibson simulator using Gibson and MatterPort3D datasets show superior scalability and generalization capability compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: DA-HGNN effectively decouples exploration and coverage tasks in multi-robot collaborative area search through heterogeneous graph representation and dual-attention mechanism, achieving better performance than homogeneous graph approaches.

Abstract: In multi-robot collaborative area search, a key challenge is to dynamically balance the two objectives of exploring unknown areas and covering specific targets to be rescued. Existing methods are often constrained by homogeneous graph representations, thus failing to model and balance these distinct tasks. To address this problem, we propose a Dual-Attention Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (DA-HGNN) trained using deep reinforcement learning. Our method constructs a heterogeneous graph that incorporates three entity types: robot nodes, frontier nodes, and interesting nodes, as well as their historical states. The dual-attention mechanism comprises the relational-aware attention and type-aware attention operations. The relational-aware attention captures the complex spatio-temporal relationships among robots and candidate goals. Building on this relational-aware heterogeneous graph, the type-aware attention separately computes the relevance between robots and each goal type (frontiers vs. points of interest), thereby decoupling the exploration and coverage from the unified tasks. Extensive experiments conducted in interactive 3D scenarios within the iGibson simulator, leveraging the Gibson and MatterPort3D datasets, validate the superior scalability and generalization capability of the proposed approach.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PointWorld is a large pre-trained 3D world model that forecasts 3D point flows in response to robot actions, enabling manipulation tasks without demonstrations or post-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots need human-like ability to anticipate 3D world responses to actions from visual input, but current approaches lack unified modeling across different robot embodiments and require extensive task-specific training.

Method: Represent actions as 3D point flows in shared 3D space, train on large-scale dataset (2M trajectories, 500 hours) of real and simulated manipulation, use RGB-D images and low-level action commands as input to forecast per-pixel 3D displacements.

Result: Single pre-trained model enables real-world Franka robot to perform diverse manipulation tasks (pushing, deformable/articulated object manipulation, tool use) from single in-the-wild image without demonstrations or post-training, with real-time inference (0.1s).

Conclusion: PointWorld demonstrates effective 3D world modeling through unified point flow representation, enabling generalizable robotic manipulation across embodiments and tasks with minimal adaptation requirements.

Abstract: Humans anticipate, from a glance and a contemplated action of their bodies, how the 3D world will respond, a capability that is equally vital for robotic manipulation. We introduce PointWorld, a large pre-trained 3D world model that unifies state and action in a shared 3D space as 3D point flows: given one or few RGB-D images and a sequence of low-level robot action commands, PointWorld forecasts per-pixel displacements in 3D that respond to the given actions. By representing actions as 3D point flows instead of embodiment-specific action spaces (e.g., joint positions), this formulation directly conditions on physical geometries of robots while seamlessly integrating learning across embodiments. To train our 3D world model, we curate a large-scale dataset spanning real and simulated robotic manipulation in open-world environments, enabled by recent advances in 3D vision and simulated environments, totaling about 2M trajectories and 500 hours across a single-arm Franka and a bimanual humanoid. Through rigorous, large-scale empirical studies of backbones, action representations, learning objectives, partial observability, data mixtures, domain transfers, and scaling, we distill design principles for large-scale 3D world modeling. With a real-time (0.1s) inference speed, PointWorld can be efficiently integrated in the model-predictive control (MPC) framework for manipulation. We demonstrate that a single pre-trained checkpoint enables a real-world Franka robot to perform rigid-body pushing, deformable and articulated object manipulation, and tool use, without requiring any demonstrations or post-training and all from a single image captured in-the-wild.

*K. Ege de Bruin,Kyrre Glette,Kai Olav Ellefsen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Combining generational replacement with intra-life learning in evolutionary robotics maintains diversity while preserving performance, with performance metrics (function evaluations vs. generations) affecting conclusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Co-optimization of robot morphology and control is challenging due to controller adaptation time and lack of diversity in evolving populations, which can prematurely narrow search to few designs.

Method: Combine generational replacement (full population replacement) with intra-life learning (additional controller optimization loop) in evolutionary robotics framework.

Result: The combination increases population diversity while retaining performance, and performance evaluation differs when measured by function evaluations versus evolution generations.

Conclusion: Integrating generational replacement with intra-life learning effectively balances diversity and performance in evolutionary robotics, with careful metric selection crucial for accurate assessment.

Abstract: Evolutionary Robotics offers the possibility to design robots to solve a specific task automatically by optimizing their morphology and control together. However, this co-optimization of body and control is challenging, because controllers need some time to adapt to the evolving morphology - which may make it difficult for new and promising designs to enter the evolving population. A solution to this is to add intra-life learning, defined as an additional controller optimization loop, to each individual in the evolving population. A related problem is the lack of diversity often seen in evolving populations as evolution narrows the search down to a few promising designs too quickly. This problem can be mitigated by implementing full generational replacement, where offspring robots replace the whole population. This solution for increasing diversity usually comes at the cost of lower performance compared to using elitism. In this work, we show that combining such generational replacement with intra-life learning can increase diversity while retaining performance. We also highlight the importance of performance metrics when studying learning in morphologically evolving robots, showing that evaluating according to function evaluations versus according to generations of evolution can give different conclusions.

### [117] [Integrating Sample Inheritance into Bayesian Optimization for Evolutionary Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03813)
*K. Ege de Bruin,Kyrre Glette,Kai Olav Ellefsen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Using Bayesian optimization with sample inheritance (Lamarckian inheritance) improves evolutionary robotics by compensating for low controller learning budgets through accumulated adaptations across generations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In evolutionary robotics, optimizing both robot morphology and control together creates a body-brain optimization problem. Traditional approaches require starting controller optimization from scratch for each new morphology, which demands high learning budgets. The paper aims to address this inefficiency by leveraging inheritance mechanisms to reduce the controller learning budget needed for each morphology.

Method: The researchers use Bayesian optimization for controller optimization due to its sample efficiency and exploration capabilities. They implement sample inheritance as a form of Lamarckian inheritance under deliberately low controller learning budgets. Two inheritance approaches are tested: (1) transferring all parent samples to offspring as prior without evaluation, and (2) reevaluating parent's best samples on offspring. These are compared against a baseline without inheritance.

Result: Reevaluation inheritance performs best, with prior-based inheritance also outperforming no inheritance. Analysis shows that while the learning budget is too low for single morphologies, generational inheritance compensates by accumulating learned adaptations across generations. Inheritance mainly benefits offspring morphologies similar to their parents. More challenging environments produce more stable walking gaits.

Conclusion: Inheritance mechanisms can significantly boost performance in evolutionary robotics without requiring large learning budgets, offering an efficient path toward more capable robot design by leveraging accumulated knowledge across generations.

Abstract: In evolutionary robotics, robot morphologies are designed automatically using evolutionary algorithms. This creates a body-brain optimization problem, where both morphology and control must be optimized together. A common approach is to include controller optimization for each morphology, but starting from scratch for every new body may require a high controller learning budget. We address this by using Bayesian optimization for controller optimization, exploiting its sample efficiency and strong exploration capabilities, and using sample inheritance as a form of Lamarckian inheritance. Under a deliberately low controller learning budget for each morphology, we investigate two types of sample inheritance: (1) transferring all the parent's samples to the offspring to be used as prior without evaluating them, and (2) reevaluating the parent's best samples on the offspring. Both are compared to a baseline without inheritance. Our results show that reevaluation performs best, with prior-based inheritance also outperforming no inheritance. Analysis reveals that while the learning budget is too low for a single morphology, generational inheritance compensates for this by accumulating learned adaptations across generations. Furthermore, inheritance mainly benefits offspring morphologies that are similar to their parents. Finally, we demonstrate the critical role of the environment, with more challenging environments resulting in more stable walking gaits. Our findings highlight that inheritance mechanisms can boost performance in evolutionary robotics without needing large learning budgets, offering an efficient path toward more capable robot design.

TL;DR: Lightweight sampling-based trajectory planner deployed on automotive-grade embedded RTOS hardware for fail-operational autonomous driving safety, demonstrating deterministic timing with bounded latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety layers like Online Verification only detect infeasible planning outputs but lack active mechanisms to ensure safe operation when the main planner fails, creating a need for active safety extensions for fail-operational autonomous driving.

Method: Deploy a lightweight sampling-based trajectory planner on automotive-grade embedded platform running Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) that continuously computes trajectories under constrained computational resources.

Result: Experimental results show deterministic timing behavior with bounded latency and minimal jitter, validating feasibility of trajectory planning on safety-certifiable hardware.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates potential for integrating active fallback mechanisms into next-generation safeguarding frameworks while highlighting remaining challenges for fail-operational autonomous driving safety.

Abstract: Ensuring the functional safety of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) requires motion planning modules that not only operate within strict real-time constraints but also maintain controllability in case of system faults. Existing safeguarding concepts, such as Online Verification (OV), provide safety layers that detect infeasible planning outputs. However, they lack an active mechanism to ensure safe operation in the event that the main planner fails. This paper presents a first step toward an active safety extension for fail-operational Autonomous Driving (AD). We deploy a lightweight sampling-based trajectory planner on an automotive-grade, embedded platform running a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). The planner continuously computes trajectories under constrained computational resources, forming the foundation for future emergency planning architectures. Experimental results demonstrate deterministic timing behavior with bounded latency and minimal jitter, validating the feasibility of trajectory planning on safety-certifiable hardware. The study highlights both the potential and the remaining challenges of integrating active fallback mechanisms as an integral part of next-generation safeguarding frameworks.

TL;DR: Neuromorphic tactile sensing system using DVS cameras and flexible optical waveguide skin for press localization with low latency and sparse event tolerance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop wide-area flexible tactile sensors for soft robotics and interactive environments that avoid repetitive scanning and enable responsive sensing.

Method: Stereo DVS cameras observe flexible silicone optical waveguide skin; DBSCAN clustering on brightness change events enables triangulation-based press localization.

Result: 4.66 mm RMSE localization accuracy over 4620 mm² area; maintains functionality with extreme event reduction (9.33 mm error at 1/1024 data); 31 ms latency.

Conclusion: Event-driven tactile sensing approach is promising for low-power, responsive large-area skin applications, remaining functional even with sparse event data.

Abstract: This paper presents a neuromorphic, event-driven tactile sensing system for soft, large-area skin, based on the Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) integrated with a flexible silicone optical waveguide skin. Instead of repetitively scanning embedded photoreceivers, this design uses a stereo vision setup comprising two DVS cameras looking sideways through the skin. Such a design produces events as changes in brightness are detected, and estimates press positions on the 2D skin surface through triangulation, utilizing Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to find the center of mass of contact events resulting from pressing actions. The system is evaluated over a 4620 mm2 probed area of the skin using a meander raster scan. Across 95 % of the presses visible to both cameras, the press localization achieved a Root-Mean-Squared Error (RMSE) of 4.66 mm. The results highlight the potential of this approach for wide-area flexible and responsive tactile sensors in soft robotics and interactive environments. Moreover, we examined how the system performs when the amount of event data is strongly reduced. Using stochastic down-sampling, the event stream was reduced to 1/1024 of its original size. Under this extreme reduction, the average localization error increased only slightly (from 4.66 mm to 9.33 mm), and the system still produced valid press localizations for 85 % of the trials. This reduction in pass rate is expected, as some presses no longer produce enough events to form a reliable cluster for triangulation. These results show that the sensing approach remains functional even with very sparse event data, which is promising for reducing power consumption and computational load in future implementations. The system exhibits a detection latency distribution with a characteristic width of 31 ms.

TL;DR: CoINS is a hierarchical framework that integrates skill-aware VLM reasoning with low-level execution for interactive navigation, enabling robots to actively modify cluttered environments rather than just avoid obstacles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM-based navigators are limited to passive obstacle avoidance and lack understanding of robot physical capabilities, preventing them from reasoning about when and how to interact with objects to clear blocked paths in cluttered environments.

Method: Proposes CoINS framework with: 1) InterNav-VLM fine-tuned with skill affordance and constraint parameters for counterfactual reasoning about object removal effects, 2) Reinforcement learning-based skill library for diverse object manipulation, 3) Systematic Isaac Sim benchmark for evaluation.

Result: CoINS significantly outperforms baselines with 17% higher overall success rate and over 80% improvement in complex long-horizon scenarios, demonstrating effective interactive navigation capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed CoINS framework successfully bridges the gap between semantic reasoning and physical execution in interactive navigation, enabling robots to actively modify environments for path clearance through integrated skill-aware VLM reasoning and robust low-level execution.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in robotic planning. However, they typically function as semantic reasoners, lacking an intrinsic understanding of the specific robot's physical capabilities. This limitation is particularly critical in interactive navigation, where robots must actively modify cluttered environments to create traversable paths. Existing VLM-based navigators are predominantly confined to passive obstacle avoidance, failing to reason about when and how to interact with objects to clear blocked paths. To bridge this gap, we propose Counterfactual Interactive Navigation via Skill-aware VLM (CoINS), a hierarchical framework that integrates skill-aware reasoning and robust low-level execution. Specifically, we fine-tune a VLM, named InterNav-VLM, which incorporates skill affordance and concrete constraint parameters into the input context and grounds them into a metric-scale environmental representation. By internalizing the logic of counterfactual reasoning through fine-tuning on the proposed InterNav dataset, the model learns to implicitly evaluate the causal effects of object removal on navigation connectivity, thereby determining interaction necessity and target selection. To execute the generated high-level plans, we develop a comprehensive skill library through reinforcement learning, specifically introducing traversability-oriented strategies to manipulate diverse objects for path clearance. A systematic benchmark in Isaac Sim is proposed to evaluate both the reasoning and execution aspects of interactive navigation. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that CoINS significantly outperforms representative baselines, achieving a 17\% higher overall success rate and over 80\% improvement in complex long-horizon scenarios compared to the best-performing baseline

TL;DR: RSS framework addresses VLA model brittleness to linguistic perturbations by disentangling physical affordance from semantic execution via Monte Carlo syntactic integration and residual affordance steering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models are brittle to linguistic perturbations due to "modality collapse" where strong visual priors overwhelm sparse linguistic signals, causing agents to overfit to specific instruction phrasings while ignoring semantic intent.

Method: Proposes Residual Semantic Steering (RSS) with two innovations: 1) Monte Carlo Syntactic Integration approximates true semantic posterior via dense LLM-driven distributional expansion, and 2) Residual Affordance Steering uses dual-stream decoding to isolate causal influence of language by subtracting visual affordance prior.

Result: RSS achieves state-of-the-art robustness across diverse manipulation benchmarks, maintaining performance even under adversarial linguistic perturbations.

Conclusion: RSS effectively addresses modality collapse in VLA models by maximizing mutual information between action and intent while suppressing visual distractors, leading to improved linguistic robustness.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generalized robotic control; however, they remain notoriously brittle to linguistic perturbations. We identify a critical ``modality collapse'' phenomenon where strong visual priors overwhelm sparse linguistic signals, causing agents to overfit to specific instruction phrasings while ignoring the underlying semantic intent. To address this, we propose \textbf{Residual Semantic Steering (RSS)}, a probabilistic framework that disentangles physical affordance from semantic execution. RSS introduces two theoretical innovations: (1) \textbf{Monte Carlo Syntactic Integration}, which approximates the true semantic posterior via dense, LLM-driven distributional expansion, and (2) \textbf{Residual Affordance Steering}, a dual-stream decoding mechanism that explicitly isolates the causal influence of language by subtracting the visual affordance prior. Theoretical analysis suggests that RSS effectively maximizes the mutual information between action and intent while suppressing visual distractors. Empirical results across diverse manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that RSS achieves state-of-the-art robustness, maintaining performance even under adversarial linguistic perturbations.

Motivation: Current vision-language-action models suffer from limited robotic data and visual entanglement in existing latent action models, which capture noise instead of manipulation skills from abundant human video demonstrations.

Method: Proposes Contrastive Latent Action Pretraining (CLAP) that aligns visual latent space from videos with proprioceptive latent space from robot trajectories using contrastive learning, mapping video transitions to quantized executable codebook. Includes dual VLA framework: CLAP-NTP (autoregressive model) and CLAP-RF (Rectified Flow-based policy), plus Knowledge Matching regularization to prevent catastrophic forgetting.

Result: Extensive experiments show CLAP significantly outperforms strong baselines, enabling effective transfer of skills from human videos to robotic execution.

Conclusion: CLAP successfully addresses visual entanglement and data scarcity issues by aligning video and proprioceptive representations, providing an effective framework for transferring manipulation skills from human demonstrations to robots.

Abstract: Generalist Vision-Language-Action models are currently hindered by the scarcity of robotic data compared to the abundance of human video demonstrations. Existing Latent Action Models attempt to leverage video data but often suffer from visual entanglement, capturing noise rather than manipulation skills. To address this, we propose Contrastive Latent Action Pretraining (CLAP), a framework that aligns the visual latent space from videos with a proprioceptive latent space from robot trajectories. By employing contrastive learning, CLAP maps video transitions onto a quantized, physically executable codebook. Building on this representation, we introduce a dual-formulation VLA framework offering both CLAP-NTP, an autoregressive model excelling at instruction following and object generalization, and CLAP-RF, a Rectified Flow-based policy designed for high-frequency, precise manipulation. Furthermore, we propose a Knowledge Matching (KM) regularization strategy to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLAP significantly outperforms strong baselines, enabling the effective transfer of skills from human videos to robotic execution.

TL;DR: The paper introduces WoW-World-Eval benchmark to assess video foundation models as world models for embodied AI, revealing significant gaps in spatiotemporal consistency, physical reasoning, and real-world execution accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video foundation models are increasingly used as predictive world models for embodied tasks, but two critical questions remain unanswered: (1) whether their generative generalization maintains perceptual fidelity for human observers, and (2) whether they are robust enough to serve as universal priors for real-world embodied agents.

Method: Introduces the Embodied Turing Test benchmark WoW-World-Eval, built upon 609 robot manipulation data. Examines five core abilities (perception, planning, prediction, generalization, execution) with 22 metrics. Uses Inverse Dynamic Model (IDM) to evaluate execution accuracy in real-world scenarios.

Result: Models achieve only 17.27 on long-horizon planning and at best 68.02 on physical consistency, indicating limited spatiotemporal consistency and physical reasoning. For Inverse Dynamic Model Turing Test, most models collapse to ≈0% success rate, while WoW maintains 40.74% success rate.

Conclusion: There's a noticeable gap between generated videos and the real world, highlighting the urgency and necessity of benchmarking World Models in Embodied AI. The benchmark establishes reliable foundation for Human Turing Test with high correlation (>0.93) between overall score and human preference.

Abstract: As world models gain momentum in Embodied AI, an increasing number of works explore using video foundation models as predictive world models for downstream embodied tasks like 3D prediction or interactive generation. However, before exploring these downstream tasks, video foundation models still have two critical questions unanswered: (1) whether their generative generalization is sufficient to maintain perceptual fidelity in the eyes of human observers, and (2) whether they are robust enough to serve as a universal prior for real-world embodied agents. To provide a standardized framework for answering these questions, we introduce the Embodied Turing Test benchmark: WoW-World-Eval (Wow,wo,val). Building upon 609 robot manipulation data, Wow-wo-val examines five core abilities, including perception, planning, prediction, generalization, and execution. We propose a comprehensive evaluation protocol with 22 metrics to assess the models' generation ability, which achieves a high Pearson Correlation between the overall score and human preference (>0.93) and establishes a reliable foundation for the Human Turing Test. On Wow-wo-val, models achieve only 17.27 on long-horizon planning and at best 68.02 on physical consistency, indicating limited spatiotemporal consistency and physical reasoning. For the Inverse Dynamic Model Turing Test, we first use an IDM to evaluate the video foundation models' execution accuracy in the real world. However, most models collapse to $\approx$ 0% success, while WoW maintains a 40.74% success rate. These findings point to a noticeable gap between the generated videos and the real world, highlighting the urgency and necessity of benchmarking World Model in Embodied AI.

Abstract: Many embedded devices operate under resource constraints and in dynamic environments, requiring local decision-making capabilities. Enabling devices to make independent decisions in such environments can improve the responsiveness of the system and reduce the dependence on constant external control. In this work, we integrate an autonomous agent, programmed using AgentSpeak, with a small two-wheeled robot that explores a maze using its own decision-making and sensor data. Experimental results show that the agent successfully solved the maze in 59 seconds using 287 reasoning cycles, with decision phases taking less than one millisecond. These results indicate that the reasoning process is efficient enough for real-time execution on resource-constrained hardware. This integration demonstrates how high-level agent-based control can be applied to resource-constrained embedded systems for autonomous operation.
