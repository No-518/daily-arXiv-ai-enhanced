Recently, Large Language Models\n(LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in path planning but still suffer from\nspatial illusion and poor planning performance. Among all the works, LLM-A*\n\\cite{meng2024llm} leverages LLM to generate a series of waypoints and then\nuses A* to plan the paths between the neighboring waypoints. In this way, the\ncomplete path is constructed. However, LLM-A* still suffers from high\ncomputational time for large-scale maps. To fill this gap, we conducted a deep\ninvestigation into LLM-A* and found its bottleneck, resulting in limited\nperformance. Accordingly, we design an innovative LLM-enhanced algorithm, abbr.\nas iLLM-A*. iLLM-A* includes 3 carefully designed mechanisms, including the\noptimization of A*, an incremental learning method for LLM to generate\nhigh-quality waypoints, and the selection of the appropriate waypoints for A*\nfor path planning. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation on various grid maps\nshows that, compared with LLM-A*, iLLM-A* \\textbf{1) achieves more than\n$1000\\times$ speedup on average, and up to $2349.5\\times$ speedup in the\nextreme case, 2) saves up to $58.6\\%$ of the memory cost, 3) achieves both\nobviously shorter path length and lower path length standard deviation.}", "AI": {"tldr": "iLLM-A* is an improved version of LLM-A* that addresses computational bottlenecks in large-scale grid map path planning by optimizing A* algorithm, implementing incremental learning for LLM waypoint generation, and selecting appropriate waypoints, achieving over 1000\u00d7 speedup and significant memory savings.", "motivation": "Existing path planning methods like A* and Dijkstra struggle with large-scale maps due to high computational time and memory consumption.
