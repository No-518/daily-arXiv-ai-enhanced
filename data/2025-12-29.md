Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a data-driven framework using VLMs to extract audiovisual features, cluster them into interpretable factors, and train a regression model to predict engagement on short-form edutainment videos, outperforming traditional metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video evaluation frameworks focus on visual/semantic fidelity but fail to capture how specific audiovisual attributes drive real audience engagement, especially for short-form content.

Method: Uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to extract unsupervised audiovisual features, clusters them into interpretable factors, and trains a regression-based evaluator on a curated YouTube Shorts dataset to predict engagement.

Result: Strong correlations between predicted and actual engagement, demonstrating that the lightweight feature-based evaluator provides interpretable and scalable assessments compared to traditional metrics like SSIM and FID.

Conclusion: The approach advances robust and explainable video understanding by grounding evaluation in both multimodal feature importance and human-centered engagement signals.

Abstract: Evaluating short-form video content requires moving beyond surface-level quality metrics toward human-aligned, multimodal reasoning. While existing frameworks like VideoScore-2 assess visual and semantic fidelity, they do not capture how specific audiovisual attributes drive real audience engagement. In this work, we propose a data-driven evaluation framework that uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to extract unsupervised audiovisual features, clusters them into interpretable factors, and trains a regression-based evaluator to predict engagement on short-form edutainment videos. Our curated YouTube Shorts dataset enables systematic analysis of how VLM-derived features relate to human engagement behavior. Experiments show strong correlations between predicted and actual engagement, demonstrating that our lightweight, feature-based evaluator provides interpretable and scalable assessments compared to traditional metrics (e.g., SSIM, FID). By grounding evaluation in both multimodal feature importance and human-centered engagement signals, our approach advances toward robust and explainable video understanding.

### [2] [A Tool Bottleneck Framework for Clinically-Informed and Interpretable Medical Image Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21414)
*Christina Liu,Alan Q. Wang,Joy Hsu,Jiajun Wu,Ehsan Adeli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Tool Bottleneck Framework (TBF) improves medical image understanding by using a learned neural network (TBM) to compose specialized tools selected by VLMs, outperforming text-based composition methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tool-use frameworks rely on text-based composition (via code or natural language) which performs poorly for medical images where spatially-localized features are difficult to compose via text alone.

Method: TBF uses an off-the-shelf medical VLM to select clinically-relevant tools, then composes them via a learned Tool Bottleneck Model (TBM) - a neural network that fuses tool outputs instead of using text-based composition.

Result: TBF performs on par with or better than deep learning classifiers, VLMs, and state-of-the-art tool-use frameworks on histopathology and dermatology tasks, with particular gains in data-limited regimes.

Conclusion: The framework improves medical image understanding, yields more interpretable clinically-grounded predictors, and enables effective tool composition beyond text-based methods.

Abstract: Recent tool-use frameworks powered by vision-language models (VLMs) improve image understanding by grounding model predictions with specialized tools. Broadly, these frameworks leverage VLMs and a pre-specified toolbox to decompose the prediction task into multiple tool calls (often deep learning models) which are composed to make a prediction. The dominant approach to composing tools is using text, via function calls embedded in VLM-generated code or natural language. However, these methods often perform poorly on medical image understanding, where salient information is encoded as spatially-localized features that are difficult to compose or fuse via text alone. To address this, we propose a tool-use framework for medical image understanding called the Tool Bottleneck Framework (TBF), which composes VLM-selected tools using a learned Tool Bottleneck Model (TBM). For a given image and task, TBF leverages an off-the-shelf medical VLM to select tools from a toolbox that each extract clinically-relevant features. Instead of text-based composition, these tools are composed by the TBM, which computes and fuses the tool outputs using a neural network before outputting the final prediction. We propose a simple and effective strategy for TBMs to make predictions with any arbitrary VLM tool selection. Overall, our framework not only improves tool-use in medical imaging contexts, but also yields more interpretable, clinically-grounded predictors. We evaluate TBF on tasks in histopathology and dermatology and find that these advantages enable our framework to perform on par with or better than deep learning-based classifiers, VLMs, and state-of-the-art tool-use frameworks, with particular gains in data-limited regimes.

### [3] [Scalable Deep Subspace Clustering Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21434)
*Nairouz Mrabah,Mohamed Bouguessa,Sihem Sami*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDSNet is a scalable deep subspace clustering method that reduces complexity from O(n³) to O(n) using landmark approximation, avoiding full affinity matrices while maintaining clustering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subspace clustering methods suffer from O(n³) computational complexity due to constructing full n×n affinity matrices and spectral decomposition, creating scalability limits. Deep learning approaches improve features but maintain the pairwise similarity bottleneck.

Method: SDSNet uses: (1) landmark-based approximation to avoid full affinity matrices, (2) joint optimization of auto-encoder reconstruction with self-expression objectives, and (3) direct spectral clustering on factorized representations. Combines convolutional auto-encoders with subspace-preserving constraints.

Result: Experimental results show SDSNet achieves comparable clustering quality to state-of-the-art methods with significantly improved computational efficiency, achieving O(n) complexity instead of O(n³).

Conclusion: SDSNet provides a scalable deep subspace clustering framework that breaks the O(n³) computational bottleneck through landmark approximation and joint optimization, enabling efficient clustering at scale while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Subspace clustering methods face inherent scalability limits due to the $O(n^3)$ cost (with $n$ denoting the number of data samples) of constructing full $n\times n$ affinities and performing spectral decomposition. While deep learning-based approaches improve feature extraction, they maintain this computational bottleneck through exhaustive pairwise similarity computations. We propose SDSNet (Scalable Deep Subspace Network), a deep subspace clustering framework that achieves $\mathcal{O}(n)$ complexity through (1) landmark-based approximation, avoiding full affinity matrices, (2) joint optimization of auto-encoder reconstruction with self-expression objectives, and (3) direct spectral clustering on factorized representations. The framework combines convolutional auto-encoders with subspace-preserving constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that SDSNet achieves comparable clustering quality to state-of-the-art methods with significantly improved computational efficiency.

*Haotian Lv,Yuhui Zhang,Jiangbo Dai,Hanli Wu,Jiaji Wang,Dawei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel deep learning framework (MCGA-Net) using DCGAN data augmentation and multi-modal attention mechanisms achieves state-of-the-art automated detection of subsurface road defects from GPR images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional GPR image interpretation for subsurface road defect detection relies heavily on subjective expert analysis, leading to inefficiencies and inaccuracies. There's a need for automated, objective, and accurate detection methods.

Method: Three-part framework: (1) DCGAN-based data augmentation to synthesize high-fidelity GPR images, (2) MCGA-Net architecture with Multi-modal Chain Feature Fusion (MCFF) for hierarchical multi-scale defect representation and Global Attention Mechanism (GAM) for context-aware feature enhancement, (3) MS COCO transfer learning for backbone network fine-tuning.

Result: MCGA-Net achieves Precision: 92.8%, Recall: 92.5%, and mAP@50: 95.9%. The model maintains robustness against Gaussian noise, weak signals, and small targets, outperforming other comparative models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework establishes a new paradigm for automated GPR-based defect detection, balancing computational efficiency with high accuracy in complex subsurface environments, addressing data scarcity and subjective interpretation limitations.

Abstract: Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) has emerged as a pivotal tool for non-destructive evaluation of subsurface road defects. However, conventional GPR image interpretation remains heavily reliant on subjective expertise, introducing inefficiencies and inaccuracies. This study introduces a comprehensive framework to address these limitations: (1) A DCGAN-based data augmentation strategy synthesizes high-fidelity GPR images to mitigate data scarcity while preserving defect morphology under complex backgrounds; (2) A novel Multi-modal Chain and Global Attention Network (MCGA-Net) is proposed, integrating Multi-modal Chain Feature Fusion (MCFF) for hierarchical multi-scale defect representation and Global Attention Mechanism (GAM) for context-aware feature enhancement; (3) MS COCO transfer learning fine-tunes the backbone network, accelerating convergence and improving generalization. Ablation and comparison experiments validate the framework's efficacy. MCGA-Net achieves Precision (92.8%), Recall (92.5%), and mAP@50 (95.9%). In the detection of Gaussian noise, weak signals and small targets, MCGA-Net maintains robustness and outperforms other models. This work establishes a new paradigm for automated GPR-based defect detection, balancing computational efficiency with high accuracy in complex subsurface environments.

### [5] [CCAD: Compressed Global Feature Conditioned Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21459)
*Xiao Jin,Liang Diao,Qixin Xiao,Yifan Hu,Ziqi Zhang,Yuchen Liu,Haisong Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CCAD combines reconstruction-based and unsupervised representation methods for anomaly detection by using compressed global features as reconstruction conditions, achieving better AUC and faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current anomaly detection methods have limitations: unsupervised representation methods struggle with domain shifts, while reconstruction-based methods suffer from low training efficiency and performance degradation due to insufficient constraints.

Method: CCAD synergizes both paradigms by adapting global features as a new modality condition for reconstruction models, with an adaptive compression mechanism to enhance generalization and training efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments show CCAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in AUC while achieving faster convergence. Also contributed a reorganized/re-annotated DAGM 2007 dataset.

Conclusion: CCAD effectively addresses limitations of existing anomaly detection methods by combining reconstruction and representation approaches, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Anomaly detection holds considerable industrial significance, especially in scenarios with limited anomalous data. Currently, reconstruction-based and unsupervised representation-based approaches are the primary focus. However, unsupervised representation-based methods struggle to extract robust features under domain shift, whereas reconstruction-based methods often suffer from low training efficiency and performance degradation due to insufficient constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method named Compressed Global Feature Conditioned Anomaly Detection (CCAD). CCAD synergizes the strengths of both paradigms by adapting global features as a new modality condition for the reconstruction model. Furthermore, we design an adaptive compression mechanism to enhance both generalization and training efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CCAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of AUC while achieving faster convergence. In addition, we contribute a reorganized and re-annotated version of the DAGM 2007 dataset with new annotations to further validate our method's effectiveness. The code for reproducing main results is available at https://github.com/chloeqxq/CCAD.

*Kumar Abhishek,Jeremy Kawahara,Ghassan Hamarneh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ISIC MultiAnnot++ is the largest publicly available multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation dataset with 17,684 masks across 14,967 dermoscopic images, including annotator metadata for segmentation preference modeling research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are currently no large-scale publicly available multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation datasets for dermoscopic imaging, which is crucial for observing morphological structures not visible in regular clinical photos and advancing segmentation research.

Method: Created ISIC MultiAnnot++ by collecting and curating segmentation masks from the ISIC Archive, including 2,394 images with 2-5 segmentations per image, and annotating metadata about annotator skill level and segmentation tools.

Result: Produced the largest publicly available SLS dataset with 17,684 segmentation masks spanning 14,967 dermoscopic images, with curated data partitions, consensus segmentation masks, and comprehensive annotator metadata.

Conclusion: ISIC MultiAnnot++ enables important research on multi-annotator segmentation, annotator-specific preference modeling, and metadata analysis for dermoscopic skin lesion imaging, addressing a critical gap in publicly available medical imaging datasets.

Abstract: Multi-annotator medical image segmentation is an important research problem, but requires annotated datasets that are expensive to collect. Dermoscopic skin lesion imaging allows human experts and AI systems to observe morphological structures otherwise not discernable from regular clinical photographs. However, currently there are no large-scale publicly available multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation (SLS) datasets with annotator-labels for dermoscopic skin lesion imaging. We introduce ISIC MultiAnnot++, a large public multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation dataset for images from the ISIC Archive. The final dataset contains 17,684 segmentation masks spanning 14,967 dermoscopic images, where 2,394 dermoscopic images have 2-5 segmentations per image, making it the largest publicly available SLS dataset. Further, metadata about the segmentation, including the annotators' skill level and segmentation tool, is included, enabling research on topics such as annotator-specific preference modeling for segmentation and annotator metadata analysis. We provide an analysis on the characteristics of this dataset, curated data partitions, and consensus segmentation masks.

### [7] [GPF-Net: Gated Progressive Fusion Learning for Polyp Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21476)
*Suncheng Xiang,Xiaoyang Wang,Junjie Jiang,Hejia Wang,Dahong Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Gated Progressive Fusion network for colonoscopic polyp re-identification, using multi-level feature fusion with gating mechanisms to improve matching accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Colonoscopic polyp re-identification is crucial for colorectal cancer prevention, but current methods using coarse high-level features perform poorly on small polyps where detailed information matters.

Method: Gated Progressive Fusion network that selectively fuses features from multiple levels using gates in a fully connected way, with layer-wise refinement through multi-level feature interactions.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art unimodal ReID models on standard benchmarks, especially when combined with specialized multimodal fusion strategy.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture effectively addresses the limitations of coarse high-level features for small polyp re-identification through selective multi-level feature fusion.

Abstract: Colonoscopic Polyp Re-Identification aims to match the same polyp from a large gallery with images from different views taken using different cameras, which plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer in computer-aided diagnosis. However, the coarse resolution of high-level features of a specific polyp often leads to inferior results for small objects where detailed information is important. To address this challenge, we propose a novel architecture, named Gated Progressive Fusion network, to selectively fuse features from multiple levels using gates in a fully connected way for polyp ReID. On the basis of it, a gated progressive fusion strategy is introduced to achieve layer-wise refinement of semantic information through multi-level feature interactions. Experiments on standard benchmarks show the benefits of the multimodal setting over state-of-the-art unimodal ReID models, especially when combined with the specialized multimodal fusion strategy.

### [8] [Generative Multi-Focus Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21495)
*Xinzhe Xie,Buyu Guo,Bolin Li,Shuangyan He,Yanzhen Gu,Qingyan Jiang,Peiliang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMFF is a two-stage generative multi-focus image fusion framework that first uses deterministic fusion with StackMFF V4, then employs generative restoration with IFControlNet to reconstruct missing content and eliminate artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fusion algorithms assume at least one input image has each spatial location in focus, and suffer from edge artifacts in complex real-world scenarios due to uncertain focus estimation or hard-selection operations.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Deterministic fusion using StackMFF V4 with focal plane information to produce initial fused image; 2) Generative restoration using IFControlNet (latent diffusion model) to reconstruct missing focal plane content, restore fine details, and eliminate edge artifacts.

Result: Extensive experiments show GMFF achieves state-of-the-art fusion performance and exhibits significant potential for practical applications, especially in scenarios with complex multi-focal content.

Conclusion: GMFF effectively addresses limitations of existing fusion methods by combining deterministic fusion with generative restoration, achieving superior performance for complex multi-focus scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion aims to generate an all-in-focus image from a sequence of partially focused input images. Existing fusion algorithms generally assume that, for every spatial location in the scene, there is at least one input image in which that location is in focus. Furthermore, current fusion models often suffer from edge artifacts caused by uncertain focus estimation or hard-selection operations in complex real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a generative multi-focus image fusion framework, termed GMFF, which operates in two sequential stages. In the first stage, deterministic fusion is implemented using StackMFF V4, the latest version of the StackMFF series, and integrates the available focal plane information to produce an initial fused image. The second stage, generative restoration, is realized through IFControlNet, which leverages the generative capabilities of latent diffusion models to reconstruct content from missing focal planes, restore fine details, and eliminate edge artifacts. Each stage is independently developed and functions seamlessly in a cascaded manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMFF achieves state-of-the-art fusion performance and exhibits significant potential for practical applications, particularly in scenarios involving complex multi-focal content. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/Xinzhe99/StackMFF-Series.

### [9] [SVBench: Evaluation of Video Generation Models on Social Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21507)
*Wenshuo Peng,Gongxuan Wang,Tianmeng Yang,Chuanhao Li,Xiaojie Xu,Hui He,Kaipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Researchers introduce the first benchmark for evaluating social reasoning in video generation models, revealing that while current models excel in visual realism, they fail at understanding social cognition like intention recognition and belief reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video generation models produce visually realistic videos but lack social coherence - they can't infer intentions, beliefs, emotions, or social norms from visual cues like humans do. There's no systematic way to evaluate this social reasoning gap.

Method: Created a benchmark with 30 classic social cognition paradigms organized into 7 dimensions. Developed a training-free agent-based pipeline that distills reasoning mechanisms, synthesizes video scenarios, enforces conceptual neutrality through critique, and evaluates videos using a VLM judge across 5 social reasoning dimensions.

Result: Large-scale study across 7 state-of-the-art video generation systems shows substantial performance gaps: models excel in surface-level plausibility but systematically fail in intention recognition, belief reasoning, joint attention, and prosocial inference.

Conclusion: Current video generation models have significant limitations in social reasoning capabilities despite their visual realism, highlighting the need for models that can understand and generate socially coherent behavior.

Abstract: Recent text-to-video generation models exhibit remarkable progress in visual realism, motion fidelity, and text-video alignment, yet they remain fundamentally limited in their ability to generate socially coherent behavior. Unlike humans, who effortlessly infer intentions, beliefs, emotions, and social norms from brief visual cues, current models tend to render literal scenes without capturing the underlying causal or psychological logic. To systematically evaluate this gap, we introduce the first benchmark for social reasoning in video generation. Grounded in findings from developmental and social psychology, our benchmark organizes thirty classic social cognition paradigms into seven core dimensions, including mental-state inference, goal-directed action, joint attention, social coordination, prosocial behavior, social norms, and multi-agent strategy. To operationalize these paradigms, we develop a fully training-free agent-based pipeline that (i) distills the reasoning mechanism of each experiment, (ii) synthesizes diverse video-ready scenarios, (iii) enforces conceptual neutrality and difficulty control through cue-based critique, and (iv) evaluates generated videos using a high-capacity VLM judge across five interpretable dimensions of social reasoning. Using this framework, we conduct the first large-scale study across seven state-of-the-art video generation systems. Our results reveal substantial performance gaps: while modern models excel in surface-level plausibility, they systematically fail in intention recognition, belief reasoning, joint attention, and prosocial inference.

### [10] [Fixed-Budget Parameter-Efficient Training with Frozen Encoders Improves Multimodal Chest X-Ray Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21508)
*Md Ashik Khan,Md Nahid Siddique*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Parameter-efficient training methods (frozen encoders, BitFit, LoRA, adapters) achieve better chest X-ray classification performance than full fine-tuning with 40x fewer parameters, though they have calibration issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal chest X-Ray analysis typically requires computationally expensive fine-tuning of large vision-language models. The study aims to explore parameter-efficient training strategies to reduce computational costs while maintaining performance.

Method: Evaluated PET strategies including frozen encoders, BitFit, LoRA, and adapters for multi-label classification on Indiana University Chest X-Ray dataset (3,851 image-report pairs). Used redacted pathology terms to prevent data leakage. Conducted budget-matched comparisons and external validation on CheXpert dataset.

Result: All PET variants achieved AUROC 0.892-0.908 with only 2.37M parameters (2.51% of total), outperforming full fine-tuning (0.770 AUROC with 94.3M parameters). External validation confirmed scalability. However, PET methods showed degraded calibration (ECE: 0.29-0.34) compared to simpler models (ECE: 0.049).

Conclusion: Frozen encoder strategies provide superior discrimination at substantially reduced computational cost, but calibration correction is essential for clinical deployment. Improvements come primarily from parameter allocation rather than cross-modal synergy.

Abstract: Multimodal chest X-Ray analysis often fine-tunes large vision-language models, which is computationally costly. We study parameter-efficient training (PET) strategies, including frozen encoders, BitFit, LoRA, and adapters for multi-label classification on the Indiana University Chest X-Ray dataset (3,851 image-report pairs; 579 test samples). To mitigate data leakage, we redact pathology terms from reports used as text inputs while retaining clinical context. Under a fixed parameter budget (2.37M parameters, 2.51% of total), all PET variants achieve AUROC between 0.892 and 0.908, outperforming full fine-tuning (0.770 AUROC), which uses 94.3M trainable parameters, a 40x reduction. External validation on CheXpert (224,316 images, 58x larger) confirms scalability: all PET methods achieve >0.69 AUROC with <9% trainable parameters, with Adapter achieving best performance (0.7214 AUROC). Budget-matched comparisons reveal that vision-only models (0.653 AUROC, 1.06M parameters) outperform budget-matched multimodal models (0.641 AUROC, 1.06M parameters), indicating improvements arise primarily from parameter allocation rather than cross-modal synergy. While PET methods show degraded calibration (ECE: 0.29-0.34) compared to simpler models (ECE: 0.049), this represents a tractable limitation addressable through post-hoc calibration methods. These findings demonstrate that frozen encoder strategies provide superior discrimination at substantially reduced computational cost, though calibration correction is essential for clinical deployment.

### [11] [Fixed-Threshold Evaluation of a Hybrid CNN-ViT for AI-Generated Image Detection Across Photos and Art](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21512)
*Md Ashik Khan,Arafat Alam Jion*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fixed-threshold evaluation protocol reveals true robustness of AI image detectors across post-processing, showing ViTs maintain performance under compression while CNNs collapse, with hybrids balancing cross-domain detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI image detection methods use misleading robustness estimates by retuning thresholds per condition, masking deployment failures. Need deployment-critical evaluation that maintains fixed thresholds across transformations.

Method: Introduces fixed-threshold evaluation protocol holding decision thresholds constant across all post-processing. Uses lightweight CNN-ViT hybrid with gated fusion and optional frequency enhancement, evaluated at three operating points (Low-FPR, ROC-optimal, Best-F1).

Result: ViTs degrade minimally under compression (92.86% to 88.36%) while frequency-aided CNNs collapse (93.33% to 61.49%). All architectures achieve 15% higher AUROC on artistic content vs photorealistic. Hybrid achieves 91.4% accuracy on photos, 89.7% on art/graphics, 98.3% on CIFAKE.

Conclusion: Fixed-threshold evaluation eliminates retuning inflation, reveals genuine robustness gaps. Deployment guidance: CNNs for clean photos, ViTs for compressed content, hybrids for art/graphics. Semantic patterns provide more reliable detection cues than forensic artifacts.

Abstract: AI image generators create both photorealistic images and stylized art, necessitating robust detectors that maintain performance under common post-processing transformations (JPEG compression, blur, downscaling). Existing methods optimize single metrics without addressing deployment-critical factors such as operating point selection and fixed-threshold robustness. This work addresses misleading robustness estimates by introducing a fixed-threshold evaluation protocol that holds decision thresholds, selected once on clean validation data, fixed across all post-processing transformations. Traditional methods retune thresholds per condition, artificially inflating robustness estimates and masking deployment failures. We report deployment-relevant performance at three operating points (Low-FPR, ROC-optimal, Best-F1) under systematic degradation testing using a lightweight CNN-ViT hybrid with gated fusion and optional frequency enhancement. Our evaluation exposes a statistically validated forensic-semantic spectrum: frequency-aided CNNs excel on pristine photos but collapse under compression (93.33% to 61.49%), whereas ViTs degrade minimally (92.86% to 88.36%) through robust semantic pattern recognition. Multi-seed experiments demonstrate that all architectures achieve 15% higher AUROC on artistic content (0.901-0.907) versus photorealistic images (0.747-0.759), confirming that semantic patterns provide fundamentally more reliable detection cues than forensic artifacts. Our hybrid approach achieves balanced cross-domain performance: 91.4% accuracy on tiny-genimage photos, 89.7% on AiArtData art/graphics, and 98.3% (competitive) on CIFAKE. Fixed-threshold evaluation eliminates retuning inflation, reveals genuine robustness gaps, and yields actionable deployment guidance: prefer CNNs for clean photo verification, ViTs for compressed content, and hybrids for art/graphics screening.

TL;DR: MuS-Polar3D is a benchmark dataset for polarization-based underwater 3D imaging with controlled scattering conditions and multiple viewpoints, enabling fair algorithm evaluation and accurate reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing public datasets lack diversity in scattering and observation conditions, hindering fair comparisons among different polarization-based underwater 3D reconstruction methods.

Method: Constructed MuS-Polar3D dataset with 42 objects captured under 7 controlled scattering conditions and 5 viewpoints, plus high-precision 3D models, normal maps, and masks. Proposed two-stage pipeline: descattering followed by 3D reconstruction.

Result: Achieved best mean angular error of 15.49 degrees in evaluations. Dataset supports multiple vision tasks including normal estimation, segmentation, descattering, and 3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: MuS-Polar3D is the first publicly available benchmark dataset for quantitative turbidity underwater polarization-based 3D imaging, enabling accurate reconstruction and fair algorithm evaluation under controllable scattering conditions.

Abstract: Polarization-based underwater 3D imaging exploits polarization cues to suppress background scattering, exhibiting distinct advantages in turbid water. Although data-driven polarization-based underwater 3D reconstruction methods show great potential, existing public datasets lack sufficient diversity in scattering and observation conditions, hindering fair comparisons among different approaches, including single-view and multi-view polarization imaging methods.
  To address this limitation, we construct MuS-Polar3D, a benchmark dataset comprising polarization images of 42 objects captured under seven quantitatively controlled scattering conditions and five viewpoints, together with high-precision 3D models (+/- 0.05 mm accuracy), normal maps, and foreground masks. The dataset supports multiple vision tasks, including normal estimation, object segmentation, descattering, and 3D reconstruction.
  Inspired by computational imaging, we further decouple underwater 3D reconstruction under scattering into a two-stage pipeline, namely descattering followed by 3D reconstruction, from an imaging-chain perspective. Extensive evaluations using multiple baseline methods under complex scattering conditions demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed benchmark, achieving a best mean angular error of 15.49 degrees. To the best of our knowledge, MuS-Polar3D is the first publicly available benchmark dataset for quantitative turbidity underwater polarization-based 3D imaging, enabling accurate reconstruction and fair algorithm evaluation under controllable scattering conditions. The dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/WangPuyun/MuS-Polar3D.

### [13] [DiverseGRPO: Mitigating Mode Collapse in Image Generation via Diversity-Aware GRPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21514)
*Henglin Liu,Huijuan Huang,Jing Wang,Chang Liu,Xiu Li,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRPO-based RL improves image quality but causes homogenized outputs in later training stages. The paper addresses this by proposing distributional creativity rewards and structure-aware regularization to enhance diversity while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GRPO for image generation leads to homogenized outputs lacking creativity and visual diversity in later training stages, limiting application scenarios. This stems from single-sample reward signals that neglect distribution-level diversity and misaligned regularization that doesn't preserve early-stage denoising diversity.

Method: Two-pronged approach: 1) Distributional creativity bonus using spectral clustering over semantically grouped samples to allocate exploratory rewards based on group sizes, encouraging novel visual modes. 2) Structure-aware regularization that enforces stronger early-stage constraints to preserve diversity without compromising reward optimization efficiency.

Result: The method achieves 13-18% improvement in semantic diversity under matched quality scores, establishing a new Pareto frontier between image quality and diversity for GRPO-based image generation.

Conclusion: By addressing both reward modeling and generation dynamics, the proposed approach successfully mitigates diversity degradation in GRPO-based image generation, enabling better quality-diversity trade-offs for more creative and diverse visual outputs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly GRPO, improves image generation quality significantly by comparing the relative performance of images generated within the same group. However, in the later stages of training, the model tends to produce homogenized outputs, lacking creativity and visual diversity, which restricts its application scenarios. This issue can be analyzed from both reward modeling and generation dynamics perspectives. First, traditional GRPO relies on single-sample quality as the reward signal, driving the model to converge toward a few high-reward generation modes while neglecting distribution-level diversity. Second, conventional GRPO regularization neglects the dominant role of early-stage denoising in preserving diversity, causing a misaligned regularization budget that limits the achievable quality--diversity trade-off. Motivated by these insights, we revisit the diversity degradation problem from both reward modeling and generation dynamics. At the reward level, we propose a distributional creativity bonus based on semantic grouping. Specifically, we construct a distribution-level representation via spectral clustering over samples generated from the same caption, and adaptively allocate exploratory rewards according to group sizes to encourage the discovery of novel visual modes. At the generation level, we introduce a structure-aware regularization, which enforces stronger early-stage constraints to preserve diversity without compromising reward optimization efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a 13\%--18\% improvement in semantic diversity under matched quality scores, establishing a new Pareto frontier between image quality and diversity for GRPO-based image generation.

TL;DR: Efficient hierarchy-aware fine-tuning framework for Vision-Language Models that enforces structural consistency in hierarchical classification with minimal parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard approaches treat labels as flat categories and require expensive full fine-tuning, producing inconsistent predictions across taxonomy levels in hierarchical classification tasks.

Method: Proposes two objectives: Tree-Path KL Divergence (TP-KL) for vertical coherence along ground-truth label paths, and Hierarchy-Sibling Smoothed Cross-Entropy (HiSCE) for consistency among sibling classes, both working in VLM's shared embedding space and integrated with lightweight LoRA adaptation.

Result: Experiments across multiple benchmarks show consistent improvements in Full-Path Accuracy and Tree-based Inconsistency Error with minimal parameter overhead.

Conclusion: Provides an efficient strategy for adapting VLMs to structured taxonomies through hierarchy-aware fine-tuning with structural consistency enforcement.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) learn powerful multimodal representations through large-scale image-text pretraining, but adapting them to hierarchical classification is underexplored. Standard approaches treat labels as flat categories and require full fine-tuning, which is expensive and produces inconsistent predictions across taxonomy levels. We propose an efficient hierarchy-aware fine-tuning framework that updates a few parameters while enforcing structural consistency. We combine two objectives: Tree-Path KL Divergence (TP-KL) aligns predictions along the ground-truth label path for vertical coherence, while Hierarchy-Sibling Smoothed Cross-Entropy (HiSCE) encourages consistent predictions among sibling classes. Both losses work in the VLM's shared embedding space and integrate with lightweight LoRA adaptation. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show consistent improvements in Full-Path Accuracy and Tree-based Inconsistency Error with minimal parameter overhead. Our approach provides an efficient strategy for adapting VLMs to structured taxonomies.

*Dongchen Han,Tianyu Li,Ziyi Wang,Gao Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Circulant Attention replaces standard self-attention with Block Circulant matrices to achieve O(N log N) complexity while maintaining model capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-attention's quadratic complexity limits practical application in high-resolution vision tasks. Previous methods introduce handcrafted patterns that compromise model capacity.

Method: Identify that self-attention matrices in vision Transformers approximate Block Circulant matrices with Circulant Blocks (BCCB). Model attention maps as nearest BCCB matrices and develop efficient O(N log N) computation algorithm.

Result: Achieves O(N log N) computation complexity while largely maintaining standard self-attention capacity. Extensive experiments on diverse visual tasks demonstrate effectiveness.

Conclusion: Circulant attention is a promising alternative to self-attention for vision Transformer architectures, offering efficient computation without significant capacity loss.

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism has been a key factor in the advancement of vision Transformers. However, its quadratic complexity imposes a heavy computational burden in high-resolution scenarios, restricting the practical application. Previous methods attempt to mitigate this issue by introducing handcrafted patterns such as locality or sparsity, which inevitably compromise model capacity. In this paper, we present a novel attention paradigm termed \textbf{Circulant Attention} by exploiting the inherent efficient pattern of self-attention. Specifically, we first identify that the self-attention matrix in vision Transformers often approximates the Block Circulant matrix with Circulant Blocks (BCCB), a kind of structured matrix whose multiplication with other matrices can be performed in $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ time. Leveraging this interesting pattern, we explicitly model the attention map as its nearest BCCB matrix and propose an efficient computation algorithm for fast calculation. The resulting approach closely mirrors vanilla self-attention, differing only in its use of BCCB matrices. Since our design is inspired by the inherent efficient paradigm, it not only delivers $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ computation complexity, but also largely maintains the capacity of standard self-attention. Extensive experiments on diverse visual tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, establishing circulant attention as a promising alternative to self-attention for vision Transformer architectures.

### [16] [EraseLoRA: MLLM-Driven Foreground Exclusion and Background Subtype Aggregation for Dataset-Free Object Removal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21545)
*Sanghyun Jo,Donghwan Lee,Eunji Jung,Seong Je Oh,Kyungsu Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EraseLoRA: A dataset-free object removal framework using background-aware reasoning and test-time adaptation to prevent target reappearance while preserving structural fidelity, outperforming attention-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object removal requires preventing target reappearance and reconstructing occluded background with structural fidelity, not just plausible hole filling. Current dataset-free approaches using attention redirection fail by misinterpreting non-target foregrounds as background (causing unwanted regeneration) and disrupting fine details through attention manipulation.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Background-aware Foreground Exclusion (BFE) uses multimodal LLMs to separate target foreground, non-target foregrounds, and clean background from single image-mask pairs without supervision; 2) Background-aware Reconstruction with Subtype Aggregation (BRSA) performs test-time optimization treating background subtypes as complementary pieces, enforcing consistent integration through reconstruction and alignment objectives without explicit attention intervention.

Result: EraseLoRA demonstrates consistent improvements over dataset-free baselines and competitive results against dataset-driven methods across object removal benchmarks, validating it as a plug-in to pretrained diffusion models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of attention-based approaches by replacing attention surgery with background-aware reasoning and test-time adaptation, achieving reliable object removal while preserving structural and contextual fidelity without requiring paired supervision datasets.

Abstract: Object removal differs from common inpainting, since it must prevent the masked target from reappearing and reconstruct the occluded background with structural and contextual fidelity, rather than merely filling a hole plausibly. Recent dataset-free approaches that redirect self-attention inside the mask fail in two ways: non-target foregrounds are often misinterpreted as background, which regenerates unwanted objects, and direct attention manipulation disrupts fine details and hinders coherent integration of background cues. We propose EraseLoRA, a novel dataset-free framework that replaces attention surgery with background-aware reasoning and test-time adaptation. First, Background-aware Foreground Exclusion (BFE), uses a multimodal large-language models to separate target foreground, non-target foregrounds, and clean background from a single image-mask pair without paired supervision, producing reliable background cues while excluding distractors. Second, Background-aware Reconstruction with Subtype Aggregation (BRSA), performs test-time optimization that treats inferred background subtypes as complementary pieces and enforces their consistent integration through reconstruction and alignment objectives, preserving local detail and global structure without explicit attention intervention. We validate EraseLoRA as a plug-in to pretrained diffusion models and across benchmarks for object removal, demonstrating consistent improvements over dataset-free baselines and competitive results against dataset-driven methods. The code will be made available upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: New tasks for context-aware object insertion and sponsor-product logo augmentation in images, with corresponding datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing methods often fail to ensure inserted objects are contextually appropriate, especially for advertising and digital media applications.

Method: Introduce two new tasks: (1) context-aware object insertion (predicting suitable categories, generating objects, and placing them plausibly), and (2) sponsor-product logo augmentation (detecting products and inserting correct brand logos). Build two new datasets with category annotations, placement regions, and sponsor-product labels.

Result: Two new datasets created to support the proposed tasks, containing annotations for object categories, placement regions, and sponsor-product relationships.

Conclusion: The paper introduces important new tasks for intelligent image editing in advertising and digital media, providing datasets to enable research in context-aware object insertion and brand logo augmentation.

Abstract: Intelligent image editing increasingly relies on advances in computer vision, multimodal reasoning, and generative modeling. While vision-language models (VLMs) and diffusion models enable guided visual manipulation, existing work rarely ensures that inserted objects are \emph{contextually appropriate}. We introduce two new tasks for advertising and digital media: (1) \emph{context-aware object insertion}, which requires predicting suitable object categories, generating them, and placing them plausibly within the scene; and (2) \emph{sponsor-product logo augmentation}, which involves detecting products and inserting correct brand logos, even when items are unbranded or incorrectly branded. To support these tasks, we build two new datasets with category annotations, placement regions, and sponsor-product labels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Analysis of AIGC image detection reproducibility issues: papers omit implicit details and methods overfit to specific generators, causing poor reproducibility and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two core issues in AIGC image detection field: poor reproducibility and insufficient generalizability that hinder practical application of detection technologies.

Method: Review 7 key papers on AIGC detection, construct lightweight test dataset, and reproduce representative detection method to identify root causes of reproducibility problems.

Result: Basic performance can be reproduced when strictly following core procedures, but detection performance drops sharply when preprocessing disrupts key features or when testing across different generators.

Conclusion: Provides empirical evidence for improving AIGC detection reproducibility and offers reference directions for researchers to disclose experimental details more comprehensively and verify method generalizability.

Abstract: While the technology for detecting AI-Generated Content (AIGC) images has advanced rapidly, the field still faces two core issues: poor reproducibility and insufficient gen eralizability, which hinder the practical application of such technologies. This study addresses these challenges by re viewing 7 key papers on AIGC detection, constructing a lightweight test dataset, and reproducing a representative detection method. Through this process, we identify the root causes of the reproducibility dilemma in the field: firstly, papers often omit implicit details such as prepro cessing steps and parameter settings; secondly, most detec tion methods overfit to exclusive features of specific gener ators rather than learning universal intrinsic features of AIGC images. Experimental results show that basic perfor mance can be reproduced when strictly following the core procedures described in the original papers. However, de tection performance drops sharply when preprocessing dis rupts key features or when testing across different genera tors. This research provides empirical evidence for improv ing the reproducibility of AIGC detection technologies and offers reference directions for researchers to disclose ex perimental details more comprehensively and verify the generalizability of their proposed methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LAid: A knowledge distillation method that transfers long-range attention mechanisms from large to small vision-language models, enabling up to 3.2x longer effective context windows while maintaining performance on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small vision-language models have limited window sizes that fail at linguistics-photography alignment, while large models demonstrate strong long-context understanding. The challenge is to transfer this long-range attention capability to smaller models.

Method: LAid uses two complementary components: (1) progressive distance-weighted attention matching that dynamically emphasizes longer position differences during training, and (2) learnable RoPE response gain modulation that selectively amplifies position sensitivity where needed.

Result: LAid-distilled models achieve up to 3.2 times longer effective context windows compared to baseline small models while maintaining or improving performance on standard VL benchmarks. Spectral analysis shows LAid preserves crucial low-frequency attention components that conventional methods fail to transfer.

Conclusion: LAid provides practical techniques for building more efficient long-context VLMs and offers theoretical insights into how positional understanding emerges and transfers during distillation, addressing the window size limitations of small vision-language models.

Abstract: While large vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate strong long-context understanding, their prevalent small branches fail on linguistics-photography alignment for a limited window size. We discover that knowledge distillation improves students' capability as a complement to Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) on window sizes (anchored from large models). Building on this insight, we propose LAid, which directly aims at the transfer of long-range attention mechanisms through two complementary components: (1) a progressive distance-weighted attention matching that dynamically emphasizes longer position differences during training, and (2) a learnable RoPE response gain modulation that selectively amplifies position sensitivity where needed. Extensive experiments across multiple model families demonstrate that LAid-distilled models achieve up to 3.2 times longer effective context windows compared to baseline small models, while maintaining or improving performance on standard VL benchmarks. Spectral analysis also suggests that LAid successfully preserves crucial low-frequency attention components that conventional methods fail to transfer. Our work not only provides practical techniques for building more efficient long-context VLMs but also offers theoretical insights into how positional understanding emerges and transfers during distillation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based metrics favor their own generations (lack neutrality), while most LLM-free metrics don't always show high performance. There's a need for a neutral, high-performance evaluation metric for image captions.

Method: Proposes Pearl, an LLM-free supervised metric that learns representations of image-caption and caption-caption similarities. Also constructs a large human-annotated dataset with ~333k judgments from 2,360 annotators across 75k+ images.

Result: Pearl outperformed other existing LLM-free metrics on Composite, Flickr8K-Expert, Flickr8K-CF, Nebula, and FOIL datasets in both reference-based and reference-free settings.

Conclusion: Pearl provides a neutral, high-performance evaluation solution for image captioning that addresses the limitations of both LLM-based and existing LLM-free metrics, with comprehensive human validation.

Abstract: We focus on the automatic evaluation of image captions in both reference-based and reference-free settings. Existing metrics based on large language models (LLMs) favor their own generations; therefore, the neutrality is in question. Most LLM-free metrics do not suffer from such an issue, whereas they do not always demonstrate high performance. To address these issues, we propose Pearl, an LLM-free supervised metric for image captioning, which is applicable to both reference-based and reference-free settings. We introduce a novel mechanism that learns the representations of image--caption and caption--caption similarities. Furthermore, we construct a human-annotated dataset for image captioning metrics, that comprises approximately 333k human judgments collected from 2,360 annotators across over 75k images. Pearl outperformed other existing LLM-free metrics on the Composite, Flickr8K-Expert, Flickr8K-CF, Nebula, and FOIL datasets in both reference-based and reference-free settings.

Conclusion: UltraLBM-UNet provides an accurate, robust, and resource-efficient solution for skin lesion segmentation, making it highly suitable for point-of-care clinical deployment where computational resources are limited but accurate lesion analysis is essential.

Abstract: Skin lesion segmentation is a crucial step in dermatology for guiding clinical decision-making.

To address these limitations, we propose UltraLBM-UNet, a lightweight U-Net variant that integrates a bidirectional Mamba-based global modeling mechanism with multi-branch local feature perception. The proposed architecture integrates efficient local feature injection with bidirectional state-space modeling, enabling richer contextual interaction across spatial dimensions while maintaining computational compactness suitable for point-of-care deployment. Extensive experiments on the ISIC 2017, ISIC 2018, and PH2 datasets demonstrate that our model consistently achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, outperforming existing lightweight and Mamba counterparts with only 0.034M parameters and 0.060 GFLOPs. In addition, we introduce a hybrid knowledge distillation strategy to train an ultra-compact student model, where the distilled variant UltraLBM-UNet-T, with only 0.011M parameters and 0.019 GFLOPs, achieves competitive segmentation performance. These results highlight the suitability of UltraLBM-UNet for point-of-care deployment, where accurate and robust lesion analyses are essential.

*Jian Lang,Rongpei Hong,Ting Zhong,Leiting Chen,Qiang Gao,Fan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ALARM is a label-free harmful meme detection framework using LMM agent self-improvement that learns from explicit memes to detect complex ones without manual annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Harmful meme detection requires large labeled datasets, which are costly to create and can't adapt to evolving content. Need scalable, adaptable solutions without manual annotation.

Method: Uses Confidence-based Explicit Meme Identification to isolate explicit memes with pseudo-labels, then Pairwise Learning Guided Agent Self-Improvement with contrastive pairs to refine LMM agent for complex meme detection.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on three datasets, even beats label-driven approaches, shows strong adaptability to newly evolved memes.

Conclusion: ALARM demonstrates label-free frameworks are scalable, promising solutions for dynamic online environments, enabling adaptation to novel harmful meme forms and topics.

Abstract: The proliferation of harmful memes on online media poses significant risks to public health and stability. Existing detection methods heavily rely on large-scale labeled data for training, which necessitates substantial manual annotation efforts and limits their adaptability to the continually evolving nature of harmful content. To address these challenges, we present ALARM, the first lAbeL-free hARmful Meme detection framework powered by Large Multimodal Model (LMM) agent self-improvement. The core innovation of ALARM lies in exploiting the expressive information from "shallow" memes to iteratively enhance its ability to tackle more complex and subtle ones. ALARM consists of a novel Confidence-based Explicit Meme Identification mechanism that isolates the explicit memes from the original dataset and assigns them pseudo-labels. Besides, a new Pairwise Learning Guided Agent Self-Improvement paradigm is introduced, where the explicit memes are reorganized into contrastive pairs (positive vs. negative) to refine a learner LMM agent. This agent autonomously derives high-level detection cues from these pairs, which in turn empower the agent itself to handle complex and challenging memes effectively. Experiments on three diverse datasets demonstrate the superior performance and strong adaptability of ALARM to newly evolved memes. Notably, our method even outperforms label-driven methods. These results highlight the potential of label-free frameworks as a scalable and promising solution for adapting to novel forms and topics of harmful memes in dynamic online environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analyzing cryo-EM datasets containing both continuous motions and discrete states is challenging, but essential for understanding protein flexibility and dynamic interactions.

Method: Uses Gaussian pseudo-atomic framework with two-encoder-one-decoder architecture to map images to individual Gaussian components, representing structural variability through Gaussian parameter changes.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on both simulated and experimental datasets, providing interpretable descriptions of conformational changes and preserving local structural consistency.

Conclusion: GaussianEM bridges gap between density-based models and atomic models while offering intuitive analysis of macromolecular dynamics from cryo-EM data.

Abstract: Understanding protein flexibility and its dynamic interactions with other molecules is essential for protein function study. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) provides an opportunity to directly observe macromolecular dynamics. However, analyzing datasets that contain both continuous motions and discrete states remains highly challenging. Here we present GaussianEM, a Gaussian pseudo-atomic framework that simultaneously models compositional and conformational heterogeneity from experimental cryo-EM images. GaussianEM employs a two-encoder-one-decoder architecture to map an image to its individual Gaussian components, and represent structural variability through changes in Gaussian parameters. This approach provides an intuitive and interpretable description of conformational changes, preserves local structural consistency along the transition trajectories, and naturally bridges the gap between density-based models and corresponding atomic models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GaussianEM on both simulated and experimental datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D simulation methods for autonomous driving struggle to simultaneously achieve photorealistic rendering and interactive traffic editing, often suffering from artifacts in large-angle novel views and during asset manipulation.

Method: Introduces Symmetric Auto-regressive Online Restoration paradigm that constructs paired symmetric views for detail recovery using ground-truth-guided dual-view formulation, and uses training-free harmonization mechanism that treats vehicle insertion as context-aware inpainting.

Result: Extensive experiments show SymDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance in both novel-view enhancement and realistic 3D vehicle insertion.

Conclusion: SymDrive provides a unified solution for high-fidelity 3D simulation in autonomous driving that addresses both rendering quality and editing capabilities simultaneously.

Abstract: High-fidelity and controllable 3D simulation is essential for addressing the long-tail data scarcity in Autonomous Driving (AD), yet existing methods struggle to simultaneously achieve photorealistic rendering and interactive traffic editing. Current approaches often falter in large-angle novel view synthesis and suffer from geometric or lighting artifacts during asset manipulation. To address these challenges, we propose SymDrive, a unified diffusion-based framework capable of joint high-quality rendering and scene editing. We introduce a Symmetric Auto-regressive Online Restoration paradigm, which constructs paired symmetric views to recover fine-grained details via a ground-truth-guided dual-view formulation and utilizes an auto-regressive strategy for consistent lateral view generation. Furthermore, we leverage this restoration capability to enable a training-free harmonization mechanism, treating vehicle insertion as context-aware inpainting to ensure seamless lighting and shadow consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SymDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance in both novel-view enhancement and realistic 3D vehicle insertion.

TL;DR: LCMP is the first benchmark for evaluating long-context MLLM personalization, assessing how well models handle personalized concepts over extended dialogues. TAME framework achieves state-of-the-art performance with double memories and RA2G paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM personalization methods focus only on simple visual identification and textual replacement of personalized concepts, lacking support for long-context conversations where models need to continually learn from past dialogue histories and adapt to concept variations over time.

Method: Proposes LCMP benchmark for long-context MLLM personalization evaluation, and introduces TAME framework with: 1) Double memories to manage temporal vs. persistent concept variations, 2) Retrieve-then-Align Augmented Generation (RA2G) paradigm that adds alignment step to extract contextually fitted information from retrieved knowledge.

Result: TAME achieves best performance on LCMP benchmark, demonstrating remarkable and evolving interaction experiences in long-context scenarios. The training-free approach shows strong capability in handling complex real-world user queries.

Conclusion: LCMP addresses the gap in long-context MLLM personalization evaluation, and TAME provides an effective training-free solution with double memory management and RA2G paradigm, enabling MLLMs to better handle personalized concept variations over extended dialogues.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) Personalization is a critical research problem that facilitates personalized dialogues with MLLMs targeting specific entities (known as personalized concepts). However, existing methods and benchmarks focus on the simple, context-agnostic visual identification and textual replacement of the personalized concept (e.g., "A yellow puppy" -> "Your puppy Mochi"), overlooking the ability to support long-context conversations. An ideal personalized MLLM assistant is capable of engaging in long-context dialogues with humans and continually improving its experience quality by learning from past dialogue histories. To bridge this gap, we propose LCMP, the first Long-Context MLLM Personalization evaluation benchmark. LCMP assesses the capability of MLLMs in perceiving variations of personalized concepts and generating contextually appropriate personalized responses that reflect these variations. As a strong baseline for LCMP, we introduce a novel training-free and state-aware framework TAME. TAME endows MLLMs with double memories to manage the temporal and persistent variations of each personalized concept in a differentiated manner. In addition, TAME incorporates a new training-free Retrieve-then-Align Augmented Generation (RA2G) paradigm. RA2G introduces an alignment step to extract the contextually fitted information from the multi-memory retrieved knowledge to the current questions, enabling better interactions for complex real-world user queries. Experiments on LCMP demonstrate that TAME achieves the best performance, showcasing remarkable and evolving interaction experiences in long-context scenarios.

*Zhiwen Yang,Jinglin Xu,Yuxin Pen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A causal inference approach for few-shot fine-grained visual categorization that addresses biased data distributions through sample-level and feature-level interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FS-FGVC methods overlook that support samples act as confounding variables, introducing biased data distribution and misleading discriminative feature extraction, which hampers performance.

Method: Proposes CausalFSFG with two components: 1) Interventional multi-scale encoder (IMSE) for sample-level interventions, and 2) Interventional masked feature reconstruction (IMFR) for feature-level interventions, both designed to eliminate spurious correlations and reveal real causalities.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on widely-used public datasets including CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, and Stanford Cars.

Conclusion: Causal inference effectively addresses biased data distributions in FS-FGVC, and the proposed CausalFSFG approach with sample-level and feature-level interventions successfully eliminates spurious correlations to improve classification performance.

Abstract: Few-shot fine-grained visual categorization (FS-FGVC) focuses on identifying various subcategories within a common superclass given just one or few support examples. Most existing methods aim to boost classification accuracy by enriching the extracted features with discriminative part-level details. However, they often overlook the fact that the set of support samples acts as a confounding variable, which hampers the FS-FGVC performance by introducing biased data distribution and misguiding the extraction of discriminative features. To address this issue, we propose a new causal FS-FGVC (CausalFSFG) approach inspired by causal inference for addressing biased data distributions through causal intervention. Specifically, based on the structural causal model (SCM), we argue that FS-FGVC infers the subcategories (i.e., effect) from the inputs (i.e., cause), whereas both the few-shot condition disturbance and the inherent fine-grained nature (i.e., large intra-class variance and small inter-class variance) lead to unobservable variables that bring spurious correlations, compromising the final classification performance. To further eliminate the spurious correlations, our CausalFSFG approach incorporates two key components: (1) Interventional multi-scale encoder (IMSE) conducts sample-level interventions, (2) Interventional masked feature reconstruction (IMFR) conducts feature-level interventions, which together reveal real causalities from inputs to subcategories. Extensive experiments and thorough analyses on the widely-used public datasets, including CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, and Stanford Cars, demonstrate that our CausalFSFG achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: PPE framework for disentangled image editing gets improved with L1 regularization to reduce semantic leakage in latent space manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-driven image manipulation often suffers from attribute entanglement where modifying target attributes unintentionally alters other semantic properties like identity or appearance.

Method: Analyzes PPE framework (BERT-based attribute prediction + StyleGAN2 generation), identifies limitation in original regularization, and introduces sparsity-based constraint using L1 regularization on latent space manipulation.

Result: Proposed approach enforces more focused and controlled edits, effectively reducing unintended changes in non-target attributes while preserving facial identity.

Conclusion: Sparsity-based L1 regularization improves PPE framework by reducing semantic leakage and enabling more disentangled image editing.

Abstract: Text-driven image manipulation often suffers from attribute entanglement, where modifying a target attribute (e.g., adding bangs) unintentionally alters other semantic properties such as identity or appearance. The Predict, Prevent, and Evaluate (PPE) framework addresses this issue by leveraging pre-trained vision-language models for disentangled editing. In this work, we analyze the PPE framework, focusing on its architectural components, including BERT-based attribute prediction and StyleGAN2-based image generation on the CelebA-HQ dataset. Through empirical analysis, we identify a limitation in the original regularization strategy, where latent updates remain dense and prone to semantic leakage. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a sparsity-based constraint using L1 regularization on latent space manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach enforces more focused and controlled edits, effectively reducing unintended changes in non-target attributes while preserving facial identity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrackTeller is a temporal multimodal framework for 3D object grounding that uses LiDAR-image fusion and temporal reasoning to understand language references to objects in dynamic driving scenes, achieving significant improvements in tracking accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many referring expressions in driving scenes describe targets through recent motion or short-term interactions, which cannot be resolved from static appearance or geometry alone, necessitating temporal reasoning for accurate 3D object grounding.

Method: TrackTeller integrates LiDAR-image fusion, language-conditioned decoding, and temporal reasoning in a unified architecture, constructing a shared UniScene representation aligned with textual semantics, generating language-aware 3D proposals, and refining grounding decisions using motion history and short-term dynamics.

Result: Experiments on the NuPrompt benchmark show TrackTeller consistently improves language-grounded tracking performance with 70% relative improvement in Average Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy and 3.15-3.4 times reduction in False Alarm Frequency compared to strong baselines.

Conclusion: TrackTeller effectively addresses temporal language-based 3D grounding by leveraging multi-frame observations and multimodal fusion, demonstrating significant performance gains in understanding natural-language references to objects in dynamic driving scenes.

Abstract: Understanding natural-language references to objects in dynamic 3D driving scenes is essential for interactive autonomous systems. In practice, many referring expressions describe targets through recent motion or short-term interactions, which cannot be resolved from static appearance or geometry alone. We study temporal language-based 3D grounding, where the objective is to identify the referred object in the current frame by leveraging multi-frame observations. We propose TrackTeller, a temporal multimodal grounding framework that integrates LiDAR-image fusion, language-conditioned decoding, and temporal reasoning in a unified architecture. TrackTeller constructs a shared UniScene representation aligned with textual semantics, generates language-aware 3D proposals, and refines grounding decisions using motion history and short-term dynamics. Experiments on the NuPrompt benchmark demonstrate that TrackTeller consistently improves language-grounded tracking performance, outperforming strong baselines with a 70% relative improvement in Average Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy and a 3.15-3.4 times reduction in False Alarm Frequency.

TL;DR: Mechanistic interpretability framework for deepfake detection using sparse autoencoder analysis and forensic manifold analysis to understand model decision processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake detection models achieve high accuracy but remain opaque "black boxes" - we need to understand their decision processes for interpretability and robustness.

Method: Combines sparse autoencoder (SAE) analysis of internal representations with novel forensic manifold analysis that probes feature responses to controlled forensic artifact manipulations.

Result: Only small fraction of latent features actively used per layer; geometric properties of feature manifold (intrinsic dimensionality, curvature, feature selectivity) vary systematically with different deepfake artifacts.

Conclusion: Provides first step toward opening the "black box" of deepfake detectors, enabling identification of learned features corresponding to specific forensic artifacts and guiding development of more interpretable/robust models.

Abstract: Deepfake detection models have achieved high accuracy in identifying synthetic media, but their decision processes remain largely opaque. In this paper we present a mechanistic interpretability framework for deepfake detection applied to a vision-language model. Our approach combines a sparse autoencoder (SAE) analysis of internal network representations with a novel forensic manifold analysis that probes how the model's features respond to controlled forensic artifact manipulations. We demonstrate that only a small fraction of latent features are actively used in each layer, and that the geometric properties of the model's feature manifold, including intrinsic dimensionality, curvature, and feature selectivity, vary systematically with different types of deepfake artifacts. These insights provide a first step toward opening the "black box" of deepfake detectors, allowing us to identify which learned features correspond to specific forensic artifacts and to guide the development of more interpretable and robust models.

Abstract: Recently, a plethora of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms have been proposed to achieve the efficiency, safety, and reliability of autonomous vehicles (AVs). The AVs use a perception system to detect, localize, and identify other vehicles, pedestrians, and road signs to perform safe navigation and decision-making. In this paper, we compare the performance of DL models, including YOLO-NAS and YOLOv8, for a detection-based perception task. We capture a custom dataset and experiment with both DL models using our custom dataset. Our analysis reveals that the YOLOv8s model saves 75% of training time compared to the YOLO-NAS model. In addition, the YOLOv8s model (83%) outperforms the YOLO-NAS model (81%) when the target is to achieve the highest object detection accuracy. These comparative analyses of these new emerging DL models will allow the relevant research community to understand the models' performance under real-world use case scenarios.

Motivation: Bengali is the 5th most spoken language but lacks resources for handwritten text generation, unlike English and Arabic. Large diverse datasets are hard to collect but essential for realistic HTG due to handwriting style variations.

Method: Developed a self-collected dataset of Bengali handwriting samples from ~500 individuals across different ages/genders, with pre-processing for consistency. Proposed a method to generate diverse handwritten outputs from input plain text.

Result: The approach demonstrates ability to produce diverse handwritten outputs from input plain text, showing promise for Bengali handwriting generation.

Conclusion: This work contributes to advancing Bengali handwriting generation and can support further research in this area, addressing a significant gap in resources for the world's 5th most spoken language.

Abstract: Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) is a well-established research area. In contrast, Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) is an emerging field with significant potential. This task is challenging due to the variation in individual handwriting styles. A large and diverse dataset is required to generate realistic handwritten text. However, such datasets are difficult to collect and are not readily available. Bengali is the fifth most spoken language in the world. While several studies exist for languages such as English and Arabic, Bengali handwritten text generation has received little attention. To address this gap, we propose a method for generating Bengali handwritten words. We developed and used a self-collected dataset of Bengali handwriting samples. The dataset includes contributions from approximately five hundred individuals across different ages and genders. All images were pre-processed to ensure consistency and quality. Our approach demonstrates the ability to produce diverse handwritten outputs from input plain text. We believe this work contributes to the advancement of Bengali handwriting generation and can support further research in this area.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C-Graph: A contrastive graph modeling framework for cross-domain few-shot medical image segmentation that leverages structural consistency as a domain-transferable prior, outperforming existing methods while preserving source-domain accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-domain few-shot medical image segmentation methods filter out domain-specific information to improve generalization, but this limits cross-domain performance and degrades source-domain accuracy. There's a need for a method that can effectively transfer knowledge across domains without sacrificing performance on the source domain.

Method: Proposes Contrastive Graph Modeling (C-Graph) framework with three key components: 1) Structural Prior Graph (SPG) layer to capture and transfer target-category node dependencies through explicit node interactions, 2) Subgraph Matching Decoding (SMD) mechanism that exploits semantic relations among nodes to guide prediction, and 3) Confusion-minimizing Node Contrast (CNC) loss to mitigate node ambiguity and subgraph heterogeneity by contrastively enhancing node discriminability in graph space.

Result: Significantly outperforms prior CD-FSMIS approaches across multiple cross-domain benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while simultaneously preserving strong segmentation accuracy on the source domain.

Conclusion: The C-Graph framework successfully leverages structural consistency of medical images as a reliable domain-transferable prior, addressing limitations of existing methods by preserving both cross-domain performance and source-domain accuracy through graph-based modeling and contrastive learning techniques.

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot medical image segmentation (CD-FSMIS) offers a promising and data-efficient solution for medical applications where annotations are severely scarce and multimodal analysis is required. However, existing methods typically filter out domain-specific information to improve generalization, which inadvertently limits cross-domain performance and degrades source-domain accuracy. To address this, we present Contrastive Graph Modeling (C-Graph), a framework that leverages the structural consistency of medical images as a reliable domain-transferable prior. We represent image features as graphs, with pixels as nodes and semantic affinities as edges. A Structural Prior Graph (SPG) layer is proposed to capture and transfer target-category node dependencies and enable global structure modeling through explicit node interactions. Building upon SPG layers, we introduce a Subgraph Matching Decoding (SMD) mechanism that exploits semantic relations among nodes to guide prediction. Furthermore, we design a Confusion-minimizing Node Contrast (CNC) loss to mitigate node ambiguity and subgraph heterogeneity by contrastively enhancing node discriminability in the graph space. Our method significantly outperforms prior CD-FSMIS approaches across multiple cross-domain benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while simultaneously preserving strong segmentation accuracy on the source domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal medical imaging provides complementary information but deep learning development is limited by scarcity of large paired/aligned datasets. Need to leverage separate unpaired CT and MRI cohorts that are common in healthcare.

Method: Adaptive Quaternion Cross-Fusion Network (A-QCF-Net) with quaternion neural networks for parameter efficiency and expressive power. Core is Adaptive Quaternion Cross-Fusion (A-QCF) block - data-driven attention module enabling bidirectional knowledge transfer between CT and MRI streams.

Result: Jointly trained on unpaired LiTS (CT) and ATLAS (MRI) datasets. Achieves Tumor Dice scores of 76.7% on CT and 78.3% on MRI, exceeding unimodal nnU-Net baseline by 5.4% and 4.7% respectively. Explainability analysis confirms clinically meaningful focus.

Conclusion: Provides robust and clinically viable paradigm for leveraging large unpaired imaging archives common in healthcare through adaptive cross-fusion and bidirectional knowledge transfer between modalities.

Abstract: Multimodal medical imaging provides complementary information that is crucial for accurate delineation of pathology, but the development of deep learning models is limited by the scarcity of large datasets in which different modalities are paired and spatially aligned. This paper addresses this fundamental limitation by proposing an Adaptive Quaternion Cross-Fusion Network (A-QCF-Net) that learns a single unified segmentation model from completely separate and unpaired CT and MRI cohorts. The architecture exploits the parameter efficiency and expressive power of Quaternion Neural Networks to construct a shared feature space. At its core is the Adaptive Quaternion Cross-Fusion (A-QCF) block, a data driven attention module that enables bidirectional knowledge transfer between the two streams. By learning to modulate the flow of information dynamically, the A-QCF block allows the network to exchange abstract modality specific expertise, such as the sharp anatomical boundary information available in CT and the subtle soft tissue contrast provided by MRI. This mutual exchange regularizes and enriches the feature representations of both streams. We validate the framework by jointly training a single model on the unpaired LiTS (CT) and ATLAS (MRI) datasets. The jointly trained model achieves Tumor Dice scores of 76.7% on CT and 78.3% on MRI, significantly exceeding the strong unimodal nnU-Net baseline by margins of 5.4% and 4.7% respectively. Furthermore, comprehensive explainability analysis using Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++ confirms that the model correctly focuses on relevant pathological structures, ensuring the learned representations are clinically meaningful. This provides a robust and clinically viable paradigm for unlocking the large unpaired imaging archives that are common in healthcare.

TL;DR: SlideChain is a blockchain-based framework that provides verifiable integrity for AI-generated educational content by anchoring semantic extractions from vision-language models on a tamper-evident ledger.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models produce inconsistent semantic outputs across different models and settings, making AI-generated educational content unreliable and difficult to verify, especially in high-stakes STEM domains.

Method: Developed SlideChain framework that extracts concepts and relational triples from medical imaging lecture slides using four state-of-the-art VLMs, then anchors cryptographic hashes of structured provenance records on a local EVM-compatible blockchain.

Result: Found significant cross-model discrepancies (low concept overlap, near-zero agreement in relational triples), demonstrated perfect tamper detection, deterministic reproducibility, and evaluated gas usage/throughput/scalability for practical deployment.

Conclusion: SlideChain provides a practical, scalable solution for trustworthy multimodal educational pipelines with long-term auditability, reproducibility, and integrity for AI-assisted instructional systems.

Abstract: Modern vision--language models (VLMs) are increasingly used to interpret and generate educational content, yet their semantic outputs remain challenging to verify, reproduce, and audit over time. Inconsistencies across model families, inference settings, and computing environments undermine the reliability of AI-generated instructional material, particularly in high-stakes and quantitative STEM domains. This work introduces SlideChain, a blockchain-backed provenance framework designed to provide verifiable integrity for multimodal semantic extraction at scale. Using the SlideChain Slides Dataset-a curated corpus of 1,117 medical imaging lecture slides from a university course-we extract concepts and relational triples from four state-of-the-art VLMs and construct structured provenance records for every slide. SlideChain anchors cryptographic hashes of these records on a local EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)-compatible blockchain, providing tamper-evident auditability and persistent semantic baselines. Through the first systematic analysis of semantic disagreement, cross-model similarity, and lecture-level variability in multimodal educational content, we reveal pronounced cross-model discrepancies, including low concept overlap and near-zero agreement in relational triples on many slides. We further evaluate gas usage, throughput, and scalability under simulated deployment conditions, and demonstrate perfect tamper detection along with deterministic reproducibility across independent extraction runs. Together, these results show that SlideChain provides a practical and scalable step toward trustworthy, verifiable multimodal educational pipelines, supporting long-term auditability, reproducibility, and integrity for AI-assisted instructional systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a VAE-GAN hybrid video generator with Markov chain recall mechanism to generate long, temporally consistent videos of hundreds/thousands of frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation models (GANs, VAEs, Diffusion) struggle with temporal scaling - quality degrades when generating long sequences beyond typical 16-frame limits. Need for models that can generate meaningful, coherent long videos with temporal continuity.

Method: 1) VAE-GAN hybrid structure with variational encoder for inference capabilities; 2) Dual-branch architecture (content + movement); 3) Markov chain framework with recall mechanism where each state represents a VAE-GAN short-video generator; 4) Sequential connection of generated sub-sequences to maintain temporal dependencies.

Result: Enables generation of long videos (hundreds/thousands of frames) with temporal continuity, consistency, and dynamics while overcoming quality degradation issues of classical approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed memory-efficient approach successfully extends video generation capabilities to long sequences by combining VAE-GAN architecture with Markov chain recall mechanism, ensuring meaningful temporal progression in generated videos.

Abstract: Video generation has seen remarkable progresses thanks to advancements in generative deep learning. Generated videos should not only display coherent and continuous movement but also meaningful movement in successions of scenes. Generating models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and more recently Diffusion Networks have been used for generating short video sequences, usually of up to 16 frames. In this paper, we first propose a new type of video generator by enabling adversarial-based unconditional video generators with a variational encoder, akin to a VAE-GAN hybrid structure, in order to enable the generation process with inference capabilities. The proposed model, as in other video deep learning-based processing frameworks, incorporates two processing branches, one for content and another for movement. However, existing models struggle with the temporal scaling of the generated videos. In classical approaches when aiming to increase the generated video length, the resulting video quality degrades, particularly when considering generating significantly long sequences. To overcome this limitation, our research study extends the initially proposed VAE-GAN video generation model by employing a novel, memory-efficient approach to generate long videos composed of hundreds or thousands of frames ensuring their temporal continuity, consistency and dynamics. Our approach leverages a Markov chain framework with a recall mechanism, with each state representing a VAE-GAN short-length video generator. This setup allows for the sequential connection of generated video sub-sequences, enabling temporal dependencies, resulting in meaningful long video sequences.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGGT's global self-attention collapses with long sequences; analysis shows it's a degenerate diffusion process converging to Dirac measure at O(1/L) rate, explaining why token-merging helps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mathematically explain the collapse phenomenon in VGGT's global self-attention when processing long sequences (hundreds of frames), where attention matrices become near rank-one and reconstruction error accumulates super-linearly.

Method: View global-attention iteration as a degenerate diffusion process, prove token-feature flow converges to Dirac-type measure at O(1/L) rate, derive closed-form mean-field PDE that predicts rank profile, and validate against empirical observations.

Result: Theory quantitatively matches attention-heat-map evolution and experimental outcomes, explains why token-merging (removing redundant tokens) slows diffusion coefficient and delays collapse without retraining.

Conclusion: Analysis provides principled framework for interpreting scalable 3D-vision transformers, with potential for multi-modal generalization, offering mathematical understanding of attention collapse in long sequences.

Abstract: Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) delivers state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D reconstruction, yet its global self-attention layer suffers from a drastic collapse phenomenon when the input sequence exceeds a few hundred frames: attention matrices rapidly become near rank-one, token geometry degenerates to an almost one-dimensional subspace, and reconstruction error accumulates super-linearly.In this report,we establish a rigorous mathematical explanation of the collapse by viewing the global-attention iteration as a degenerate diffusion process.We prove that,in VGGT, the token-feature flow converges toward a Dirac-type measure at a $O(1/L)$ rate, where $L$ is the layer index, yielding a closed-form mean-field partial differential equation that precisely predicts the empirically observed rank profile.The theory quantitatively matches the attention-heat-map evolution and a series of experiments outcomes reported in relevant works and explains why its token-merging remedy -- which periodically removes redundant tokens -- slows the effective diffusion coefficient and thereby delays collapse without additional training.We believe the analysis provides a principled lens for interpreting future scalable 3D-vision transformers,and we highlight its potential for multi-modal generalization.

TL;DR: InstructMoLE introduces instruction-guided routing for diffusion transformers, using global routing signals instead of per-token routing to prevent spatial fragmentation and improve multi-conditional image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for DiTs suffer from task interference with monolithic adapters like LoRA, and MoLE architectures have limited potential due to token-level routing that conflicts with global user instructions, causing spatial fragmentation and semantic drift.

Method: InstructMoLE framework with Instruction-Guided Routing (IGR) that uses global routing signals from user instructions to select a single expert council applied uniformly across all tokens, plus an output-space orthogonality loss to promote expert diversity and prevent representational collapse.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing LoRA adapters and MoLE variants across challenging multi-conditional generation benchmarks, enabling superior compositional control and fidelity to user intent.

Conclusion: InstructMoLE presents a robust and generalizable framework for instruction-driven fine-tuning of generative models that preserves global semantics and structural integrity through instruction-guided expert routing.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for diverse, multi-conditional tasks often suffers from task interference when using monolithic adapters like LoRA. The Mixture of Low-rank Experts (MoLE) architecture offers a modular solution, but its potential is usually limited by routing policies that operate at a token level. Such local routing can conflict with the global nature of user instructions, leading to artifacts like spatial fragmentation and semantic drift in complex image generation tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce InstructMoLE, a novel framework that employs an Instruction-Guided Mixture of Low-Rank Experts. Instead of per-token routing, InstructMoLE utilizes a global routing signal, Instruction-Guided Routing (IGR), derived from the user's comprehensive instruction. This ensures that a single, coherently chosen expert council is applied uniformly across all input tokens, preserving the global semantics and structural integrity of the generation process. To complement this, we introduce an output-space orthogonality loss, which promotes expert functional diversity and mitigates representational collapse. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstructMoLE significantly outperforms existing LoRA adapters and MoLE variants across challenging multi-conditional generation benchmarks. Our work presents a robust and generalizable framework for instruction-driven fine-tuning of generative models, enabling superior compositional control and fidelity to user intent.

Conclusion: ShinyNeRF successfully addresses the limitations of current NeRF methods in handling anisotropic reflections, advancing 3D digitization capabilities for cultural heritage preservation with both improved accuracy and material editing functionality.

Abstract: Recent advances in digitization technologies have transformed the preservation and dissemination of cultural heritage. In this vein, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have emerged as a leading technology for 3D digitization, delivering representations with exceptional realism. However, existing methods struggle to accurately model anisotropic specular surfaces, typically observed, for example, on brushed metals. In this work, we introduce ShinyNeRF, a novel framework capable of handling both isotropic and anisotropic reflections. Our method is capable of jointly estimating surface normals, tangents, specular concentration, and anisotropy magnitudes of an Anisotropic Spherical Gaussian (ASG) distribution, by learning an approximation of the outgoing radiance as an encoded mixture of isotropic von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions. Experimental results show that ShinyNeRF not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on digitizing anisotropic specular reflections, but also offers plausible physical interpretations and editing of material properties compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Cell detection in pathological images presents unique challenges due to densely packed objects, subtle inter-class differences, and severe background clutter. In this paper, we propose CellMamba, a lightweight and accurate one-stage detector tailored for fine-grained biomedical instance detection. Built upon a VSSD backbone, CellMamba integrates CellMamba Blocks, which couple either NC-Mamba or Multi-Head Self-Attention (MSA) with a novel Triple-Mapping Adaptive Coupling (TMAC) module. TMAC enhances spatial discriminability by splitting channels into two parallel branches, equipped with dual idiosyncratic and one consensus attention map, adaptively fused to preserve local sensitivity and global consistency. Furthermore, we design an Adaptive Mamba Head that fuses multi-scale features via learnable weights for robust detection under varying object sizes. Extensive experiments on two public datasets-CoNSeP and CytoDArk0-demonstrate that CellMamba outperforms both CNN-based, Transformer-based, and Mamba-based baselines in accuracy, while significantly reducing model size and inference latency.

Conclusion: Prior-AttUNet demonstrates excellent cross-device performance and efficiency, showing potential as a reliable automated clinical analysis tool.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of macular edema, a hallmark pathological feature in vision-threatening conditions such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema, is essential for clinical diagnosis and management. To overcome the challenges of segmenting fluid regions in optical coherence tomography (OCT) images-notably ambiguous boundaries and cross-device heterogeneity-this study introduces Prior-AttUNet, a segmentation model augmented with generative anatomical priors. The framework adopts a hybrid dual-path architecture that integrates a generative prior pathway with a segmentation network. A variational autoencoder supplies multi-scale normative anatomical priors, while the segmentation backbone incorporates densely connected blocks and spatial pyramid pooling modules to capture richer contextual information. Additionally, a novel triple-attention mechanism, guided by anatomical priors, dynamically modulates feature importance across decoding stages, substantially enhancing boundary delineation. Evaluated on the public RETOUCH benchmark, Prior-AttUNet achieves excellent performance across three OCT imaging devices (Cirrus, Spectralis, and Topcon), with mean Dice similarity coefficients of 93.93%, 95.18%, and 93.47%, respectively. The model maintains a low computational cost of 0.37 TFLOPs, striking an effective balance between segmentation precision and inference efficiency. These results demonstrate its potential as a reliable tool for automated clinical analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches often use simplified financial data and single-dimensional inputs, missing real-world complexity. The paper aims to leverage raw multivariate market data with CNN's image classification capabilities for better stock prediction.

Method: Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on multivariate raw market data including stock splits/dividend events. Treats historical data matrices as images (vector of historical data matrices) for classification to predict stock movements at individual, sector, or portfolio levels.

Result: The model achieves promising results in predicting stock movements using the CNN approach on raw multivariate data.

Conclusion: CNN can effectively process complex financial data by treating multivariate historical data as images, showing potential for improved stock movement prediction using raw market data rather than engineered features.

Abstract: This paper is about predicting the movement of stock consist of S&P 500 index. Historically there are many approaches have been tried using various methods to predict the stock movement and being used in the market currently for algorithm trading and alpha generating systems using traditional mathematical approaches [1, 2].
  The success of artificial neural network recently created a lot of interest and paved the way to enable prediction using cutting-edge research in the machine learning and deep learning. Some of these papers have done a great job in implementing and explaining benefits of these new technologies. Although most these papers do not go into the complexity of the financial data and mostly utilize single dimension data, still most of these papers were successful in creating the ground for future research in this comparatively new phenomenon. In this paper, I am trying to use multivariate raw data including stock split/dividend events (as-is) present in real-world market data instead of engineered financial data. Convolution Neural Network (CNN), the best-known tool so far for image classification, is used on the multi-dimensional stock numbers taken from the market mimicking them as a vector of historical data matrices (read images) and the model achieves promising results. The predictions can be made stock by stock, i.e., a single stock, sector-wise or for the portfolio of stocks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of generative AI models has created an urgent need for reliable detection of AI-generated images, as existing methods often fail to generalize across diverse generators, especially on high-fidelity images.

Method: FUSE combines spectral features from Fast Fourier Transform with semantic features from CLIP's Vision encoder, fuses them into a joint representation, and trains progressively in two stages for improved generalization.

Result: State-of-the-art results on Chameleon benchmark, 91.36% mean accuracy on GenImage, 88.71% accuracy across all tested generators, 94.96% mean Average Precision, with Stage 2 training further improving most generator performance.

Conclusion: Integrating spectral and semantic features enables robust, generalized detection of AI-generated images across diverse generators, outperforming existing methods that struggle with high-fidelity content.

Abstract: The fast evolution of generative models has heightened the demand for reliable detection of AI-generated images. To tackle this challenge, we introduce FUSE, a hybrid system that combines spectral features extracted through Fast Fourier Transform with semantic features obtained from the CLIP's Vision encoder. The features are fused into a joint representation and trained progressively in two stages. Evaluations on GenImage, WildFake, DiTFake, GPT-ImgEval and Chameleon datasets demonstrate strong generalization across multiple generators. Our FUSE (Stage 1) model demonstrates state-of-the-art results on the Chameleon benchmark. It also attains 91.36% mean accuracy on the GenImage dataset, 88.71% accuracy across all tested generators, and a mean Average Precision of 94.96%. Stage 2 training further improves performance for most generators. Unlike existing methods, which often perform poorly on high-fidelity images in Chameleon, our approach maintains robustness across diverse generators. These findings highlight the benefits of integrating spectral and semantic features for generalized detection of images generated by AI.

### [45] [Balancing Accuracy and Efficiency: CNN Fusion Models for Diabetic Retinopathy Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21861)
*Md Rafid Islam,Rafsan Jany,Akib Ahmed,Mohammad Ashrafuzzaman Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Feature-level fusion of CNN backbones (EfficientNet-B0 + DenseNet121) improves binary diabetic retinopathy screening accuracy on heterogeneous fundus images while maintaining practical inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diabetic retinopathy screening faces challenges due to limited specialist availability and variable image quality across different devices and populations, requiring accurate and efficient automated solutions.

Method: Used 11,156 fundus images from five public datasets, compared three pretrained CNN models (ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0, DenseNet121) against pairwise and tri-fusion variants for binary DR classification across five independent runs.

Result: Fusion consistently outperformed single backbones. EfficientNet-B0 + DenseNet121 fusion achieved best overall mean accuracy (82.89%) with balanced F1-scores (normal: 83.60%, diabetic: 82.60%). EfficientNet-B0 was fastest (1.16 ms/image), while fusion offered optimal accuracy-latency balance.

Conclusion: Lightweight feature fusion enhances generalization across heterogeneous datasets and supports scalable binary DR screening workflows where both accuracy and throughput are critical.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of preventable blindness, yet large-scale screening is constrained by limited specialist availability and variable image quality across devices and populations. This work investigates whether feature-level fusion of complementary convolutional neural network (CNN) backbones can deliver accurate and efficient binary DR screening on globally sourced fundus images. Using 11,156 images pooled from five public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, IDRiD, Messidor, and ODIR), we frame DR detection as a binary classification task and compare three pretrained models (ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0, and DenseNet121) against pairwise and tri-fusion variants. Across five independent runs, fusion consistently outperforms single backbones. The EfficientNet-B0 + DenseNet121 (Eff+Den) fusion model achieves the best overall mean performance (accuracy: 82.89\%) with balanced class-wise F1-scores for normal (83.60\%) and diabetic (82.60\%) cases. While the tri-fusion is competitive, it incurs a substantially higher computational cost. Inference profiling highlights a practical trade-off: EfficientNet-B0 is the fastest (approximately 1.16 ms/image at batch size 1000), whereas the Eff+Den fusion offers a favorable accuracy--latency balance. These findings indicate that lightweight feature fusion can enhance generalization across heterogeneous datasets, supporting scalable binary DR screening workflows where both accuracy and throughput are critical.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods have inflexible spatiotemporal representations (relying on positional encodings) and high computational costs from quadratic attention mechanisms, limiting their ability to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies in human motion.

Method: Proposes Spatiotemporal-Untrammelled Mixture of Experts (ST-MoE) with four distinct spatiotemporal experts to capture different spatial/temporal dependencies, using bidirectional spatiotemporal Mamba as experts for efficiency and parameter economy.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art in accuracy on four multi-person benchmark datasets while reducing model parameters by 41.38% and achieving 3.6x speedup in training.

Conclusion: ST-MoE effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by flexibly capturing complex spatio-temporal dependencies while significantly improving computational efficiency and parameter economy.

Abstract: Comprehensively and flexibly capturing the complex spatio-temporal dependencies of human motion is critical for multi-person motion prediction. Existing methods grapple with two primary limitations: i) Inflexible spatiotemporal representation due to reliance on positional encodings for capturing spatiotemporal information. ii) High computational costs stemming from the quadratic time complexity of conventional attention mechanisms. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Spatiotemporal-Untrammelled Mixture of Experts (ST-MoE), which flexibly explores complex spatio-temporal dependencies in human motion and significantly reduces computational cost. To adaptively mine complex spatio-temporal patterns from human motion, our model incorporates four distinct types of spatiotemporal experts, each specializing in capturing different spatial or temporal dependencies. To reduce the potential computational overhead while integrating multiple experts, we introduce bidirectional spatiotemporal Mamba as experts, each sharing bidirectional temporal and spatial Mamba in distinct combinations to achieve model efficiency and parameter economy. Extensive experiments on four multi-person benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-art in accuracy but also reduces model parameter by 41.38% and achieves a 3.6x speedup in training.

*Zhan Chen,Zile Guo,Enze Zhu,Peirong Zhang,Xiaoxuan Liu,Lei Wang,Yidan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAPTOR is a real-time high-resolution video prediction architecture that breaks the speed-quality-resolution trade-off using efficient factorized attention and achieves >30 FPS on edge hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video prediction faces a fundamental trilemma: high-resolution and perceptual quality come at the cost of real-time speed, which is critical for latency-sensitive applications like autonomous UAV navigation in dense urban environments where safety depends on foreseeing events from high-resolution imagery.

Method: RAPTOR uses a single-pass design to avoid iterative generation errors and latency. Its core innovation is Efficient Video Attention (EVA), a translator module that factorizes spatiotemporal modeling by alternating operations along spatial (S) and temporal (T) axes, reducing complexity from O((ST)²) to O(S+T). This enables global context modeling at 512²+ resolution with patch-free design. A 3-stage training curriculum progressively refines predictions from coarse structure to sharp details.

Result: RAPTOR is the first predictor to exceed 30 FPS on Jetson AGX Orin for 512² video, setting new SOTA on UAVid, KTH, and custom high-resolution datasets in PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. It boosts real-world UAV navigation mission success rate by 18%.

Conclusion: RAPTOR breaks the long-standing trade-off in video prediction, enabling real-time high-resolution performance on edge hardware, which paves the way for safer and more anticipatory embodied agents in latency-critical applications.

Abstract: Video prediction is plagued by a fundamental trilemma: achieving high-resolution and perceptual quality typically comes at the cost of real-time speed, hindering its use in latency-critical applications. This challenge is most acute for autonomous UAVs in dense urban environments, where foreseeing events from high-resolution imagery is non-negotiable for safety. Existing methods, reliant on iterative generation (diffusion, autoregressive models) or quadratic-complexity attention, fail to meet these stringent demands on edge hardware. To break this long-standing trade-off, we introduce RAPTOR, a video prediction architecture that achieves real-time, high-resolution performance. RAPTOR's single-pass design avoids the error accumulation and latency of iterative approaches. Its core innovation is Efficient Video Attention (EVA), a novel translator module that factorizes spatiotemporal modeling. Instead of processing flattened spacetime tokens with $O((ST)^2)$ or $O(ST)$ complexity, EVA alternates operations along the spatial (S) and temporal (T) axes. This factorization reduces the time complexity to $O(S + T)$ and memory complexity to $O(max(S, T))$, enabling global context modeling at $512^2$ resolution and beyond, operating directly on dense feature maps with a patch-free design. Complementing this architecture is a 3-stage training curriculum that progressively refines predictions from coarse structure to sharp, temporally coherent details. Experiments show RAPTOR is the first predictor to exceed 30 FPS on a Jetson AGX Orin for $512^2$ video, setting a new state-of-the-art on UAVid, KTH, and a custom high-resolution dataset in PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. Critically, RAPTOR boosts the mission success rate in a real-world UAV navigation task by 18/%, paving the way for safer and more anticipatory embodied agents.

TL;DR: AstraNav-World is an end-to-end world model that jointly predicts future visual states and action sequences in a unified probabilistic framework, improving embodied navigation by synchronizing vision and action planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied navigation in open, dynamic environments requires accurate foresight of world evolution and action sequences. Current approaches often use decoupled "envision-then-plan" pipelines that suffer from cumulative errors and lack tight coupling between visual predictions and action planning.

Method: Integrates diffusion-based video generator with vision-language policy in unified probabilistic framework. Uses synchronized rollouts where predicted scenes and planned actions update simultaneously. Training optimizes two complementary objectives: generating action-conditioned multi-step visual predictions and deriving trajectories conditioned on predicted visuals.

Result: Improved trajectory accuracy and higher success rates across diverse embodied navigation benchmarks. Ablations confirm necessity of tight vision-action coupling and unified training. Demonstrated exceptional zero-shot capabilities in real-world testing, adapting to unseen scenarios without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: AstraNav-World captures transferable spatial understanding and planning-relevant navigation dynamics rather than overfitting to simulation data. Unifying foresight vision and control within single generative model moves toward reliable, interpretable, general-purpose embodied agents for open-ended real-world settings.

Abstract: Embodied navigation in open, dynamic environments demands accurate foresight of how the world will evolve and how actions will unfold over time. We propose AstraNav-World, an end-to-end world model that jointly reasons about future visual states and action sequences within a unified probabilistic framework. Our framework integrates a diffusion-based video generator with a vision-language policy, enabling synchronized rollouts where predicted scenes and planned actions are updated simultaneously. Training optimizes two complementary objectives: generating action-conditioned multi-step visual predictions and deriving trajectories conditioned on those predicted visuals. This bidirectional constraint makes visual predictions executable and keeps decisions grounded in physically consistent, task-relevant futures, mitigating cumulative errors common in decoupled "envision-then-plan" pipelines. Experiments across diverse embodied navigation benchmarks show improved trajectory accuracy and higher success rates. Ablations confirm the necessity of tight vision-action coupling and unified training, with either branch removal degrading both prediction quality and policy reliability. In real-world testing, AstraNav-World demonstrated exceptional zero-shot capabilities, adapting to previously unseen scenarios without any real-world fine-tuning. These results suggest that AstraNav-World captures transferable spatial understanding and planning-relevant navigation dynamics, rather than merely overfitting to simulation-specific data distribution. Overall, by unifying foresight vision and control within a single generative model, we move closer to reliable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied agents that operate robustly in open-ended real-world settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel unsupervised brain lesion detection framework using disentangled representation and edge-to-image restoration to improve generalizability across multi-modality/multi-center MRIs and suppress abnormal residuals in reconstructed pseudo-healthy images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unsupervised anomaly detection methods for brain MRI have limited generalizability across different imaging modalities and centers due to reliance on specific imaging information in training data, and suffer from performance constraints due to abnormal residuals propagating to reconstructed pseudo-healthy images.

Method: Two novel modules: 1) Disentangled representation module that decouples brain MRI into imaging information and essential imaging-invariant anatomical images using brain anatomical priors and differentiable one-hot encoding; 2) Edge-to-image restoration module that reconstructs high-quality pseudo-healthy images by restoring anatomical representation from high-frequency edge information and recoupling imaging information.

Result: Outperforms 17 state-of-the-art methods on nine public datasets (4,443 patients' MRIs from multiple centers), achieving absolute improvements of +18.32% in AP (Average Precision) and +13.64% in DSC (Dice Similarity Coefficient).

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of current unsupervised methods by improving generalizability across diverse imaging conditions and suppressing abnormal residuals, leading to superior lesion detection performance in multi-modality, multi-center brain MRI analysis.

Abstract: Detection of various lesions in brain MRI is clinically critical, but challenging due to the diversity of lesions and variability in imaging conditions. Current unsupervised learning methods detect anomalies mainly through reconstructing abnormal images into pseudo-healthy images (PHIs) by normal samples learning and then analyzing differences between images. However, these unsupervised models face two significant limitations: restricted generalizability to multi-modality and multi-center MRIs due to their reliance on the specific imaging information in normal training data, and constrained performance due to abnormal residuals propagated from input images to reconstructed PHIs. To address these limitations, two novel modules are proposed, forming a new PHI reconstruction framework. Firstly, the disentangled representation module is proposed to improve generalizability by decoupling brain MRI into imaging information and essential imaging-invariant anatomical images, ensuring that the reconstruction focuses on the anatomy. Specifically, brain anatomical priors and a differentiable one-hot encoding operator are introduced to constrain the disentanglement results and enhance the disentanglement stability. Secondly, the edge-to-image restoration module is designed to reconstruct high-quality PHIs by restoring the anatomical representation from the high-frequency edge information of anatomical images, and then recoupling the disentangled imaging information. This module not only suppresses abnormal residuals in PHI by reducing abnormal pixels input through edge-only input, but also effectively reconstructs normal regions using the preserved structural details in the edges. Evaluated on nine public datasets (4,443 patients' MRIs from multiple centers), our method outperforms 17 SOTA methods, achieving absolute improvements of +18.32% in AP and +13.64% in DSC.

*Steven Xiao,XIndi Zhang,Dechao Meng,Qi Wang,Peng Zhang,Bang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Knot Forcing is a streaming framework for real-time portrait animation that addresses error accumulation and motion discontinuities in autoregressive models through chunk-wise generation with KV caching, temporal knot modules for smooth transitions, and a "running ahead" mechanism for long-term coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time portrait animation needs high visual fidelity, temporal coherence, ultra-low latency, and responsive control for interactive applications like virtual assistants. Diffusion models have quality but aren't causal for streaming, while autoregressive approaches suffer from error accumulation and motion discontinuities at chunk boundaries.

Method: Three key designs: (1) chunk-wise generation with global identity preservation via cached KV states of reference images and local temporal modeling with sliding window attention; (2) temporal knot module that overlaps adjacent chunks and propagates spatio-temporal cues via image-to-video conditioning; (3) "running ahead" mechanism that dynamically updates reference frame's temporal coordinate during inference to keep semantic context ahead of current rollout.

Result: Enables high-fidelity, temporally consistent, and interactive portrait animation over infinite sequences with real-time performance and strong visual stability on consumer-grade GPUs.

Conclusion: Knot Forcing addresses key challenges in streaming portrait animation by combining chunk-wise generation with mechanisms to ensure smooth transitions and long-term coherence, making it suitable for real-time interactive applications.

Abstract: Real-time portrait animation is essential for interactive applications such as virtual assistants and live avatars, requiring high visual fidelity, temporal coherence, ultra-low latency, and responsive control from dynamic inputs like reference images and driving signals. While diffusion-based models achieve strong quality, their non-causal nature hinders streaming deployment. Causal autoregressive video generation approaches enable efficient frame-by-frame generation but suffer from error accumulation, motion discontinuities at chunk boundaries, and degraded long-term consistency. In this work, we present a novel streaming framework named Knot Forcing for real-time portrait animation that addresses these challenges through three key designs: (1) a chunk-wise generation strategy with global identity preservation via cached KV states of the reference image and local temporal modeling using sliding window attention; (2) a temporal knot module that overlaps adjacent chunks and propagates spatio-temporal cues via image-to-video conditioning to smooth inter-chunk motion transitions; and (3) A "running ahead" mechanism that dynamically updates the reference frame's temporal coordinate during inference, keeping its semantic context ahead of the current rollout frame to support long-term coherence. Knot Forcing enables high-fidelity, temporally consistent, and interactive portrait animation over infinite sequences, achieving real-time performance with strong visual stability on consumer-grade GPUs.

TL;DR: LVLM-VA: A method using Large Vision Language Models to align small vision models with human domain knowledge, reducing reliance on spurious correlations without needing fine-grained feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small task-specific vision models often rely on spurious correlations rather than aligning with human domain knowledge, leading to brittle behavior in real-world deployment. Current explanation methods reveal this misalignment but don't solve it.

Method: LVLM-Aided Visual Alignment (LVLM-VA) creates a bidirectional interface using Large Vision Language Models to translate model behavior into natural language and map human class-level specifications to image-level critiques, enabling effective interaction between domain experts and models.

Result: The method demonstrates substantial improvement in aligning model behavior with human specifications on both synthetic and real-world datasets, effectively reducing dependence on spurious features and group-specific biases.

Conclusion: LVLM-VA provides an efficient way to align small vision models with human domain knowledge using LVLMs, addressing the brittleness problem without requiring fine-grained feedback from domain experts.

Abstract: In high-stakes domains, small task-specific vision models are crucial due to their low computational requirements and the availability of numerous methods to explain their results. However, these explanations often reveal that the models do not align well with human domain knowledge, relying instead on spurious correlations. This might result in brittle behavior once deployed in the real-world. To address this issue, we introduce a novel and efficient method for aligning small task-specific vision models with human domain knowledge by leveraging the generalization capabilities of a Large Vision Language Model (LVLM). Our LVLM-Aided Visual Alignment (LVLM-VA) method provides a bidirectional interface that translates model behavior into natural language and maps human class-level specifications to image-level critiques, enabling effective interaction between domain experts and the model. Our method demonstrates substantial improvement in aligning model behavior with human specifications, as validated on both synthetic and real-world datasets. We show that it effectively reduces the model's dependence on spurious features and on group-specific biases, without requiring fine-grained feedback.

TL;DR: SyncAnyone: A two-stage diffusion framework for high-quality AI video dubbing that achieves accurate lip-sync while preserving facial structure and background consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mask-based video dubbing methods disrupt spatiotemporal context, causing instability in facial structure and background consistency despite achieving lip-sync accuracy.

Method: Two-stage framework: Stage 1 trains diffusion-based video transformer for masked mouth inpainting; Stage 2 uses mask-free tuning with pseudo-paired training samples from synthesized lip-synced videos to eliminate mask-induced artifacts.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in visual quality, temporal coherence, and identity preservation in in-the-wild lip-syncing scenarios.

Conclusion: SyncAnyone overcomes limitations of mask-based approaches by combining accurate motion modeling with high visual fidelity through a novel two-stage learning framework.

Abstract: High-quality AI-powered video dubbing demands precise audio-lip synchronization, high-fidelity visual generation, and faithful preservation of identity and background. Most existing methods rely on a mask-based training strategy, where the mouth region is masked in talking-head videos, and the model learns to synthesize lip movements from corrupted inputs and target audios. While this facilitates lip-sync accuracy, it disrupts spatiotemporal context, impairing performance on dynamic facial motions and causing instability in facial structure and background consistency. To overcome this limitation, we propose SyncAnyone, a novel two-stage learning framework that achieves accurate motion modeling and high visual fidelity simultaneously. In Stage 1, we train a diffusion-based video transformer for masked mouth inpainting, leveraging its strong spatiotemporal modeling to generate accurate, audio-driven lip movements. However, due to input corruption, minor artifacts may arise in the surrounding facial regions and the background. In Stage 2, we develop a mask-free tuning pipeline to address mask-induced artifacts. Specifically, on the basis of the Stage 1 model, we develop a data generation pipeline that creates pseudo-paired training samples by synthesizing lip-synced videos from the source video and random sampled audio. We further tune the stage 2 model on this synthetic data, achieving precise lip editing and better background consistency. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results in visual quality, temporal coherence, and identity preservation under in-the wild lip-syncing scenarios.

TL;DR: LongFly is a spatiotemporal context modeling framework for UAV vision-and-language navigation that improves long-horizon navigation in complex disaster environments through structured historical data compression and trajectory encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UAV vision-and-language navigation methods struggle with long-horizon spatiotemporal context modeling in complex post-disaster environments, leading to inaccurate semantic alignment and unstable path planning.

Method: Proposes three modules: 1) Slot-based historical image compression to distill multi-view observations into fixed-length contextual representations, 2) Spatiotemporal trajectory encoding to capture temporal dynamics and spatial structure, and 3) Prompt-guided multimodal integration to combine spatiotemporal context with current observations for time-based reasoning.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art UAV VLN baselines by 7.89% in success rate and 6.33% in success weighted by path length, with consistent performance across both seen and unseen environments.

Conclusion: LongFly effectively addresses long-horizon spatiotemporal context modeling challenges in UAV VLN, providing more accurate semantic alignment and stable path planning for post-disaster search and rescue missions.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are crucial tools for post-disaster search and rescue, facing challenges such as high information density, rapid changes in viewpoint, and dynamic structures, especially in long-horizon navigation. However, current UAV vision-and-language navigation(VLN) methods struggle to model long-horizon spatiotemporal context in complex environments, resulting in inaccurate semantic alignment and unstable path planning. To this end, we propose LongFly, a spatiotemporal context modeling framework for long-horizon UAV VLN. LongFly proposes a history-aware spatiotemporal modeling strategy that transforms fragmented and redundant historical data into structured, compact, and expressive representations. First, we propose the slot-based historical image compression module, which dynamically distills multi-view historical observations into fixed-length contextual representations. Then, the spatiotemporal trajectory encoding module is introduced to capture the temporal dynamics and spatial structure of UAV trajectories. Finally, to integrate existing spatiotemporal context with current observations, we design the prompt-guided multimodal integration module to support time-based reasoning and robust waypoint prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that LongFly outperforms state-of-the-art UAV VLN baselines by 7.89\% in success rate and 6.33\% in success weighted by path length, consistently across both seen and unseen environments.

Motivation: Existing diffusion-based avatar methods are non-causal and computationally expensive for streaming, while current interactive approaches are limited to head-and-shoulder regions without full-body gestures.

Method: Two-stage autoregressive adaptation with autoregressive distillation and adversarial refinement, featuring Reference Sink, Reference-Anchored Positional Re-encoding (RAPR), and Consistency-Aware Discriminator for long-term stability.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in generation quality, real-time efficiency, and interaction naturalness, with one-shot interactive human avatar capable of natural talking/listening behaviors and coherent gestures.

Conclusion: Proposed framework successfully enables real-time streaming interactive avatars with full-body motion capabilities, overcoming limitations of existing diffusion-based and interactive approaches.

Abstract: Real-time, streaming interactive avatars represent a critical yet challenging goal in digital human research. Although diffusion-based human avatar generation methods achieve remarkable success, their non-causal architecture and high computational costs make them unsuitable for streaming. Moreover, existing interactive approaches are typically limited to head-and-shoulder region, limiting their ability to produce gestures and body motions. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage autoregressive adaptation and acceleration framework that applies autoregressive distillation and adversarial refinement to adapt a high-fidelity human video diffusion model for real-time, interactive streaming. To ensure long-term stability and consistency, we introduce three key components: a Reference Sink, a Reference-Anchored Positional Re-encoding (RAPR) strategy, and a Consistency-Aware Discriminator. Building on this framework, we develop a one-shot, interactive, human avatar model capable of generating both natural talking and listening behaviors with coherent gestures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing approaches in generation quality, real-time efficiency, and interaction naturalness.

*Evgeny Alves Limarenko,Anastasiia Studenikina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BertsWin: A hybrid SSL architecture combining BERT-style token masking with Swin Transformer windows for 3D medical imaging, achieving 5.8x faster semantic convergence and 15x reduction in training epochs while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Masked Autoencoders (MAE) struggle with 3D volumetric medical images due to difficulty capturing three-dimensional spatial relationships when discarding 75% of tokens, and ViTs face quadratic complexity issues in 3D.

Method: Hybrid architecture combining full BERT-style token masking with Swin Transformer windows, maintaining complete 3D token grid (masked and visible) to preserve spatial topology, using single-level local Swin windows to reduce complexity, plus structural priority loss function.

Result: 5.8x faster semantic convergence than standard ViT-MAE baselines; 15x reduction in training epochs (44 vs 660) to reach SOTA reconstruction fidelity; maintains FLOP parity with sparse ViT baselines at canonical resolutions; evaluated on TMJ segmentation from 3D CT scans.

Conclusion: BertsWin enables efficient SSL for 3D medical imaging by preserving complete spatial topology while avoiding computational penalties, achieving significant acceleration in convergence and training efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: The application of self-supervised learning (SSL) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) approaches demonstrates promising results in the field of 2D medical imaging, but the use of these methods on 3D volumetric images is fraught with difficulties. Standard Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which are state-of-the-art solution for 2D, have a hard time capturing three-dimensional spatial relationships, especially when 75% of tokens are discarded during pre-training. We propose BertsWin, a hybrid architecture combining full BERT-style token masking using Swin Transformer windows, to enhance spatial context learning in 3D during SSL pre-training. Unlike the classic MAE, which processes only visible areas, BertsWin introduces a complete 3D grid of tokens (masked and visible), preserving the spatial topology. And to smooth out the quadratic complexity of ViT, single-level local Swin windows are used. We introduce a structural priority loss function and evaluate the results of cone beam computed tomography of the temporomandibular joints. The subsequent assessment includes TMJ segmentation on 3D CT scans. We demonstrate that the BertsWin architecture, by maintaining a complete three-dimensional spatial topology, inherently accelerates semantic convergence by a factor of 5.8x compared to standard ViT-MAE baselines. Furthermore, when coupled with our proposed GradientConductor optimizer, the full BertsWin framework achieves a 15-fold reduction in training epochs (44 vs 660) required to reach state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity. Analysis reveals that BertsWin achieves this acceleration without the computational penalty typically associated with dense volumetric processing. At canonical input resolutions, the architecture maintains theoretical FLOP parity with sparse ViT baselines, resulting in a significant net reduction in total computational resources due to faster convergence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scene-VLM is a fine-tuned vision-language model for video scene segmentation that jointly processes visual and textual cues, generates sequential predictions with causal dependencies, and provides explainable rationales, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing encoder-based methods for video scene segmentation have visual-centric biases, process shots in isolation without considering sequential dependencies, lack narrative understanding, and provide no explainability for their decisions.

Method: Scene-VLM is a fine-tuned VLM framework that jointly processes visual frames, transcriptions, and optional metadata for multimodal reasoning. It uses sequential prediction with causal dependencies among shots, a context-focus window mechanism for temporal context, extracts confidence scores from token-level logits, and can generate natural-language rationales through minimal supervision.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard scene segmentation benchmarks. On MovieNet, Scene-VLM shows significant improvements of +6 AP and +13.7 F1 over previous leading methods.

Conclusion: Scene-VLM represents the first fine-tuned VLM approach for video scene segmentation, overcoming limitations of encoder-based methods by enabling multimodal reasoning, sequential dependencies, controllable precision-recall trade-offs, and explainable rationales while achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Segmenting long-form videos into semantically coherent scenes is a fundamental task in large-scale video understanding. Existing encoder-based methods are limited by visual-centric biases, classify each shot in isolation without leveraging sequential dependencies, and lack both narrative understanding and explainability. In this paper, we present Scene-VLM, the first fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM) framework for video scene segmentation. Scene-VLM jointly processes visual and textual cues including frames, transcriptions, and optional metadata to enable multimodal reasoning across consecutive shots. The model generates predictions sequentially with causal dependencies among shots and introduces a context-focus window mechanism to ensure sufficient temporal context for each shot-level decision. In addition, we propose a scheme to extract confidence scores from the token-level logits of the VLM, enabling controllable precision-recall trade-offs that were previously limited to encoder-based methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our model can be aligned to generate coherent natural-language rationales for its boundary decisions through minimal targeted supervision. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard scene segmentation benchmarks. On MovieNet, for example, Scene-VLM yields significant improvements of +6 AP and +13.7 F1 over the previous leading method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study diffusion posterior sampling for single-image super-resolution under known degradation models without retraining diffusion models for each operator, balancing diffusion priors with measurement consistency.

Method: Likelihood-guided sampling combining unconditional diffusion prior with gradient-based conditioning for measurement consistency, evaluated across guidance scales and noise levels for 4× super-resolution with additive Gaussian noise.

Result: Moderate guidance improves reconstruction quality with best configuration at PS scale 0.95 and noise σ=0.01 (score 1.45231), restoring sharper edges and coherent facial details compared to alternatives like MCG and PS-annealed.

Conclusion: Balancing diffusion priors and measurement-gradient strength is crucial for stable, high-quality reconstructions without retraining diffusion models for each operator, with PS conditioning showing optimal texture fidelity trade-offs.

Abstract: This report studies diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) for single-image super-resolution (SISR) under a known degradation model. We implement a likelihood-guided sampling procedure that combines an unconditional diffusion prior with gradient-based conditioning to enforce measurement consistency for $4\times$ super-resolution with additive Gaussian noise. We evaluate posterior sampling (PS) conditioning across guidance scales and noise levels, using PSNR and SSIM as fidelity metrics and a combined selection score $(\mathrm{PSNR}/40)+\mathrm{SSIM}$. Our ablation shows that moderate guidance improves reconstruction quality, with the best configuration achieved at PS scale $0.95$ and noise standard deviation $σ=0.01$ (score $1.45231$). Qualitative results confirm that the selected PS setting restores sharper edges and more coherent facial details compared to the downsampled inputs, while alternative conditioning strategies (e.g., MCG and PS-annealed) exhibit different texture fidelity trade-offs. These findings highlight the importance of balancing diffusion priors and measurement-gradient strength to obtain stable, high-quality reconstructions without retraining the diffusion model for each operator.

*Mengqi He,Xinyu Tian,Xin Shen,Jinhong Ni,Shu Zou,Zhaoyuan Yang,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Targeted attacks on high-entropy tokens in VLMs achieve strong attack success with minimal perturbations, revealing critical safety vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and while entropy correlates with reliability, prior attacks treat all tokens equally. The authors discovered that only about 20% of high-entropy tokens disproportionately control output trajectories, presenting a more efficient attack strategy.

Method: Proposed Entropy-bank Guided Adversarial attacks (EGA) that concentrate adversarial perturbations on critical decision points (high-entropy tokens) rather than all decoding steps, using smaller perturbation budgets.

Result: EGA achieves 93-95% attack success rates while converting 35-49% of benign outputs into harmful ones. The method shows transferability across diverse VLMs (17-26% harmful rates on unseen targets) and reveals recurring vulnerable high-entropy forks.

Conclusion: Selective attacks on critical high-entropy tokens expose fundamental safety weaknesses in current VLMs, demonstrating that small perturbation budgets focused on key decision points can effectively compromise model safety and reliability.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable performance but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Entropy, a measure of model uncertainty, is strongly correlated with the reliability of VLM. Prior entropy-based attacks maximize uncertainty at all decoding steps, implicitly assuming that every token contributes equally to generation instability. We show instead that a small fraction (about 20%) of high-entropy tokens, i.e., critical decision points in autoregressive generation, disproportionately governs output trajectories. By concentrating adversarial perturbations on these positions, we achieve semantic degradation comparable to global methods while using substantially smaller budgets. More importantly, across multiple representative VLMs, such selective attacks convert 35-49% of benign outputs into harmful ones, exposing a more critical safety risk. Remarkably, these vulnerable high-entropy forks recur across architecturally diverse VLMs, enabling feasible transferability (17-26% harmful rates on unseen targets). Motivated by these findings, we propose Entropy-bank Guided Adversarial attacks (EGA), which achieves competitive attack success rates (93-95%) alongside high harmful conversion, thereby revealing new weaknesses in current VLM safety mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable 3D spatiotemporal understanding in autonomous driving is challenging due to occlusions, limited viewpoints, and communication delays in V2X scenarios, requiring effective multi-view cooperative perception and multimodal fusion.

Method: Proposes XET-V2X with dual-layer spatial cross-attention based on multi-scale deformable attention: first aggregates multi-view image features for semantic consistency, then fuses point clouds guided by updated spatial queries for cross-modal interaction with reduced computation.

Result: Experiments on V2X-Seq-SPD, V2X-Sim-V2V, and V2X-Sim-V2I benchmarks show consistent improvements in detection and tracking performance under varying communication delays, with robust and temporally stable perception in complex traffic scenarios.

Conclusion: XET-V2X effectively addresses V2X perception challenges through unified multi-view multimodal fusion, demonstrating practical value for autonomous driving systems in real-world scenarios with communication constraints.

Abstract: Multi-view cooperative perception and multimodal fusion are essential for reliable 3D spatiotemporal understanding in autonomous driving, especially under occlusions, limited viewpoints, and communication delays in V2X scenarios. This paper proposes XET-V2X, a multi-modal fused end-to-end tracking framework for v2x collaboration that unifies multi-view multimodal sensing within a shared spatiotemporal representation. To efficiently align heterogeneous viewpoints and modalities, XET-V2X introduces a dual-layer spatial cross-attention module based on multi-scale deformable attention. Multi-view image features are first aggregated to enhance semantic consistency, followed by point cloud fusion guided by the updated spatial queries, enabling effective cross-modal interaction while reducing computational overhead. Experiments on the real-world V2X-Seq-SPD dataset and the simulated V2X-Sim-V2V and V2X-Sim-V2I benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in detection and tracking performance under varying communication delays. Both quantitative results and qualitative visualizations indicate that XET-V2X achieves robust and temporally stable perception in complex traffic scenarios.

TL;DR: SCL-PNC is a scalable class-incremental learning method that uses parametric neural collapse to enable demand-driven backbone expansion with dynamic ETF classifiers and knowledge distillation for feature alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing incremental learning methods freeze old model parameters but ignore structural efficiency issues, leading to feature differences between modules and class misalignment from evolving class distributions.

Method: Proposes SCL-PNC with: 1) adapt-layer for demand-driven minimal-cost backbone expansion, 2) dynamic parametric Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) classifier that evolves with incremental classes, 3) parallel expansion framework with knowledge distillation to align features across modules.

Result: Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method in handling increasing categories in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: SCL-PNC addresses class misalignment and feature consistency in incremental learning through dynamic ETF classifiers and knowledge distillation, leveraging neural collapse for structured model convergence.

Abstract: Incremental learning often encounter challenges such as overfitting to new data and catastrophic forgetting of old data. Existing methods can effectively extend the model for new tasks while freezing the parameters of the old model, but ignore the necessity of structural efficiency to lead to the feature difference between modules and the class misalignment due to evolving class distributions. To address these issues, we propose scalable class-incremental learning based on parametric neural collapse (SCL-PNC) that enables demand-driven, minimal-cost backbone expansion by adapt-layer and refines the static into a dynamic parametric Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) framework according to incremental class. This method can efficiently handle the model expansion question with the increasing number of categories in real-world scenarios. Additionally, to counteract feature drift in serial expansion models, the parallel expansion framework is presented with a knowledge distillation algorithm to align features across expansion modules. Therefore, SCL-PNC can not only design a dynamic and extensible ETF classifier to address class misalignment due to evolving class distributions, but also ensure feature consistency by an adapt-layer with knowledge distillation between extended modules. By leveraging neural collapse, SCL-PNC induces the convergence of the incremental expansion model through a structured combination of the expandable backbone, adapt-layer, and the parametric ETF classifier. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhangchuangxin71-cyber/dynamic_ ETF2.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RGB-T SOD methods rely on manually aligned datasets and struggle with real-world unaligned image pairs due to spatial misalignment, scale variations, and viewpoint shifts, causing performance deterioration.

Method: Dual-stream MobileViT encoder with Mamba scanning mechanisms, Semantic Correlation Constraint Module (SCCM) to constrain salient features, Thin-Plate Spline Alignment Module (TPSAM) for spatial alignment, and Cross-Modal Correlation Module (CMCM) for inter-modal dependency integration.

Result: Extensive experiments show TPS-SCL achieves state-of-the-art performance among lightweight SOD methods and outperforms mainstream RGB-T SOD approaches on various datasets.

Conclusion: TPS-SCL effectively addresses real-world unaligned RGB-T SOD challenges through efficient architecture design, semantic constraints, spatial alignment, and cross-modal correlation learning.

Abstract: Existing RGB-T salient object detection methods predominantly rely on manually aligned and annotated datasets, struggling to handle real-world scenarios with raw, unaligned RGB-T image pairs. In practical applications, due to significant cross-modal disparities such as spatial misalignment, scale variations, and viewpoint shifts, the performance of current methods drastically deteriorates on unaligned datasets. To address this issue, we propose an efficient RGB-T SOD method for real-world unaligned image pairs, termed Thin-Plate Spline-driven Semantic Correlation Learning Network (TPS-SCL). We employ a dual-stream MobileViT as the encoder, combined with efficient Mamba scanning mechanisms, to effectively model correlations between the two modalities while maintaining low parameter counts and computational overhead. To suppress interference from redundant background information during alignment, we design a Semantic Correlation Constraint Module (SCCM) to hierarchically constrain salient features. Furthermore, we introduce a Thin-Plate Spline Alignment Module (TPSAM) to mitigate spatial discrepancies between modalities. Additionally, a Cross-Modal Correlation Module (CMCM) is incorporated to fully explore and integrate inter-modal dependencies, enhancing detection performance. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that TPS-SCL attains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among existing lightweight SOD methods and outperforms mainstream RGB-T SOD approaches.

*Haodong Lei,Hongsong Wang,Xin Geng,Liang Wang,Pan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADT-Tree accelerates autoregressive image generation by dynamically adjusting draft tree structure based on spatial prediction difficulty, achieving 3x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive image models match diffusion quality but suffer from slow sequential inference (~2000 steps for 576x576). Existing speculative decoding methods from LLMs underperform on visual AR models due to spatially varying token prediction difficulty across image regions.

Method: Proposes Adjacency-Adaptive Dynamical Draft Trees (ADT-Tree) that dynamically adjusts draft tree depth and width using adjacent token states and prior acceptance rates. Initializes via horizontal adjacency, then refines depth/width through bisectional adaptation - creating deeper trees in simple regions and wider trees in complex ones.

Result: Achieves speedups of 3.13x on MS-COCO 2017 and 3.05x on PartiPrompts. Integrates seamlessly with relaxed sampling methods like LANTERN for further acceleration.

Conclusion: ADT-Tree effectively addresses the spatial prediction difficulty challenge in visual AR models, enabling significant inference acceleration while maintaining quality, with potential for further speedup through integration with existing sampling methods.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image models achieve diffusion-level quality but suffer from sequential inference, requiring approximately 2,000 steps for a 576x576 image. Speculative decoding with draft trees accelerates LLMs yet underperforms on visual AR models due to spatially varying token prediction difficulty. We identify a key obstacle in applying speculative decoding to visual AR models: inconsistent acceptance rates across draft trees due to varying prediction difficulties in different image regions. We propose Adjacency-Adaptive Dynamical Draft Trees (ADT-Tree), an adjacency-adaptive dynamic draft tree that dynamically adjusts draft tree depth and width by leveraging adjacent token states and prior acceptance rates. ADT-Tree initializes via horizontal adjacency, then refines depth/width via bisectional adaptation, yielding deeper trees in simple regions and wider trees in complex ones. The empirical evaluations on MS-COCO 2017 and PartiPrompts demonstrate that ADT-Tree achieves speedups of 3.13xand 3.05x, respectively. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly with relaxed sampling methods such as LANTERN, enabling further acceleration. Code is available at https://github.com/Haodong-Lei-Ray/ADT-Tree.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIOR is a training-free method that uses large vision-language models to generate conditional image embeddings by prompting them to describe images with single words related to given conditions, outperforming existing methods including CLIP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision foundation models like CLIP provide rich image representations but aren't designed to focus on specific conditional aspects (e.g., color, genre) indicated by textual conditions. There's a need for methods that can generate embeddings that specifically highlight condition-relevant features without requiring additional training.

Method: DIOR leverages large vision-language models (LVLMs) in a training-free approach: 1) Prompt the LVLM to describe an image with a single word related to a given condition, 2) Extract the hidden state vector of the LVLM's last token as the conditional image embedding. This works for any image and condition without task-specific priors.

Result: DIOR outperforms existing training-free baselines including CLIP on conditional image similarity tasks. It also achieves superior performance compared to methods that require additional training across multiple settings.

Conclusion: DIOR provides a versatile, training-free solution for generating conditional image embeddings that can focus on specific aspects of images as indicated by textual conditions, demonstrating strong performance across various settings without requiring additional training or task-specific priors.

Abstract: Conditional image embeddings are feature representations that focus on specific aspects of an image indicated by a given textual condition (e.g., color, genre), which has been a challenging problem. Although recent vision foundation models, such as CLIP, offer rich representations of images, they are not designed to focus on a specified condition. In this paper, we propose DIOR, a method that leverages a large vision-language model (LVLM) to generate conditional image embeddings. DIOR is a training-free approach that prompts the LVLM to describe an image with a single word related to a given condition. The hidden state vector of the LVLM's last token is then extracted as the conditional image embedding. DIOR provides a versatile solution that can be applied to any image and condition without additional training or task-specific priors. Comprehensive experimental results on conditional image similarity tasks demonstrate that DIOR outperforms existing training-free baselines, including CLIP. Furthermore, DIOR achieves superior performance compared to methods that require additional training across multiple settings.

*Yihan Hu,Xuelin Chen,Xiaodong Cun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EasyOmnimatte: A unified end-to-end video omnimatte method that finetunes a video inpainting diffusion model with dual experts - Effect Expert for foreground+effects and Quality Expert for alpha matte refinement - achieving SOTA results efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video omnimatte methods are slow, multi-stage, or use inference-time optimization that fails to fully leverage generative priors, producing suboptimal decompositions. The authors recognize that if a video inpainting model can be finetuned to remove foreground effects, it must inherently perceive them and could be adapted for foreground layer decomposition.

Method: Finetune a pretrained video inpainting diffusion model with dual complementary experts: 1) Effect Expert with LoRA applied only to effect-sensitive DiT blocks to capture foreground and associated effects, and 2) Quality Expert with full LoRA finetuning to refine alpha mattes. During sampling, Effect Expert handles early high-noise steps while Quality Expert takes over at later low-noise steps.

Result: EasyOmnimatte sets new state-of-the-art for video omnimatte, significantly outperforming baselines in both quality and efficiency. It enables various downstream tasks and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the Dual-Expert strategy.

Conclusion: The proposed EasyOmnimatte is the first unified, end-to-end video omnimatte method that effectively captures both foreground layers and associated effects through a dual-expert approach, eliminating the need for multiple diffusion passes while maintaining high quality and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Existing video omnimatte methods typically rely on slow, multi-stage, or inference-time optimization pipelines that fail to fully exploit powerful generative priors, producing suboptimal decompositions. Our key insight is that, if a video inpainting model can be finetuned to remove the foreground-associated effects, then it must be inherently capable of perceiving these effects, and hence can also be finetuned for the complementary task: foreground layer decomposition with associated effects. However, although naïvely finetuning the inpainting model with LoRA applied to all blocks can produce high-quality alpha mattes, it fails to capture associated effects. Our systematic analysis reveals this arises because effect-related cues are primarily encoded in specific DiT blocks and become suppressed when LoRA is applied across all blocks. To address this, we introduce EasyOmnimatte, the first unified, end-to-end video omnimatte method. Concretely, we finetune a pretrained video inpainting diffusion model to learn dual complementary experts while keeping its original weights intact: an Effect Expert, where LoRA is applied only to effect-sensitive DiT blocks to capture the coarse structure of the foreground and associated effects, and a fully LoRA-finetuned Quality Expert learns to refine the alpha matte. During sampling, Effect Expert is used for denoising at early, high-noise steps, while Quality Expert takes over at later, low-noise steps. This design eliminates the need for two full diffusion passes, significantly reducing computational cost without compromising output quality. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of this Dual-Expert strategy. Experiments demonstrate that EasyOmnimatte sets a new state-of-the-art for video omnimatte and enables various downstream tasks, significantly outperforming baselines in both quality and efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPAR introduces dynamic token aggregation for autoregressive image generation, reducing token count by 1.8-2x and FLOPs by up to 40% while improving FID by 27%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current decoder-only autoregressive image models use fixed tokenization where token count grows quadratically with resolution, increasing computational and memory costs for attention mechanisms.

Method: DPAR dynamically aggregates image tokens into variable-sized patches using next-token prediction entropy from a lightweight unsupervised autoregressive model as a merging criterion, with minimal architectural modifications.

Result: Reduces token count by 1.81x (Imagenet 256) and 2.06x (Imagenet 384), cuts FLOPs by up to 40% in training, shows faster convergence, and improves FID by up to 27.1% relative to baselines.

Conclusion: DPAR enables efficient autoregressive image generation through dynamic token aggregation based on information content, maintaining compatibility with multimodal frameworks while significantly reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Decoder-only autoregressive image generation typically relies on fixed-length tokenization schemes whose token counts grow quadratically with resolution, substantially increasing the computational and memory demands of attention. We present DPAR, a novel decoder-only autoregressive model that dynamically aggregates image tokens into a variable number of patches for efficient image generation. Our work is the first to demonstrate that next-token prediction entropy from a lightweight and unsupervised autoregressive model provides a reliable criterion for merging tokens into larger patches based on information content. DPAR makes minimal modifications to the standard decoder architecture, ensuring compatibility with multimodal generation frameworks and allocating more compute to generation of high-information image regions. Further, we demonstrate that training with dynamically sized patches yields representations that are robust to patch boundaries, allowing DPAR to scale to larger patch sizes at inference. DPAR reduces token count by 1.81x and 2.06x on Imagenet 256 and 384 generation resolution respectively, leading to a reduction of up to 40% FLOPs in training costs. Further, our method exhibits faster convergence and improves FID by up to 27.1% relative to baseline models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SLIM-Brain is a new fMRI foundation model that improves both data- and training-efficiency through a two-stage adaptive design with temporal saliency ranking and 4D hierarchical encoding, achieving SOTA performance with only 4k pre-training sessions and 30% GPU memory of traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fMRI foundation models face dual bottlenecks: atlas-based methods lose spatial details and need large cohorts, while atlas-free methods preserve spatial fidelity but are too memory/compute-intensive for large-scale pre-training.

Method: Two-stage adaptive design: (1) lightweight temporal extractor captures global context and ranks data windows by saliency, (2) 4D hierarchical encoder (Hiera-JEPA) learns voxel-level representations only from top-k selected windows while deleting ~70% masked patches.

Result: Establishes new state-of-the-art performance across seven public benchmarks while requiring only 4,000 pre-training sessions and approximately 30% of GPU memory compared to traditional voxel-level methods.

Conclusion: SLIM-Brain successfully addresses the data- and training-efficiency bottlenecks in fMRI foundation models, enabling effective atlas-free analysis with significantly reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Foundation models are emerging as a powerful paradigm for fMRI analysis, but current approaches face a dual bottleneck of data- and training-efficiency. Atlas-based methods aggregate voxel signals into fixed regions of interest, reducing data dimensionality but discarding fine-grained spatial details, and requiring extremely large cohorts to train effectively as general-purpose foundation models. Atlas-free methods, on the other hand, operate directly on voxel-level information - preserving spatial fidelity but are prohibitively memory- and compute-intensive, making large-scale pre-training infeasible. We introduce SLIM-Brain (Sample-efficient, Low-memory fMRI Foundation Model for Human Brain), a new atlas-free foundation model that simultaneously improves both data- and training-efficiency. SLIM-Brain adopts a two-stage adaptive design: (i) a lightweight temporal extractor captures global context across full sequences and ranks data windows by saliency, and (ii) a 4D hierarchical encoder (Hiera-JEPA) learns fine-grained voxel-level representations only from the top-$k$ selected windows, while deleting about 70% masked patches. Extensive experiments across seven public benchmarks show that SLIM-Brain establishes new state-of-the-art performance on diverse tasks, while requiring only 4 thousand pre-training sessions and approximately 30% of GPU memory comparing to traditional voxel-level methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional visual localization uses pair-wise pose regression with late-fusion strategies, which are insufficient for effective spatial integration and degrade in complex environments. There's a need for better multi-view spatial integration mechanisms.

Method: Built on VGGT backbone for multi-view 3D geometry encoding. Introduces pose tokenizer and projection module to exploit spatial relationships from multiple database views. Uses novel sparse mask attention strategy to reduce computational cost from quadratic to linear complexity, enabling real-time performance.

Result: Trained on ~8M posed image pairs, demonstrates strong accuracy and remarkable generalization. Extensive experiments across diverse public datasets validate effectiveness and efficiency, delivering high-quality camera pose estimates in real time with robustness to unseen environments.

Conclusion: Reloc-VGGT presents the first visual localization framework with early-fusion multi-view spatial integration, achieving robust performance in both structured and unstructured environments with real-time capability and strong generalization.

Abstract: Visual localization has traditionally been formulated as a pair-wise pose regression problem. Existing approaches mainly estimate relative poses between two images and employ a late-fusion strategy to obtain absolute pose estimates. However, the late motion average is often insufficient for effectively integrating spatial information, and its accuracy degrades in complex environments. In this paper, we present the first visual localization framework that performs multi-view spatial integration through an early-fusion mechanism, enabling robust operation in both structured and unstructured environments. Our framework is built upon the VGGT backbone, which encodes multi-view 3D geometry, and we introduce a pose tokenizer and projection module to more effectively exploit spatial relationships from multiple database views. Furthermore, we propose a novel sparse mask attention strategy that reduces computational cost by avoiding the quadratic complexity of global attention, thereby enabling real-time performance at scale. Trained on approximately eight million posed image pairs, Reloc-VGGT demonstrates strong accuracy and remarkable generalization ability. Extensive experiments across diverse public datasets consistently validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, delivering high-quality camera pose estimates in real time while maintaining robustness to unseen environments. Our code and models will be publicly released upon acceptance.https://github.com/dtc111111/Reloc-VGGT.

Conclusion: CrownGen offers a scalable solution to automate complex prosthetic modeling, potentially lowering costs, shortening turnaround times, and enhancing patient access to high-quality dental care.

Abstract: Digital crown design remains a labor-intensive bottleneck in restorative dentistry. We present \textbf{CrownGen}, a generative framework that automates patient-customized crown design using a denoising diffusion model on a novel tooth-level point cloud representation. The system employs two core components: a boundary prediction module to establish spatial priors and a diffusion-based generative module to synthesize high-fidelity morphology for multiple teeth in a single inference pass. We validated CrownGen through a quantitative benchmark on 496 external scans and a clinical study of 26 restoration cases. Results demonstrate that CrownGen surpasses state-of-the-art models in geometric fidelity and significantly reduces active design time. Clinical assessments by trained dentists confirmed that CrownGen-assisted crowns are statistically non-inferior in quality to those produced by expert technicians using manual workflows.

TL;DR: A DiT-based framework for high-fidelity, long-duration human animation with improved facial/hand details and arbitrary-length video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models struggle with long-duration video generation and lack fine-grained facial/hand details, limiting real-world high-quality applications.

Method: Proposes a DiT-based framework with: 1) hybrid implicit guidance signals + sharpness guidance for facial/hand details, 2) Position Shift Adaptive Module for arbitrary-length videos, 3) data augmentation + skeleton alignment to handle identity variations.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both high-fidelity and long-duration human image animation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations in long-duration video generation and fine-grained detail synthesis for human animation applications.

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion models has significantly advanced the field of human image animation. While existing methods can generate temporally consistent results for short or regular motions, significant challenges remain, particularly in generating long-duration videos. Furthermore, the synthesis of fine-grained facial and hand details remains under-explored, limiting the applicability of current approaches in real-world, high-quality applications. To address these limitations, we propose a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based framework which focuses on generating high-fidelity and long-duration human animation videos. First, we design a set of hybrid implicit guidance signals and a sharpness guidance factor, enabling our framework to additionally incorporate detailed facial and hand features as guidance. Next, we incorporate the time-aware position shift fusion module, modify the input format within the DiT backbone, and refer to this mechanism as the Position Shift Adaptive Module, which enables video generation of arbitrary length. Finally, we introduce a novel data augmentation strategy and a skeleton alignment model to reduce the impact of human shape variations across different identities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior performance in both high-fidelity and long-duration human image animation.

*Zeyu Liang,Hailun Xia,Naichuan Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAN is a human-centric graph representation learning framework for multimodal action recognition that fuses RGB and skeleton data by representing RGB patches containing human joints as spatiotemporal graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal methods for action recognition (RGB + skeleton) suffer from inherent heterogeneity between modalities and fail to fully exploit their complementary potential, needing better alignment and fusion strategies.

Method: Proposes PAN framework with human-centric graph modeling: token embeddings of RGB patches containing human joints are represented as spatiotemporal graphs. Includes attention-based post calibration to reduce dependency on high-quality skeletal data. Two variants: PAN-Ensemble (dual-path GCNs with late fusion) and PAN-Unified (unified graph representation learning in single network).

Result: Both PAN-Ensemble and PAN-Unified achieve state-of-the-art performance on three widely used multimodal action recognition datasets in their respective settings (separate and unified modeling).

Conclusion: Human-centric graph representation learning effectively addresses modality heterogeneity in multimodal action recognition, enabling more effective and semantically coherent fusion of RGB and skeleton features through graph-based alignment.

Abstract: While human action recognition has witnessed notable achievements, multimodal methods fusing RGB and skeleton modalities still suffer from their inherent heterogeneity and fail to fully exploit the complementary potential between them. In this paper, we propose PAN, the first human-centric graph representation learning framework for multimodal action recognition, in which token embeddings of RGB patches containing human joints are represented as spatiotemporal graphs. The human-centric graph modeling paradigm suppresses the redundancy in RGB frames and aligns well with skeleton-based methods, thus enabling a more effective and semantically coherent fusion of multimodal features. Since the sampling of token embeddings heavily relies on 2D skeletal data, we further propose attention-based post calibration to reduce the dependency on high-quality skeletal data at a minimal cost interms of model performance. To explore the potential of PAN in integrating with skeleton-based methods, we present two variants: PAN-Ensemble, which employs dual-path graph convolution networks followed by late fusion, and PAN-Unified, which performs unified graph representation learning within a single network. On three widely used multimodal action recognition datasets, both PAN-Ensemble and PAN-Unified achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in their respective settings of multimodal fusion: separate and unified modeling, respectively.

TL;DR: AutoPP is an automated pipeline for product poster generation and optimization that eliminates human intervention, achieving state-of-the-art results through unified design generation and CTR optimization using online feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manually crafting and optimizing product posters based on online performance is laborious and resource-consuming, creating a need for automated solutions.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Generator uses unified design module to integrate background, text, and layout, then element rendering module encodes these into condition tokens for controllable generation. 2) Optimizer enhances CTR by systematically replacing elements to gather fine-grained comparisons and uses Isolated Direct Preference Optimization (IDPO) to attribute CTR gains to isolated elements.

Result: AutoPP achieves state-of-the-art results in both offline and online settings, supported by AutoPP1M dataset containing one million high-quality posters and user feedback.

Conclusion: AutoPP provides an effective automated solution for product poster generation and optimization, eliminating human intervention while improving performance through data-driven optimization.

Abstract: Product posters blend striking visuals with informative text to highlight the product and capture customer attention. However, crafting appealing posters and manually optimizing them based on online performance is laborious and resource-consuming. To address this, we introduce AutoPP, an automated pipeline for product poster generation and optimization that eliminates the need for human intervention. Specifically, the generator, relying solely on basic product information, first uses a unified design module to integrate the three key elements of a poster (background, text, and layout) into a cohesive output. Then, an element rendering module encodes these elements into condition tokens, efficiently and controllably generating the product poster. Based on the generated poster, the optimizer enhances its Click-Through Rate (CTR) by leveraging online feedback. It systematically replaces elements to gather fine-grained CTR comparisons and utilizes Isolated Direct Preference Optimization (IDPO) to attribute CTR gains to isolated elements. Our work is supported by AutoPP1M, the largest dataset specifically designed for product poster generation and optimization, which contains one million high-quality posters and feedback collected from over one million users. Experiments demonstrate that AutoPP achieves state-of-the-art results in both offline and online settings. Our code and dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/JD-GenX/AutoPP

TL;DR: Proposes DRU framework for anime scenery low-light enhancement using data relativistic uncertainty to address illumination uncertainty in unpaired datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses domain gap in low-light enhancement for anime scenery images, which is underexplored compared to natural images/videos, and tackles data scarcity in this domain.

Method: Constructs unpaired anime scenery dataset, proposes Data Relativistic Uncertainty (DRU) framework inspired by Relativistic GAN, quantifies illumination uncertainty using wave-particle duality analogy, and dynamically adjusts objective functions to recalibrate learning under data uncertainty.

Result: DRU framework demonstrates superior perceptual and aesthetic qualities beyond state-of-the-art methods, showing effectiveness in anime scenery low-light enhancement by training EnlightenGAN variants.

Conclusion: Proposes novel data-centric learning paradigm using uncertainty information that can potentially extend to other visual and language domains, with code made available.

Abstract: By contrast with the prevailing works of low-light enhancement in natural images and videos, this study copes with the low-illumination quality degradation in anime scenery images to bridge the domain gap. For such an underexplored enhancement task, we first curate images from various sources and construct an unpaired anime scenery dataset with diverse environments and illumination conditions to address the data scarcity. To exploit the power of uncertainty information inherent with the diverse illumination conditions, we propose a Data Relativistic Uncertainty (DRU) framework, motivated by the idea from Relativistic GAN. By analogy with the wave-particle duality of light, our framework interpretably defines and quantifies the illumination uncertainty of dark/bright samples, which is leveraged to dynamically adjust the objective functions to recalibrate the model learning under data uncertainty. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DRU framework by training several versions of EnlightenGANs, yielding superior perceptual and aesthetic qualities beyond the state-of-the-art methods that are incapable of learning from data uncertainty perspective. We hope our framework can expose a novel paradigm of data-centric learning for potential visual and language domains. Code is available.

*Ali Lotfi,Adam Carter,Thuan Ha,Mohammad Meysami,Kwabena Nketia,Steve Shirtliffe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automated method finds compact spectral indices for vegetation classification by generating polynomial combinations of normalized band differences and selecting optimal subsets via feature selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate the discovery of compact, interpretable spectral indices for vegetation classification that maintain illumination invariance while capturing discriminative spectral interactions.

Method: Generate all pairwise normalized differences from spectral bands, build polynomial combinations up to degree 2, then apply feature selection methods (ANOVA filtering, recursive elimination, L1-regularized SVM) to select optimal compact index sets.

Result: For Kochia detection using Sentinel-2 imagery, a single degree-2 index (product of two red-edge normalized differences) achieved 96.26% accuracy, while 8 indices reached 97.70%. Selected features consistently involved degree-2 products from bands b4-b8.

Conclusion: The automated framework successfully discovers compact, interpretable spectral indices that capture discriminative spectral interactions, can be deployed in platforms like Google Earth Engine, and generalizes to other sensors and classification tasks.

Abstract: We introduce an automated way to find compact spectral indices for vegetation classification. The idea is to take all pairwise normalized differences from the spectral bands and then build polynomial combinations up to a fixed degree, which gives a structured search space that still keeps the illumination invariance needed in remote sensing. For a sensor with $n$ bands this produces $\binom{n}{2}$ base normalized differences, and the degree-2 polynomial expansion gives 1,080 candidate features for the 10-band Sentinel-2 configuration we use here. Feature selection methods (ANOVA filtering, recursive elimination, and $L_1$-regularized SVM) then pick out small sets of indices that reach the desired accuracy, so the final models stay simple and easy to interpret. We test the framework on Kochia (\textit{Bassia scoparia}) detection using Sentinel-2 imagery from Saskatchewan, Canada ($N = 2{,}318$ samples, 2022--2024). A single degree-2 index, the product of two normalized differences from the red-edge bands, already reaches 96.26\% accuracy, and using eight indices only raises this to 97.70\%. In every case the chosen features are degree-2 products built from bands $b_4$ through $b_8$, which suggests that the discriminative signal comes from spectral \emph{interactions} rather than individual band ratios. Because the indices involve only simple arithmetic, they can be deployed directly in platforms like Google Earth Engine. The same approach works for other sensors and classification tasks, and an open-source implementation (\texttt{ndindex}) is available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Medical MLLMs are vulnerable to real-world noise like imaging artifacts and text errors, limiting clinical use. This paper introduces a training-free framework (IMC) that enhances robustness by leveraging MLLMs' inherent denoising capabilities across both visual and textual modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical MLLMs show promise but are sensitive to real-world input perturbations (imaging artifacts, textual errors), which undermines clinical applicability. Current robustness studies focus on text modality and require fine-tuning, failing to address complex medical noise patterns and strict safety standards.

Method: Proposes Inherent-enhanced Multi-modal Calibration (IMC) framework with two components: 1) Perturbation-aware Denoising Calibration (PDC) for visual noise using MLLMs' vision encoder to identify patterns and perform prototype-guided feature calibration; 2) Self-instantiated Multi-agent System (SMS) for text denoising using MLLMs' self-assessment capabilities through cooperative agent hierarchy.

Result: Built benchmark with 11 noise types across image and text modalities on 2 datasets. Experimental results show state-of-the-art performance across multiple modalities, demonstrating potential to enhance MLLMs' robustness in real clinical scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free IMC framework effectively enhances medical MLLMs' robustness to real-world perturbations by leveraging their inherent denoising capabilities, addressing critical safety concerns for clinical deployment without requiring costly fine-tuning.

Abstract: Medical Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promising clinical performance. However, their sensitivity to real-world input perturbations, such as imaging artifacts and textual errors, critically undermines their clinical applicability. Systematic analysis of such noise impact on medical MLLMs remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, while several works have investigated the MLLMs' robustness in general domains, they primarily focus on text modality and rely on costly fine-tuning. They are inadequate to address the complex noise patterns and fulfill the strict safety standards in medicine. To bridge this gap, this work systematically analyzes the impact of various perturbations on medical MLLMs across both visual and textual modalities. Building on our findings, we introduce a training-free Inherent-enhanced Multi-modal Calibration (IMC) framework that leverages MLLMs' inherent denoising capabilities following the perceive-and-calibrate principle for cross-modal robustness enhancement. For the visual modality, we propose a Perturbation-aware Denoising Calibration (PDC) which leverages MLLMs' own vision encoder to identify noise patterns and perform prototype-guided feature calibration. For text denoising, we design a Self-instantiated Multi-agent System (SMS) that exploits the MLLMs' self-assessment capabilities to refine noisy text through a cooperative hierarchy of agents. We construct a benchmark containing 11 types of noise across both image and text modalities on 2 datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance across multiple modalities, showing potential to enhance MLLMs' robustness in real clinical scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lightweight multi-scale attention framework (LMSF-A) for real-time spinal endoscopy instance segmentation that balances accuracy and speed with only 1.8M parameters and 8.8 GFLOPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time instance segmentation in spinal endoscopy is challenging due to narrow field of view, specular highlights, smoke/bleeding, unclear boundaries, and large scale changes. Deployment is constrained by limited surgical hardware, requiring models that balance accuracy and speed while remaining stable under small-batch training.

Method: LMSF-A co-designs backbone, neck, and head: (1) Backbone uses C2f-Pro module combining RepViT-style re-parameterized convolution with efficient multi-scale attention; (2) Neck improves cross-scale consistency and boundary detail using Scale-Sequence Feature Fusion and Triple Feature Encoding; (3) Head adopts Lightweight Multi-task Shared Head with shared convolutions and GroupNorm for parameter reduction and batch-1 stability.

Result: Highly competitive or better than existing methods across all evaluation metrics, with only 1.8M parameters and 8.8 GFLOPs. Generalizes well to public teeth benchmark. Releases clinically reviewed PELD dataset (61 patients, 610 images) with instance masks for adipose tissue, bone, ligamentum flavum, and nerve.

Conclusion: LMSF-A provides an effective solution for real-time instance segmentation in spinal endoscopy, achieving excellent accuracy-speed balance with minimal computational requirements and good generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Real-time instance segmentation for spinal endoscopy is important for identifying and protecting critical anatomy during surgery, but it is difficult because of the narrow field of view, specular highlights, smoke/bleeding, unclear boundaries, and large scale changes. Deployment is also constrained by limited surgical hardware, so the model must balance accuracy and speed and remain stable under small-batch (even batch-1) training. We propose LMSF-A, a lightweight multi-scale attention framework co-designed across backbone, neck, and head. The backbone uses a C2f-Pro module that combines RepViT-style re-parameterized convolution (RVB) with efficient multi-scale attention (EMA), enabling multi-branch training while collapsing into a single fast path for inference. The neck improves cross-scale consistency and boundary detail using Scale-Sequence Feature Fusion (SSFF) and Triple Feature Encoding (TFE), which strengthens high-resolution features. The head adopts a Lightweight Multi-task Shared Head (LMSH) with shared convolutions and GroupNorm to reduce parameters and support batch-1 stability. We also release the clinically reviewed PELD dataset (61 patients, 610 images) with instance masks for adipose tissue, bone, ligamentum flavum, and nerve. Experiments show that LMSF-A is highly competitive (or even better than) in all evaluation metrics and much lighter than most instance segmentation methods requiring only 1.8M parameters and 8.8 GFLOPs, and it generalizes well to a public teeth benchmark.

TL;DR: ALEAHallu is an adversarial parametric editing framework that mitigates hallucinations in Vision-Language Models by identifying and fine-tuning hallucination-prone parameter clusters using adversarial optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs suffer from persistent hallucination issues due to over-reliance on linguistic priors and insufficient visual feature integration. Existing heuristic decoding calibration strategies are non-trainable and have limited optimization potential.

Method: Proposes an Activate-Locate-Edit Adversarially paradigm: 1) Construct activation dataset with grounded vs. hallucinatory responses, 2) Identify critical hallucination-prone parameter clusters via differential hidden state analysis, 3) Fine-tune clusters using adversarial prefixes optimized to maximize visual neglect, forcing visual evidence prioritization.

Result: Evaluations on both generative and discriminative VLM tasks demonstrate significant effectiveness in alleviating hallucinations.

Conclusion: ALEAHallu provides an effective adversarial parametric editing framework for hallucination mitigation in VLMs by forcing models to prioritize visual evidence over inherent parametric biases.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have garnered increasing attention in the AI community due to their promising practical applications, they exhibit persistent hallucination issues, generating outputs misaligned with visual inputs. Recent studies attribute these hallucinations to VLMs' over-reliance on linguistic priors and insufficient visual feature integration, proposing heuristic decoding calibration strategies to mitigate them. However, the non-trainable nature of these strategies inherently limits their optimization potential. To this end, we propose an adversarial parametric editing framework for Hallucination mitigation in VLMs, which follows an \textbf{A}ctivate-\textbf{L}ocate-\textbf{E}dit \textbf{A}dversarially paradigm. Specifically, we first construct an activation dataset that comprises grounded responses (positive samples attentively anchored in visual features) and hallucinatory responses (negative samples reflecting LLM prior bias and internal knowledge artifacts). Next, we identify critical hallucination-prone parameter clusters by analyzing differential hidden states of response pairs. Then, these clusters are fine-tuned using prompts injected with adversarial tuned prefixes that are optimized to maximize visual neglect, thereby forcing the model to prioritize visual evidence over inherent parametric biases. Evaluations on both generative and discriminative VLM tasks demonstrate the significant effectiveness of ALEAHallu in alleviating hallucinations.

TL;DR: iSHIFT is a lightweight 2.5B multimodal GUI agent that dynamically switches between slow (detailed visual grounding) and fast (global cues) reasoning modes using perception tokens to achieve both efficiency and precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle to balance efficiency for routine GUI tasks with precision for fine-grained interactions requiring exact visual grounding, and they lack adaptive reasoning depth while being computationally heavy.

Method: iSHIFT integrates latent thinking (implicit chain-of-thought) with a perception control module, using special perception tokens to guide attention to relevant screen regions and enabling dynamic switching between slow (detailed) and fast (global) reasoning modes.

Result: Despite its compact 2.5B size, iSHIFT matches state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets for GUI interaction tasks.

Conclusion: iSHIFT demonstrates that lightweight multimodal agents can achieve both efficiency and precision through adaptive reasoning modes and visual attention guidance, addressing key limitations in current GUI interaction approaches.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show strong potential for interpreting and interacting with complex, pixel-rich Graphical User Interface (GUI) environments. However, building agents that are both efficient for high-level tasks and precise for fine-grained interactions remains challenging. GUI agents must perform routine actions efficiently while also handling tasks that demand exact visual grounding, yet existing approaches struggle when accuracy depends on identifying specific interface elements. These MLLMs also remain large and cannot adapt their reasoning depth to the task at hand. In this work, we introduce iSHIFT: Implicit Slow-fast Hybrid Inference with Flexible Tokens, a lightweight agent that integrates latent thinking (implicit chain-of-thought) with a perception control module. iSHIFT enables an MLLM to switch between a slow mode, which leverages detailed visual grounding for high precision and a fast mode that uses global cues for efficiency. Special perception tokens guide attention to relevant screen regions, allowing the model to decide both how to reason and where to focus. Despite its compact 2.5B size, iSHIFT matches state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets.

Motivation: Existing deepfake detection methods struggle with generalization to unseen forgery patterns, suffering performance degradation in cross-domain settings despite strong intra-domain performance. Current approaches often rely on handcrafted forensic cues and complex architectures.

Method: GenDF transfers a large-scale vision model to deepfake detection with a compact design. It incorporates: 1) deepfake-specific representation learning to capture discriminative patterns, 2) feature space redistribution to mitigate distribution mismatch, and 3) classification-invariant feature augmentation to enhance generalization without extra parameters.

Result: GenDF achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance in cross-domain and cross-manipulation settings while requiring only 0.28M trainable parameters, demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed GenDF framework provides a simple yet effective solution for deepfake detection with strong generalization capabilities and minimal parameter overhead, addressing the critical need for robust detection methods against evolving AI-generated facial forgeries.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence has enabled the creation of highly realistic fake facial images, posing serious threats to personal privacy and the integrity of online information. Existing deepfake detection methods often rely on handcrafted forensic cues and complex architectures, achieving strong performance in intra-domain settings but suffering significant degradation when confronted with unseen forgery patterns. In this paper, we propose GenDF, a simple yet effective framework that transfers a powerful large-scale vision model to the deepfake detection task with a compact and neat network design. GenDF incorporates deepfake-specific representation learning to capture discriminative patterns between real and fake facial images, feature space redistribution to mitigate distribution mismatch, and a classification-invariant feature augmentation strategy to enhance generalization without introducing additional trainable parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GenDF achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance in cross-domain and cross-manipulation settings while requiring only 0.28M trainable parameters, validating the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BadVSFM is the first backdoor attack framework specifically designed for prompt-driven video segmentation foundation models, achieving high attack success while maintaining clean performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt-driven Video Segmentation Foundation Models (VSFMs) are widely deployed in safety-critical applications, but classic backdoor attacks are ineffective against them (ASR < 5%). The authors investigate why and develop a specialized attack framework.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) Steer image encoder so triggered frames map to target embedding while clean frames align with reference encoder; (2) Train mask decoder so triggered frame-prompt pairs produce shared target mask across prompt types while clean outputs stay close to reference decoder.

Result: BadVSFM achieves strong, controllable backdoor effects under diverse triggers and prompts while preserving clean segmentation quality. Extensive experiments on 2 datasets and 5 VSFMs show robustness, and defenses remain largely ineffective.

Conclusion: BadVSFM reveals an underexplored vulnerability in current VSFMs, successfully separating triggered and clean representations while shifting attention to trigger regions, demonstrating the need for specialized security considerations for these models.

Abstract: Prompt-driven Video Segmentation Foundation Models (VSFMs) such as SAM2 are increasingly deployed in applications like autonomous driving and digital pathology, raising concerns about backdoor threats. Surprisingly, we find that directly transferring classic backdoor attacks (e.g., BadNet) to VSFMs is almost ineffective, with ASR below 5\%. To understand this, we study encoder gradients and attention maps and observe that conventional training keeps gradients for clean and triggered samples largely aligned, while attention still focuses on the true object, preventing the encoder from learning a distinct trigger-related representation. To address this challenge, we propose BadVSFM, the first backdoor framework tailored to prompt-driven VSFMs. BadVSFM uses a two-stage strategy: (1) steer the image encoder so triggered frames map to a designated target embedding while clean frames remain aligned with a clean reference encoder; (2) train the mask decoder so that, across prompt types, triggered frame-prompt pairs produce a shared target mask, while clean outputs stay close to a reference decoder. Extensive experiments on two datasets and five VSFMs show that BadVSFM achieves strong, controllable backdoor effects under diverse triggers and prompts while preserving clean segmentation quality. Ablations over losses, stages, targets, trigger settings, and poisoning rates demonstrate robustness to reasonable hyperparameter changes and confirm the necessity of the two-stage design. Finally, gradient-conflict analysis and attention visualizations show that BadVSFM separates triggered and clean representations and shifts attention to trigger regions, while four representative defenses remain largely ineffective, revealing an underexplored vulnerability in current VSFMs.

TL;DR: MAI-UI is a family of foundation GUI agents that addresses key deployment challenges through self-evolving data, device-cloud collaboration, and online RL, achieving SOTA results on GUI grounding and mobile navigation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI agents could revolutionize human-computer interaction, but face four key deployment challenges: lack of native agent-user interaction, limits of UI-only operation, absence of practical deployment architecture, and brittleness in dynamic environments.

Method: Unified methodology with: 1) self-evolving data pipeline expanding navigation data to include user interaction and MCP tool calls, 2) native device-cloud collaboration system routing execution by task state, and 3) online RL framework with advanced optimizations for scaling parallel environments and context length.

Online RL scaling shows +5.2 points from 32 to 512 parallel environments and +4.3 points from 15 to 50 environment steps. Device-cloud collaboration improves on-device performance by 33% and reduces cloud calls by over 40%.

Conclusion: MAI-UI successfully addresses key GUI agent deployment challenges through its unified methodology, establishing new SOTA performance while demonstrating practical benefits through device-cloud collaboration and scalable online RL optimization.

Abstract: The development of GUI agents could revolutionize the next generation of human-computer interaction. Motivated by this vision, we present MAI-UI, a family of foundation GUI agents spanning the full spectrum of sizes, including 2B, 8B, 32B, and 235B-A22B variants. We identify four key challenges to realistic deployment: the lack of native agent-user interaction, the limits of UI-only operation, the absence of a practical deployment architecture, and brittleness in dynamic environments. MAI-UI addresses these issues with a unified methodology: a self-evolving data pipeline that expands the navigation data to include user interaction and MCP tool calls, a native device-cloud collaboration system routes execution by task state, and an online RL framework with advanced optimizations to scale parallel environments and context length. MAI-UI establishes new state-of-the-art across GUI grounding and mobile navigation. On grounding benchmarks, it reaches 73.5% on ScreenSpot-Pro, 91.3% on MMBench GUI L2, 70.9% on OSWorld-G, and 49.2% on UI-Vision, surpassing Gemini-3-Pro and Seed1.8 on ScreenSpot-Pro. On mobile GUI navigation, it sets a new SOTA of 76.7% on AndroidWorld, surpassing UI-Tars-2, Gemini-2.5-Pro and Seed1.8. On MobileWorld, MAI-UI obtains 41.7% success rate, significantly outperforming end-to-end GUI models and competitive with Gemini-3-Pro based agentic frameworks. Our online RL experiments show significant gains from scaling parallel environments from 32 to 512 (+5.2 points) and increasing environment step budget from 15 to 50 (+4.3 points). Finally, the native device-cloud collaboration system improves on-device performance by 33%, reduces cloud model calls by over 40%, and preserves user privacy.

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework called \method generates interactive, continuous worlds from single images or text prompts with real-time keyboard exploration, addressing parameter size, inference speed, and text control limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models for interactive world generation face challenges: large parameter sizes, slow inference requiring many steps, growing historical context issues, and lack of text-controlled generation capabilities, limiting real-time performance.

Method: Three-component framework: 1) Long-video generation with unified context compression and linear attention; 2) Real-time streaming acceleration via bidirectional attention distillation and enhanced text embedding; 3) Text-controlled method for generating world events.

Result: The method generates realistic, interactive, continuous worlds from single images or text prompts with keyboard-based exploration, addressing previous limitations in parameter efficiency, inference speed, and text control.

Conclusion: \method provides a novel solution for generating explorable worlds with real-time performance and text control, overcoming key challenges in diffusion-based world generation through its three-component framework.

Abstract: Recent approaches have demonstrated the promise of using diffusion models to generate interactive and explorable worlds. However, most of these methods face critical challenges such as excessively large parameter sizes, reliance on lengthy inference steps, and rapidly growing historical context, which severely limit real-time performance and lack text-controlled generation capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose \method, a novel framework designed to generate realistic, interactive, and continuous worlds from a single image or text prompt. \method achieves this through a carefully designed framework that supports keyboard-based exploration of the generated worlds. The framework comprises three core components: (1) a long-video generation framework integrating unified context compression with linear attention; (2) a real-time streaming acceleration strategy powered by bidirectional attention distillation and an enhanced text embedding scheme; (3) a text-controlled method for generating world events. We have provided the codebase in the supplementary material.

### [83] [Learning Association via Track-Detection Matching for Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22105)
*Momir Adžemović*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TDLP is a tracking-by-detection method that uses link prediction between tracks and detections for per-frame association, learning from data without handcrafted rules while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tracking methods face a trade-off: tracking-by-detection methods are efficient but rely on handcrafted association heuristics, while end-to-end methods learn association from data but are computationally complex. There's a need for a method that learns association directly from data while remaining efficient.

Method: Track-Detection Link Prediction (TDLP) performs per-frame association via link prediction between tracks and detections. It predicts the correct continuation of each track at every frame, primarily using geometric features like bounding boxes, with optional incorporation of additional cues like pose and appearance.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show TDLP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance across both tracking-by-detection and end-to-end methods. Analysis shows link prediction is more effective than metric learning-based association, especially for heterogeneous features like detection bounding boxes.

Conclusion: TDLP successfully bridges the gap between heuristic-based tracking-by-detection and end-to-end methods by learning association from data while maintaining modularity and computational efficiency, with link prediction proving superior to metric learning for track-detection association.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking aims to maintain object identities over time by associating detections across video frames. Two dominant paradigms exist in literature: tracking-by-detection methods, which are computationally efficient but rely on handcrafted association heuristics, and end-to-end approaches, which learn association from data at the cost of higher computational complexity. We propose Track-Detection Link Prediction (TDLP), a tracking-by-detection method that performs per-frame association via link prediction between tracks and detections, i.e., by predicting the correct continuation of each track at every frame. TDLP is architecturally designed primarily for geometric features such as bounding boxes, while optionally incorporating additional cues, including pose and appearance. Unlike heuristic-based methods, TDLP learns association directly from data without handcrafted rules, while remaining modular and computationally efficient compared to end-to-end trackers. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TDLP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance across both tracking-by-detection and end-to-end methods. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis comparing link prediction with metric learning-based association and show that link prediction is more effective, particularly when handling heterogeneous features such as detection bounding boxes.

*Zhi Ouyang,Dian Zheng,Xiao-Ming Wu,Jian-Jian Jiang,Kun-Yu Lin,Jingke Meng,Wei-Shi Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProEdit improves inversion-based visual editing by addressing over-reliance on source information through KV-mix attention mechanism and Latents-Shift perturbation, achieving better attribute editing while maintaining consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inversion-based editing methods overly rely on source image information during sampling, which negatively affects target image edits - often failing to properly change subject attributes like pose, number, or color as instructed.

Method: Two key innovations: 1) KV-mix in attention aspect - mixes KV features of source and target in edited regions to mitigate source influence while maintaining background consistency; 2) Latents-Shift in latent aspect - perturbs edited region of source latent to eliminate inverted latent's influence on sampling.

Result: Extensive experiments on several image and video editing benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. The method is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into existing inversion and editing methods like RF-Solver, FireFlow and UniEdit.

Conclusion: ProEdit effectively addresses the over-reliance problem in inversion-based editing through attention and latent modifications, enabling better attribute editing while maintaining consistency, with broad applicability to existing methods.

Abstract: Inversion-based visual editing provides an effective and training-free way to edit an image or a video based on user instructions. Existing methods typically inject source image information during the sampling process to maintain editing consistency. However, this sampling strategy overly relies on source information, which negatively affects the edits in the target image (e.g., failing to change the subject's atributes like pose, number, or color as instructed). In this work, we propose ProEdit to address this issue both in the attention and the latent aspects. In the attention aspect, we introduce KV-mix, which mixes KV features of the source and the target in the edited region, mitigating the influence of the source image on the editing region while maintaining background consistency. In the latent aspect, we propose Latents-Shift, which perturbs the edited region of the source latent, eliminating the influence of the inverted latent on the sampling. Extensive experiments on several image and video editing benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA performance. In addition, our design is plug-and-play, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing inversion and editing methods, such as RF-Solver, FireFlow and UniEdit.

*Shuoshuo Zhang,Yizhen Zhang,Jingjing Fu,Lei Song,Jiang Bian,Yujiu Yang,Rui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bi-directional Perceptual Shaping (BiPS) improves vision-language models by using bidirectional where-to-look signals to shape perception during training, boosting performance by 8.2% on average across eight benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models often miss fine-grained visual evidence, generalize poorly across domains, and have high inference costs. Existing methods using intermediate visual cues overlook detailed visual evidence like polylines in charts.

Method: BiPS transforms question-conditioned masked views into bidirectional where-to-look signals. It uses two constraints: 1) KL-consistency between original image and evidence-preserving view (keeping only question-relevant regions) for coarse coverage, and 2) KL-separation between original and evidence-ablated view (masking critical pixels) to prevent text-only shortcuts and enforce visual reliance.

Result: BiPS boosts Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 8.2% on average across eight benchmarks and shows strong out-of-domain generalization to unseen datasets and image types.

Conclusion: BiPS effectively shapes visual perception in VLMs through bidirectional constraints, improving performance and generalization while addressing limitations of existing visual cue mechanisms.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) often benefit from intermediate visual cues, either injected via external tools or generated as latent visual tokens during reasoning, but these mechanisms still overlook fine-grained visual evidence (e.g., polylines in charts), generalize poorly across domains, and incur high inference-time cost. In this paper, we propose Bi-directional Perceptual Shaping (BiPS), which transforms question-conditioned masked views into bidirectional where-to-look signals that shape perception during training. BiPS first applies a KL-consistency constraint between the original image and an evidence-preserving view that keeps only question-relevant regions, encouraging coarse but complete coverage of supporting pixels. It then applies a KL-separation constraint between the original and an evidence-ablated view where critical pixels are masked so the image no longer supports the original answer, discouraging text-only shortcuts (i.e., answering from text alone) and enforcing fine-grained visual reliance. Across eight benchmarks, BiPS boosts Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 8.2% on average and shows strong out-of-domain generalization to unseen datasets and image types.

*Yuanshuang Fu,Qianyao Wang,Qihao Wang,Bonan Zhang,Jiaxin Zhao,Yiming Cao,Zhijun Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Active path planning method for UAV water quality monitoring that avoids dynamic light/shadow disturbances using 3D virtual obstacles, improved IFDS algorithm, MPC optimization, and dynamic altitude adjustment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic illumination conditions (shadows, sun glint) in UAV spectral remote sensing cause severe spectral distortion, reducing data availability for water quality monitoring. Need to maximize high-quality data acquisition while ensuring flight safety.

Method: 1) Dynamic prediction model transforms time-varying light/shadow disturbance areas into 3D virtual obstacles; 2) Improved IFDS algorithm generates smooth initial obstacle avoidance paths using repulsive force fields; 3) MPC framework for rolling-horizon path optimization with flight dynamics constraints; 4) Dynamic Flight Altitude Adjustment mechanism to lower altitude when observable area is narrow for better spatial resolution.

Result: Achieves 98% obstacle avoidance success rate in densely disturbed scenarios, significantly improves path smoothness, and increases effective observation data volume by approximately 27% compared to traditional PID and single obstacle avoidance algorithms.

Conclusion: Proposed method provides effective engineering solution for precise UAV water quality monitoring in complex illumination environments, balancing data quality and flight safety through active disturbance avoidance and adaptive planning.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) spectral remote sensing technology is widely used in water quality monitoring. However, in dynamic environments, varying illumination conditions, such as shadows and specular reflection (sun glint), can cause severe spectral distortion, thereby reducing data availability. To maximize the acquisition of high-quality data while ensuring flight safety, this paper proposes an active path planning method for dynamic light and shadow disturbance avoidance. First, a dynamic prediction model is constructed to transform the time-varying light and shadow disturbance areas into three-dimensional virtual obstacles. Second, an improved Interfered Fluid Dynamical System (IFDS) algorithm is introduced, which generates a smooth initial obstacle avoidance path by building a repulsive force field. Subsequently, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework is employed for rolling-horizon path optimization to handle flight dynamics constraints and achieve real-time trajectory tracking. Furthermore, a Dynamic Flight Altitude Adjustment (DFAA) mechanism is designed to actively reduce the flight altitude when the observable area is narrow, thereby enhancing spatial resolution. Simulation results show that, compared with traditional PID and single obstacle avoidance algorithms, the proposed method achieves an obstacle avoidance success rate of 98% in densely disturbed scenarios, significantly improves path smoothness, and increases the volume of effective observation data by approximately 27%. This research provides an effective engineering solution for precise UAV water quality monitoring in complex illumination environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots face a trade-off between safety and speed in cluttered environments due to uncertainty from occlusions and limited sensor range. The paper investigates whether co-pilot instructions can help robots plan more decisively while maintaining safety.

Method: Introduces PaceForecaster, which takes the robot's local sensor footprint (Level-1) and co-pilot instructions as input, and predicts: (1) a forecasted map with all regions visible from Level-1 (Level-2), and (2) an instruction-conditioned subgoal within Level-2. This provides explicit guidance to exploit forecasted environments in a goal-directed manner.

Result: Integration with a Log-MPPI controller demonstrates that using language-conditioned forecasts and goals improves navigation performance by 36% over a local-map-only baseline in polygonal environments.

Conclusion: Co-pilot instructions combined with predictive mapping can significantly enhance robot navigation performance in cluttered environments by enabling more decisive planning while maintaining safety through better environmental forecasting.

Abstract: In cluttered environments, motion planners often face a trade-off between safety and speed due to uncertainty caused by occlusions and limited sensor range. In this work, we investigate whether co-pilot instructions can help robots plan more decisively while remaining safe. We introduce PaceForecaster, as an approach that incorporates such co-pilot instructions into local planners. PaceForecaster takes the robot's local sensor footprint (Level-1) and the provided co-pilot instructions as input and predicts (i) a forecasted map with all regions visible from Level-1 (Level-2) and (ii) an instruction-conditioned subgoal within Level-2. The subgoal provides the planner with explicit guidance to exploit the forecasted environment in a goal-directed manner. We integrate PaceForecaster with a Log-MPPI controller and demonstrate that using language-conditioned forecasts and goals improves navigation performance by 36% over a local-map-only baseline while in polygonal environments.

*Hang Zhou,Yuhui Zhai,Shiyu Shen,Yanfeng Ouyang,Xiaowei Shi,Xiaopeng*

TL;DR: First study to derive Urban Air Mobility fundamental diagrams using real-world physical test data, showing classical ground traffic flow models apply to UAM systems but with deviations between simulation and experimental results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban Air Mobility faces potential congestion as drone density increases, but fundamental characteristics of UAM traffic flow under real-world conditions remain poorly understood, creating a need for empirical validation.

Method: Integrated theoretical analysis with physical experiments: designed drone control laws for collision avoidance, developed simulation-based traffic generation, applied traffic flow theory using Edie's definition, and conducted physical experiments on reduced-scale testbed with Crazyflie drones.

Result: Created UAMTra2Flow dataset; found classical fundamental diagram structures applicable to UAM systems; physical experiments showed deviations from simulation results, highlighting importance of experimental validation; results scaled to realistic operating conditions.

Conclusion: Experimental validation is crucial for UAM traffic modeling as real-world disturbances cause deviations from simulation predictions; the framework and dataset provide practical insights for future UAM traffic system design.

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is an emerging application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that promises to reduce travel time and alleviate congestion in urban transportation systems. As drone density increases, UAM operations are expected to experience congestion similar to that in ground traffic. However, the fundamental characteristics of UAM traffic flow, particularly under real-world operating conditions, remain poorly understood. This study proposes a general framework for constructing the fundamental diagram (FD) of UAM traffic by integrating theoretical analysis with physical experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to derive a UAM FD using real-world physical test data. On the theoretical side, we design two drone control laws for collision avoidance and develop simulation-based traffic generation methods to produce diverse UAM traffic scenarios. Based on Edie's definition, traffic flow theory is then applied to construct the FD and characterize the macroscopic properties of UAM traffic. To account for real-world disturbances and modeling uncertainties, we further conduct physical experiments on a reduced-scale testbed using Bitcraze Crazyflie drones. Both simulation and physical test trajectory data are collected and organized into the UAMTra2Flow dataset, which is analyzed using the proposed framework. Preliminary results indicate that classical FD structures for ground transportation are also applicable to UAM systems. Notably, FD curves obtained from physical experiments exhibit deviations from simulation-based results, highlighting the importance of experimental validation. Finally, results from the reduced-scale testbed are scaled to realistic operating conditions to provide practical insights for future UAM traffic systems. The dataset and code for this paper are publicly available at https://github.com/CATS-Lab/UAM-FD.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: EVE: A modular generator-verifier framework that boosts pretrained generative policies at test time using zero-shot VLM-based verifiers without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative policies (diffusion/flow-based) degrade under distribution shifts and lack recovery capabilities without costly finetuning. Inspired by test-time compute scaling in LLMs, the authors hypothesize that generative policies can benefit from additional inference-time compute using zero-shot VLM-based verifiers.

Method: EVE wraps frozen base policies with multiple zero-shot VLM-based verifier agents. Verifiers propose action refinements to base policy candidates, and an action incorporator fuses aggregated verifier outputs into final executed actions. Studies design choices for generator-verifier information interfacing across verifiers with distinct capabilities.

Result: Across diverse manipulation tasks, EVE consistently improves task success rates without additional policy training. Extensive ablations isolate contributions of verifier capabilities and action incorporator strategies.

Conclusion: EVE demonstrates that generative policies can benefit from test-time compute scaling via zero-shot VLM verifiers, offering practical guidelines for building scalable, modular generator-verifier systems for embodied control.

Abstract: Visuomotor policies based on generative architectures such as diffusion and flow-based matching have shown strong performance but degrade under distribution shifts, demonstrating limited recovery capabilities without costly finetuning. In the language modeling domain, test-time compute scaling has revolutionized reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs by leveraging additional inference-time compute for candidate solution refinement. These methods typically leverage foundation models as verification modules in a zero-shot manner to synthesize improved candidate solutions. In this work, we hypothesize that generative policies can similarly benefit from additional inference-time compute that employs zero-shot VLM-based verifiers. A systematic analysis of improving policy performance through the generation-verification framework remains relatively underexplored in the current literature. To this end, we introduce EVE - a modular, generator-verifier interaction framework - that boosts the performance of pretrained generative policies at test time, with no additional training. EVE wraps a frozen base policy with multiple zero-shot, VLM-based verifier agents. Each verifier proposes action refinements to the base policy candidate actions, while an action incorporator fuses the aggregated verifier output into the base policy action prediction to produce the final executed action. We study design choices for generator-verifier information interfacing across a system of verifiers with distinct capabilities. Across a diverse suite of manipulation tasks, EVE consistently improves task success rates without any additional policy training. Through extensive ablations, we isolate the contribution of verifier capabilities and action incorporator strategies, offering practical guidelines to build scalable, modular generator-verifier systems for embodied control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Planetary rover exploration is gaining momentum with upcoming missions, but there's a lack of space mission-based datasets, standardized benchmarks, and evaluation protocols for path planning research. Existing data from prior missions remains underutilized.

Method: Created two large planar benchmark datasets (MarsPlanBench and MoonPlanBench) from high-resolution digital terrain images of Mars and the Moon. Established a unified framework to evaluate both classical and learned path planning algorithms on these datasets and a popular planning benchmark.

Result: Classical algorithms achieved up to 100% global path planning success rates on average across challenging terrains like Moon's north and south poles. Learning-based models showed promising results in less complex environments but struggled to generalize to planetary domains.

Conclusion: The study provides the first standardized planetary path planning benchmarks, explains why classical algorithms are used in practice by NASA, and highlights the generalization challenges for learning-based methods in planetary domains. Code and datasets are released to serve as a foundation for future research.

Abstract: Planetary rover exploration is attracting renewed interest with several upcoming space missions to the Moon and Mars. However, a substantial amount of data from prior missions remain underutilized for path planning and autonomous navigation research. As a result, there is a lack of space mission-based planetary datasets, standardized benchmarks, and evaluation protocols. In this paper, we take a step towards coordinating these three research directions in the context of planetary rover path planning. We propose the first two large planar benchmark datasets, MarsPlanBench and MoonPlanBench, derived from high-resolution digital terrain images of Mars and the Moon. In addition, we set up classical and learned path planning algorithms, in a unified framework, and evaluate them on our proposed datasets and on a popular planning benchmark. Through comprehensive experiments, we report new insights on the performance of representative path planning algorithms on planetary terrains, for the first time to the best of our knowledge. Our results show that classical algorithms can achieve up to 100% global path planning success rates on average across challenging terrains such as Moon's north and south poles. This suggests, for instance, why these algorithms are used in practice by NASA. Conversely, learning-based models, although showing promising results in less complex environments, still struggle to generalize to planetary domains. To serve as a starting point for fundamental path planning research, our code and datasets will be released at: https://github.com/mchancan/PlanetaryPathBench.

Motivation: Address the challenge of probabilistic temporal reach-avoid-stay tasks in dynamic environments with uncertain obstacles, where traditional methods lack formal probabilistic safety guarantees and real-time performance.

Method: Extends STT framework with time-varying ball formulation in state space, develops closed-form control law without approximations, and creates model-free, optimization-free controller that confines system trajectory within evolving tube based on uncertain sensory information.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness through simulation studies and hardware experiments on mobile robots, UAV, and 7-DOF manipulator in cluttered uncertain environments, showing scalability and real-time execution with formal probabilistic safety guarantees.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses PrT-RAS tasks with formal probabilistic safety guarantees, offering a model-free, approximation-free, optimization-free solution that enables efficient real-time execution while ensuring task completion and convergence to target.

Abstract: In this work, we extend the Spatiotemporal Tube (STT) framework to address Probabilistic Temporal Reach-Avoid-Stay (PrT-RAS) tasks in dynamic environments with uncertain obstacles. We develop a real-time tube synthesis procedure that explicitly accounts for time-varying uncertain obstacles and provides formal probabilistic safety guarantees. The STT is formulated as a time-varying ball in the state space whose center and radius evolve online based on uncertain sensory information. We derive a closed-form, approximation-free control law that confines the system trajectory within the tube, ensuring both probabilistic safety and task satisfaction. Our method offers a formal guarantee for probabilistic avoidance and finite-time task completion. The resulting controller is model-free, approximation-free, and optimization-free, enabling efficient real-time execution while guaranteeing convergence to the target. The effectiveness and scalability of the framework are demonstrated through simulation studies and hardware experiments on mobile robots, a UAV, and a 7-DOF manipulator navigating in cluttered and uncertain environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more effective variable stiffness mechanism for robotic applications that overcomes limitations of conventional planar electrostatic layer jamming by providing greater stiffness enhancement with smaller footprint through helical configuration.

Method: Proposed HWS-ELJ uses electrostatic attraction to enhance interlayer friction, suppressing relative sliding for tunable stiffness. The helical winding configuration provides exponential stiffness increase with winding angle. Voltage-based control enables practical stiffness modulation.

Result: Experimental tests showed HWS-ELJ achieves significantly greater stiffness enhancement than planar ELJ for same electrode contact area, reduces footprint under equivalent stiffness, and follows theoretical trends. Robotic finger prototype demonstrated successful voltage-driven stiffness modulation.

Conclusion: HWS-ELJ is a rationally designed, effective variable stiffness mechanism for robotic applications, particularly suitable for robotic finger design, with demonstrated feasibility of voltage-controlled stiffness modulation and superior performance over conventional planar ELJ.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel variable stiffness mechanism termed Helically Wound Structured Electrostatic Layer Jamming (HWS-ELJ) and systematically investigates its potential applications in variable stiffness robotic finger design. The proposed method utilizes electrostatic attraction to enhance interlayer friction, thereby suppressing relative sliding and enabling tunable stiffness. Compared with conventional planar ELJ, the helical configuration of HWS-ELJ provides exponentially increasing stiffness adjustment with winding angle, achieving significantly greater stiffness enhancement for the same electrode contact area while reducing the required footprint under equivalent stiffness conditions. Considering the practical advantage of voltage-based control, a series of experimental tests under different initial force conditions were conducted to evaluate the stiffness modulation characteristics of HWS-ELJ. The results demonstrated its rational design and efficacy, with outcomes following the deduced theoretical trends. Furthermore, a robotic finger prototype integrating HWS-ELJ was developed, demonstrating voltage-driven stiffness modulation and confirming the feasibility of the proposed robotic variable stiffness mechanism.

Conclusion: Structured human representations combined with lightweight physical constraints can effectively produce robot-ready motion from monocular video input without complex pipelines.

Abstract: Recovering world-coordinate human motion from monocular videos with humanoid robot retargeting is significant for embodied intelligence and robotics. To avoid complex SLAM pipelines or heavy temporal models, we propose a lightweight, engineering-oriented framework that leverages SAM 3D Body (3DB) as a frozen perception backbone and uses the Momentum HumanRig (MHR) representation as a robot-friendly intermediate. Our method (i) locks the identity and skeleton-scale parameters of per tracked subject to enforce temporally consistent bone lengths, (ii) smooths per-frame predictions via efficient sliding-window optimization in the low-dimensional MHR latent space, and (iii) recovers physically plausible global root trajectories with a differentiable soft foot-ground contact model and contact-aware global optimization. Finally, we retarget the reconstructed motion to the Unitree G1 humanoid using a kinematics-aware two-stage inverse kinematics pipeline. Results on real monocular videos show that our method has stable world trajectories and reliable robot retargeting, indicating that structured human representations with lightweight physical constraints can yield robot-ready motion from monocular input.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes an image-centric memory framework with visual compression for lifelong embodied navigation, achieving SOTA performance by enabling agents to reason over long visual histories efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current object-centric memory approaches are limited by detection/reconstruction pipelines that reduce robustness and scalability. Need for agents to accumulate, retain, and exploit spatial-semantic experience across tasks for efficient exploration in novel environments and rapid goal reaching in familiar ones.

Method: Image-centric memory framework with visual context compression module end-to-end coupled with Qwen2.5-VL-based navigation policy. Uses ViT backbone with frozen DINOv3 features and lightweight PixelUnshuffle+Conv blocks for configurable compression rates (e.g., 16× compression = ~30 tokens per image).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art navigation performance on GOAT-Bench and HM3D-OVON benchmarks. Improves exploration in unfamiliar environments and shortens paths in familiar ones. Ablation studies show moderate compression provides best balance between efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: Compressed image-centric memory is a practical and scalable interface for lifelong embodied agents, enabling human-like efficiency by allowing reasoning over long visual histories while maintaining navigation performance.

Abstract: Lifelong embodied navigation requires agents to accumulate, retain, and exploit spatial-semantic experience across tasks, enabling efficient exploration in novel environments and rapid goal reaching in familiar ones. While object-centric memory is interpretable, it depends on detection and reconstruction pipelines that limit robustness and scalability. We propose an image-centric memory framework that achieves long-term implicit memory via an efficient visual context compression module end-to-end coupled with a Qwen2.5-VL-based navigation policy. Built atop a ViT backbone with frozen DINOv3 features and lightweight PixelUnshuffle+Conv blocks, our visual tokenizer supports configurable compression rates; for example, under a representative 16$\times$ compression setting, each image is encoded with about 30 tokens, expanding the effective context capacity from tens to hundreds of images. Experimental results on GOAT-Bench and HM3D-OVON show that our method achieves state-of-the-art navigation performance, improving exploration in unfamiliar environments and shortening paths in familiar ones. Ablation studies further reveal that moderate compression provides the best balance between efficiency and accuracy. These findings position compressed image-centric memory as a practical and scalable interface for lifelong embodied agents, enabling them to reason over long visual histories and navigate with human-like efficiency.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A structure-induced exploration framework for multi-robot path planning that integrates spatial priors into ant colony optimization to improve scalability, route compactness, and workload balance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-robot path planning is challenging due to combinatorial complexity and the need to balance global efficiency with fair task allocation. Traditional swarm intelligence methods often converge prematurely and struggle to scale to complex environments.

Method: Integrates structural priors into ant colony optimization by leveraging spatial task distribution to constrain search space, designing pheromone updates to emphasize meaningful connections, incorporating load-aware objectives, and using explicit overlap suppression to ensure distinct and balanced tasks.

Result: Demonstrated consistent improvements in route compactness, stability, and workload distribution across diverse benchmark scenarios with various instance sizes and robot team configurations, outperforming representative metaheuristic baselines.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable and interpretable framework for large-scale multi-robot coordination applicable to logistics, surveillance, and search-and-rescue where reliable coordination is essential.

Abstract: Multi-robot path planning is a fundamental yet challenging problem due to its combinatorial complexity and the need to balance global efficiency with fair task allocation among robots. Traditional swarm intelligence methods, although effective on small instances, often converge prematurely and struggle to scale to complex environments. In this work, we present a structure-induced exploration framework that integrates structural priors into the search process of the ant colony optimization (ACO). The approach leverages the spatial distribution of the task to induce a structural prior at initialization, thereby constraining the search space. The pheromone update rule is then designed to emphasize structurally meaningful connections and incorporates a load-aware objective to reconcile the total travel distance with individual robot workload. An explicit overlap suppression strategy further ensures that tasks remain distinct and balanced across the team. The proposed framework was validated on diverse benchmark scenarios covering a wide range of instance sizes and robot team configurations. The results demonstrate consistent improvements in route compactness, stability, and workload distribution compared to representative metaheuristic baselines. Beyond performance gains, the method also provides a scalable and interpretable framework that can be readily applied to logistics, surveillance, and search-and-rescue applications where reliable large-scale coordination is essential.

Conclusion: MAction-SocialNav effectively addresses action ambiguity in social navigation, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency compared to large language models, highlighting its potential for real-world human-robot navigation applications.

Abstract: Socially compliant navigation requires robots to move safely and appropriately in human-centered environments by respecting social norms. However, social norms are often ambiguous, and in a single scenario, multiple actions may be equally acceptable. Most existing methods simplify this problem by assuming a single correct action, which limits their ability to handle real-world social uncertainty. In this work, we propose MAction-SocialNav, an efficient vision language model for socially compliant navigation that explicitly addresses action ambiguity, enabling generating multiple plausible actions within one scenario. To enhance the model's reasoning capability, we introduce a novel meta-cognitive prompt (MCP) method. Furthermore, to evaluate the proposed method, we curate a multi-action socially compliant navigation dataset that accounts for diverse conditions, including crowd density, indoor and outdoor environments, and dual human annotations. The dataset contains 789 samples, each with three-turn conversation, split into 710 training samples and 79 test samples through random selection. We also design five evaluation metrics to assess high-level decision precision, safety, and diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MAction-SocialNav achieves strong social reasoning performance while maintaining high efficiency, highlighting its potential for real-world human robot navigation. Compared with zero-shot GPT-4o and Claude, our model achieves substantially higher decision quality (APG: 0.595 vs. 0.000/0.025) and safety alignment (ER: 0.264 vs. 0.642/0.668), while maintaining real-time efficiency (1.524 FPS, over 3x faster).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied agents need robust planning for complex scenarios, especially when instructions are in natural language. LLMs have linguistic knowledge but need proper architecture to handle ambiguity, retrieve environmental information, and leverage agent skills.

Method: Proposed HELP: Hierarchical Embodied Language Planner consisting of multiple LLM-based agents, each dedicated to solving different subtasks. Uses open-source LLMs with relatively small parameters for autonomous deployment.

Result: Evaluated on household tasks with real-world experiments using an embodied agent. Demonstrated effectiveness of the hierarchical approach with specialized agents.

Conclusion: HELP provides an effective architecture for embodied agents to leverage LLMs' linguistic capabilities while handling ambiguity, environmental information retrieval, and skill utilization through specialized hierarchical agents.

Abstract: Embodied agents tasked with complex scenarios, whether in real or simulated environments, rely heavily on robust planning capabilities. When instructions are formulated in natural language, large language models (LLMs) equipped with extensive linguistic knowledge can play this role. However, to effectively exploit the ability of such models to handle linguistic ambiguity, to retrieve information from the environment, and to be based on the available skills of an agent, an appropriate architecture must be designed. We propose a Hierarchical Embodied Language Planner, called HELP, consisting of a set of LLM-based agents, each dedicated to solving a different subtask. We evaluate the proposed approach on a household task and perform real-world experiments with an embodied agent. We also focus on the use of open source LLMs with a relatively small number of parameters, to enable autonomous deployment.

TL;DR: ANWM is an aerial navigation world model that predicts future visual observations to enable UAVs to rank trajectories by semantic plausibility and navigational utility, improving navigation success in large-scale 3D environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UAV navigation policies focus only on low-level objectives like obstacle avoidance and trajectory smoothness, lacking the ability to incorporate high-level semantics into planning, which limits autonomous navigation in large-scale 3D environments.

Method: ANWM predicts future visual observations conditioned on past frames and actions, using a physics-inspired Future Frame Projection (FFP) module that projects past frames into future viewpoints to provide coarse geometric priors, mitigating representational uncertainty in long-distance visual generation.

Result: ANWM significantly outperforms existing world models in long-distance visual forecasting and improves UAV navigation success rates in large-scale environments.

Conclusion: The proposed aerial navigation world model successfully bridges the gap between low-level navigation objectives and high-level semantic planning, enabling more effective autonomous UAV navigation through semantic trajectory ranking.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as powerful embodied agents. One of the core abilities is autonomous navigation in large-scale three-dimensional environments. Existing navigation policies, however, are typically optimized for low-level objectives such as obstacle avoidance and trajectory smoothness, lacking the ability to incorporate high-level semantics into planning. To bridge this gap, we propose ANWM, an aerial navigation world model that predicts future visual observations conditioned on past frames and actions, thereby enabling agents to rank candidate trajectories by their semantic plausibility and navigational utility. ANWM is trained on 4-DoF UAV trajectories and introduces a physics-inspired module: Future Frame Projection (FFP), which projects past frames into future viewpoints to provide coarse geometric priors. This module mitigates representational uncertainty in long-distance visual generation and captures the mapping between 3D trajectories and egocentric observations. Empirical results demonstrate that ANWM significantly outperforms existing world models in long-distance visual forecasting and improves UAV navigation success rates in large-scale environments.

Abstract: Multitask learning poses significant challenges due to the highly multimodal and diverse nature of robot action distributions. However, effectively fitting policies to these complex task distributions is often difficult, and existing monolithic models often underfit the action distribution and lack the flexibility required for efficient adaptation. We introduce a novel modular diffusion policy framework that factorizes complex action distributions into a composition of specialized diffusion models, each capturing a distinct sub-mode of the behavior space for a more effective overall policy. In addition, this modular structure enables flexible policy adaptation to new tasks by adding or fine-tuning components, which inherently mitigates catastrophic forgetting.

Result: Validated on high-fidelity airway mannequins under standard and difficult configurations, demonstrating reliable navigation and controlled tube placement with objective depth awareness.

Conclusion: BRIS represents progress toward safer, more consistent, and clinically compatible robotic airway management by addressing key limitations of existing systems.

Abstract: Endotracheal intubation is a critical yet technically demanding procedure, with failure or improper tube placement leading to severe complications. Existing robotic and teleoperated intubation systems primarily focus on airway navigation and do not provide integrated control of endotracheal tube advancement or objective verification of tube depth relative to the carina. This paper presents the Robotic Intubation System (BRIS), a compact, human-in-the-loop platform designed to assist fiberoptic-guided intubation while enabling real-time, objective depth awareness. BRIS integrates a four-way steerable fiberoptic bronchoscope, an independent endotracheal tube advancement mechanism, and a camera-augmented mouthpiece compatible with standard clinical workflows. A learning-enabled closed-loop control framework leverages real-time shape sensing to map joystick inputs to distal bronchoscope tip motion in Cartesian space, providing stable and intuitive teleoperation under tendon nonlinearities and airway contact. Monocular endoscopic depth estimation is used to classify airway regions and provide interpretable, anatomy-aware guidance for safe tube positioning relative to the carina. The system is validated on high-fidelity airway mannequins under standard and difficult airway configurations, demonstrating reliable navigation and controlled tube placement. These results highlight BRIS as a step toward safer, more consistent, and clinically compatible robotic airway management.

Motivation: Address limitations of traditional HTP test: heterogeneous scoring standards, subjective examiner reliance, and lack of unified quantitative coding.

Method: Multi-agent framework using multimodal large language models that integrates social-psychological perspectives and destigmatizing narratives to correct visual hallucinations.

Result: 0.75 mean semantic similarity with human experts (SD 0.05), rising to 0.85 in structured expert datasets; produces psychologically valid, coherent reports.

Conclusion: MLLMs can serve as standardized projective assessment tools; multi-agent framework decouples feature recognition from psychological inference for digital mental-health services.

Abstract: Background: The House-Tree-Person (HTP) drawing test, introduced by John Buck in 1948, remains a widely used projective technique in clinical psychology. However, it has long faced challenges such as heterogeneous scoring standards, reliance on examiners subjective experience, and a lack of a unified quantitative coding system.
  Results: Quantitative experiments showed that the mean semantic similarity between Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) interpretations and human expert interpretations was approximately 0.75 (standard deviation about 0.05). In structurally oriented expert data sets, this similarity rose to 0.85, indicating expert-level baseline comprehension. Qualitative analyses demonstrated that the multi-agent system, by integrating social-psychological perspectives and destigmatizing narratives, effectively corrected visual hallucinations and produced psychological reports with high ecological validity and internal coherence.
  Conclusions: The findings confirm the potential of multimodal large models as standardized tools for projective assessment. The proposed multi-agent framework, by dividing roles, decouples feature recognition from psychological inference and offers a new paradigm for digital mental-health services.

TL;DR: Analyzes how current Go solvers using Relevance-Zone Based Search (RZS) and pattern tables solve Life-and-Death problems, finding they identify critical zones and rare patterns but sometimes give different answers than human experts and have issues with rare pattern valuation and territory maximization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how state-of-the-art computer Go solvers with RZS and relevance-zone pattern tables perform on classic Life-and-Death problems from Go literature, comparing their solutions to established human expert answers and identifying limitations.

Method: Used relevance-zone based solvers (RZS and relevance-zone pattern table) to analyze seven Life-and-Death problems from Cho Chikun's "Life and Death Dictionary," examining the solvers' identified relevance-zones, discovered patterns, and solution variations.

Result: Solvers successfully identified critical relevance-zones for each problem, discovered rare patterns, but gave different answers than the book for two problems. Found two key issues: misjudging values of rare patterns and prioritizing direct living over territory maximization (unlike human players).

Conclusion: While RZS-based solvers effectively identify critical areas and patterns in Life-and-Death problems, they have systematic issues with rare pattern valuation and strategic priorities that differ from human play. Future work should address these limitations to improve solver performance.

Abstract: This paper analyzes the behavior of solving Life-and-Death (L&D) problems in the game of Go using current state-of-the-art computer Go solvers with two techniques: the Relevance-Zone Based Search (RZS) and the relevance-zone pattern table. We examined the solutions derived by relevance-zone based solvers on seven L&D problems from the renowned book "Life and Death Dictionary" written by Cho Chikun, a Go grandmaster, and found several interesting results. First, for each problem, the solvers identify a relevance-zone that highlights the critical areas for solving. Second, the solvers discover a series of patterns, including some that are rare. Finally, the solvers even find different answers compared to the given solutions for two problems. We also identified two issues with the solver: (a) it misjudges values of rare patterns, and (b) it tends to prioritize living directly rather than maximizing territory, which differs from the behavior of human Go players. We suggest possible approaches to address these issues in future work. Our code and data are available at https://rlg.iis.sinica.edu.tw/papers/study-LD-RZ.

*Junfang Luo,Mengjun Hu,Guangming Lang,Xin Yang,Keyun Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes separating alliance and conflict functions in three-way conflict analysis to clarify semantics, enabling better interpretation of agent relations and strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing rating/auxiliary functions combine opposite aspects (alliance/conflict) in single functions, making aggregations ambiguous - e.g., alliance+1 + conflict-1 averages to same as neutrality 0, losing important semantic distinctions.

Method: Separates alliance and conflict aspects into distinct functions, then trisects agents, issues, and agent pairs using these separate functions. Explores alliance sets and strategies concepts.

Result: Develops clearer semantic framework for three-way conflict analysis with separate alliance/conflict functions, enabling better interpretation of group relations and strategic analysis.

Conclusion: Separating alliance and conflict functions clarifies semantics in three-way conflict analysis, provides foundation for analyzing alliance sets/strategies, with real-world application demonstrating utility.

Abstract: Trisecting agents, issues, and agent pairs are essential topics of three-way conflict analysis. They have been commonly studied based on either a rating or an auxiliary function. A rating function defines the positive, negative, or neutral ratings of agents on issues. An auxiliary function defines the alliance, conflict, and neutrality relations between agents. These functions measure two opposite aspects in a single function, leading to challenges in interpreting their aggregations over a group of issues or agents. For example, when studying agent relations regarding a set of issues, a standard aggregation takes the average of an auxiliary function concerning single issues. Therefore, a pair of alliance +1 and conflict -1 relations will produce the same result as a pair of neutrality 0 relations, although the attitudes represented by the two pairs are very different. To clarify semantics, we separate the two opposite aspects in an auxiliary function into a pair of alliance and conflict functions. Accordingly, we trisect the agents, issues, and agent pairs and investigate their applications in solving a few crucial questions in conflict analysis. Particularly, we explore the concepts of alliance sets and strategies. A real-world application is given to illustrate the proposed models.

Conclusion: The proposed conflict resolution models outperform existing approaches by unifying weighted agent-issue evaluation with consistency/non-consistency measures to systematically identify feasible strategies and optimal solutions.

Abstract: Most existing work on three-way conflict analysis has focused on trisecting agent pairs, agents, or issues, which contributes to understanding the nature of conflicts but falls short in addressing their resolution. Specifically, the formulation of feasible strategies, as an essential component of conflict resolution and mitigation, has received insufficient scholarly attention. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate feasible strategies from two perspectives of consistency and non-consistency. Particularly, we begin with computing the overall rating of a clique of agents based on positive and negative similarity degrees. Afterwards, considering the weights of both agents and issues, we propose weighted consistency and non-consistency measures, which are respectively used to identify the feasible strategies for a clique of agents. Algorithms are developed to identify feasible strategies, $L$-order feasible strategies, and the corresponding optimal ones. Finally, to demonstrate the practicality, effectiveness, and superiority of the proposed models, we apply them to two commonly used case studies on NBA labor negotiations and development plans for Gansu Province and conduct a sensitivity analysis on parameters and a comparative analysis with existing state-of-the-art conflict analysis approaches. The comparison results demonstrate that our conflict resolution models outperform the conventional approaches by unifying weighted agent-issue evaluation with consistency and non-consistency measures to enable the systematic identification of not only feasible strategies but also optimal solutions.

### [109] [Three-way decision with incomplete information based on similarity and satisfiability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21421)
*Junfang Luo,Mengjun Hu,Keyun Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper generalizes three-way decision from complete to incomplete information using both computational (similarity relations) and conceptual (satisfiability degrees) formulations, proposing new approaches for practical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Three-way decision with rough sets is well-established for complete information, but real-world applications often involve incomplete information. The paper aims to extend both computational and conceptual formulations to handle incomplete data.

Method: Two formulations: (1) Computational: proposes similarity degree measure to generalize equivalence relations, using alpha-similarity classes and approximability of objects; (2) Conceptual: proposes satisfiability degree measure to generalize logical satisfiability, using alpha-meaning sets and confidence of formulas.

Result: The paper successfully generalizes three-way decision to incomplete information, providing both computational and conceptual frameworks. While similarity classes are common, the new concepts of approximability and the conceptual approaches offer promising new directions.

Conclusion: The paper extends three-way decision theory to handle incomplete information through novel similarity and satisfiability measures, opening new research directions beyond traditional similarity-based approaches for practical applications.

Abstract: Three-way decision is widely applied with rough set theory to learn classification or decision rules. The approaches dealing with complete information are well established in the literature, including the two complementary computational and conceptual formulations. The computational formulation uses equivalence relations, and the conceptual formulation uses satisfiability of logic formulas. In this paper, based on a briefly review of these two formulations, we generalize both formulations into three-way decision with incomplete information that is more practical in real-world applications. For the computational formulation, we propose a new measure of similarity degree of objects as a generalization of equivalence relations. Based on it, we discuss two approaches to three-way decision using alpha-similarity classes and approximability of objects, respectively. For the conceptual formulation, we propose a measure of satisfiability degree of formulas as a quantitative generalization of satisfiability with complete information. Based on it, we study two approaches to three-way decision using alpha-meaning sets of formulas and confidence of formulas, respectively. While using similarity classes is a common method of analyzing incomplete information in the literature, the proposed concept of approximability and the two approaches in conceptual formulation point out new promising directions.

*Fanwei Zeng,Changtao Miao,Jing Huang,Zhiya Tan,Shutao Gong,Xiaoming Yu,Yang Wang,Huazhe Tan,Weibin Yao,Jianshu Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LogicLens is a unified visual-textual co-reasoning framework for text-centric forgery analysis that integrates detection, grounding, and explanation through cross-cues-aware chain-of-thought reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for text-centric forgery analysis are limited to coarse-grained visual analysis, lack sophisticated reasoning capabilities, and treat detection, grounding, and explanation as separate tasks, missing their intrinsic relationships for holistic performance improvement.

Method: LogicLens introduces a unified framework with Cross-Cues-aware Chain of Thought (CCT) mechanism for iterative visual-textual cross-validation, weighted multi-task reward function for GRPO optimization, PR² pipeline for annotation generation, and RealText dataset with 5,397 images.

Result: LogicLens achieves 41.4% improvement over specialized frameworks and 23.4% over GPT-4o on T-IC13 in zero-shot evaluation, and establishes significant leads on T-SROIE dataset across multiple metrics including mF1, CSS, and macro-average F1.

Conclusion: LogicLens demonstrates superior performance in text-centric forgery analysis through unified visual-textual co-reasoning, showing the effectiveness of integrating detection, grounding, and explanation tasks with sophisticated reasoning mechanisms.

Abstract: Sophisticated text-centric forgeries, fueled by rapid AIGC advancements, pose a significant threat to societal security and information authenticity. Current methods for text-centric forgery analysis are often limited to coarse-grained visual analysis and lack the capacity for sophisticated reasoning. Moreover, they typically treat detection, grounding, and explanation as discrete sub-tasks, overlooking their intrinsic relationships for holistic performance enhancement. To address these challenges, we introduce LogicLens, a unified framework for Visual-Textual Co-reasoning that reformulates these objectives into a joint task. The deep reasoning of LogicLens is powered by our novel Cross-Cues-aware Chain of Thought (CCT) mechanism, which iteratively cross-validates visual cues against textual logic. To ensure robust alignment across all tasks, we further propose a weighted multi-task reward function for GRPO-based optimization. Complementing this framework, we first designed the PR$^2$ (Perceiver, Reasoner, Reviewer) pipeline, a hierarchical and iterative multi-agent system that generates high-quality, cognitively-aligned annotations. Then, we constructed RealText, a diverse dataset comprising 5,397 images with fine-grained annotations, including textual explanations, pixel-level segmentation, and authenticity labels for model training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LogicLens across multiple benchmarks. In a zero-shot evaluation on T-IC13, it surpasses the specialized framework by 41.4% and GPT-4o by 23.4% in macro-average F1 score. Moreover, on the challenging dense-text T-SROIE dataset, it establishes a significant lead over other MLLM-based methods in mF1, CSS, and the macro-average F1. Our dataset, model, and code will be made publicly available.

*Yanhao Li,Lu Ma,Jiaran Zhang,Lexiang Tang,Wentao Zhang,Guibo Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Leash is an adaptive length penalty framework using reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust penalty coefficients, reducing reasoning length by 60% while maintaining performance across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed length penalties are hard to tune and fail to adapt to LLMs' evolving reasoning abilities, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy and conciseness.

Method: Formulates length control as constrained optimization, employs Lagrangian primal-dual method to dynamically adjust penalty coefficients - intensifying when generations exceed target length and relaxing when shorter.

Result: Reduces average reasoning length by 60% across diverse tasks (in-distribution mathematical reasoning and out-of-distribution domains like coding and instruction following) while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: Presents a practical and effective paradigm for developing controllable and efficient LLMs that balance reasoning capabilities with computational budgets.

Abstract: Existing approaches typically rely on fixed length penalties, but such penalties are hard to tune and fail to adapt to the evolving reasoning abilities of LLMs, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy and conciseness. To address this challenge, we propose Leash (adaptive LEngth penAlty and reward SHaping), a reinforcement learning framework for efficient reasoning in LLMs. We formulate length control as a constrained optimization problem and employ a Lagrangian primal-dual method to dynamically adjust the penalty coefficient. When generations exceed the target length, the penalty is intensified; when they are shorter, it is relaxed. This adaptive mechanism guides models toward producing concise reasoning without sacrificing task performance. Experiments on Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507 show that Leash reduces the average reasoning length by 60% across diverse tasks - including in-distribution mathematical reasoning and out-of-distribution domains such as coding and instruction following - while maintaining competitive performance. Our work thus presents a practical and effective paradigm for developing controllable and efficient LLMs that balance reasoning capabilities with computational budgets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal models in medicine often produce hallucinations or inconsistent reasoning chains, limiting clinical trust despite the growth of LLMs and VLMs.

Method: Built on LLaVA, the framework includes: input encoder for text/images, projection module for cross-modal alignment, reasoning controller for task decomposition, and logic tree generator for assembling verifiable conclusions.

Result: Improves diagnostic accuracy and yields more interpretable reasoning traces on multimodal tasks (MedXpertQA and other benchmarks), while remaining competitive on text-only settings.

Conclusion: The approach represents a promising step toward trustworthy multimodal medical AI by addressing reliability and interpretability issues.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) in medicine, simply integrating clinical text and medical imaging does not guarantee reliable reasoning. Existing multimodal models often produce hallucinations or inconsistent chains of thought, limiting clinical trust. We propose a diagnostic framework built upon LLaVA that combines vision-language alignment with logic-regularized reasoning. The system includes an input encoder for text and images, a projection module for cross-modal alignment, a reasoning controller that decomposes diagnostic tasks into steps, and a logic tree generator that assembles stepwise premises into verifiable conclusions. Evaluations on MedXpertQA and other benchmarks show that our method improves diagnostic accuracy and yields more interpretable reasoning traces on multimodal tasks, while remaining competitive on text-only settings. These results suggest a promising step toward trustworthy multimodal medical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between natural language design intent and industrial-level AMS IC design deliverables, automating the traditionally manual and time-consuming I/O subsystem generation process.

Method: Framework with structured domain knowledge base for reusable constraints/conventions, and design intent structuring that converts ambiguous user intent into verifiable logic steps using JSON/Python as intermediate formats.

Result: Achieves over 70% DRC+LVS pass rate on AMS-IO-Bench benchmark, reduces design turnaround from hours to minutes, and successfully fabricated/validated in 28nm CMOS tape-out - first reported human-agent collaborative AMS IC design.

Conclusion: AMS-IO-Agent demonstrates practical effectiveness in real AMS IC design flows, enabling LLM-based agents to complete nontrivial subtasks with outputs directly used in silicon fabrication.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose AMS-IO-Agent, a domain-specialized LLM-based agent for structure-aware input/output (I/O) subsystem generation in analog and mixed-signal (AMS) integrated circuits (ICs). The central contribution of this work is a framework that connects natural language design intent with industrial-level AMS IC design deliverables. AMS-IO-Agent integrates two key capabilities: (1) a structured domain knowledge base that captures reusable constraints and design conventions; (2) design intent structuring, which converts ambiguous user intent into verifiable logic steps using JSON and Python as intermediate formats. We further introduce AMS-IO-Bench, a benchmark for wirebond-packaged AMS I/O ring automation. On this benchmark, AMS-IO-Agent achieves over 70\% DRC+LVS pass rate and reduces design turnaround time from hours to minutes, outperforming the baseline LLM. Furthermore, an agent-generated I/O ring was fabricated and validated in a 28 nm CMOS tape-out, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of the approach in real AMS IC design flows. To our knowledge, this is the first reported human-agent collaborative AMS IC design in which an LLM-based agent completes a nontrivial subtask with outputs directly used in silicon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Therapeutic discovery faces challenges from domain fragmentation and the gap between computational design and physiological validation. Current generative AI models are passive assistants rather than autonomous executors.

Method: Human-in-the-loop multi-agent platform with three specialized agents: Biologist Agent uses knowledge graph reasoning for target identification; Chemist Agent performs structural analysis for de novo design or drug repositioning; Pharmacologist Agent runs PBPK simulations for evaluation. An Orchestrator manages the dynamic feedback loop where pharmacokinetic/toxicity results trigger structural reoptimization.

Result: The platform establishes an autonomous discovery engine that transforms drug discovery from stochastic search to programmable evidence-based engineering, democratizing therapeutic design through seamless integration of autonomous execution with human guidance.

Conclusion: OrchestRA represents a paradigm shift in therapeutic discovery by creating an autonomous, integrated platform that actively executes and reasons across biological, chemical, and pharmacological domains, bridging the gap between computational design and physiological validation.

Abstract: Therapeutic discovery remains a formidable challenge, impeded by the fragmentation of specialized domains and the execution gap between computational design and physiological validation. Although generative AI offers promise, current models often function as passive assistants rather than as autonomous executors. Here, we introduce OrchestRA, a human-in-the-loop multi-agent platform that unifies biology, chemistry, and pharmacology into an autonomous discovery engine. Unlike static code generators, our agents actively execute simulations and reason the results to drive iterative optimization. Governed by an Orchestrator, a Biologist Agent leverages deep reasoning over a massive knowledge graph (>10 million associations) to pinpoint high-confidence targets; a Chemist Agent autonomously detects structural pockets for de novo design or drug repositioning; and a Pharmacologist Agent evaluates candidates via rigorous physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) simulations. This architecture establishes a dynamic feedback loop where pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles directly trigger structural reoptimization. By seamlessly integrating autonomous execution with human guidance, OrchestRA democratizes therapeutic design, transforming drug discovery from a stochastic search to a programmable evidence-based engineering discipline.

*Hong Xie,Haoran Gu,Yanying Huang,Tao Tan,Defu Lian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A prioritized resource sharing bandit model for resource allocation in LLM/edge intelligence applications, with matching regret bounds up to logarithmic factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address resource allocation problems in emerging applications like LLM serving and edge intelligence, where multiple requests with different priorities compete for limited resources (e.g., GPU memory, compute units).

Method: Proposes MSB-PRS-OffOpt algorithm to find optimal play allocation with O(MK³) complexity, then uses it as subroutine in approximate UCB algorithm for online learning.

Result: Proves instance-independent regret lower bound Ω(α₁σ√(KMT)) and instance-dependent lower bound Ω(α₁σ²(M/Δ)lnT). Achieves matching upper bounds up to √(K ln KT) and α₁K² factors respectively.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses technical challenges in optimizing/learning under nonlinear combinatorial utility from prioritized resource sharing, providing efficient algorithms with near-optimal regret bounds for practical resource allocation problems.

Abstract: This paper proposes a variant of multiple-play stochastic bandits tailored to resource allocation problems arising from LLM applications, edge intelligence, etc. The model is composed of $M$ arms and $K$ plays. Each arm has a stochastic number of capacities, and each unit of capacity is associated with a reward function. Each play is associated with a priority weight. When multiple plays compete for the arm capacity, the arm capacity is allocated in a larger priority weight first manner. Instance independent and instance dependent regret lower bounds of $Ω( α_1 σ\sqrt{KM T} )$ and $Ω(α_1 σ^2 \frac{M}Δ \ln T)$ are proved, where $α_1$ is the largest priority weight and $σ$ characterizes the reward tail. When model parameters are given, we design an algorithm named \texttt{MSB-PRS-OffOpt} to locate the optimal play allocation policy with a computational complexity of $O(MK^3)$. Utilizing \texttt{MSB-PRS-OffOpt} as a subroutine, an approximate upper confidence bound (UCB) based algorithm is designed, which has instance independent and instance dependent regret upper bounds matching the corresponding lower bound up to factors of $ \sqrt{K \ln KT }$ and $α_1 K^2$ respectively. To this end, we address nontrivial technical challenges arising from optimizing and learning under a special nonlinear combinatorial utility function induced by the prioritized resource sharing mechanism.

TL;DR: Proposes a Responsible and Explainable AI Agent Architecture using multi-model consensus and reasoning-layer governance to address challenges in autonomous agentic AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic AI systems enable powerful autonomous capabilities but introduce critical challenges in explainability, accountability, robustness, and governance, especially when agent outputs influence real-world decisions. Existing implementations prioritize functionality over transparency and responsibility.

Method: A consortium of heterogeneous LLM and VLM agents independently generate candidate outputs from shared input context, exposing uncertainty and disagreements. A dedicated reasoning agent performs structured consolidation across outputs, enforcing safety/policy constraints, mitigating hallucinations/bias, and producing auditable decisions.

Result: Evaluation across multiple real-world agentic AI workflows demonstrates that consensus-driven reasoning improves robustness, transparency, and operational trust across diverse application domains.

Conclusion: Provides practical guidance for designing agentic AI systems that are both autonomous/scalable and responsible/explainable by construction through multi-model consensus and reasoning-layer governance.

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a major shift in how autonomous systems reason, plan, and execute multi-step tasks through the coordination of Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision Language Models (VLMs), tools, and external services. While these systems enable powerful new capabilities, increasing autonomy introduces critical challenges related to explainability, accountability, robustness, and governance, especially when agent outputs influence downstream actions or decisions. Existing agentic AI implementations often emphasize functionality and scalability, yet provide limited mechanisms for understanding decision rationale or enforcing responsibility across agent interactions. This paper presents a Responsible(RAI) and Explainable(XAI) AI Agent Architecture for production-grade agentic workflows based on multi-model consensus and reasoning-layer governance. In the proposed design, a consortium of heterogeneous LLM and VLM agents independently generates candidate outputs from a shared input context, explicitly exposing uncertainty, disagreement, and alternative interpretations. A dedicated reasoning agent then performs structured consolidation across these outputs, enforcing safety and policy constraints, mitigating hallucinations and bias, and producing auditable, evidence-backed decisions. Explainability is achieved through explicit cross-model comparison and preserved intermediate outputs, while responsibility is enforced through centralized reasoning-layer control and agent-level constraints. We evaluate the architecture across multiple real-world agentic AI workflows, demonstrating that consensus-driven reasoning improves robustness, transparency, and operational trust across diverse application domains. This work provides practical guidance for designing agentic AI systems that are autonomous and scalable, yet responsible and explainable by construction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAI growth relies on large-scale open-source datasets collected through unrestricted/opaque practices, with ethical/legal considerations often neglected. Dataset provenance information gets lost as datasets are shared and reproduced.

Method: Introduce Compliance Rating Scheme (CRS) framework to evaluate dataset compliance with transparency, accountability, and security principles. Develop open-source Python library using data provenance technology for integration into dataset-processing and AI training pipelines.

Result: Framework and library enable both reactive evaluation of existing datasets' CRS and proactive guidance for responsible scraping/construction of new datasets.

Conclusion: CRS framework addresses ethical/legal gaps in GAI dataset creation by providing systematic compliance evaluation and practical tools for responsible dataset management.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has experienced exponential growth in recent years, partly facilitated by the abundance of large-scale open-source datasets. These datasets are often built using unrestricted and opaque data collection practices. While most literature focuses on the development and applications of GAI models, the ethical and legal considerations surrounding the creation of these datasets are often neglected. In addition, as datasets are shared, edited, and further reproduced online, information about their origin, legitimacy, and safety often gets lost. To address this gap, we introduce the Compliance Rating Scheme (CRS), a framework designed to evaluate dataset compliance with critical transparency, accountability, and security principles. We also release an open-source Python library built around data provenance technology to implement this framework, allowing for seamless integration into existing dataset-processing and AI training pipelines. The library is simultaneously reactive and proactive, as in addition to evaluating the CRS of existing datasets, it equally informs responsible scraping and construction of new datasets.

TL;DR: SAGA introduces a bi-level autonomous agent that automates objective function design for scientific discovery, moving beyond fixed proxy objectives to systematically explore objective spaces and trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scientific discovery agents rely on imperfect proxy objective functions specified by scientists, which limits their effectiveness for grand scientific challenges. There's an unmet need for automating objective function design.

Method: SAGA uses a bi-level architecture: outer loop LLM agents analyze optimization outcomes, propose new objectives, and convert them to computable scoring functions; inner loop performs solution optimization under current objectives.

Result: Demonstrated across diverse applications (antibiotic design, inorganic materials, functional DNA sequences, chemical processes) showing automated objective formulation substantially improves scientific discovery agent effectiveness.

Conclusion: Automating objective function design is crucial for scientific discovery agents, and SAGA's bi-level approach enables systematic exploration of objective spaces and trade-offs, overcoming limitations of fixed proxy objectives.

Abstract: There has been unprecedented interest in developing agents that expand the boundary of scientific discovery, primarily by optimizing quantitative objective functions specified by scientists. However, for grand challenges in science , these objectives are only imperfect proxies. We argue that automating objective function design is a central, yet unmet requirement for scientific discovery agents. In this work, we introduce the Scientific Autonomous Goal-evolving Agent (SAGA) to amend this challenge. SAGA employs a bi-level architecture in which an outer loop of LLM agents analyzes optimization outcomes, proposes new objectives, and converts them into computable scoring functions, while an inner loop performs solution optimization under the current objectives. This bi-level design enables systematic exploration of the space of objectives and their trade-offs, rather than treating them as fixed inputs. We demonstrate the framework through a broad spectrum of applications, including antibiotic design, inorganic materials design, functional DNA sequence design, and chemical process design, showing that automating objective formulation can substantially improve the effectiveness of scientific discovery agents.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial transcriptomics assays are increasing in scale/complexity, creating computational bottlenecks. While AI agents have improved at software engineering and general data analysis, it's unclear if they can extract biological insight from messy, real-world spatial datasets.

Method: Created SpatialBench benchmark with 146 verifiable problems derived from practical spatial analysis workflows across 5 spatial technologies and 7 task categories. Each problem provides experimental data snapshot and deterministic grader to evaluate recovery of key biological results.

Result: Base model accuracy remains low (20-38% across model families) with strong model-task and model-platform interactions. Harness design (tools, prompts, control flow, execution environment) has large empirical effect on performance.

Conclusion: SpatialBench serves as both measurement tool and diagnostic lens for developing agents that can interact with real spatial datasets faithfully, transparently, and reproducibly.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics assays are rapidly increasing in scale and complexity, making computational analysis a major bottleneck in biological discovery. Although frontier AI agents have improved dramatically at software engineering and general data analysis, it remains unclear whether they can extract biological insight from messy, real-world spatial datasets. We introduce SpatialBench, a benchmark of 146 verifiable problems derived from practical spatial analysis workflows spanning five spatial technologies and seven task categories. Each problem provides a snapshot of experimental data immediately prior to an analysis step and a deterministic grader that evaluates recovery of a key biological result. Benchmark data on frontier models shows that base model accuracy remains low (20-38% across model families), with strong model-task and model-platform interactions. Harness design has a large empirical effect on performance, indicating that tools, prompts, control flow, and execution environment should be evaluated and improved as first-class objects. SpatialBench serves both as a measurement tool and a diagnostic lens for developing agents that can interact with real spatial datasets faithfully, transparently, and reproducibly.

*Zubair Shah,Noaman Khan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Pruning emerges as equilibrium outcome of strategic game among model components, not as external constraint.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most pruning methods treat sparsity as externally imposed constraint using heuristic scores or regularization, lacking principled foundation. Need theory-grounded alternative.

Method: Model parameter groups (weights, neurons, filters) as players in continuous non-cooperative game where each selects participation level. Sparsity emerges when participation becomes dominated strategy at equilibrium. Derive equilibrium-driven pruning algorithm updating parameters and participation jointly without importance scores.

Result: Dominated players collapse to zero participation under mild conditions, providing principled explanation for pruning. Experiments show competitive sparsity-accuracy trade-offs on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: Pruning can be understood as equilibrium phenomenon in strategic game among model components, offering interpretable, theory-grounded alternative to existing heuristic methods.

Abstract: Neural network pruning is widely used to reduce model size and computational cost. Yet, most existing methods treat sparsity as an externally imposed constraint, enforced through heuristic importance scores or training-time regularization. In this work, we propose a fundamentally different perspective: pruning as an equilibrium outcome of strategic interaction among model components. We model parameter groups such as weights, neurons, or filters as players in a continuous non-cooperative game, where each player selects its level of participation in the network to balance contribution against redundancy and competition. Within this formulation, sparsity emerges naturally when continued participation becomes a dominated strategy at equilibrium. We analyze the resulting game and show that dominated players collapse to zero participation under mild conditions, providing a principled explanation for pruning behavior. Building on this insight, we derive a simple equilibrium-driven pruning algorithm that jointly updates network parameters and participation variables without relying on explicit importance scores. This work focuses on establishing a principled formulation and empirical validation of pruning as an equilibrium phenomenon, rather than exhaustive architectural or large-scale benchmarking. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive sparsity-accuracy trade-offs while offering an interpretable, theory-grounded alternative to existing pruning methods.
