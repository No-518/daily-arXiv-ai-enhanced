### [1] [Pathological Truth Bias in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22674)
*Yash Thube*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATS audit reveals VLMs often agree with visually contradicted statements, with generative models showing poor spatial consistency while contrastive encoders are more robust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard benchmarks hide systematic failures in Vision Language Models, reducing real-world trust. Need to measure if models reject visually contradicted statements.

Method: Introduce MATS behavioral audit with Spatial Consistency Score (SCS) and Incorrect Agreement Rate (IAR) metrics. Use activation patching to localize failure loci.

Result: Instruction-tuned generative VLMs (LLaVA 1.5, QwenVLchat) show very low SCS and high IAR, while contrastive encoders (CLIP, SigLIP) are far more robust. Identified failure loci in cross-attention layers and projection components.

Conclusion: MATS reveals systematic failures in VLMs, provides causal localization of failure points, and suggests concrete repair paths for improving model robustness.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are improving quickly, but standard benchmarks
can hide systematic failures that reduce real world trust. We introduce MATS
(Multimodal Audit for Truthful Spatialization), a compact behavioral audit that
measures whether models reject visually contradicted statements, and two
metrics Spatial Consistency Score (SCS) and Incorrect Agreement Rate (IAR).
Instruction tuned generative VLMs (LLaVA 1.5, QwenVLchat) exhibit very low SCS
and high IAR, while contrastive encoders (CLIP, SigLIP) are far more robust.
Activation patching causally localizes failure loci (mid to late cross
attention for generative models, pooled projection components for contrastive
models) and suggests concrete repair paths.

### [2] [Scale and Rotation Estimation of Similarity-Transformed Images via Cross-Correlation Maximization Based on Auxiliary Function Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22686)
*Shinji Yamashita,Yuma Kinoshita,Hitoshi Kiya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel algorithm for joint scale and rotation estimation between images with sub-pixel precision using Fourier transform in log-polar coordinates and cross-correlation maximization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional phase-correlation techniques are effective for translational shifts but inadequate for scale and rotation changes that occur due to camera zooming or rotational movements, which are common in real-world scenarios.

Method: Integrates scale and rotation estimation based on Fourier transform in log-polar coordinates with cross-correlation maximization strategy using the auxiliary function method, incorporating sub-pixel-level cross-correlation.

Result: Experimental results show the proposed method achieves lower mean estimation errors for both scale and rotation compared to conventional Fourier transform-based techniques that rely on discrete cross-correlation.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm provides a highly efficient solution for precise joint estimation of scale and rotation between images with sub-pixel accuracy, outperforming existing Fourier-based methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces a highly efficient algorithm capable of jointly
estimating scale and rotation between two images with sub-pixel precision.
Image alignment serves as a critical process for spatially registering images
captured from different viewpoints, and finds extensive use in domains such as
medical imaging and computer vision. Traditional phase-correlation techniques
are effective in determining translational shifts; however, they are inadequate
when addressing scale and rotation changes, which often arise due to camera
zooming or rotational movements. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm
that integrates scale and rotation estimation based on the Fourier transform in
log-polar coordinates with a cross-correlation maximization strategy,
leveraging the auxiliary function method. By incorporating sub-pixel-level
cross-correlation our method enables precise estimation of both scale and
rotation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
lower mean estimation errors for scale and rotation than conventional Fourier
transform-based techniques that rely on discrete cross-correlation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal Large Language Models struggle with structured perception tasks requiring precise localization and robustness, despite excelling in vision-language reasoning.

Method: Proposed reinforcement learning framework that augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with curriculum-based data scheduling and difficulty-aware filtering to stabilize optimization under sparse, noisy rewards.

Result: Evaluations on autonomous driving benchmarks show substantial improvements in detection accuracy and robustness. Ablation studies confirm importance of reward design, KL regularization, and curriculum pacing.

Conclusion: Reinforcement-driven optimization with structured data curricula provides a scalable path toward robust and interpretable multimodal detection.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language reasoning
but often struggle with structured perception tasks requiring precise
localization and robustness. We propose a reinforcement learning framework that
augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with curriculum-based data
scheduling and difficulty-aware filtering. This approach stabilizes
optimization under sparse, noisy rewards and enables progressive adaptation to
complex samples. Evaluations on autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements in detection accuracy and robustness. Ablation studies
confirm the importance of reward design, KL regularization, and curriculum
pacing for convergence stability and generalization. Our findings highlight
reinforcement-driven optimization with structured data curricula as a scalable
path toward robust and interpretable multimodal detection.

### [4] [Graph-Theoretic Consistency for Robust and Topology-Aware Semi-Supervised Histopathology Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22689)
*Ha-Hieu Pham,Minh Le,Han Huynh,Nguyen Quoc Khanh Le,Huy-Hieu Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TGC is a semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework that uses graph-theoretic constraints to enforce global topology, achieving state-of-the-art performance with only 5-10% supervision on pathology datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semi-supervised segmentation methods rely on pixel-level consistency which propagates noisy pseudo-labels and produces fragmented or topologically invalid masks, especially problematic in computational pathology where dense annotations are costly.

Method: Proposes Topology Graph Consistency (TGC) framework that integrates graph-theoretic constraints by aligning Laplacian spectra, component counts, and adjacency statistics between prediction graphs and references.

Result: Experiments on GlaS and CRAG datasets demonstrate TGC achieves state-of-the-art performance under 5-10% supervision and significantly narrows the gap to full supervision.

Conclusion: TGC effectively enforces global topology constraints in semi-supervised segmentation, providing a robust solution for computational pathology applications with limited annotations.

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) is vital in computational
pathology, where dense annotations are costly and limited. Existing methods
often rely on pixel-level consistency, which propagates noisy pseudo-labels and
produces fragmented or topologically invalid masks. We propose Topology Graph
Consistency (TGC), a framework that integrates graph-theoretic constraints by
aligning Laplacian spectra, component counts, and adjacency statistics between
prediction graphs and references. This enforces global topology and improves
segmentation accuracy. Experiments on GlaS and CRAG demonstrate that TGC
achieves state-of-the-art performance under 5-10% supervision and significantly
narrows the gap to full supervision. Code is available at

### [5] [A review of Recent Techniques for Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22690)
*Andrea Asperti,Salvatore Fiorilla,Simone Nardi,Lorenzo Orsini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This survey paper reviews both supervised and unsupervised person re-identification methods, highlighting that supervised approaches have reached maturity while unsupervised techniques are rapidly advancing and closing the performance gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the scalability challenges of supervised person Re-ID methods that require large annotated datasets, and to explore the promising developments in unsupervised approaches that leverage abundant unlabeled data.

Method: The survey employs a dual-focus approach: (1) reviewing and categorizing significant supervised person Re-ID publications to assess current state-of-the-art, and (2) exploring recent advancements in unsupervised person Re-ID over the past three years to identify emerging trends.

Result: The survey finds that supervised person re-identification has little room for further improvement, while unsupervised techniques have shown promising developments and are narrowing the performance gap with supervised approaches.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that unsupervised person re-identification represents a promising direction that may eventually converge with supervised methods in performance, contributing to the evolving narrative of person re-identification research.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReId), a crucial task in surveillance, involves
matching individuals across different camera views. The advent of Deep
Learning, especially supervised techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks
and Attention Mechanisms, has significantly enhanced person Re-ID. However, the
success of supervised approaches hinges on vast amounts of annotated data,
posing scalability challenges in data labeling and computational costs. To
address these limitations, recent research has shifted towards unsupervised
person re-identification. Leveraging abundant unlabeled data, unsupervised
methods aim to overcome the need for pairwise labelled data. Although
traditionally trailing behind supervised approaches, unsupervised techniques
have shown promising developments in recent years, signalling a narrowing
performance gap. Motivated by this evolving landscape, our survey pursues two
primary objectives. First, we review and categorize significant publications in
supervised person re-identification, providing an in-depth overview of the
current state-of-the-art and emphasizing little room for further improvement in
this domain. Second, we explore the latest advancements in unsupervised person
re-identification over the past three years, offering insights into emerging
trends and shedding light on the potential convergence of performance between
supervised and unsupervised paradigms. This dual-focus survey aims to
contribute to the evolving narrative of person re-identification, capturing
both the mature landscape of supervised techniques and the promising outcomes
in the realm of unsupervised learning.

### [6] [Sequential Token Merging: Revisiting Hidden States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22691)
*Yan Wen,Peng Ye,Lin Zhang,Baopu Li,Jiakang Yuan,Yaoxin Yang,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Mambas (ViMs) face quadratic token scaling issues. The paper proposes Sequential Token Merging (STM) with bidirectional merging and hidden states protection to reduce tokens while preserving accuracy, achieving minimal performance degradation even with significant token reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViMs achieve success with sub-quadratic complexity but efficiency is constrained by quadratic token scaling with image resolution. Existing methods overlook ViMs' intrinsic Limited Directional Sequential Dependence (LDSD) and Mamba's selective scan enables gradual information aggregation.

Method: Proposed Sequential Token Merging (STM) with: 1) Bidirectional nearest neighbor merging for symmetric spatial aggregation to preserve sequential dependencies, and 2) Hidden states protection to stabilize hidden states around class token. Leverages Mamba's layer-wise loss convergence to convert temporal forgetfulness into stability.

Result: STM achieves 1.0% accuracy drop for ViM-Ti at 20% token reduction, and only 1.4% degradation for ViM-S at 40% reduction. Achieves state-of-the-art efficiency with minimal complexity.

Conclusion: STM provides superior token reduction while maintaining accuracy, offering new insights into state-space model dynamics and achieving state-of-the-art efficiency with minimal performance degradation.

Abstract: Vision Mambas (ViMs) achieve remarkable success with sub-quadratic
complexity, but their efficiency remains constrained by quadratic token scaling
with image resolution. While existing methods address token redundancy, they
overlook ViMs' intrinsic Limited Directional Sequential Dependence (LDSD) - a
critical information flow mechanism revealed in our analysis. We further
identify Mamba's selective scan enables gradual information aggregation in
hidden states. Based on these insights, we propose Sequential Token Merging
(STM), featuring: 1) Bidirectional nearest neighbor merging to preserve
sequential dependencies through symmetric spatial aggregation, and 2) Hidden
states protection to stabilize the hidden states around the class token. STM
strategically leverages Mamba's layer-wise loss convergence to convert temporal
forgetfulness into stability. Experiments demonstrate STM's superiority: 1.0%
accuracy drop for ViM-Ti at 20% token reduction, and only 1.4% degradation for
ViM-S at 40% reduction. Our method achieves state-of-the-art efficiency with
minimal complexity, while providing new insights into state-space model
dynamics. Codes will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper provides a comprehensive survey of super-resolution (SR) methods, covering single image SR (SISR), video SR (VSR), stereo SR (SSR), and light field SR (LFSR), analyzing over 150 SISR methods, 70 VSR approaches, and 30 SSR/LFSR techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SR surveys are domain-specific and lack comprehensive overviews. The field has expanded significantly with deep learning advances and growing demand for high-quality visual applications, necessitating a holistic review.

Method: Conducted an in-depth review of diverse SR methods, analyzing methodologies, datasets, evaluation protocols, empirical results, and complexity. Created taxonomy based on backbone structures and explored under-studied open issues.

Conclusion: This work serves as a valuable resource and offers guidance to researchers in the super-resolution domain, providing a comprehensive overview that addresses the limitations of existing domain-specific surveys.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) has garnered significant attention within the computer
vision community, driven by advances in deep learning (DL) techniques and the
growing demand for high-quality visual applications. With the expansion of this
field, numerous surveys have emerged. Most existing surveys focus on specific
domains, lacking a comprehensive overview of this field. Here, we present an
in-depth review of diverse SR methods, encompassing single image
super-resolution (SISR), video super-resolution (VSR), stereo super-resolution
(SSR), and light field super-resolution (LFSR). We extensively cover over 150
SISR methods, nearly 70 VSR approaches, and approximately 30 techniques for SSR
and LFSR. We analyze methodologies, datasets, evaluation protocols, empirical
results, and complexity. In addition, we conducted a taxonomy based on each
backbone structure according to the diverse purposes. We also explore valuable
yet under-studied open issues in the field. We believe that this work will

### [8] [Learning Hyperspectral Images with Curated Text Prompts for Efficient Multimodal Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22697)
*Abhiroop Chatterjee,Susmita Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a parameter-efficient CLIP-style vision-language model for hyperspectral image understanding that aligns voxel-level embeddings with text representations using contrastive learning and descriptive prompts, achieving state-of-the-art performance with only 0.07% parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral images have high-dimensional 3D voxel structures that make cross-modal alignment with language models challenging and underexplored. As data requirements grow, efficient learning depends on curating high-value data rather than brute-force scaling.

Method: A CLIP-style contrastive training framework that maps voxel-level embeddings from a vision backbone to a frozen large embedding model's latent space. Uses a trainable probe to align vision features with text tokens, with contrastive loss on hard and semi-hard negatives plus positive pairs. Descriptive prompts encode class semantics as structured anchors.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 0.07% parameter updates: +0.92 OA and +1.60 Kappa on Indian Pines, +0.69 OA and +0.90 Kappa on Pavia University. Uses 50× fewer parameters than DCTN and 90× fewer than SS-TMNet.

Conclusion: The proposed parameter-efficient VLM framework effectively aligns hyperspectral image embeddings with language representations, demonstrating that careful curation and distillation can outperform brute-force scaling while using minimal additional parameters.

Abstract: As data requirements continue to grow, efficient learning increasingly
depends on the curation and distillation of high-value data rather than
brute-force scaling of model sizes. In the case of a hyperspectral image (HSI),
the challenge is amplified by the high-dimensional 3D voxel structure, where
each spatial location is associated with hundreds of contiguous spectral
channels. While vision and language models have been optimized effectively for
natural image or text tasks, their cross-modal alignment in the hyperspectral
domain remains an open and underexplored problem. In this article, we make an
attempt to optimize a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for hyperspectral scene
understanding by exploiting a CLIP-style contrastive training framework. Our
framework maps voxel-level embeddings from a vision backbone onto the latent
space of a frozen large embedding model (LEM), where a trainable probe aligns
vision features with the model's textual token representations. The two
modalities are aligned via a contrastive loss restricted to a curated set of
hard (closest wrong classes) and semi-hard (random distractors) negatives,
along with positive pairs. To further enhance alignment, descriptive prompts
that encode class semantics are introduced and act as structured anchors for
the HSI embeddings. It is seen that the proposed method updates only 0.07
percent of the total parameters, yet yields state-of-the-art performance. For
example, on Indian Pines (IP) the model produces better results over unimodal
and multimodal baselines by +0.92 Overall Accuracy (OA) and +1.60 Kappa
($\kappa$), while on Pavia University (PU) data it provides gains of +0.69 OA
and +0.90 $\kappa$. Moreover, this is achieved with the set of parameters,
nearly 50$\times$ smaller than DCTN and 90$\times$ smaller than SS-TMNet.

### [9] [Global Prompt Refinement with Non-Interfering Attention Masking for One-Shot Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22700)
*Zhuang Qi,Pan Yu,Lei Meng,Sijin Zhou,Han Yu,Xiaoxiao Li,Xiangxu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPR-NIAM is a one-shot federated prompt learning method that uses attention masking to restrict interaction between text and prompt embeddings, enabling better cross-task generalization without multi-round communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated prompt learning methods require multi-round communication to leverage global information, and one-shot methods lack cross-task generalization capabilities.

Method: Uses attention isolation module to suppress prompt-to-text attention and reweight text-to-prompt attention, plus cross-silo collaborative refinement to integrate decentralized visual knowledge and align multi-source cross-modal knowledge.

Result: Outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods on ten benchmark datasets in both class-level and domain-level generalization tasks.

Conclusion: GPR-NIAM effectively addresses the limitations of existing FPL methods by enabling one-shot learning with strong cross-task generalization through non-interfering attention masking and collaborative refinement.

Abstract: Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) enables communication-efficient adaptation by
tuning lightweight prompts on top of frozen pre-trained models. Existing FPL
methods typically rely on global information, which is only available after the
second training round, to facilitate collaboration among client models.
Therefore, they are inherently dependent on multi-round communication to fully
exhibit their strengths. Moreover, existing one-shot federated learning methods
typically focus on fitting seen tasks, but lack cross-task generalization. To
bridge this gap, we propose the Global Prompt Refinement with Non-Interfering
Attention Masking (GPR-NIAM) method for one-shot FPL. The core idea is to
design a masking mechanism that restricts excessive interaction between the
original text embeddings and the learnable prompt embeddings. GPR-NIAM achieves
this through the collaboration of two key modules. Firstly, the attention
isolation module suppresses attention from the learnable prompt tokens to the
original text tokens, and reweights the reverse attention which preserves
generalization across tasks. Secondly, the cross-silo collaborative refinement
module integrates decentralized visual knowledge into a unified base and
calibrates the global prompt through multi-source cross-modal knowledge
alignment, further mitigating the inconsistency caused by data heterogeneity.
Extensive experiments conducted on ten benchmark datasets under two tasks show
that GPR-NIAM outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods in both class-level
and domain-level generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GZSL-MoE integrates Mixture-of-Experts layers into Generative Zero-Shot Learning for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation, enabling recognition of unseen classes by generating realistic fake features that resemble real features from seen classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of 3D semantic segmentation when comprehensive training data for all object classes is unavailable, particularly in Human-Robot Collaboration environments where robots need to recognize both seen and unseen objects.

Method: Combines Generative Zero-Shot Learning with Mixture-of-Experts layers in Generator and Discriminator components to generate fake features that closely resemble real features extracted using pre-trained KPConv model on seen classes, applied to COVERED dataset.

Result: The GZSL-MoE model demonstrates enhanced performance on both seen and unseen classes in 3D point cloud semantic segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: GZSL-MoE provides a promising solution for understanding complex 3D environments by enabling zero-shot learning capabilities through the integration of Mixture-of-Experts with generative models, particularly valuable when complete training data is unavailable.

Abstract: Generative Zero-Shot Learning approach (GZSL) has demonstrated significant
potential in 3D point cloud semantic segmentation tasks. GZSL leverages
generative models like GANs or VAEs to synthesize realistic features (real
features) of unseen classes. This allows the model to label unseen classes
during testing, despite being trained only on seen classes. In this context, we
introduce the Generalized Zero-Shot Learning based-upon Mixture-of-Experts
(GZSL-MoE) model. This model incorporates Mixture-of-Experts layers (MoE) to
generate fake features that closely resemble real features extracted using a
pre-trained KPConv (Kernel Point Convolution) model on seen classes. The main
contribution of this paper is the integration of Mixture-of-Experts into the
Generator and Discriminator components of the Generative Zero-Shot Learning
model for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation, applied to the COVERED dataset
(CollabOratiVE Robot Environment Dataset) for Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC)
environments. By combining the Generative Zero-Shot Learning model with
Mixture-of- Experts, GZSL-MoE for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation provides
a promising solution for understanding complex 3D environments, especially when
comprehensive training data for all object classes is unavailable. The
performance evaluation of the GZSL-MoE model highlights its ability to enhance
performance on both seen and unseen classes. Keywords Generalized Zero-Shot

### [11] [IBiT: Utilizing Inductive Biases to Create a More Data Efficient Attention Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22719)
*Adithya Giri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introducing inductive biases through learned masks allows Vision Transformers to learn effectively on small datasets without Knowledge Distillation, resulting in more accurate models while retaining explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers lack the inductive biases of CNNs, which limits their performance on small datasets. The goal is to enable Vision Transformers to learn effectively on smaller datasets by incorporating these biases.

Method: Developed Inductively Biased Image Transformers (IBiT) that introduce inductive biases through learned masks, allowing the model to adapt to smaller datasets without requiring Knowledge Distillation.

Result: IBiT models are significantly more accurate on small datasets compared to standard Vision Transformers, while maintaining the explainability benefits of Transformers.

Conclusion: Learned masks can successfully introduce inductive biases into Vision Transformers, enabling them to perform well on small datasets and bridging the gap with CNNs while preserving Transformer advantages.

Abstract: In recent years, Transformer-based architectures have become the dominant
method for Computer Vision applications. While Transformers are explainable and
scale well with dataset size, they lack the inductive biases of Convolutional
Neural Networks. While these biases may be learned on large datasets, we show
that introducing these inductive biases through learned masks allow Vision
Transformers to learn on much smaller datasets without Knowledge Distillation.
These Transformers, which we call Inductively Biased Image Transformers (IBiT),
are significantly more accurate on small datasets, while retaining the
explainability Transformers.

### [12] [LayoutAgent: A Vision-Language Agent Guided Compositional Diffusion for Spatial Layout Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22720)
*Zezhong Fan,Xiaohan Li,Luyi Ma,Kai Zhao,Liang Peng,Topojoy Biswas,Evren Korpeoglu,Kaushiki Nag,Kannan Achan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayoutAgent is an agentic framework that combines vision-language reasoning with compositional diffusion to generate realistic multi-object scene layouts that respect semantic relations and physical plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models lack explicit spatial reasoning for realistic object layouts, while traditional spatial planning methods in robotics struggle with semantic richness in visual scenes. The paper aims to bridge this gap.

Method: The framework uses visual-language models for preprocessing (segmentation, object size estimation, scene graph construction, prompt rewriting), compositional diffusion for bounding box synthesis respecting object relations, and foreground-conditioned image generation for final scene composition.

Result: Experiments show LayoutAgent outperforms state-of-the-art layout generation models in layout coherence, spatial realism and aesthetic alignment.

Conclusion: LayoutAgent successfully unifies vision-language reasoning with compositional diffusion to generate physically plausible and semantically rich multi-object scene layouts.

Abstract: Designing realistic multi-object scenes requires not only generating images,
but also planning spatial layouts that respect semantic relations and physical
plausibility. On one hand, while recent advances in diffusion models have
enabled high-quality image generation, they lack explicit spatial reasoning,
leading to unrealistic object layouts. On the other hand, traditional spatial
planning methods in robotics emphasize geometric and relational consistency,
but they struggle to capture semantic richness in visual scenes. To bridge this
gap, in this paper, we propose LayoutAgent, an agentic framework that unifies
vision-language reasoning with compositional diffusion for layout generation.
Given multiple input images with target objects in them, our method first
employs visual-language model to preprocess the inputs through segmentation,
object size estimation, scene graph construction, and prompt rewriting. Then we
leverage compositional diffusion-a method traditionally used in robotics-to
synthesize bounding boxes that respect object relations encoded in the scene
graph for spatial layouts. In the end, a foreground-conditioned image generator
composes the complete scene by rendering the objects into the planned layout
guided by designed prompts. Experiments demonstrate that LayoutAgent
outperforms other state-of-the-art layout generation models in layout
coherence, spatial realism and aesthetic alignment.

### [13] [CompareBench: A Benchmark for Visual Comparison Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22737)
*Jie Cai,Kangning Yang,Lan Fu,Jiaming Ding,Jinlong Li,Huiming Sun,Daitao Xing,Jinglin Shen,Zibo Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompareBench is a new benchmark for evaluating visual comparison reasoning in VLMs, revealing systematic limitations in temporal ordering, spatial relations, and basic counting/geometric comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual comparison reasoning is a fundamental but understudied skill in vision-language models that needs systematic evaluation.

Method: Created CompareBench with 1000 QA pairs across four tasks (quantity, temporal, geometric, spatial) derived from auxiliary datasets TallyBench and HistCaps, and evaluated both closed-source and open-source VLMs.

Result: Models show scaling trends but consistently fail at temporal ordering and spatial relations, and make mistakes in basic counting and geometric comparisons that are trivial for humans.

Conclusion: Visual comparison remains a systematic blind spot for current VLMs, and CompareBench provides a foundation for advancing more reliable multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: We introduce CompareBench, a benchmark for evaluating visual comparison
reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs), a fundamental yet understudied
skill. CompareBench consists of 1000 QA pairs across four tasks: quantity
(600), temporal (100), geometric (200), and spatial (100). It is derived from
two auxiliary datasets that we constructed: TallyBench (2000 counting images
with QA) and HistCaps (515 historical images with bilingual captions). We
evaluate both closed-source APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude) and open-source
models (Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL series). Results show clear scaling trends but
also reveal critical limitations: even the strongest models consistently fail
at temporal ordering and spatial relations, and they often make mistakes in
basic counting and geometric comparisons that are trivial for humans. These
findings demonstrate that visual comparison remains a systematic blind spot for
current VLMs. By providing controlled, diverse, and diagnostic evaluation,
CompareBench establishes a foundation for advancing more reliable multimodal
reasoning.

### [14] [MILR: Improving Multimodal Image Generation via Test-Time Latent Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22761)
*Yapeng Mi,Hengli Li,Yanpeng Zhao,Chenxi Li,Huimin Wu,Xiaojian Ma,Song-Chun Zhu,Ying Nian Wu,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MILR is a test-time reasoning method that jointly reasons over image and text in a unified latent space using policy gradient optimization, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks including 80% improvement on knowledge-intensive tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning-based image generation methods are limited to single modalities or require high-quality reasoning data for fine-tuning, which restricts their effectiveness and applicability.

Method: MILR performs joint reasoning over image and text in a unified latent vector space by searching through discrete token representations using policy gradient method guided by an image quality critic, operating entirely at test time within the MUG framework.

Result: MILR achieves state-of-the-art results on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and WISE benchmarks, with 80% improvement over baseline on knowledge-intensive WISE (overall score 0.63), and demonstrates strong temporal and cultural reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: Joint reasoning in unified latent space is key to MILR's strong performance, enabling effective cross-modal reasoning without requiring fine-tuning data and demonstrating non-trivial reasoning capabilities across different domains.

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented machine learning systems have shown improved performance
in various domains, including image generation. However, existing
reasoning-based methods for image generation either restrict reasoning to a
single modality (image or text) or rely on high-quality reasoning data for
fine-tuning. To tackle these limitations, we propose MILR, a test-time method
that jointly reasons over image and text in a unified latent vector space.
Reasoning in MILR is performed by searching through vector representations of
discrete image and text tokens. Practically, this is implemented via the policy
gradient method, guided by an image quality critic. We instantiate MILR within
the unified multimodal understanding and generation (MUG) framework that
natively supports language reasoning before image synthesis and thus
facilitates cross-modal reasoning. The intermediate model outputs, which are to
be optimized, serve as the unified latent space, enabling MILR to operate
entirely at test time. We evaluate MILR on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and WISE,
achieving state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks. Notably, on
knowledge-intensive WISE, MILR attains an overall score of 0.63, improving over
the baseline by 80%. Our further analysis indicates that joint reasoning in the
unified latent space is the key to its strong performance. Moreover, our
qualitative studies reveal MILR's non-trivial ability in temporal and cultural

*Tangqi Shi,Pietro Lio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UESA-Net is a U-shaped network with multidirectional shrinkage attention that achieves state-of-the-art performance in breast and thyroid ultrasound segmentation, addressing challenges like speckle noise and weak global-local feature interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast and thyroid cancers are increasing public health burdens. Ultrasound imaging suffers from speckle noise, overlapping structures, and weak global-local feature interactions, making existing networks struggle to reconcile high-level semantics with low-level spatial details.

Method: Proposed UESA-Net with encoder-decoder architecture using multidirectional shrinkage attention. Attention modules operate along horizontal, vertical, and depth directions with shrinkage strategy to integrate prior knowledge and local features. Decoder applies pairwise shrinkage mechanism combining prior low-level physical cues with encoder features.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on TN3K (3493 images) with IoU 0.8487 and BUSI (780 images) with IoU 0.6495.

Conclusion: UESA-Net effectively aggregates multidirectional spatial information and prior knowledge to improve robustness and accuracy in breast and thyroid ultrasound segmentation, demonstrating superior performance to existing methods.

Abstract: Background: Breast and thyroid cancers pose an increasing public-health
burden. Ultrasound imaging is a cost-effective, real-time modality for lesion
detection and segmentation, yet suffers from speckle noise, overlapping
structures, and weak global-local feature interactions. Existing networks
struggle to reconcile high-level semantics with low-level spatial details. We
aim to develop a segmentation framework that bridges the semantic gap between
global context and local detail in noisy ultrasound images.
  Methods: We propose UESA-Net, a U-shaped network with multidirectional
shrinkage attention. The encoder-decoder architecture captures long-range
dependencies and fine-grained structures of lesions. Within each encoding
block, attention modules operate along horizontal, vertical, and depth
directions to exploit spatial details, while a shrinkage (threshold) strategy
integrates prior knowledge and local features. The decoder mirrors the encoder
but applies a pairwise shrinkage mechanism, combining prior low-level physical
cues with corresponding encoder features to enhance context modeling.
  Results: On two public datasets - TN3K (3493 images) and BUSI (780 images) -
UESA-Net achieved state-of-the-art performance with intersection-over-union
(IoU) scores of 0.8487 and 0.6495, respectively.
  Conclusions: UESA-Net effectively aggregates multidirectional spatial
information and prior knowledge to improve robustness and accuracy in breast
and thyroid ultrasound segmentation, demonstrating superior performance to
existing methods on multiple benchmarks.

TL;DR: PartCo is a novel framework that enhances Generalized Category Discovery by incorporating part-level visual feature correspondences to capture finer-grained semantic structures, improving performance of existing GCD methods without major modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCD methods rely on semantic labels and global image representations, overlooking detailed part-level cues crucial for distinguishing closely related categories.

Method: Introduces PartCo (Part-Level Correspondence Prior) framework that leverages part-level visual feature correspondences to capture finer-grained semantic structures and understand category relationships more nuancedly.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show PartCo significantly improves current GCD approaches' performance, achieving state-of-the-art results by bridging semantic labels and part-level visual compositions.

Conclusion: PartCo sets new benchmarks for GCD by seamlessly integrating with existing methods and demonstrating superior performance through part-level correspondence modeling.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify both known and novel
categories within unlabeled data by leveraging a set of labeled examples from
known categories. Existing GCD methods primarily depend on semantic labels and
global image representations, often overlooking the detailed part-level cues
that are crucial for distinguishing closely related categories. In this paper,
we introduce PartCo, short for Part-Level Correspondence Prior, a novel
framework that enhances category discovery by incorporating part-level visual
feature correspondences. By leveraging part-level relationships, PartCo
captures finer-grained semantic structures, enabling a more nuanced
understanding of category relationships. Importantly, PartCo seamlessly
integrates with existing GCD methods without requiring significant
modifications. Our extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that PartCo significantly improves the performance of current GCD
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results by bridging the gap between
semantic labels and part-level visual compositions, thereby setting new

*Komal Kumar,Rao Muhammad Anwer,Fahad Shahbaz Khan,Salman Khan,Ivan Laptev,Hisham Cholakkal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEFT is an efficient fine-tuning framework for Text-to-Image models that decomposes weight matrix updates into two components - a projection onto a low-rank subspace complement and a low-rank update - achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks while maintaining editability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current efficient fine-tuning methods struggle to balance learning new concepts from limited data, retaining instruction-following capabilities for multiple tasks, and maintaining editability with various prompts, all while minimizing computational resources.

Method: DEFT adapts pre-trained weight matrices by decomposing updates into two trainable components: (1) projection onto the complement of a low-rank subspace defined by one matrix, and (2) a low-rank update using another matrix for flexible parameter adaptation within that subspace.

Result: Extensive experiments on Dreambooth, Dreambench Plus, InsDet, and VisualCloze datasets with Stable Diffusion and unified models demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, highlighting emergent properties of efficient fine-tuning.

Conclusion: DEFT provides an effective decompositional approach for efficient fine-tuning that successfully balances concept learning, task unification, and editability while minimizing computational requirements.

Abstract: Efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) models involves
adjusting the model to suit a particular task or dataset while minimizing
computational resources and limiting the number of trainable parameters.
However, it often faces challenges in striking a trade-off between aligning
with the target distribution: learning a novel concept from a limited image for
personalization and retaining the instruction ability needed for unifying
multiple tasks, all while maintaining editability (aligning with a variety of
prompts or in-context generation). In this work, we introduce DEFT,
Decompositional Efficient Fine-Tuning, an efficient fine-tuning framework that
adapts a pre-trained weight matrix by decomposing its update into two
components with two trainable matrices: (1) a projection onto the complement of
a low-rank subspace spanned by a low-rank matrix, and (2) a low-rank update.
The single trainable low-rank matrix defines the subspace, while the other
trainable low-rank matrix enables flexible parameter adaptation within that
subspace. We conducted extensive experiments on the Dreambooth and Dreambench
Plus datasets for personalization, the InsDet dataset for object and scene
adaptation, and the VisualCloze dataset for a universal image generation
framework through visual in-context learning with both Stable Diffusion and a
unified model. Our results demonstrated state-of-the-art performance,
highlighting the emergent properties of efficient fine-tuning. Our code is

TL;DR: VideoScore2 is a multi-dimensional video evaluation framework that assesses visual quality, text-video alignment, and physical consistency while providing interpretable rationales, outperforming existing methods on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video evaluators provide only single opaque scores or coarse analysis, lacking comprehensive assessment of video quality across multiple dimensions and interpretability.

Method: Two-stage training pipeline using supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on a large-scale dataset (VideoFeedback2) with 27,168 human-annotated videos containing scores and reasoning traces.

Result: Achieves 44.35 accuracy (+5.94 improvement) on VideoScore-Bench-v2 and 50.37 average performance (+4.32 improvement) across four out-of-domain benchmarks, while providing interpretable assessments.

Conclusion: VideoScore2 bridges the gap between evaluation and controllable generation through effective reward modeling for Best-of-N sampling, offering comprehensive and interpretable video quality assessment.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have produced increasingly
realistic and diverse content, yet evaluating such videos remains a fundamental
challenge due to their multi-faceted nature encompassing visual quality,
semantic alignment, and physical consistency. Existing evaluators and reward
models are limited to single opaque scores, lack interpretability, or provide
only coarse analysis, making them insufficient for capturing the comprehensive
nature of video quality assessment. We present VideoScore2, a
multi-dimensional, interpretable, and human-aligned framework that explicitly
evaluates visual quality, text-to-video alignment, and physical/common-sense
consistency while producing detailed chain-of-thought rationales. Our model is
trained on a large-scale dataset VideoFeedback2 containing 27,168
human-annotated videos with both scores and reasoning traces across three
dimensions, using a two-stage pipeline of supervised fine-tuning followed by
reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to
enhance analytical robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
VideoScore2 achieves superior performance with 44.35 (+5.94) accuracy on our
in-domain benchmark VideoScore-Bench-v2 and 50.37 (+4.32) average performance
across four out-of-domain benchmarks (VideoGenReward-Bench, VideoPhy2, etc),
while providing interpretable assessments that bridge the gap between
evaluation and controllable generation through effective reward modeling for
Best-of-N sampling. Project Page: https://tiger-ai-lab.github.io/VideoScore2/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TRUST is a test-time adaptation method for State Space Models that uses uncertainty-guided traversal permutations to improve robustness against distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State Space Models like VMamba show degraded performance under distribution shifts, despite being efficient alternatives to Vision Transformers.

Method: Leverages diverse traversal permutations to generate multiple causal perspectives, uses model predictions as pseudo-labels to update Mamba-specific parameters, and averages adapted weights across traversal scans.

Result: Experiments on seven benchmarks show consistent improvement in robustness and outperformance of existing TTA methods.

Conclusion: TRUST is the first approach that explicitly leverages SSM architectural properties for adaptation, effectively addressing distribution shift challenges.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to Vision
Transformers (ViTs), with VMamba standing out as a pioneering architecture
designed for vision tasks. However, their generalization performance degrades
significantly under distribution shifts. To address this limitation, we propose
TRUST (Test-Time Refinement using Uncertainty-Guided SSM Traverses), a novel
test-time adaptation (TTA) method that leverages diverse traversal permutations
to generate multiple causal perspectives of the input image. Model predictions
serve as pseudo-labels to guide updates of the Mamba-specific parameters, and
the adapted weights are averaged to integrate the learned information across
traversal scans. Altogether, TRUST is the first approach that explicitly
leverages the unique architectural properties of SSMs for adaptation.
Experiments on seven benchmarks show that TRUST consistently improves
robustness and outperforms existing TTA methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMPB is the first extensive benchmark for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on personalization, comprising 10k image-query pairs across 111 concepts in four categories, revealing that most VLMs struggle with personalization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual personalization is essential for user-facing AI systems, but current large VLMs remain underexplored in their ability to adapt to individual users, creating a need for systematic evaluation.

Method: Created MMPB benchmark with 10k image-query pairs across 111 concepts in humans, animals, objects, and characters. Evaluated 23 VLMs using three-stage protocol: concept injection, multi-turn dialogue, and personalized querying.

Result: Most VLMs (including closed-source models) struggle with personalization, particularly in maintaining dialogue consistency, handling user preferences, and adapting to visual cues. Key challenges include refusal behaviors and long-context forgetting.

Conclusion: MMPB identifies substantial room for improvement in VLM personalization and provides a scalable benchmark foundation for future research toward truly personalized multi-modal AI systems.

Abstract: Visual personalization is essential in user-facing AI systems such as smart
homes and healthcare, where aligning model behavior with user-centric concepts
is critical. However, recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), despite their
broad applicability, remain underexplored in their ability to adapt to
individual users. In this paper, we introduce MMPB, the first extensive
benchmark for evaluating VLMs on personalization. MMPB comprises 10k
image-query pairs and includes 111 personalizable concepts across four
categories: humans, animals, objects, and characters, with the human category
enriched with preference-grounded queries. We structure personalization into
three main task types, each highlighting a different key property of VLMs.
Using 23 widely used VLMs including both open- and closed-source models, we
evaluate personalization performance via a three-stage protocol: concept
injection, multi-turn dialogue, and personalized querying. Our findings
indicate that most VLMs (including some closed-source models) struggle with
personalization, particularly in maintaining consistency over dialogue,
handling user preferences, and adapting to visual cues. Our analysis reveals
that the challenges in VLM personalization (such as refusal behaviors and
long-context forgetting) highlight substantial room for improvement. By
identifying these limitations and offering a scalable benchmark, MMPB offers
valuable insights and a solid foundation for future research toward truly
personalized multi-modal AI. Project Page: aidaslab.github.io/MMPB

*Roie Kazoom,Alon Goldberg,Hodaya Cohen,Ofer Hadar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for fully controllable adversarial patch generation that allows attackers to choose both input image and target class, achieving over 99% attack success rates while maintaining visual realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial patch attacks rely on unrealistic white-box assumptions, untargeted objectives, or produce visually conspicuous patches that limit real-world applicability.

Method: Combines generative U-Net design with Grad-CAM-guided patch placement for semantic-aware localization that maximizes attack effectiveness while preserving visual realism.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across convolutional networks (DenseNet-121, ResNet-50) and vision transformers (ViT-B/16, Swin-B/16) with attack success rates and target-class success consistently exceeding 99%.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a new benchmark for adversarial robustness research by simultaneously ensuring realism, targeted control, and black-box applicability - the three most challenging dimensions of patch-based attacks.

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks pose a severe threat to deep neural networks, yet
most existing approaches rely on unrealistic white-box assumptions, untargeted
objectives, or produce visually conspicuous patches that limit real-world
applicability. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for fully
controllable adversarial patch generation, where the attacker can freely choose
both the input image x and the target class y target, thereby dictating the
exact misclassification outcome. Our method combines a generative U-Net design
with Grad-CAM-guided patch placement, enabling semantic-aware localization that
maximizes attack effectiveness while preserving visual realism. Extensive
experiments across convolutional networks (DenseNet-121, ResNet-50) and vision
transformers (ViT-B/16, Swin-B/16, among others) demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance across all settings, with attack success
rates (ASR) and target-class success (TCS) consistently exceeding 99%.
  Importantly, we show that our method not only outperforms prior white-box
attacks and untargeted baselines, but also surpasses existing non-realistic
approaches that produce detectable artifacts. By simultaneously ensuring
realism, targeted control, and black-box applicability-the three most
challenging dimensions of patch-based attacks-our framework establishes a new
benchmark for adversarial robustness research, bridging the gap between
theoretical attack strength and practical stealthiness.

*Ibrahim Delibasoglu,Fredrik Heintz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrossScaleNet is a novel architecture that combines patch-based cross-attention with multi-scale processing to achieve both high forecasting performance and enhanced temporal explainability, outperforming transformer-based models while providing intrinsic explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional post-hoc methods for temporal saliency detection are computationally expensive and complex, while existing explainable models often fail to maintain strong performance on standard benchmarks. There's a need for models that offer both transparency and high accuracy.

Method: Uses a patch-based cross-attention mechanism with multi-scale processing, embedding attention mechanisms directly into the training process to provide intrinsic explainability for temporal saliency.

Result: Outperforms most transformer-based models on real-world forecasting tasks, achieves superior performance in both temporal saliency detection and forecasting accuracy, and maintains robust performance across datasets of varying complexity.

Conclusion: CrossScaleNet successfully bridges the gap between explainability and performance, offering a balanced approach that effectively captures temporal saliency while delivering state-of-the-art forecasting performance without sacrificing predictive accuracy.

Abstract: Explainability in time series forecasting is essential for improving model
transparency and supporting informed decision-making. In this work, we present
CrossScaleNet, an innovative architecture that combines a patch-based
cross-attention mechanism with multi-scale processing to achieve both high
performance and enhanced temporal explainability. By embedding attention
mechanisms into the training process, our model provides intrinsic
explainability for temporal saliency, making its decision-making process more
transparent. Traditional post-hoc methods for temporal saliency detection are
computationally expensive, particularly when compared to feature importance
detection. While ablation techniques may suffice for datasets with fewer
features, identifying temporal saliency poses greater challenges due to its
complexity. We validate CrossScaleNet on synthetic datasets with known saliency
ground truth and on established public benchmarks, demonstrating the robustness
of our method in identifying temporal saliency. Experiments on real-world
datasets for forecasting task show that our approach consistently outperforms
most transformer-based models, offering better explainability without
sacrificing predictive accuracy. Our evaluations demonstrate superior
performance in both temporal saliency detection and forecasting accuracy.
Moreover, we highlight that existing models claiming explainability often fail
to maintain strong performance on standard benchmarks. CrossScaleNet addresses
this gap, offering a balanced approach that captures temporal saliency
effectively while delivering state-of-the-art forecasting performance across
datasets of varying complexity.

TL;DR: A transfer learning approach using multimodal interactive perception with MAMBA and slice interaction module achieves significant improvement in lung cancer IGTV segmentation, increasing Dice score from 0.385 to 0.609.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, and accurate IGTV delineation in PET/CT imaging is crucial for radiation therapy but challenged by limited annotated datasets and attenuated PET signal intensity at tumor boundaries.

Method: Transfer learning-based methodology using multimodal interactive perception network with MAMBA pre-trained on GTV datasets and fine-tuned on private IGTV cohort (LUCID dataset), with a novel slice interaction module (SIM) in 2.5D segmentation framework to model inter-slice relationships.

Result: Achieved Dice score of 0.609 on private IGTV dataset, substantially surpassing the conventional baseline score of 0.385.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates potential of transfer learning combined with multimodal techniques and SIM to enhance reliability and clinical relevance of IGTV segmentation for lung cancer radiation therapy planning.

Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancerrelated deaths globally.
Accurate delineation of internal gross tumor volume (IGTV) in PET/CT imaging is
pivotal for optimal radiation therapy in mobile tumors such as lung cancer to
account for tumor motion, yet is hindered by the limited availability of
annotated IGTV datasets and attenuated PET signal intensity at tumor
boundaries. In this study, we present a transfer learningbased methodology
utilizing a multimodal interactive perception network with MAMBA, pre-trained
on extensive gross tumor volume (GTV) datasets and subsequently fine-tuned on a
private IGTV cohort. This cohort constitutes the PET/CT subset of the
Lung-cancer Unified Cross-modal Imaging Dataset (LUCID). To further address the
challenge of weak PET intensities in IGTV peripheral slices, we introduce a
slice interaction module (SIM) within a 2.5D segmentation framework to
effectively model inter-slice relationships. Our proposed module integrates
channel and spatial attention branches with depthwise convolutions, enabling
more robust learning of slice-to-slice dependencies and thereby improving
overall segmentation performance. A comprehensive experimental evaluation
demonstrates that our approach achieves a Dice of 0.609 on the private IGTV
dataset, substantially surpassing the conventional baseline score of 0.385.
This work highlights the potential of transfer learning, coupled with advanced
multimodal techniques and a SIM to enhance the reliability and clinical
relevance of IGTV segmentation for lung cancer radiation therapy planning.

Conclusion: The approach streamlines event data generation, significantly reduces labeling costs, and demonstrates powerful text-based generation capabilities inherited from foundation models.

Abstract: In recent years, event cameras have gained significant attention due to their
bio-inspired properties, such as high temporal resolution and high dynamic

vision tasks remains challenging and costly. In this paper, we present
ControlEvents, a diffusion-based generative model designed to synthesize

diffusion prior from foundation models, such as Stable Diffusion, enabling
high-quality event data generation with minimal fine-tuning and limited labeled
data. Our method streamlines the data generation process and significantly
reduces the cost of producing labeled event datasets. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach by synthesizing event data for visual
recognition, 2D skeleton estimation, and 3D body pose estimation. Our
experiments show that the synthesized labeled event data enhances model
performance in all tasks. Additionally, our approach can generate events based

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR integrate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into deformable image registration using implicit neural representations, achieving superior accuracy with reduced computational costs through randomized basis sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing learning-based DIR methods that require large datasets and struggle with precision, while overcoming the computational inefficiency of instance-specific optimization in implicit neural representations.

Method: Proposed KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with implicit neural representations, featuring a randomized basis sampling strategy to reduce basis functions while maintaining registration quality.

Result: Achieved highest accuracy among INR-based methods across lung CT, brain MRI, and cardiac MRI datasets, with minimal computational overhead and superior learning stability across multiple random seeds.

Conclusion: RandKAN-IDIR with randomized basis sampling slightly outperforms learnable basis function models while eliminating training-time complexity, demonstrating the effectiveness of KANs in deformable image registration.

Abstract: Deformable image registration (DIR) is a cornerstone of medical image
analysis, enabling spatial alignment for tasks like comparative studies and
multi-modal fusion. While learning-based methods (e.g., CNNs, transformers)
offer fast inference, they often require large training datasets and struggle
to match the precision of classical iterative approaches on some organ types
and imaging modalities. Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as
a promising alternative, parameterizing deformations as continuous mappings
from coordinates to displacement vectors. However, this comes at the cost of
requiring instance-specific optimization, making computational efficiency and
seed-dependent learning stability critical factors for these methods. In this
work, we propose KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR, the first integration of
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into deformable image registration with
implicit neural representations (INRs). Our proposed randomized basis sampling
strategy reduces the required number of basis functions in KAN while
maintaining registration quality, thereby significantly lowering computational
costs. We evaluated our approach on three diverse datasets (lung CT, brain MRI,
cardiac MRI) and compared it with competing instance-specific learning-based
approaches, dataset-trained deep learning models, and classical registration
approaches. KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR achieved the highest accuracy among
INR-based methods across all evaluated modalities and anatomies, with minimal
computational overhead and superior learning stability across multiple random
seeds. Additionally, we discovered that our RandKAN-IDIR model with randomized
basis sampling slightly outperforms the model with learnable basis function
indices, while eliminating its additional training-time complexity.

### [26] [Convolutional Set Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22889)
*Federico Chinello,Giacomo Boracchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Convolutional Set Transformer (CST) is a neural architecture that processes image sets of varying sizes with shared semantics, combining feature extraction and contextual modeling directly on 3D image tensors for superior performance in set-based tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing set-input networks like Deep Sets and Set Transformer can only handle vector inputs, requiring separate feature extractors (CNNs) before modeling inter-image relationships, which prevents synergistic learning between feature extraction and contextual modeling.

Method: CST operates directly on 3D image tensors, performing simultaneous feature extraction and contextual modeling through a novel architecture that enables synergies between these processes, and provides native compatibility with CNN explainability methods like Grad-CAM.

Result: CST achieves superior performance in tasks such as Set Classification and Set Anomaly Detection compared to existing approaches, and can be pre-trained on large-scale datasets like ImageNet and adapted to new domains through transfer learning.

Conclusion: CST provides an effective solution for processing heterogeneous image sets with shared semantics, offering better performance, explainability, and transfer learning capabilities than existing set-input networks.

Abstract: We introduce the Convolutional Set Transformer (CST), a novel neural
architecture designed to process image sets of arbitrary cardinality that are
visually heterogeneous yet share high-level semantics - such as a common
category, scene, or concept. Existing set-input networks, e.g., Deep Sets and
Set Transformer, are limited to vector inputs and cannot directly handle 3D
image tensors. As a result, they must be cascaded with a feature extractor,
typically a CNN, which encodes images into embeddings before the set-input
network can model inter-image relationships. In contrast, CST operates directly
on 3D image tensors, performing feature extraction and contextual modeling
simultaneously, thereby enabling synergies between the two processes. This
design yields superior performance in tasks such as Set Classification and Set
Anomaly Detection and further provides native compatibility with CNN
explainability methods such as Grad-CAM, unlike competing approaches that
remain opaque. Finally, we show that CSTs can be pre-trained on large-scale
datasets and subsequently adapted to new domains and tasks through standard
Transfer Learning schemes. To support further research, we release CST-15, a
CST backbone pre-trained on ImageNet
(https://github.com/chinefed/convolutional-set-transformer).

Conclusion: TY-RIST effectively addresses key challenges in infrared small target detection through architectural optimizations, achieving superior accuracy, real-time performance, and strong generalization while reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is critical for defense and
surveillance but remains challenging due to (1) target loss from minimal

from low saliency, and (4) high computational costs. To address these issues,
we propose TY-RIST, an optimized YOLOv12n architecture that integrates (1) a
stride-aware backbone with fine-grained receptive fields, (2) a high-resolution

pruning strategy that reduces computational cost by about 25.5% while
marginally improving accuracy and enabling real-time inference. We also
incorporate the Normalized Gaussian Wasserstein Distance (NWD) to enhance
regression stability. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks and across 20
different models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, improving mAP at 0.5

### [28] [Learning Unified Representation of 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22917)
*Yuelin Xin,Yuheng Liu,Xiaohui Xie,Xinke Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an embedding representation for 3D Gaussian Splatting using continuous submanifold fields to address the non-unique and heterogeneous nature of Gaussian parameters, enabling better neural network learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS parameter-based representation is hard to learn as features for neural networks due to non-unique and heterogeneous nature, yielding data-dependent models.

Method: Embedding representation based on continuous submanifold fields that encapsulate intrinsic information of Gaussian primitives.

Result: The proposed representation preserves color and geometric structure while enforcing unique mapping and channel homogeneity.

Conclusion: The embedding representation benefits learning of 3DGS in neural-network-based models.

Abstract: A well-designed vectorized representation is crucial for the learning systems
natively based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. While 3DGS enables efficient and
explicit 3D reconstruction, its parameter-based representation remains hard to
learn as features, especially for neural-network-based models. Directly feeding
raw Gaussian parameters into learning frameworks fails to address the
non-unique and heterogeneous nature of the Gaussian parameterization, yielding
highly data-dependent models. This challenge motivates us to explore a more
principled approach to represent 3D Gaussian Splatting in neural networks that
preserves the underlying color and geometric structure while enforcing unique
mapping and channel homogeneity. In this paper, we propose an embedding
representation of 3DGS based on continuous submanifold fields that encapsulate
the intrinsic information of Gaussian primitives, thereby benefiting the
learning of 3DGS.

*Yuanzhi Zhu,Xi Wang,Stéphane Lathuilière,Vicky Kalogeiton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Soft-Di[M]O introduces soft embeddings to make one-step generators from masked diffusion models fully differentiable, enabling post-distillation refinements like adversarial training and reward fine-tuning while achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: One-step generators from masked diffusion models suffer from modeling bias inheritance and discrete token outputs that block gradient flow, preventing post-distillation refinements such as adversarial training and reward-based fine-tuning.

Method: Introduces soft embeddings that replace discrete tokens with expected embeddings under the generator's output distribution, creating a fully differentiable continuous surrogate compatible with teacher backbones and tokenizer decoders within the Di[M]O distillation framework.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art one-step results: improved class-to-image performance, one-step FID of 1.56 on ImageNet-256 with GAN-based refinement, higher GenEval and HPS scores on text-to-image with reward fine-tuning, and further gains from Test-Time Embedding Optimization.

Conclusion: Soft embeddings enable end-to-end trainable one-step generators that are compatible with various refinement techniques, overcoming limitations of discrete token outputs while maintaining representation fidelity.

Abstract: One-step generators distilled from Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) compress
multiple sampling steps into a single forward pass, enabling efficient text and
image synthesis. However, they suffer two key limitations: they inherit
modeling bias from the teacher, and their discrete token outputs block gradient
flow, preventing post-distillation refinements such as adversarial training,
reward-based fine-tuning, and Test-Time Embedding Optimization (TTEO). In this
work, we introduce soft embeddings, a simple relaxation that replaces discrete
tokens with the expected embeddings under the generator's output distribution.
Soft embeddings preserve representation fidelity for one-step discrete
generator while providing a fully differentiable continuous surrogate that is
compatible with teacher backbones and tokenizer decoders. Integrating soft
embeddings into the Di[M]O distillation framework (denoted Soft-Di[M]O) makes
one-step generators end-to-end trainable and enables straightforward
application of GAN-based refinement, differentiable reward fine-tuning, and
TTEO. Empirically, across multiple MDM teachers (e.g., MaskBit, MaskGen),
Soft-Di[M]O achieves state-of-the-art one-step results: improved class-to-image
performance, a one-step FID of 1.56 on ImageNet-256 with GAN-based refinement,
along with higher GenEval and HPS scores on text-to-image with reward
fine-tuning, and further gains from TTEO.

*Chenghan Yang,Peng Zhou,Dong-Sheng Zhang,Yueyun Wang,Hong-Bin Shen,Xiaoyong Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FishAI 2.0 is an intelligent marine fish recognition framework that integrates multimodal few-shot deep learning with image generation for data augmentation, achieving high accuracy (91.67% Top-1) for rare species recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional marine biological image recognition faces challenges with incomplete datasets and poor model accuracy, especially for rare species under few-shot conditions where data scarcity hampers performance.

Method: Uses hierarchical marine fish dataset, employs DeepSeek LLM to generate textual descriptions, inputs them into Stable Diffusion 2 for image augmentation via hierarchical diffusion strategy, and uses CLIP-based model for few-shot recognition.

Result: Achieves 91.67% Top-1 and 97.97% Top-5 accuracy at family level, outperforming baseline models. At genus and species level, achieves 87.58% and 85.42% Top-1 accuracy respectively, showing practical utility.

Conclusion: FishAI 2.0 improves marine fish identification efficiency and accuracy, providing scalable technical solution for marine ecological monitoring and conservation with demonstrated scientific value and practical applicability.

Abstract: Traditional marine biological image recognition faces challenges of
incomplete datasets and unsatisfactory model accuracy, particularly for
few-shot conditions of rare species where data scarcity significantly hampers
the performance. To address these issues, this study proposes an intelligent
marine fish recognition framework, FishAI 2.0, integrating multimodal few-shot
deep learning techniques with image generation for data augmentation. First, a
hierarchical marine fish benchmark dataset, which provides a comprehensive data
foundation for subsequent model training, is utilized to train the FishAI 2.0
model. To address the data scarcity of rare classes, the large language model
DeepSeek was employed to generate high-quality textual descriptions, which are
input into Stable Diffusion 2 for image augmentation through a hierarchical
diffusion strategy that extracts latent encoding to construct a multimodal
feature space. The enhanced visual-textual datasets were then fed into a
Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) based model, enabling robust
few-shot image recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that FishAI 2.0
achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 91.67 percent and Top-5 accuracy of 97.97 percent
at the family level, outperforming baseline CLIP and ViT models with a
substantial margin for the minority classes with fewer than 10 training
samples. To better apply FishAI 2.0 to real-world scenarios, at the genus and
species level, FishAI 2.0 respectively achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 87.58
percent and 85.42 percent, demonstrating practical utility. In summary, FishAI
2.0 improves the efficiency and accuracy of marine fish identification and
provides a scalable technical solution for marine ecological monitoring and
conservation, highlighting its scientific value and practical applicability.

*Ahta-Shamul Hoque Emran,Hafija Akter,Abdullah Al Shiam,Abu Saleh Musa Miah,Anichur Rahman,Fahmid Al Farid,Hezerul Abdul Karim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an automatic deep-learning framework using ResNet50 with Dense-Dropout sequence for brain tumor detection from MRI scans, and introduces the MMCBT dataset to address data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely detection of brain tumors is critical for patient outcomes, and there's a lack of reliable brain tumor MRI datasets for research.

Method: Uses pre-trained ResNet50 for feature extraction, Global Average Pooling, linear projection, and a novel Dense-Dropout sequence to enhance feature learning and reduce overfitting.

Result: Created the MMCBT dataset with 209 subjects (3671 tumor and 13273 non-tumor images), and developed a framework that handles class imbalance through data augmentation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework with Dense-Dropout sequence and balanced MMCBT dataset provides an effective solution for automated brain tumor detection from MRI scans.

Abstract: Brain tumors are abnormal cell growths in the central nervous system (CNS),
and their timely detection is critical for improving patient outcomes. This
paper proposes an automatic and efficient deep-learning framework for brain
tumor detection from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The framework
employs a pre-trained ResNet50 model for feature extraction, followed by Global
Average Pooling (GAP) and linear projection to obtain compact, high-level image
representations. These features are then processed by a novel Dense-Dropout
sequence, a core contribution of this work, which enhances non-linear feature
learning, reduces overfitting, and improves robustness through diverse feature
transformations. Another major contribution is the creation of the Mymensingh
Medical College Brain Tumor (MMCBT) dataset, designed to address the lack of
reliable brain tumor MRI resources. The dataset comprises MRI scans from 209
subjects (ages 9 to 65), including 3671 tumor and 13273 non-tumor images, all
clinically verified under expert supervision. To overcome class imbalance, the
tumor class was augmented, resulting in a balanced dataset well-suited for deep
learning research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hemorica is a publicly available dataset of 372 head CT scans with comprehensive annotations for five intracranial hemorrhage subtypes, enabling robust AI model development for ICH detection and segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragmented public data issue hindering robust AI solutions for timely intracranial hemorrhage diagnosis on CT scans by providing a unified, clinically realistic dataset.

Method: Created Hemorica dataset with 372 head CT exams (2012-2024) featuring exhaustive annotations including patient-wise/slice-wise classification, subtype-specific bounding boxes, 2D pixel masks, and 3D voxel masks. Used double-reading workflow with neurosurgeon adjudication to ensure quality.

Result: Lightweight models achieved 87.8% F1 score for binary classification and 85.5% Dice score for lesion segmentation, validating annotation quality and sufficient sample size.

Conclusion: Hemorica provides a unified benchmark supporting multi-task learning, transfer to weakly labeled cohorts, and facilitates AI assistant development for ICH detection and quantification.

Abstract: Timely diagnosis of Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on Computed Tomography (CT)
scans remains a clinical priority, yet the development of robust Artificial
Intelligence (AI) solutions is still hindered by fragmented public data. To
close this gap, we introduce Hemorica, a publicly available collection of 372
head CT examinations acquired between 2012 and 2024. Each scan has been
exhaustively annotated for five ICH subtypes-epidural (EPH), subdural (SDH),
subarachnoid (SAH), intraparenchymal (IPH), and intraventricular (IVH)-yielding
patient-wise and slice-wise classification labels, subtype-specific bounding
boxes, two-dimensional pixel masks and three-dimensional voxel masks. A
double-reading workflow, preceded by a pilot consensus phase and supported by
neurosurgeon adjudication, maintained low inter-rater variability.
Comprehensive statistical analysis confirms the clinical realism of the
dataset. To establish reference baselines, standard convolutional and
transformer architectures were fine-tuned for binary slice classification and
hemorrhage segmentation. With only minimal fine-tuning, lightweight models such
as MobileViT-XS achieved an F1 score of 87.8% in binary classification, whereas
a U-Net with a DenseNet161 encoder reached a Dice score of 85.5% for binary
lesion segmentation that validate both the quality of the annotations and the
sufficiency of the sample size. Hemorica therefore offers a unified,
fine-grained benchmark that supports multi-task and curriculum learning,
facilitates transfer to larger but weakly labelled cohorts, and facilitates the
process of designing an AI-based assistant for ICH detection and quantification
systems.

### [33] [ARSS: Taming Decoder-only Autoregressive Visual Generation for View Synthesis From Single View](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23008)
*Wenbin Teng,Gonglin Chen,Haiwei Chen,Yajie Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARSS is a novel framework that uses GPT-style autoregressive models for novel view generation from single images, outperforming diffusion models by maintaining consistency across views through causal generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have limitations in world modeling tasks like novel view generation due to non-causal generation causing inconsistencies across views, while autoregressive models offer better causal reasoning for incremental knowledge adaptation.

Method: Uses a GPT-style decoder-only AR model with video tokenizer for discrete token mapping, camera encoder for 3D positional guidance, and an autoregressive transformer module that permutes spatial order while maintaining temporal order.

Result: Extensive experiments show ARSS performs comparably to or better than state-of-the-art diffusion-based view synthesis approaches on public datasets.

Conclusion: ARSS demonstrates that autoregressive models can effectively handle novel view generation tasks while maintaining consistency, offering a promising alternative to diffusion models for world modeling applications.

Abstract: Despite their exceptional generative quality, diffusion models have limited
applicability to world modeling tasks, such as novel view generation from
sparse inputs. This limitation arises because diffusion models generate outputs
in a non-causal manner, often leading to distortions or inconsistencies across
views, and making it difficult to incrementally adapt accumulated knowledge to
new queries. In contrast, autoregressive (AR) models operate in a causal
fashion, generating each token based on all previously generated tokens. In
this work, we introduce \textbf{ARSS}, a novel framework that leverages a
GPT-style decoder-only AR model to generate novel views from a single image,
conditioned on a predefined camera trajectory. We employ a video tokenizer to
map continuous image sequences into discrete tokens and propose a camera
encoder that converts camera trajectories into 3D positional guidance. Then to
enhance generation quality while preserving the autoregressive structure, we
propose a autoregressive transformer module that randomly permutes the spatial
order of tokens while maintaining their temporal order. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method
performs comparably to, or better than, state-of-the-art view synthesis
approaches based on diffusion models. Our code will be released upon paper
acceptance.

*Masato Kobayashi,Ning Ding,Toru Tamaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a method to reduce static bias in action recognition by separating temporal dynamic information from static scene information using statistical independence loss and scene prediction loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Action recognition models rely excessively on static cues rather than dynamic human motion (static bias), leading to poor performance in real-world applications and zero-shot action recognition.

Method: Separates temporal dynamic information from static scene information using statistical independence loss between biased and unbiased streams, combined with a scene prediction loss.

Result: The method effectively reduces static bias and experiments confirm the importance of scene prediction loss.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses static bias in action recognition through temporal-spatial separation and scene prediction mechanisms.

Abstract: Action recognition models rely excessively on static cues rather than dynamic
human motion, which is known as static bias. This bias leads to poor
performance in real-world applications and zero-shot action recognition. In
this paper, we propose a method to reduce static bias by separating temporal
dynamic information from static scene information. Our approach uses a
statistical independence loss between biased and unbiased streams, combined
with a scene prediction loss. Our experiments demonstrate that this method
effectively reduces static bias and confirm the importance of scene prediction
loss.

### [35] [Desensitizing for Improving Corruption Robustness in Point Cloud Classification through Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23010)
*Zhiqiang Tian,Weigang Li,Chunhua Deng,Junwei Hu,Yongqiang Wang,Wenping Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Desensitized Adversarial Training (DesenAT) to address DNNs' over-reliance on point cloud features, which makes them vulnerable to corrupted point clouds. The method uses feature desensitization and self-distillation to improve model robustness without sacrificing clean data performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point cloud corruption is inevitable due to scene complexity, sensor inaccuracies, and processing imprecision. DNNs' over-reliance on input features makes them vulnerable, and it's unclear whether this issue exists in 3D tasks and whether reducing feature dependence can enhance robustness to corrupted point clouds.

Method: Desensitized Adversarial Training (DesenAT) generates adversarial samples using feature desensitization and conducts training within a self-distillation framework. It eliminates high-contribution data points, uses spatial transformation to simulate corruption, and transfers knowledge from clean samples to adversarial samples through self-distillation.

Result: Extensive experiments on ModelNet-C and PointCloud-C demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves model robustness without reducing performance on clean datasets.

Conclusion: The DesenAT method successfully addresses DNNs' over-reliance on point cloud features by smoothing sensitivity through adversarial training and self-distillation, achieving improved robustness to corrupted point clouds while maintaining clean data performance.

Abstract: Due to scene complexity, sensor inaccuracies, and processing imprecision,
point cloud corruption is inevitable. Over-reliance on input features is the
root cause of DNN vulnerabilities. It remains unclear whether this issue exists
in 3D tasks involving point clouds and whether reducing dependence on these
features can enhance the model's robustness to corrupted point clouds. This
study attempts to answer these questions. Specifically, we quantified the
sensitivity of the DNN to point cloud features using Shapley values and found
that models trained using traditional methods exhibited high sensitivity values
for certain features. Furthermore, under an equal pruning ratio, prioritizing
the pruning of highly sensitive features causes more severe damage to model
performance than random pruning. We propose `Desensitized Adversarial Training'
(DesenAT), generating adversarial samples using feature desensitization and
conducting training within a self-distillation framework, which aims to
alleviate DNN's over-reliance on point clouds features by smoothing
sensitivity. First, data points with high contribution components are
eliminated, and spatial transformation is used to simulate corruption scenes,
generate adversarial samples, and conduct adversarial training on the model.
Next, to compensate for information loss in adversarial samples, we use the
self-distillation method to transfer knowledge from clean samples to
adversarial samples, and perform adversarial training in a distillation
manner.Extensive experiments on ModelNet-C and PointCloud-C demonstrate show
that the propose method can effectively improve the robustness of the model
without reducing the performance of clean data sets. This code is publicly

*Zetian Wu,Tianshuo Zhou,Stefan Lee,Liang Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel sign language translation method that incorporates anatomical constraints on skeletal joints to generate more natural and biomechanically plausible body movements, achieving significant improvements in realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of generating accurate and natural body poses in sign language translation, as prior methods often produce rigid or biomechanically implausible outputs by neglecting anatomical constraints and coordination patterns.

Method: Explicitly models relationships among skeletal joints by incorporating geometric constraints on joint positions, bone lengths, and movement dynamics. Uses parent-relative reweighting for finger flexibility, bone-pose losses, and bone-length constraints to enforce anatomical consistency.

Result: Narrows performance gap between previous best and ground-truth oracle by 56.51%, reduces bone length discrepancies by 18.76%, and movement variance discrepancies by 5.48%.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates significant gains in anatomical realism and motion naturalness for sign language translation, effectively addressing biomechanical plausibility issues in generated movements.

Abstract: Sign language translation from text to video plays a crucial role in enabling
effective communication for Deaf and hard--of--hearing individuals. A major
challenge lies in generating accurate and natural body poses and movements that
faithfully convey intended meanings. Prior methods often neglect the anatomical
constraints and coordination patterns of human skeletal motion, resulting in
rigid or biomechanically implausible outputs. To address this, we propose a
novel approach that explicitly models the relationships among skeletal
joints--including shoulders, arms, and hands--by incorporating geometric
constraints on joint positions, bone lengths, and movement dynamics. During
training, we introduce a parent-relative reweighting mechanism to enhance
finger flexibility and reduce motion stiffness. Additionally, bone-pose losses
and bone-length constraints enforce anatomically consistent structures. Our
method narrows the performance gap between the previous best and the
ground-truth oracle by 56.51%, and further reduces discrepancies in bone length
and movement variance by 18.76% and 5.48%, respectively, demonstrating
significant gains in anatomical realism and motion naturalness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni-Plan is a planning framework using unified multimodal models (UMMs) that enables reasoning through generated visual content, serving as policy, dynamics model, and value function simultaneously with self-discriminated filtering to avoid hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM/VLM-based decision-making approaches rely solely on language reasoning, limiting their ability to reason and make informed decisions. UMMs with multimodal inputs/outputs offer greater potential for decision-making through visual reasoning.

Method: Built on UMMs where a single model serves as policy, dynamics model, and value function. Introduces self-discriminated filtering where the generative model acts as self-discriminator to filter invalid dynamics predictions.

Result: Substantially improves success rates on long-horizon planning tasks compared to VLM-based methods, shows strong data scalability, requires no expert demonstrations, and achieves better performance with same training data size.

Conclusion: This work lays foundation for future research in reasoning and decision-making with unified multimodal models.

Abstract: With the powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), many recent works have explored using them for
decision-making. However, most of these approaches rely solely on
language-based reasoning, which limits their ability to reason and make
informed decisions. Recently, a promising new direction has emerged with
unified multimodal models (UMMs), which support both multimodal inputs and
outputs. We believe such models have greater potential for decision-making by
enabling reasoning through generated visual content. To this end, we propose
Uni-Plan, a planning framework built on UMMs. Within this framework, a single
model simultaneously serves as the policy, dynamics model, and value function.
In addition, to avoid hallucinations in dynamics predictions, we present a
novel approach self-discriminated filtering, where the generative model serves
as a self-discriminator to filter out invalid dynamics predictions. Experiments
on long-horizon planning tasks show that Uni-Plan substantially improves
success rates compared to VLM-based methods, while also showing strong data
scalability, requiring no expert demonstrations and achieving better
performance under the same training-data size. This work lays a foundation for
future research in reasoning and decision-making with UMMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D-Plus-Minus (DPM) is a novel framework that detects copyright infringement in text-to-image diffusion models by measuring conditional sensitivity through fine-tuning models in learning/unlearning directions and using statistical metrics over orthogonal prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision models like Stable Diffusion can memorize and reproduce copyrighted content without authorization, raising legal/ethical concerns. Existing detection methods lack robustness and theoretical foundations.

Method: Formalize copyright detection using Differential Privacy concepts, introduce conditional sensitivity metric, propose DPM framework that fine-tunes models in learning/unlearning directions, computes confidence scores over orthogonal prompt distributions using statistical metrics.

Result: DPM reliably detects infringement content without requiring access to original training data or text prompts, and the Copyright Infringement Detection Dataset (CIDD) is constructed for standardized benchmarking.

Conclusion: DPM offers an interpretable and practical solution for safeguarding intellectual property in generative AI, providing rigorous theoretical underpinnings for copyright infringement detection.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large vision models such as Stable Diffusion
raises significant legal and ethical concerns, as these models can memorize and
reproduce copyrighted content without authorization. Existing detection
approaches often lack robustness and fail to provide rigorous theoretical
underpinnings. To address these gaps, we formalize the concept of copyright
infringement and its detection from the perspective of Differential Privacy
(DP), and introduce the conditional sensitivity metric, a concept analogous to
sensitivity in DP, that quantifies the deviation in a diffusion model's output
caused by the inclusion or exclusion of a specific training data point. To
operationalize this metric, we propose D-Plus-Minus (DPM), a novel post-hoc
detection framework that identifies copyright infringement in text-to-image
diffusion models. Specifically, DPM simulates inclusion and exclusion processes
by fine-tuning models in two opposing directions: learning or unlearning.
Besides, to disentangle concept-specific influence from the global parameter
shifts induced by fine-tuning, DPM computes confidence scores over orthogonal
prompt distributions using statistical metrics. Moreover, to facilitate
standardized benchmarking, we also construct the Copyright Infringement
Detection Dataset (CIDD), a comprehensive resource for evaluating detection
across diverse categories. Our results demonstrate that DPM reliably detects
infringement content without requiring access to the original training dataset
or text prompts, offering an interpretable and practical solution for
safeguarding intellectual property in the era of generative AI.

*Gabriel A. Viana,Luis F. Alves Pereira,Tsang Ing Ren,George D. C. Cavalcanti,Jan Sijbers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces perceptual influence as a metric to evaluate perceptual loss design choices for LDCT denoising, showing that better-designed perceptual losses significantly improve noise reduction and structural fidelity without changing network architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pixel-wise losses like MSE lead to over-smoothed reconstructions and loss of clinically relevant details in LDCT images. Perceptual losses offer an alternative but their design involves critical underexplored decisions about feature representation level, pretraining dataset, and optimization weighting.

Method: Proposes a principled framework using perceptual influence metric to assess the impact of perceptual loss design choices. Conducts systematic experimentation to evaluate different configurations including feature representation level, pretraining dataset, and relative importance of perceptual component.

Result: Widely used perceptual loss configurations in literature underperform compared to better-designed alternatives. Better perceptual loss designs lead to significant improvements in noise reduction and structural fidelity of reconstructed CT images. Provides objective guidelines supported by statistical analysis for effective use of perceptual losses.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that careful design of perceptual losses is crucial for LDCT denoising performance. The proposed perceptual influence metric and framework provide systematic guidance for optimizing perceptual loss configurations, leading to substantial improvements in image quality without architectural changes.

Abstract: Perceptual losses have emerged as powerful tools for training networks to
enhance Low-Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) images, offering an alternative to
traditional pixel-wise losses such as Mean Squared Error, which often lead to
over-smoothed reconstructions and loss of clinically relevant details in LDCT
images. The perceptual losses operate in a latent feature space defined by a
pretrained encoder and aim to preserve semantic content by comparing high-level
features rather than raw pixel values. However, the design of perceptual losses
involves critical yet underexplored decisions, including the feature
representation level, the dataset used to pretrain the encoder, and the
relative importance assigned to the perceptual component during optimization.
In this work, we introduce the concept of perceptual influence (a metric that
quantifies the relative contribution of the perceptual loss term to the total
loss) and propose a principled framework to assess the impact of the loss
design choices on the model training performance. Through systematic
experimentation, we show that the widely used configurations in the literature
to set up a perceptual loss underperform compared to better-designed
alternatives. Our findings show that better perceptual loss designs lead to
significant improvements in noise reduction and structural fidelity of
reconstructed CT images, without requiring any changes to the network
architecture. We also provide objective guidelines, supported by statistical
analysis, to inform the effective use of perceptual losses in LDCT denoising.

### [40] [Sensor-Adaptive Flood Mapping with Pre-trained Multi-Modal Transformers across SAR and Multispectral Modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23035)
*Tomohiro Tanaka,Narumasa Tsutsumida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a lightweight multi-modal transformer model called Presto for flood detection that can work with SAR-only, multispectral-only, or combined sensor data, achieving superior performance while being 250x smaller than baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current flood mapping methods face operational challenges: single-sensor approaches have weather-dependent data availability and limited revisit periods, while multi-sensor fusion requires substantial computational resources and large labeled datasets.

Method: Fine-tuned Presto, a lightweight (~0.4M parameters) multi-modal pre-trained transformer that processes both SAR and multispectral data at pixel level, enabling flood mapping with flexible sensor inputs through a single model architecture.

Result: Achieved F1 score of 0.896 and mIoU of 0.886 in optimal sensor-fusion scenario, outperforming Prithvi-100M baseline. Maintained effective performance in MS-only scenarios (F1: 0.893) and functional capabilities in SAR-only conditions (F1: 0.718).

Conclusion: The parameter-efficient, sensor-flexible approach provides an accessible and robust solution for real-world disaster scenarios requiring immediate flood extent assessment regardless of sensor availability constraints.

Abstract: Floods are increasingly frequent natural disasters causing extensive human
and economic damage, highlighting the critical need for rapid and accurate
flood inundation mapping. While remote sensing technologies have advanced flood
monitoring capabilities, operational challenges persist: single-sensor
approaches face weather-dependent data availability and limited revisit
periods, while multi-sensor fusion methods require substantial computational
resources and large-scale labeled datasets. To address these limitations, this
study introduces a novel sensor-flexible flood detection methodology by
fine-tuning Presto, a lightweight ($\sim$0.4M parameters) multi-modal
pre-trained transformer that processes both Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and
multispectral (MS) data at the pixel level. Our approach uniquely enables flood
mapping using SAR-only, MS-only, or combined SAR+MS inputs through a single
model architecture, addressing the critical operational need for rapid response
with whatever sensor data becomes available first during disasters. We
evaluated our method on the Sen1Floods11 dataset against the large-scale
Prithvi-100M baseline ($\sim$100M parameters) across three realistic data
availability scenarios. The proposed model achieved superior performance with
an F1 score of 0.896 and mIoU of 0.886 in the optimal sensor-fusion scenario,
outperforming the established baseline. Crucially, the model demonstrated
robustness by maintaining effective performance in MS-only scenarios (F1:
0.893) and functional capabilities in challenging SAR-only conditions (F1:
0.718), confirming the advantage of multi-modal pre-training for operational
flood mapping. Our parameter-efficient, sensor-flexible approach offers an
accessible and robust solution for real-world disaster scenarios requiring
immediate flood extent assessment regardless of sensor availability
constraints.

TL;DR: GeLoc3r enhances pose regression methods through Geometric Consistency Regularization (GCR) to achieve both fast inference (25ms) and high accuracy approaching correspondence-based methods, without requiring geometric computation at inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior ReLoc3R achieves fast inference but has subtle geometric inconsistencies that prevent reaching the precision ceiling of correspondence-based methods like MASt3R, creating a speed-accuracy dilemma.

Method: GeLoc3r uses Geometric Consistency Regularization (GCR) during training: generates dense 3D-2D correspondences using ground-truth depth, weights them with a FusionTransformer, computes geometrically-consistent poses via weighted RANSAC, and transfers this geometric knowledge into the regression network through a consistency loss.

Result: GeLoc3r consistently outperforms ReLoc3R: 40.45% vs. 34.85% AUC@5° on CO3Dv2 (16% relative improvement), 68.66% vs. 66.70% on RealEstate10K, and 50.45% vs. 49.60% on MegaDepth1500.

Conclusion: By teaching geometric consistency during training rather than enforcing it at inference, GeLoc3r achieves both the speed of regression and geometric understanding of correspondence methods, representing a paradigm shift in how neural networks learn camera geometry.

Abstract: Prior ReLoc3R achieves breakthrough performance with fast 25ms inference and
state-of-the-art regression accuracy, yet our analysis reveals subtle geometric
inconsistencies in its internal representations that prevent reaching the
precision ceiling of correspondence-based methods like MASt3R (which require
300ms per pair). In this work, we present GeLoc3r, a novel approach to relative
camera pose estimation that enhances pose regression methods through Geometric
Consistency Regularization (GCR). GeLoc3r overcomes the speed-accuracy dilemma
by training regression networks to produce geometrically consistent poses
without inference-time geometric computation. During training, GeLoc3r
leverages ground-truth depth to generate dense 3D-2D correspondences, weights
them using a FusionTransformer that learns correspondence importance, and
computes geometrically-consistent poses via weighted RANSAC. This creates a
consistency loss that transfers geometric knowledge into the regression
network. Unlike FAR method which requires both regression and geometric solving
at inference, GeLoc3r only uses the enhanced regression head at test time,
maintaining ReLoc3R's fast speed and approaching MASt3R's high accuracy. On
challenging benchmarks, GeLoc3r consistently outperforms ReLoc3R, achieving
significant improvements including 40.45% vs. 34.85% AUC@5{\deg} on the CO3Dv2
dataset (16% relative improvement), 68.66% vs. 66.70% AUC@5{\deg} on
RealEstate10K, and 50.45% vs. 49.60% on MegaDepth1500. By teaching geometric
consistency during training rather than enforcing it at inference, GeLoc3r
represents a paradigm shift in how neural networks learn camera geometry,
achieving both the speed of regression and the geometric understanding of
correspondence methods.

*Ye-eun Kim,Suhyeon Lim,Andrew J. Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a deep learning-based multimodal system for recognizing upper limb Activities of Daily Living (ADL) in stroke patients, addressing the limitations of existing HAR systems that focus on non-disabled individuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for stroke rehabilitation therapy faces supply shortages, and existing Human Action Recognition (HAR) systems are unsuitable for stroke patients as they primarily focus on non-disabled individuals and use simpler machine learning approaches.

Method: The system uses IMU sensors and RGB-D camera to collect multimodal data, proposes appropriate preprocessing techniques, and develops a deep learning model specifically designed for processing multimodal data from stroke patients.

Result: The study found that stroke patient action data is less clustering than non-disabled individuals' data, and the proposed model learns similar tendencies for each label in data with difficult-to-cluster features.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the potential for expanding deep learning models to not only recognize simple actions in stroke patients but also provide assessment feedback for domiciliary rehabilitation, with code available for further development.

Abstract: Rehabilitation therapy for stroke patients faces a supply shortage despite
the increasing demand. To address this issue, remote monitoring systems that
reduce the burden on medical staff are emerging as a viable alternative. A key
component of these remote monitoring systems is Human Action Recognition (HAR)
technology, which classifies actions. However, existing HAR studies have
primarily focused on non-disable individuals, making them unsuitable for
recognizing the actions of stroke patients. HAR research for stroke has largely
concentrated on classifying relatively simple actions using machine learning
rather than deep learning. In this study, we designed a system to monitor the
actions of stroke patients, focusing on domiciliary upper limb Activities of
Daily Living (ADL). Our system utilizes IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors
and an RGB-D camera, which are the most common modalities in HAR. We directly
collected a dataset through this system, investigated an appropriate preprocess
and proposed a deep learning model suitable for processing multimodal data. We
analyzed the collected dataset and found that the action data of stroke
patients is less clustering than that of non-disabled individuals.
Simultaneously, we found that the proposed model learns similar tendencies for
each label in data with features that are difficult to clustering. This study
suggests the possibility of expanding the deep learning model, which has
learned the action features of stroke patients, to not only simple action
recognition but also feedback such as assessment contributing to domiciliary
rehabilitation in future research. The code presented in this study is
available at https://github.com/ye-Kim/MMeViT.

### [43] [Activation Matching for Explanation Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23051)
*Pirzada Suhail,Aditya Anand,Amit Sethi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An activation-matching approach generates minimal binary masks that preserve both model predictions and intermediate activations, providing faithful explanations for classifier decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create minimal yet faithful explanations for pretrained classifiers that preserve both the model's prediction and internal representations while being human-interpretable.

Method: Train a lightweight autoencoder to output binary masks using multi-layer activation matching (KL divergence + cross-entropy), mask priors (L1 area, binarization penalty, total variation), and abductive constraints for faithfulness.

Result: Produces small, crisp binary masks that retain classifier behavior while discarding irrelevant regions, yielding practical minimalist explanations.

Conclusion: The combined objectives successfully generate human-interpretable masks that provide faithful explanations of model decision-making by preserving both predictions and internal activations.

Abstract: In this paper we introduce an activation-matching--based approach to generate
minimal, faithful explanations for the decision-making of a pretrained
classifier on any given image. Given an input image \(x\) and a frozen model
\(f\), we train a lightweight autoencoder to output a binary mask \(m\) such
that the explanation \(e = m \odot x\) preserves both the model's prediction
and the intermediate activations of \(x\). Our objective combines: (i)
multi-layer activation matching with KL divergence to align distributions and
cross-entropy to retain the top-1 label for both the image and the explanation;
(ii) mask priors -- L1 area for minimality, a binarization penalty for crisp
0/1 masks, and total variation for compactness; and (iii) abductive constraints
for faithfulness and necessity. Together, these objectives yield small,
human-interpretable masks that retain classifier behavior while discarding
irrelevant input regions, providing practical and faithful minimalist
explanations for the decision making of the underlying model.

*Ruilang Wang,Shuotong Xu,Bowen Liu,Runlin Huang,Donglong Chen,Weifeng Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mask What Matters is a text-guided masking framework for self-supervised medical image analysis that uses vision-language models to selectively mask diagnostically relevant regions, achieving better performance with lower masking ratios than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of annotated data scarcity in medical imaging and improve upon inefficient random masking in self-supervised learning by developing a more semantically aligned approach.

Method: Leverages vision-language models for prompt-based region localization to apply differentiated masking that emphasizes diagnostically relevant regions while reducing redundancy in background areas.

Result: Outperforms existing MIM methods across multiple medical imaging modalities (brain MRI, chest CT, lung X-ray) with gains of up to +3.1% in classification accuracy, +1.3 in BoxAP, and +1.1 in MaskAP, while using substantially lower masking ratios (40% vs 70%).

Conclusion: Controllable, text-driven masking enables semantically aligned self-supervised learning and advances robust vision models for medical image analysis.

Abstract: The scarcity of annotated data in specialized domains such as medical imaging
presents significant challenges to training robust vision models. While
self-supervised masked image modeling (MIM) offers a promising solution,
existing approaches largely rely on random high-ratio masking, leading to
inefficiency and poor semantic alignment. Moreover, region-aware variants
typically depend on reconstruction heuristics or supervised signals, limiting
their adaptability across tasks and modalities. We propose Mask What Matters, a
controllable text-guided masking framework for self-supervised medical image
analysis. By leveraging vision-language models for prompt-based region
localization, our method flexibly applies differentiated masking to emphasize
diagnostically relevant regions while reducing redundancy in background areas.
This controllable design enables better semantic alignment, improved
representation learning, and stronger cross-task generalizability.
Comprehensive evaluation across multiple medical imaging modalities, including
brain MRI, chest CT, and lung X-ray, shows that Mask What Matters consistently
outperforms existing MIM methods (e.g., SparK), achieving gains of up to +3.1
percentage points in classification accuracy, +1.3 in box average precision
(BoxAP), and +1.1 in mask average precision (MaskAP) for detection. Notably, it
achieves these improvements with substantially lower overall masking ratios
(e.g., 40\% vs. 70\%). This work demonstrates that controllable, text-driven
masking can enable semantically aligned self-supervised learning, advancing the
development of robust vision models for medical image analysis.

*Ben Liang,Yuan Liu,Bingwen Qiu,Yihong Wang,Xiubao Sui,Qian Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMC-DETR is a novel aerial-view object detection framework that uses frequency-decoupled fusion to address tiny object detection challenges in high-resolution imagery, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aerial-view object detection faces challenges in detecting tiny objects due to limited visual cues and difficulty modeling global context. Existing methods suffer from delayed contextual fusion and inadequate non-linear modeling, creating performance bottlenecks.

Method: Proposes FMC-DETR with three key components: 1) WeKat backbone using cascaded wavelet transforms for global context perception and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks for non-linear modeling, 2) Cross-stage Partial Fusion module for multi-scale feature interaction, and 3) Multi-Domain Feature Coordination module unifying spatial, frequency, and structural priors.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets with 6.5% AP and 8.2% AP50 improvements over baseline on VisDrone dataset, demonstrating effectiveness in tiny object detection with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: FMC-DETR effectively addresses tiny object detection challenges in aerial imagery through frequency-decoupled fusion, achieving superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Aerial-view object detection is a critical technology for real-world
applications such as natural resource monitoring, traffic management, and
UAV-based search and rescue. Detecting tiny objects in high-resolution aerial
imagery presents a long-standing challenge due to their limited visual cues and
the difficulty of modeling global context in complex scenes. Existing methods
are often hampered by delayed contextual fusion and inadequate non-linear
modeling, failing to effectively use global information to refine shallow
features and thus encountering a performance bottleneck. To address these
challenges, we propose FMC-DETR, a novel framework with frequency-decoupled
fusion for aerial-view object detection. First, we introduce the Wavelet
Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (WeKat) backbone, which applies cascaded wavelet
transforms to enhance global low-frequency context perception in shallow
features while preserving fine-grained details, and employs Kolmogorov-Arnold
networks to achieve adaptive non-linear modeling of multi-scale dependencies.
Next, a lightweight Cross-stage Partial Fusion (CPF) module reduces redundancy
and improves multi-scale feature interaction. Finally, we introduce the
Multi-Domain Feature Coordination (MDFC) module, which unifies spatial,
frequency, and structural priors to to balance detail preservation and global
enhancement. Extensive experiments on benchmark aerial-view datasets
demonstrate that FMC-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer
parameters. On the challenging VisDrone dataset, our model achieves
improvements of 6.5% AP and 8.2% AP50 over the baseline, highlighting its
effectiveness in tiny object detection. The code can be accessed at

*Yutao Shen,Junkun Yuan,Toru Aonishi,Hideki Nakayama,Yue Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper revisits fundamental problems in image inpainting preference alignment using direct preference optimization. Key findings show most reward models provide valid scores for preference data construction, preference data shows robust scaling trends, reward models have observable biases, and simple ensemble methods mitigate these biases to achieve superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate fundamental problems in achieving preference alignment for image inpainting rather than introducing novel methods, focusing on leveraging existing direct preference optimization approaches and public reward models.

Method: Leveraged direct preference optimization for alignment training, employed public reward models to construct preference training datasets, conducted experiments across nine reward models, two benchmarks, and two baseline models with varying structures and generative algorithms.

Result: Alignment models significantly outperformed prior models across standard metrics, GPT-4 assessments, and human evaluations without any changes to model structures or use of new datasets. Simple ensemble of reward models yielded robust and generalizable results by mitigating biases.

Conclusion: The work establishes a simple yet solid baseline for image inpainting preference alignment, demonstrating that fundamental approaches with existing tools can push this promising frontier effectively.

Abstract: This paper investigates image inpainting with preference alignment. Instead
of introducing a novel method, we go back to basics and revisit fundamental
problems in achieving such alignment. We leverage the prominent direct
preference optimization approach for alignment training and employ public
reward models to construct preference training datasets. Experiments are
conducted across nine reward models, two benchmarks, and two baseline models
with varying structures and generative algorithms. Our key findings are as
follows: (1) Most reward models deliver valid reward scores for constructing
preference data, even if some of them are not reliable evaluators. (2)
Preference data demonstrates robust trends in both candidate scaling and sample
scaling across models and benchmarks. (3) Observable biases in reward models,
particularly in brightness, composition, and color scheme, render them
susceptible to cause reward hacking. (4) A simple ensemble of these models
yields robust and generalizable results by mitigating such biases. Built upon
these observations, our alignment models significantly outperform prior models
across standard metrics, GPT-4 assessments, and human evaluations, without any
changes to model structures or the use of new datasets. We hope our work can
set a simple yet solid baseline, pushing this promising frontier. Our code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XMAG is a lightweight foundation model for computational pathology that uses cross-magnification distillation to transfer knowledge from 20x to 5x magnification, achieving near-state-of-the-art performance with 30x faster processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models in computational pathology are computationally prohibitive for clinical deployment due to massive parameter counts and high-magnification processing requirements, limiting real-time integration in resource-constrained clinical environments.

Method: Cross-magnification distillation framework that transfers knowledge from state-of-the-art 20x magnification teacher to efficient 5x magnification student architecture, using dual-level knowledge transfer (global image representations and local spatial token mapping) and trained on 3.49 million images.

Result: XMAG achieved diagnostic accuracy within 1% of substantially larger foundation models while delivering 30-fold processing acceleration (8.8 WSIs per minute), required 11.3 times fewer patches per WSI, and demonstrated robust generalization in cross-institutional validation.

Conclusion: Cross-magnification distillation is a viable approach for deploying foundation model capabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments, potentially enabling real-time pathology AI integration with near-state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Foundation models (FM) have transformed computational pathology but remain
computationally prohibitive for clinical deployment due to their massive
parameter counts and high-magnification processing requirements. Here, we
introduce XMAG, a lightweight FM developed through corss-magnification
distillation that transfers knowledge from state-of-the-art 20x magnification
teacher to an efficient 5x magnification student architecture. XMAG employs a
compact backbone and operates entirely at 5x, requiring 11.3 times fewer
patches per whole slide image (WSI) compared to existing approaches. Our Novel
distillation framework incorporates dual-level knowledge transfer, aligning
both global image representations and local spatial token mapping. We trained
XMAG on 3.49 million images curated from publicly available datasets and
evaluated performance across six clinically relevant histopathology analysis
tasks spanning multiple cancer types. XMAG achieved diagnostic accuracy within
1% of substantially larger foundation models while delivering 30-fold
processing acceleration, reaching 8.8 WSIs per minute processing speed. Our
cross-institutional validation confirmed robust generalization. Further, we
developed an end-to-end training strategy to further boost our model's
performance to approach the larger FMs' performance. These results establish
cross-magnification distillation as a viable approach for deploying FM
capabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments, potentially
enabling real-time pathology AI integration.

*Na Min An,Inha Kang,Minhyun Lee,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoPatch is a zero-shot referring image segmentation framework that enhances spatial grounding in vision-language models by improving text and image feature extraction without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models like CLIP struggle with spatial relationships - they focus on primary noun phrases in text and generate similar features for different spatial layouts in images, limiting spatial structure sensitivity.

Method: CoPatch constructs hybrid text features by incorporating context tokens with spatial cues, and extracts patch-level image features from intermediate layers where spatial structure is better preserved. These enhanced features are fused into a clustered image-text similarity map (CoMap) for mask selection.

Result: CoPatch significantly improves spatial grounding in zero-shot RIS across RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and PhraseCut datasets with 2-7 mIoU improvements without requiring any additional training.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the importance of recovering and leveraging untapped spatial knowledge inherently embedded in VLMs, paving the way for improved zero-shot referring image segmentation.

Abstract: Spatial grounding is crucial for referring image segmentation (RIS), where
the goal of the task is to localize an object described by language. Current
foundational vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, excel at aligning
images and text but struggle with understanding spatial relationships. Within
the language stream, most existing methods often focus on the primary noun
phrase when extracting local text features, undermining contextual tokens.
Within the vision stream, CLIP generates similar features for images with
different spatial layouts, resulting in limited sensitivity to spatial
structure. To address these limitations, we propose \textsc{CoPatch}, a
zero-shot RIS framework that leverages internal model components to enhance
spatial representations in both text and image modalities. For language,
\textsc{CoPatch} constructs hybrid text features by incorporating context
tokens carrying spatial cues. For vision, it extracts patch-level image
features using our novel path discovered from intermediate layers, where
spatial structure is better preserved. These enhanced features are fused into a
clustered image-text similarity map, \texttt{CoMap}, enabling precise mask
selection. As a result, \textsc{CoPatch} significantly improves spatial
grounding in zero-shot RIS across RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and PhraseCut (+
2--7 mIoU) without requiring any additional training. Our findings underscore
the importance of recovering and leveraging the untapped spatial knowledge
inherently embedded in VLMs, thereby paving the way for opportunities in
zero-shot RIS.

TL;DR: HTMA-Net combines Hadamard Transform with multiplication-avoiding in-memory computing to reduce arithmetic complexity in neural networks while maintaining accuracy, eliminating up to 52% of multiplications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing multiplication costs is critical for efficient deep neural network deployment in energy-constrained edge devices.

Method: Selectively replaces intermediate convolutions with Hybrid Hadamard-based transform layers whose internal convolutions are implemented via multiplication-avoiding in-memory operations using SRAM-based in-memory computing.

Result: Eliminates up to 52% of multiplications compared to baseline ResNet models while achieving comparable accuracy on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet datasets, with significant reduction in computational complexity and parameters.

Conclusion: Combining structured Hadamard transform layers with SRAM-based in-memory computing multiplication-avoiding operators is a promising path towards efficient deep learning architectures.

Abstract: Reducing the cost of multiplications is critical for efficient deep neural
network deployment, especially in energy-constrained edge devices. In this
work, we introduce HTMA-Net, a novel framework that integrates the Hadamard
Transform (HT) with multiplication-avoiding (MA) SRAM-based in-memory computing
to reduce arithmetic complexity while maintaining accuracy. Unlike prior
methods that only target multiplications in convolutional layers or focus
solely on in-memory acceleration, HTMA-Net selectively replaces intermediate
convolutions with Hybrid Hadamard-based transform layers whose internal
convolutions are implemented via multiplication-avoiding in-memory operations.
We evaluate HTMA-Net on ResNet-18 using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet,
and provide a detailed comparison against regular, MF-only, and HT-only
variants. Results show that HTMA-Net eliminates up to 52\% of multiplications
compared to baseline ResNet-18, ResNet-20, and ResNet-50 models, while
achieving comparable accuracy in evaluation and significantly reducing
computational complexity and the number of parameters. Our results demonstrate
that combining structured Hadamard transform layers with SRAM-based in-memory
computing multiplication-avoiding operators is a promising path towards
efficient deep learning architectures.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChangeIMTI, a large-scale multi-task dataset for remote sensing change understanding, and proposes ChangeVG, a vision-guided vision-language model that outperforms existing methods on change captioning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack deep understanding and interactions for diverse change captioning, counting, and localization tasks in remote sensing analysis.

Method: Proposed ChangeVG model with dual-granularity awareness for bi-temporal images, featuring a vision-guided module that combines fine-grained spatial feature extraction with high-level semantic summarization to guide large VLMs during instruction tuning.

Result: Outperforms the strongest method Semantic-CC by 1.39 points on the S*m metric for change captioning, demonstrating superiority across four tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses gaps in remote sensing change understanding through comprehensive multi-task learning and hierarchical cross-modal learning.

Abstract: Remote sensing change understanding (RSCU) is essential for analyzing remote
sensing images and understanding how human activities affect the environment.
However, existing datasets lack deep understanding and interactions in the
diverse change captioning, counting, and localization tasks. To tackle these
gaps, we construct ChangeIMTI, a new large-scale interactive multi-task
instruction dataset that encompasses four complementary tasks including change
captioning, binary change classification, change counting, and change
localization. Building upon this new dataset, we further design a novel
vision-guided vision-language model (ChangeVG) with dual-granularity awareness
for bi-temporal remote sensing images (i.e., two remote sensing images of the
same area at different times). The introduced vision-guided module is a
dual-branch architecture that synergistically combines fine-grained spatial
feature extraction with high-level semantic summarization. These enriched
representations further serve as the auxiliary prompts to guide large
vision-language models (VLMs) (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) during instruction tuning,
thereby facilitating the hierarchical cross-modal learning. We extensively
conduct experiments across four tasks to demonstrate the superiority of our
approach. Remarkably, on the change captioning task, our method outperforms the
strongest method Semantic-CC by 1.39 points on the comprehensive S*m metric,
which integrates the semantic similarity and descriptive accuracy to provide an
overall evaluation of change caption. Moreover, we also perform a series of
ablation studies to examine the critical components of our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified multistage generative framework using Conditional Dependent Coupling that decomposes generation into interpolant trajectories, enabling accurate distribution learning and end-to-end optimization through a single Diffusion Transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between computation and fidelity in image generation models, overcoming limitations of VAE-based models (information loss, limited detail) and pixel-space models (high computational cost), while avoiding cascade model issues like stage-wise separation and ineffective optimization.

Method: Proposes Conditional Dependent Coupling strategy to decompose generative process into interpolant trajectories at multiple stages, implemented as a single unified Diffusion Transformer for end-to-end optimization and knowledge sharing.

Result: Achieves both high fidelity and efficiency across multiple resolutions, demonstrating improved performance compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the computation-fidelity trade-off in image generation by enabling accurate distribution learning and end-to-end optimization through a unified multistage approach.

Abstract: Existing image generation models face critical challenges regarding the
trade-off between computation and fidelity. Specifically, models relying on a
pretrained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) suffer from information loss, limited
detail, and the inability to support end-to-end training. In contrast, models
operating directly in the pixel space incur prohibitive computational cost.
Although cascade models can mitigate computational cost, stage-wise separation
prevents effective end-to-end optimization, hampers knowledge sharing, and
often results in inaccurate distribution learning within each stage. To address
these challenges, we introduce a unified multistage generative framework based
on our proposed Conditional Dependent Coupling strategy. It decomposes the
generative process into interpolant trajectories at multiple stages, ensuring
accurate distribution learning while enabling end-to-end optimization.
Importantly, the entire process is modeled as a single unified Diffusion
Transformer, eliminating the need for disjoint modules and also enabling
knowledge sharing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
both high fidelity and efficiency across multiple resolutions.

TL;DR: Earth-Agent is the first agentic framework that unifies RGB and spectral Earth observation data within a tool ecosystem, enabling complex multi-step reasoning and quantitative spatiotemporal analysis beyond current MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack capability for complex tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and domain-specific tools in Earth observation. Existing agent-based methods are limited to RGB perception, shallow reasoning, and lack systematic evaluation.

Method: Earth-Agent unifies RGB and spectral EO data within an MCP-based tool ecosystem, supporting cross-modal, multi-step reasoning by dynamically invoking expert tools and models across modalities for tasks like geophysical parameter retrieval.

Result: Comprehensive experiments with different LLM backbones show Earth-Agent's effectiveness, outperforming general agent frameworks and MLLMs on remote sensing benchmarks. The framework establishes a new paradigm for EO analysis.

Conclusion: Earth-Agent moves the field toward scientifically grounded, next-generation LLM applications in Earth observation by enabling complex reasoning and quantitative analysis beyond current capabilities.

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) is essential for understanding the evolving states of
the Earth system. Although recent MLLMs have advanced EO research, they still
lack the capability to tackle complex tasks that require multi-step reasoning
and the use of domain-specific tools. Agent-based methods offer a promising
direction, but current attempts remain in their infancy, confined to RGB
perception, shallow reasoning, and lacking systematic evaluation protocols. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce Earth-Agent, the first agentic
framework that unifies RGB and spectral EO data within an MCP-based tool
ecosystem, enabling cross-modal, multi-step, and quantitative spatiotemporal
reasoning beyond pretrained MLLMs. Earth-Agent supports complex scientific
tasks such as geophysical parameter retrieval and quantitative spatiotemporal
analysis by dynamically invoking expert tools and models across modalities. To
support comprehensive evaluation, we further propose Earth-Bench, a benchmark
of 248 expert-curated tasks with 13,729 images, spanning spectrum, products and
RGB modalities, and equipped with a dual-level evaluation protocol that
assesses both reasoning trajectories and final outcomes. We conduct
comprehensive experiments varying different LLM backbones, comparisons with
general agent frameworks, and comparisons with MLLMs on remote sensing
benchmarks, demonstrating both the effectiveness and potential of Earth-Agent.
Earth-Agent establishes a new paradigm for EO analysis, moving the field toward
scientifically grounded, next-generation applications of LLMs in Earth
observation. Our code and dataset will be publicly released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on task-specific physical priors with narrow focus, limiting scalability and generalization to diverse real-world weather scenarios. Unsupervised image restoration under multi-weather conditions remains underexplored.

Method: Uses lumina-chroma decomposition to decouple degradation from content without modeling complex weather. Includes Lumina Degradation Guidance Module (LDGM) for learning luminance degradation priors via frequency-domain amplitude modulation, and Difficulty-Aware Contrastive Regularization (DACR) with CLIP-based classifier for hard sample identification and contrastive alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple weather datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised approaches with strong generalization to complex weather degradations.

Conclusion: WeatherCycle provides an effective unified framework for multi-weather image restoration that outperforms existing unsupervised methods and generalizes well to diverse weather conditions.

Abstract: Unsupervised image restoration under multi-weather conditions remains a
fundamental yet underexplored challenge. While existing methods often rely on
task-specific physical priors, their narrow focus limits scalability and
generalization to diverse real-world weather scenarios. In this work, we
propose \textbf{WeatherCycle}, a unified unpaired framework that reformulates
weather restoration as a bidirectional degradation-content translation cycle,
guided by degradation-aware curriculum regularization. At its core,
WeatherCycle employs a \textit{lumina-chroma decomposition} strategy to
decouple degradation from content without modeling complex weather, enabling
domain conversion between degraded and clean images. To model diverse and
complex degradations, we propose a \textit{Lumina Degradation Guidance Module}
(LDGM), which learns luminance degradation priors from a degraded image pool
and injects them into clean images via frequency-domain amplitude modulation,
enabling controllable and realistic degradation modeling. Additionally, we
incorporate a \textit{Difficulty-Aware Contrastive Regularization (DACR)}
module that identifies hard samples via a CLIP-based classifier and enforces
contrastive alignment between hard samples and restored features to enhance
semantic consistency and robustness. Extensive experiments across serve
multi-weather datasets, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance among unsupervised approaches, with strong generalization to
complex weather degradations.

TL;DR: Sparse2Dense is a keypoint-driven generative framework that uses sparse 3D keypoints for ultra-low bitrate human video compression and accurate vertex prediction, enabling efficient human-centric media transmission.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of achieving ultra-low bitrate human video compression while maintaining accurate vertex prediction, which requires harmonizing dynamic motion modeling, appearance synthesis, and geometric consistency for bandwidth-constrained multimedia applications.

Method: A multi-task learning-based keypoint-aware deep generative model that encodes human motion via compact 3D keypoints, uses these sparse keypoints to estimate dense motion for video synthesis with temporal coherence, and integrates a vertex predictor for joint optimization with video generation.

Result: Extensive experiments show competitive compression performance over traditional/generative video codecs while enabling precise human vertex prediction for downstream geometry applications.

Conclusion: Sparse2Dense facilitates bandwidth-efficient human-centric media transmission for applications like real-time motion analysis, virtual human animation, and immersive entertainment.

Abstract: For bandwidth-constrained multimedia applications, simultaneously achieving
ultra-low bitrate human video compression and accurate vertex prediction
remains a critical challenge, as it demands the harmonization of dynamic motion
modeling, detailed appearance synthesis, and geometric consistency. To address
this challenge, we propose Sparse2Dense, a keypoint-driven generative framework
that leverages extremely sparse 3D keypoints as compact transmitted symbols to
enable ultra-low bitrate human video compression and precise human vertex
prediction. The key innovation is the multi-task learning-based and
keypoint-aware deep generative model, which could encode complex human motion
via compact 3D keypoints and leverage these sparse keypoints to estimate dense
motion for video synthesis with temporal coherence and realistic textures.
Additionally, a vertex predictor is integrated to learn human vertex geometry
through joint optimization with video generation, ensuring alignment between
visual content and geometric structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed Sparse2Dense framework achieves competitive compression
performance for human video over traditional/generative video codecs, whilst
enabling precise human vertex prediction for downstream geometry applications.
As such, Sparse2Dense is expected to facilitate bandwidth-efficient
human-centric media transmission, such as real-time motion analysis, virtual
human animation, and immersive entertainment.

TL;DR: An end-to-end video-based pipeline for vehicle axle counting using YOLO-OBB for vehicle detection/categorization and YOLO for tire detection, with a novel TRAX algorithm to handle occlusions and improve accuracy for long vehicles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate vehicle axle counting is essential for traffic control, toll collection, and infrastructure development, but previous methods struggle in dense environments with occlusions and long vehicles.

Method: Combines YOLO-OBB for vehicle detection/categorization and YOLO for tire detection, with intelligent tire-vehicle association and a novel TRAX (Tire and Axle Tracking) algorithm to handle occlusions and track axle features between frames.

Result: Significantly reduces false positives and improves axle-counting accuracy for long vehicles, demonstrating strong robustness in real-world traffic videos.

Conclusion: Represents a significant step toward scalable, AI-driven axle counting systems that can replace legacy roadside infrastructure.

Abstract: Accurate counting of vehicle axles is essential for traffic control, toll
collection, and infrastructure development. We present an end-to-end,
video-based pipeline for axle counting that tackles limitations of previous
works in dense environments. Our system leverages a combination of YOLO-OBB to
detect and categorize vehicles, and YOLO to detect tires. Detected tires are
intelligently associated to their respective parent vehicles, enabling accurate
axle prediction even in complex scenarios. However, there are a few challenges
in detection when it comes to scenarios with longer and occluded vehicles. We
mitigate vehicular occlusions and partial detections for longer vehicles by
proposing a novel TRAX (Tire and Axle Tracking) Algorithm to successfully track
axle-related features between frames. Our method stands out by significantly
reducing false positives and improving the accuracy of axle-counting for long
vehicles, demonstrating strong robustness in real-world traffic videos. This
work represents a significant step toward scalable, AI-driven axle counting
systems, paving the way for machine vision to replace legacy roadside

### [58] [Confidence-Calibrating Regularization for Robust Brain MRI Segmentation Under Domain Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23176)
*Behraj Khan,Tahir Qasim Syed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CalSAM is a lightweight adaptation framework that improves SAM's performance on medical volumes by reducing domain shift sensitivity and penalizing overconfident predictions, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM performs well on natural images but suffers from domain shift and overconfidence when applied to medical volumes like brain MRI, limiting its reliability in clinical settings.

Method: CalSAM uses two key components: Feature Fisher Information Penalty (FIP) to reduce encoder sensitivity to domain shift on 3D feature maps, and Confidence Misalignment Penalty (CMP) to penalize overconfident voxel-wise errors. The framework fine-tunes only the mask decoder while keeping SAM's encoders frozen.

Result: On BraTS scanner split (Siemens→GE), CalSAM achieved +7.4% DSC improvement (80.1% vs 74.6%), -26.9% HD95 reduction (4.6mm vs 6.3mm), and -39.5% ECE reduction (5.2% vs 8.6%). On ATLAS-C, it achieved +5.3% DSC improvement (75.9%) and -32.6% ECE reduction (5.8%).

Conclusion: CalSAM effectively improves domain generalization and uncertainty calibration for brain MRI segmentation while maintaining computational efficiency by freezing SAM's encoder, with FIP and CMP providing complementary benefits.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibits strong zero-shot performance on
natural images but suffers from domain shift and overconfidence when applied to
medical volumes. We propose \textbf{CalSAM}, a lightweight adaptation framework
that (i) reduces encoder sensitivity to domain shift via a \emph{Feature Fisher
Information Penalty} (FIP) computed on 3D feature maps and (ii) penalizes
overconfident voxel-wise errors through a \emph{Confidence Misalignment
Penalty} (CMP). The combined loss, \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{CalSAM}}\) fine-tunes
only the mask decoder while keeping SAM's encoders frozen. On cross-center and
scanner-shift evaluations, CalSAM substantially improves accuracy and
calibration: e.g., on the BraTS scanner split (Siemens$\to$GE) CalSAM shows a
$+7.4\%$ relative improvement in $\mathrm{DSC}$ (80.1\% vs.\ 74.6\%), a
$-26.9\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{HD95}$ (4.6 mm vs.\ 6.3 mm), and a $-39.5\%$
reduction in $\mathrm{ECE}$ (5.2\% vs.\ 8.6\%). On ATLAS-C (motion
corruptions), CalSAM achieves a $+5.3\%$ relative improvement in $\mathrm{DSC}$
(75.9\%) and a $-32.6\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{ECE}$ (5.8\%). Ablations show
FIP and CMP contribute complementary gains ($p<0.01$), and the Fisher penalty
incurs a modest $\sim$15\% training-time overhead. CalSAM therefore delivers
improved domain generalization and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates for
brain MRI segmentation, while retaining the computational benefits of freezing
SAM's encoder.

TL;DR: A new unsupervised online 3D instance segmentation framework that improves upon UNIT by using synthetic point cloud sequences, flexible temporal sampling, and dynamic-weighting loss to achieve better segmentation accuracy and temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised 3D instance segmentation methods like UNIT suffer from limited training diversity, rigid temporal sampling, and heavy dependence on noisy pseudo-labels, which constrain their performance in maintaining consistent object identities across LiDAR scans.

Method: Proposes a framework that enriches training distribution through synthetic point cloud sequence generation, incorporates flexible temporal sampling using both adjacent and non-adjacent frames, and employs a dynamic-weighting loss to emphasize confident and informative samples.

Result: Outperforms UNIT and other unsupervised baselines on SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, and PandaSet datasets, achieving higher segmentation accuracy and more robust temporal associations.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses limitations of existing approaches by improving training diversity, capturing better temporal dynamics, and reducing dependence on noisy labels, resulting in superior unsupervised 3D instance segmentation performance.

Abstract: Unsupervised online 3D instance segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging
task, as it requires maintaining consistent object identities across LiDAR
scans without relying on annotated training data. Existing methods, such as
UNIT, have made progress in this direction but remain constrained by limited
training diversity, rigid temporal sampling, and heavy dependence on noisy
pseudo-labels. We propose a new framework that enriches the training
distribution through synthetic point cloud sequence generation, enabling
greater diversity without relying on manual labels or simulation engines. To
better capture temporal dynamics, our method incorporates a flexible sampling
strategy that leverages both adjacent and non-adjacent frames, allowing the
model to learn from long-range dependencies as well as short-term variations.
In addition, a dynamic-weighting loss emphasizes confident and informative
samples, guiding the network toward more robust representations. Through
extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, and PandaSet, our method
consistently outperforms UNIT and other unsupervised baselines, achieving
higher segmentation accuracy and more robust temporal associations. The code

TL;DR: GaP (Gaussian Patch) is a black-box adversarial attack method that creates a universal forehead patch using Gaussian blobs to degrade face recognition systems with high transferability across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing adversarial attacks on face recognition systems are limited to digital domains or require white-box access, creating a need for practical black-box attacks that work in physical settings.

Method: Uses a query-efficient zero-order greedy algorithm to iteratively construct symmetric grayscale forehead patches by adding Gaussian blobs, guided by cosine similarity scores from a surrogate FR model.

Result: Achieves high attack success rate with only ~10,000 queries to black-box ArcFace model, works in both digital and physical settings, and shows strong transferability to unseen FaceNet model.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a practical and severe vulnerability in face recognition systems, proving that robust transferable attacks can be crafted with limited knowledge of target systems.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on face recognition (FR) systems pose a significant
security threat, yet most are confined to the digital domain or require
white-box access. We introduce GaP (Gaussian Patch), a novel method to generate
a universal, physically transferable adversarial patch under a strict black-box
setting. Our approach uses a query-efficient, zero-order greedy algorithm to
iteratively construct a symmetric, grayscale pattern for the forehead. The
patch is optimized by successively adding Gaussian blobs, guided only by the
cosine similarity scores from a surrogate FR model to maximally degrade
identity recognition. We demonstrate that with approximately 10,000 queries to
a black-box ArcFace model, the resulting GaP achieves a high attack success
rate in both digital and real-world physical tests. Critically, the attack
shows strong transferability, successfully deceiving an entirely unseen FaceNet
model. Our work highlights a practical and severe vulnerability, proving that
robust, transferable attacks can be crafted with limited knowledge of the
target system.

*Seongsoo Heo,Dong-Wan Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRI is a novel model inversion method that incrementally detaches important patches during inversion to create sparse synthetic images, allowing remaining patches to continue evolving. It achieves 10x faster inversion than dense methods while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard model inversion is computationally expensive for Vision Transformers due to self-attention. Sparse Model Inversion (SMI) improves efficiency but discards patches prematurely, suppressing extraction of class-agnostic features essential for knowledge transfer.

Method: Patch Rebirth Inversion (PRI) progressively detaches the most important patches during inversion to construct sparse synthetic images, while allowing remaining patches to continue evolving for future selection. This enables initially less informative patches to accumulate class-relevant knowledge over time.

Result: PRI achieves up to 10x faster inversion than Dense Model Inversion (DMI) and 2x faster than SMI, while consistently outperforming SMI in accuracy and matching DMI performance.

Conclusion: The progressive detachment strategy in PRI effectively balances class-agnostic and class-specific knowledge extraction, enabling efficient model inversion for Vision Transformers while maintaining performance comparable to dense methods.

Abstract: Model inversion is a widely adopted technique in data-free learning that
reconstructs synthetic inputs from a pretrained model through iterative
optimization, without access to original training data. Unfortunately, its
application to state-of-the-art Vision Transformers (ViTs) poses a major
computational challenge, due to their expensive self-attention mechanisms. To
address this, Sparse Model Inversion (SMI) was proposed to improve efficiency
by pruning and discarding seemingly unimportant patches, which were even
claimed to be obstacles to knowledge transfer. However, our empirical findings
suggest the opposite: even randomly selected patches can eventually acquire
transferable knowledge through continued inversion. This reveals that
discarding any prematurely inverted patches is inefficient, as it suppresses
the extraction of class-agnostic features essential for knowledge transfer,
along with class-specific features. In this paper, we propose Patch Rebirth
Inversion (PRI), a novel approach that incrementally detaches the most
important patches during the inversion process to construct sparse synthetic
images, while allowing the remaining patches to continue evolving for future
selection. This progressive strategy not only improves efficiency, but also
encourages initially less informative patches to gradually accumulate more
class-relevant knowledge, a phenomenon we refer to as the Re-Birth effect,
thereby effectively balancing class-agnostic and class-specific knowledge.
Experimental results show that PRI achieves up to 10x faster inversion than
standard Dense Model Inversion (DMI) and 2x faster than SMI, while consistently
outperforming SMI in accuracy and matching the performance of DMI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel self-consistency framework that uses short binary answers to evaluate and rank long model responses, automatically generating preference pairs to reduce hallucinations without human annotations or external supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models often hallucinate details, generating non-existent objects or inaccurate attributes that compromise output reliability, and existing methods require extensive human annotations or external supervision from more powerful models.

Method: Leverages the model's self-consistency between long responses and short answers to generate preference pairs for training. Uses short binary questions to get reliable responses, then queries the target model to evaluate and rank its generated responses through a self-reflection pipeline.

Result: Significant improvements in factual grounding and reliability across multiple benchmarks (AMBER, MultiObject-Hal, Object HalBench, MMHal-Bench), while maintaining robust instruction-following ability with enhanced performance on LLaVA-Bench and MMBench.

Conclusion: The method offers a scalable and efficient solution that effectively reduces hallucinations using unlabeled data by relying solely on self-consistency rather than external supervision, providing a practical approach to improve model reliability.

Abstract: Vision-language models often hallucinate details, generating non-existent
objects or inaccurate attributes that compromise output reliability. Existing
methods typically address these issues via extensive human annotations or
external supervision from more powerful models. In this work, we present a
novel framework that leverages the model's self-consistency between long
responses and short answers to generate preference pairs for training. We
observe that short binary questions tend to yield highly reliable responses,
which can be used to query the target model to evaluate and rank its generated
responses. Specifically, we design a self-reflection pipeline where detailed
model responses are compared against concise binary answers, and inconsistency
signals are utilized to automatically curate high-quality training data without
human annotations or external model-based supervision. By relying solely on
self-consistency rather than external supervision, our method offers a scalable
and efficient solution that effectively reduces hallucinations using unlabeled
data. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, i.e., AMBER,
MultiObject-Hal (ROPE), Object HalBench, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrate
significant improvements in factual grounding and reliability. Moreover, our
approach maintains robust instruction-following ability, as evidenced by
enhanced performance on LLaVA-Bench and MMBench.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TATTOO is a training-free aesthetic-aware outfit recommendation approach that uses Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate item descriptions and aesthetic profiles, achieving state-of-the-art performance without expensive task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fashion outfit-completion tools require expensive training on large labeled datasets and lack explicit human aesthetic guidance. The authors aim to leverage MLLMs to create a training-free paradigm with better recommendation quality and aesthetic awareness.

Method: TATTOO uses MLLMs to generate target-item descriptions and aesthetic chain-of-thought to distill images into structured aesthetic profiles (color, style, occasion, season, material, balance). It fuses visual summaries with textual descriptions using a dynamic entropy-gated mechanism for embedding space ranking.

Result: Experiments on Aesthetic-100 show TATTOO achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to training-based methods. The Polyvore dataset demonstrates advanced zero-shot retrieval capability of this training-free approach.

Conclusion: The training-free paradigm using MLLMs can outperform conventional training-based methods in fashion outfit recommendation, providing better aesthetic awareness and recommendation scores without expensive labeled data requirements.

Abstract: The global fashion e-commerce market relies significantly on intelligent and
aesthetic-aware outfit-completion tools to promote sales. While previous
studies have approached the problem of fashion outfit-completion and
compatible-item retrieval, most of them require expensive, task-specific
training on large-scale labeled data, and no effort is made to guide outfit
recommendation with explicit human aesthetics. In the era of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), we show that the conventional training-based pipeline
could be streamlined to a training-free paradigm, with better recommendation
scores and enhanced aesthetic awareness. We achieve this with TATTOO, a
Training-free AesTheTic-aware Outfit recommendation approach. It first
generates a target-item description using MLLMs, followed by an aesthetic
chain-of-thought used to distill the images into a structured aesthetic profile
including color, style, occasion, season, material, and balance. By fusing the
visual summary of the outfit with the textual description and aesthetics
vectors using a dynamic entropy-gated mechanism, candidate items can be
represented in a shared embedding space and be ranked accordingly. Experiments
on a real-world evaluation set Aesthetic-100 show that TATTOO achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared with existing training-based methods.
Another standard Polyvore dataset is also used to measure the advanced
zero-shot retrieval capability of our training-free method.

TL;DR: Proposes CoAdaIN for RGB-to-thermal image translation in ADAS, enabling one-to-many mappings with component-aware style adaptation for more realistic and diverse thermal images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermal imaging improves ADAS safety in low-light and harsh weather, but limited datasets and poor simulator representation hinder research. RGB-to-thermal translation offers a solution, but existing methods only support one-to-one mappings.

Method: Multi-modal translation framework using Component-aware Adaptive Instance Normalization (CoAdaIN) that adapts styles to different image components individually, unlike original AdaIN's global style application.

Result: Produces more realistic and diverse thermal image translations compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: CoAdaIN enables effective one-to-many RGB-to-thermal mapping, addressing dataset limitations and improving thermal imaging capabilities for ADAS applications.

Abstract: Thermal imaging in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) improves road
safety with superior perception in low-light and harsh weather conditions
compared to traditional RGB cameras. However, research in this area faces
challenges due to limited dataset availability and poor representation in
driving simulators. RGB-to-thermal image translation offers a potential
solution, but existing methods focus on one-to-one mappings. We propose a
one-to-many mapping using a multi-modal translation framework enhanced with our
Component-aware Adaptive Instance Normalization (CoAdaIN). Unlike the original
AdaIN, which applies styles globally, CoAdaIN adapts styles to different image
components individually. The result, as we show, is more realistic and diverse
thermal image translations. This is the accepted author manuscript of the paper

Motivation: To develop a privacy-preserving alternative to camera-based HAR that is robust to illumination changes, using LiDAR point clouds which preserve privacy while capturing human activity.

Method: Map LiDAR frames to proximity graphs (epsilon-graphs), compute Laplacian spectrum, use eigenvalues and eigenvector statistics as pose descriptors, and apply temporal statistics over sliding windows for classification with SVM and random forests.

Result: Achieved 94.4% accuracy on 13-class rehabilitation activities and 90.3% accuracy on all 27 activities in MM-Fi dataset with 40 subjects under strict subject-independent protocol, outperforming skeleton-based baselines.

Conclusion: The method provides a compact, interpretable feature set derived directly from point cloud geometry, offering an accurate and efficient alternative to end-to-end deep learning for human activity recognition.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition supports applications in healthcare,
manufacturing, and human-machine interaction. LiDAR point clouds offer a
privacy-preserving alternative to cameras and are robust to illumination. We
propose a HAR method based on graph spectral analysis. Each LiDAR frame is
mapped to a proximity graph (epsilon-graph) and the Laplacian spectrum is
computed. Eigenvalues and statistics of eigenvectors form pose descriptors, and
temporal statistics over sliding windows yield fixed vectors for classification
with support vector machines and random forests. On the MM-Fi dataset with 40
subjects and 27 activities, under a strict subject-independent protocol, the
method reaches 94.4% accuracy on a 13-class rehabilitation set and 90.3% on all
27 activities. It also surpasses the skeleton-based baselines reported for
MM-Fi. The contribution is a compact and interpretable feature set derived
directly from point cloud geometry that provides an accurate and efficient
alternative to end-to-end deep learning.

*Atakan Topaloglu,Kunyi Li,Michael Niemeyer,Nassir Navab,A. Murat Tekalp,Federico Tombari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OracleGS is a novel framework that combines generative completeness with regressive fidelity for sparse-view novel view synthesis using a "propose-and-validate" approach with 3D Gaussian Splatting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse-view novel view synthesis suffers from geometric ambiguity, creating a trade-off where regressive models are geometrically faithful but incomplete, while generative models can complete scenes but introduce structural inconsistencies.

Method: Uses a pre-trained 3D-aware diffusion model to synthesize novel views for scene completion, then repurposes a multi-view stereo model as a 3D-aware oracle to validate 3D uncertainties. The uncertainty signal guides optimization of a 3D Gaussian Splatting model via an uncertainty-weighted loss.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on datasets including Mip-NeRF 360 and NeRF Synthetic by filtering hallucinatory artifacts while preserving plausible completions in under-constrained regions.

Conclusion: OracleGS successfully reconciles generative completeness with regressive fidelity by conditioning the generative prior on multi-view geometric evidence, providing a robust solution for sparse-view novel view synthesis.

Abstract: Sparse-view novel view synthesis is fundamentally ill-posed due to severe
geometric ambiguity. Current methods are caught in a trade-off: regressive
models are geometrically faithful but incomplete, whereas generative models can
complete scenes but often introduce structural inconsistencies. We propose
OracleGS, a novel framework that reconciles generative completeness with
regressive fidelity for sparse view Gaussian Splatting. Instead of using
generative models to patch incomplete reconstructions, our
"propose-and-validate" framework first leverages a pre-trained 3D-aware
diffusion model to synthesize novel views to propose a complete scene. We then
repurpose a multi-view stereo (MVS) model as a 3D-aware oracle to validate the
3D uncertainties of generated views, using its attention maps to reveal regions
where the generated views are well-supported by multi-view evidence versus
where they fall into regions of high uncertainty due to occlusion, lack of
texture, or direct inconsistency. This uncertainty signal directly guides the
optimization of a 3D Gaussian Splatting model via an uncertainty-weighted loss.
Our approach conditions the powerful generative prior on multi-view geometric
evidence, filtering hallucinatory artifacts while preserving plausible
completions in under-constrained regions, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods on datasets including Mip-NeRF 360 and NeRF Synthetic.

*Swaib Ilias Mazumder,Manish Kumar,Aparajita Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal deep learning framework using satellite and Earth observation data for high-resolution (1 km) monsoon rainfall classification in India, outperforming existing methods especially for extreme rainfall events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate monsoon rainfall prediction is crucial for India's agriculture, water management, and climate risk planning, but remains challenging due to sparse ground observations and complex regional variability.

Result: The multimodal framework consistently outperforms unimodal baselines and existing deep learning methods, particularly in extreme rainfall categories, using a newly curated 1 km resolution dataset for five Indian states during the June-September 2024 monsoon season.

Conclusion: This work provides a scalable framework, benchmark dataset, and state-of-the-art results for regional monsoon forecasting, climate resilience, and geospatial AI applications in India.

Abstract: Accurate monsoon rainfall prediction is vital for India's agriculture, water
management, and climate risk planning, yet remains challenging due to sparse
ground observations and complex regional variability. We present a multimodal
deep learning framework for high-resolution precipitation classification that
leverages satellite and Earth observation data. Unlike previous rainfall
prediction models based on coarse 5-50 km grids, we curate a new 1 km
resolution dataset for five Indian states, integrating seven key geospatial
modalities: land surface temperature, vegetation (NDVI), soil moisture,
relative humidity, wind speed, elevation, and land use, covering the
June-September 2024 monsoon season. Our approach uses an attention-guided U-Net
architecture to capture spatial patterns and temporal dependencies across
modalities, combined with focal and dice loss functions to handle rainfall
class imbalance defined by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).
Experiments demonstrate that our multimodal framework consistently outperforms
unimodal baselines and existing deep learning methods, especially in extreme
rainfall categories. This work contributes a scalable framework, benchmark
dataset, and state-of-the-art results for regional monsoon forecasting, climate
resilience, and geospatial AI applications in India.

*Yihao Ding,Soyeon Caren Han,Yanbei Jiang,Yan Li,Zechuan Li,Yifan Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynDoc is a framework combining discriminative and generative models for domain-specific document understanding, using synthetic data generation and adaptive instruction tuning to address limitations of existing LLMs/MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs/MLLMs face challenges with hallucinations, inadequate domain adaptation, and reliance on extensive fine-tuning datasets for domain-specific visually rich document understanding in fields like medicine, finance, and material science.

Method: Combines discriminative and generative models with synthetic data generation workflow using structural information extraction and domain-specific query generation, plus adaptive instruction tuning and recursive inferencing mechanism.

Result: The framework demonstrates scalable, efficient, and precise document understanding, bridging the gap between domain-specific adaptation and general world knowledge.

Conclusion: SynDoc provides an effective solution for domain-specific document key information extraction by leveraging synthetic data and iterative refinement between discriminative and generative models.

Abstract: Domain-specific Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU) presents
significant challenges due to the complexity and sensitivity of documents in
fields such as medicine, finance, and material science. Existing Large
(Multimodal) Language Models (LLMs/MLLMs) achieve promising results but face
limitations such as hallucinations, inadequate domain adaptation, and reliance
on extensive fine-tuning datasets. This paper introduces SynDoc, a novel
framework that combines discriminative and generative models to address these
challenges. SynDoc employs a robust synthetic data generation workflow, using
structural information extraction and domain-specific query generation to
produce high-quality annotations. Through adaptive instruction tuning, SynDoc
improves the discriminative model's ability to extract domain-specific
knowledge. At the same time, a recursive inferencing mechanism iteratively
refines the output of both models for stable and accurate predictions. This
framework demonstrates scalable, efficient, and precise document understanding
and bridges the gap between domain-specific adaptation and general world
knowledge for document key information extraction tasks.

*Rohit Chowdhury,Aniruddha Bala,Rohan Jaiswal,Siddharth Roheda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vid-Freeze is an adversarial attack that adds perturbations to images to block motion synthesis in image-to-video models by targeting attention mechanisms, preventing malicious video generation while preserving image semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid progress of image-to-video generation models poses significant risks for creating deceptive or malicious content, and existing defenses are insufficient for effectively blocking motion synthesis.

Method: Vid-Freeze adds carefully crafted adversarial perturbations to images that explicitly target the attention mechanism of I2V models, disrupting motion synthesis while preserving semantic fidelity.

Result: The immunized images generate stand-still or near-static videos, effectively blocking malicious content creation and demonstrating impressive protection capabilities.

Conclusion: Attention attacks represent a promising direction for robust and proactive defenses against misuse of image-to-video generation models.

Abstract: The rapid progress of image-to-video (I2V) generation models has introduced
significant risks, enabling video synthesis from static images and facilitating
deceptive or malicious content creation. While prior defenses such as I2VGuard
attempt to immunize images, effective and principled protection to block motion
remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Vid-Freeze - a novel
attention-suppressing adversarial attack that adds carefully crafted
adversarial perturbations to images. Our method explicitly targets the
attention mechanism of I2V models, completely disrupting motion synthesis while
preserving semantic fidelity of the input image. The resulting immunized images
generate stand-still or near-static videos, effectively blocking malicious
content creation. Our experiments demonstrate the impressive protection
provided by the proposed approach, highlighting the importance of attention
attacks as a promising direction for robust and proactive defenses against
misuse of I2V generation models.

### [71] [Seeing Through the Blur: Unlocking Defocus Maps for Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23289)
*Minsun Jeon,Simon S. Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using defocus blur as a physically interpretable forensic signal for deepfake detection, leveraging the fact that synthetic images often lack realistic depth-of-field characteristics present in camera-captured images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled mass production of photorealistic synthetic images, blurring the boundary between authentic and fabricated visual content, threatening the integrity of visual media across deepfake facial manipulation and broader AI-generated content scenarios.

Method: Construct a defocus blur map from images and use it as a discriminative feature for detecting manipulated content. Defocus blur is a depth-dependent optical phenomenon that naturally occurs in camera-captured images but is often missing or unrealistic in synthetic images.

Result: Experimental results confirm that defocus blur provides a reliable and interpretable cue for identifying synthetic images. The approach is supported by three in-depth feature analyses demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Defocus blur serves as a robust and generalizable forensic cue that encodes physical scene structure, making it more reliable than RGB textures or frequency-domain signals. The proposed detection pipeline and interpretability tools contribute meaningfully to media forensics research.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the mass production of
photorealistic synthetic images, blurring the boundary between authentic and
fabricated visual content. This challenge is particularly evident in deepfake
scenarios involving facial manipulation, but also extends to broader
AI-generated content (AIGC) cases involving fully synthesized scenes. As such
content becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish from reality, the
integrity of visual media is under threat. To address this issue, we propose a
physically interpretable deepfake detection framework and demonstrate that
defocus blur can serve as an effective forensic signal. Defocus blur is a
depth-dependent optical phenomenon that naturally occurs in camera-captured
images due to lens focus and scene geometry. In contrast, synthetic images
often lack realistic depth-of-field (DoF) characteristics. To capture these
discrepancies, we construct a defocus blur map and use it as a discriminative
feature for detecting manipulated content. Unlike RGB textures or
frequency-domain signals, defocus blur arises universally from optical imaging
principles and encodes physical scene structure. This makes it a robust and
generalizable forensic cue. Our approach is supported by three in-depth feature
analyses, and experimental results confirm that defocus blur provides a
reliable and interpretable cue for identifying synthetic images. We aim for our
defocus-based detection pipeline and interpretability tools to contribute
meaningfully to ongoing research in media forensics. The implementation is

*Liwen Hu,Yang Li,Mianzhi Liu,Yijia Guo,Shenghao Xie,Ziluo Ding,Tiejun Huang,Lei Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diff-SPK is the first diffusion-based method for reconstructing perceptible images from spike camera data, specifically addressing low-light high-speed scenarios through enhanced texture extraction and ControlNet conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spike cameras produce unique asynchronous spike streams that require reconstruction for human perception, but existing methods struggle with low-light high-speed scenarios due to severe noise and sparse information.

Method: Uses Enhanced Texture from Inter-spike Interval (ETFI) to aggregate sparse information from low-light spike streams, then employs ETFI as conditioning input for ControlNet to generate high-speed scenes, with an ETFI-based feature fusion module to improve quality.

Result: The method demonstrates superiority on real low-light spike streams and establishes the first comprehensive benchmark for low-light spike stream reconstruction with quantitative illumination information.

Conclusion: Diff-SPK effectively leverages generative priors to supplement texture information in low-light conditions, providing a robust solution for spike camera reconstruction in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Spike camera, a type of neuromorphic sensor with high-temporal resolution,
shows great promise for high-speed visual tasks. Unlike traditional cameras,
spike camera continuously accumulates photons and fires asynchronous spike
streams. Due to unique data modality, spike streams require reconstruction
methods to become perceptible to the human eye.
  However, lots of methods struggle to handle spike streams in low-light
high-speed scenarios due to severe noise and sparse information. In this work,
we propose Diff-SPK, the first diffusion-based reconstruction method for spike
camera. Diff-SPK effectively leverages generative priors to supplement texture
information in low-light conditions. Specifically, it first employs an
\textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{T}exture \textbf{f}rom Inter-spike \textbf{I}nterval
(ETFI) to aggregate sparse information from low-light spike streams. Then, ETFI
serves as a conditioning input for ControlNet to generate the high-speed
scenes. To improve the quality of results, we introduce an ETFI-based feature
fusion module during the generation process.
  Moreover, we establish the first bona fide benchmark for the low-light spike
stream reconstruction task. It significantly surpasses existing reconstruction
datasets in scale and provides quantitative illumination information. The
performance on real low-light spike streams demonstrates the superiority of
Diff-SPK.

*Hao Liu,Yongjie Zheng,Yuhan Kang,Mingyang Zhang,Maoguo Gong,Lorenzo Bruzzone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a balanced diffusion-guided fusion (BDGF) framework that uses multimodal diffusion features to guide a multi-branch network for land-cover classification, addressing modality imbalance in DDPMs and improving feature extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning methods for multimodal remote sensing data analysis are popular but face challenges with modality imbalance in DDPMs and effectively leveraging diffusion features for complementary diversity feature extraction.

Method: The BDGF framework includes: 1) adaptive modality masking strategy to achieve modality-balanced data distribution, 2) hierarchical guidance of diffusion features across CNN, Mamba, and transformer networks using feature fusion, group channel attention, and cross-attention mechanisms, 3) mutual learning strategy to enhance inter-branch collaboration through probability entropy and feature similarity alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments on four multimodal remote sensing datasets demonstrate superior classification performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed BDGF framework effectively addresses modality imbalance in multimodal DDPMs and successfully leverages diffusion features to guide complementary feature extraction, achieving state-of-the-art land-cover classification performance.

Abstract: Deep learning-based techniques for the analysis of multimodal remote sensing
data have become popular due to their ability to effectively integrate
complementary spatial, spectral, and structural information from different
sensors. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have
attracted attention in the remote sensing community due to their powerful
ability to capture robust and complex spatial-spectral distributions. However,
pre-training multimodal DDPMs may result in modality imbalance, and effectively
leveraging diffusion features to guide complementary diversity feature
extraction remains an open question. To address these issues, this paper
proposes a balanced diffusion-guided fusion (BDGF) framework that leverages
multimodal diffusion features to guide a multi-branch network for land-cover
classification. Specifically, we propose an adaptive modality masking strategy
to encourage the DDPMs to obtain a modality-balanced rather than spectral
image-dominated data distribution. Subsequently, these diffusion features
hierarchically guide feature extraction among CNN, Mamba, and transformer
networks by integrating feature fusion, group channel attention, and
cross-attention mechanisms. Finally, a mutual learning strategy is developed to
enhance inter-branch collaboration by aligning the probability entropy and
feature similarity of individual subnetworks. Extensive experiments on four
multimodal remote sensing datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves superior classification performance. The code is available at

A diagnostic framework reveals systematic biases where models identify Western festivals but struggle with underrepresented cultures and dangerously misclassify emergencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose that VLMs often appear culturally competent but actually rely on superficial pattern matching rather than genuine cultural understanding, and to highlight the risks of these symbolic shortcuts.

Method: Introduced a diagnostic framework to probe VLM reasoning on fire-themed cultural imagery through both classification and explanation analysis, testing multiple models on Western festivals, non-Western traditions, and emergency scenes.

Result: Models correctly identify prominent Western festivals but struggle with underrepresented cultural events, frequently offering vague labels or dangerously misclassifying emergencies as celebrations. These failures expose systematic biases and risks of symbolic shortcuts.

Conclusion: There is a need for cultural evaluation beyond accuracy metrics to ensure interpretable and fair multimodal systems, as current VLMs lack genuine cultural understanding despite appearing competent.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C3-OWD is a curriculum cross-modal contrastive learning framework that simultaneously addresses robustness to adverse conditions and generalization to unseen categories in object detection, overcoming the traditional trade-off between these two objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world object detection faces two key limitations: poor generalization to unseen categories and insufficient robustness under adverse conditions. Prior work addressed these issues separately, creating a trade-off where achieving both robustness and diversity simultaneously was difficult.

Method: A two-stage curriculum learning framework: Stage 1 uses RGBT data pretraining to enhance robustness, while Stage 2 employs vision-language alignment to improve generalization. An Exponential Moving Average (EMA) mechanism prevents catastrophic forgetting between stages by theoretically guaranteeing preservation of pre-stage performance.

Result: Achieves 80.1 AP50 on FLIR, 48.6 AP50_Novel on OV-COCO, and 35.7 mAPr on OV-LVIS, demonstrating competitive performance across both robustness and diversity evaluations.

Conclusion: C3-OWD successfully unifies robustness and diversity in object detection through curriculum cross-modal contrastive learning, establishing strong performance across multiple benchmarks while overcoming the traditional trade-off between these objectives.

Abstract: Object detection has advanced significantly in the closed-set setting, but
real-world deployment remains limited by two challenges: poor generalization to
unseen categories and insufficient robustness under adverse conditions. Prior
research has explored these issues separately: visible-infrared detection
improves robustness but lacks generalization, while open-world detection
leverages vision-language alignment strategy for category diversity but
struggles under extreme environments. This trade-off leaves robustness and
diversity difficult to achieve simultaneously. To mitigate these issues, we
propose \textbf{C3-OWD}, a curriculum cross-modal contrastive learning
framework that unifies both strengths. Stage~1 enhances robustness by
pretraining with RGBT data, while Stage~2 improves generalization via
vision-language alignment. To prevent catastrophic forgetting between two
stages, we introduce an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) mechanism that
theoretically guarantees preservation of pre-stage performance with bounded
parameter lag and function consistency. Experiments on FLIR, OV-COCO, and
OV-LVIS demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: C3-OWD achieves $80.1$
AP$^{50}$ on FLIR, $48.6$ AP$^{50}_{\text{Novel}}$ on OV-COCO, and $35.7$
mAP$_r$ on OV-LVIS, establishing competitive performance across both robustness
and diversity evaluations. Code available at:

*Yizhen Jiang,Mengting Ma,Anqi Zhu,Xiaowen Ma,Jiaxin Li,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes S2BNet, a binary neural network for remote sensing pansharpening that addresses spectral distortion and spatial feature degradation through customized spatial-spectral binarized convolution (S2B-Conv) with Spectral-Redistribution Mechanism and Gabor Spatial Feature Amplifier.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for pansharpening have high computational complexity, limiting their deployment on resource-limited devices. Binary neural networks (BNNs) offer efficiency but face issues with spectral distortion and spatial feature degradation when applied to pansharpening.

Method: Designed S2B-Conv composed of Spectral-Redistribution Mechanism (SRM) using dynamic affine transformation to handle spectral distribution inconsistencies, and Gabor Spatial Feature Amplifier (GSFA) with random frequency/angle selection to capture multi-scale anisotropic spatial features.

Result: Extensive experiments show that the proposed high-efficiency binarized pansharpening method achieves promising performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: S2BNet successfully applies binary neural networks to pansharpening by overcoming spectral distortion and spatial feature degradation issues, providing an efficient solution for resource-limited devices while maintaining good performance.

Abstract: Remote sensing pansharpening aims to reconstruct spatial-spectral properties
during the fusion of panchromatic (PAN) images and low-resolution
multi-spectral (LR-MS) images, finally generating the high-resolution
multi-spectral (HR-MS) images. Although deep learning-based models have
achieved excellent performance, they often come with high computational
complexity, which hinder their applications on resource-limited devices. In
this paper, we explore the feasibility of applying the binary neural network
(BNN) to pan-sharpening. Nevertheless, there are two main issues with
binarizing pan-sharpening models: (i) the binarization will cause serious
spectral distortion due to the inconsistent spectral distribution of the
PAN/LR-MS images; (ii) the common binary convolution kernel is difficult to
adapt to the multi-scale and anisotropic spatial features of remote sensing
objects, resulting in serious degradation of contours. To address the above
issues, we design the customized spatial-spectral binarized convolution
(S2B-Conv), which is composed of the Spectral-Redistribution Mechanism (SRM)
and Gabor Spatial Feature Amplifier (GSFA). Specifically, SRM employs an affine
transformation, generating its scaling and bias parameters through a dynamic
learning process. GSFA, which randomly selects different frequencies and angles
within a preset range, enables to better handle multi-scale and-directional
spatial features. A series of S2B-Conv form a brand-new binary network for
pan-sharpening, dubbed as S2BNet. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments have shown our high-efficiency binarized pan-sharpening method can
attain a promising performance.

*Hongrui Jia,Chaoya Jiang,Shikun Zhang,Wei Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training-free visual-reasoning pipeline that decouples reasoning and perception to address the issue of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) losing visual grounding during extended reasoning chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LMMs increasingly rely on textual logic and lose grounding in visual information as their reasoning chains extend, leading to reasoning paths that diverge from image content and produce erroneous conclusions.

Method: A training-free pipeline where a powerful LLM orchestrates high-level reasoning and strategically interrogates a LMM to extract specific visual information needed for logical chains, while the LMM functions exclusively as a visual question-answering engine.

Result: The framework effectively governs visual reasoning process, significantly reduces visually-unfounded reasoning steps, and substantially improves reasoning fidelity.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight, plug-and-play approach requires no additional training or architectural changes and successfully addresses the visual grounding problem in multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Significant advancements in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) are now driven by test-time scaling laws, particularly those
leveraging extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Inspired by these
breakthroughs, researchers have extended these paradigms to Large Multimodal
Models (LMMs). However, a critical limitation emerges: as their reasoning
chains extend, LMMs increasingly rely on textual logic, progressively losing
grounding in the underlying visual information. This leads to reasoning paths
that diverge from the image content, culminating in erroneous conclusions. To
address this, we introduce a strikingly simple yet effective training-free
visual-reasoning pipeline. The core concept is to decouple the reasoning and
perception processes. A powerful LLM orchestrates the high-level reasoning,
strategically interrogating a LMM to extract specific visual information
required for its logical chain. The LMM, in turn, functions exclusively as a
visual question-answering engine, supplying the necessary perceptual details on
demand. This lightweight, plug-and-play approach requires no additional
training or architectural changes. Comprehensive evaluations validate that our
framework effectively governs the visual reasoning process, leading to a
significant reduction in visually-unfounded reasoning steps and a substantial
improvement in reasoning fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dual-Decoupled Prompting (DDP) is a replay-free framework for multi-label class-incremental learning that addresses semantic confusion and partial labeling issues through class-specific prompts and progressive confidence decoupling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt-based methods work well for single-label incremental learning but fail in multi-label scenarios due to semantic confusion from co-occurring categories and true-negative-false-positive confusion from partial labeling.

Method: DDP uses class-specific positive-negative prompts to disentangle semantics and Progressive Confidence Decoupling (PCD) to suppress false positives. It freezes past prompts as knowledge anchors and uses interlayer prompting for efficiency.

Result: DDP consistently outperforms prior methods on MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC, becoming the first replay-free MLCIL approach to exceed 80% mAP and 70% F1 under the standard MS-COCO B40-C10 benchmark.

Conclusion: DDP effectively addresses the key challenges in multi-label class-incremental learning through its dual-decoupled prompting approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance without requiring replay mechanisms.

Abstract: Prompt-based methods have shown strong effectiveness in single-label
class-incremental learning, but their direct extension to multi-label
class-incremental learning (MLCIL) performs poorly due to two intrinsic
challenges: semantic confusion from co-occurring categories and
true-negative-false-positive confusion caused by partial labeling. We propose
Dual-Decoupled Prompting (DDP), a replay-free and parameter-efficient framework
that explicitly addresses both issues. DDP assigns class-specific
positive-negative prompts to disentangle semantics and introduces Progressive
Confidence Decoupling (PCD), a curriculum-inspired decoupling strategy that
suppresses false positives. Past prompts are frozen as knowledge anchors, and
interlayer prompting enhances efficiency. On MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC, DDP
consistently outperforms prior methods and is the first replay-free MLCIL
approach to exceed 80% mAP and 70% F1 under the standard MS-COCO B40-C10
benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LRPO is the first online RL framework for blind face restoration, using likelihood regularization and specialized rewards to improve restoration quality while maintaining fidelity to ground truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blind Face Restoration faces challenges with large solution space causing artifacts like missing details and identity ambiguity. Direct RL application creates incompatibility issues with ground truth.

Method: Likelihood-Regularized Policy Optimization (LRPO) with three key strategies: composite reward function for face restoration, ground-truth guided likelihood regularization, and noise-level advantage assignment.

Result: Extensive experiments show LRPO significantly improves face restoration quality over baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: LRPO effectively balances perceptual quality and fidelity in blind face restoration, demonstrating the successful application of online reinforcement learning to this challenging task.

Abstract: Blind Face Restoration (BFR) encounters inherent challenges in exploring its
large solution space, leading to common artifacts like missing details and
identity ambiguity in the restored images. To tackle these challenges, we
propose a Likelihood-Regularized Policy Optimization (LRPO) framework, the
first to apply online reinforcement learning (RL) to the BFR task. LRPO
leverages rewards from sampled candidates to refine the policy network,
increasing the likelihood of high-quality outputs while improving restoration
performance on low-quality inputs. However, directly applying RL to BFR creates
incompatibility issues, producing restoration results that deviate
significantly from the ground truth. To balance perceptual quality and
fidelity, we propose three key strategies: 1) a composite reward function
tailored for face restoration assessment, 2) ground-truth guided likelihood
regularization, and 3) noise-level advantage assignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed LRPO significantly improves the face restoration
quality over baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

interpretation across diverse imaging modalities and integrated information
synthesis. While current AI models excel at isolated tasks, they often fall
short in addressing the complex, multimodal requirements of comprehensive
clinical dental practice. Here we introduce DentVLM, a multimodal
vision-language model engineered for expert-level oral disease diagnosis.
DentVLM was developed using a comprehensive, large-scale, bilingual dataset of
110,447 images and 2.46 million visual question-answering (VQA) pairs. The
model is capable of interpreting seven 2D oral imaging modalities across 36
diagnostic tasks, significantly outperforming leading proprietary and
open-source models by 19.6% higher accuracy for oral diseases and 27.9% for
malocclusions. In a clinical study involving 25 dentists, evaluating 1,946
patients and encompassing 3,105 QA pairs, DentVLM surpassed the diagnostic
performance of 13 junior dentists on 21 of 36 tasks and exceeded that of 12
senior dentists on 12 of 36 tasks. When integrated into a collaborative
workflow, DentVLM elevated junior dentists' performance to senior levels and
reduced diagnostic time for all practitioners by 15-22%. Furthermore, DentVLM
exhibited promising performance across three practical utility scenarios,
including home-based dental health management, hospital-based intelligent
diagnosis and multi-agent collaborative interaction. These findings establish
DentVLM as a robust clinical decision support tool, poised to enhance primary
dental care, mitigate provider-patient imbalances, and democratize access to
specialized medical expertise within the field of dentistry.

*Xiaolong Fu,Lichen Ma,Zipeng Guo,Gaojing Zhou,Chongxiao Wang,ShiPing Dong,Shizhe Zhou,Shizhe Zhou,Ximan Liu,Jingling Fu,Tan Lit Sin,Yu Shi,Zhen Chen,Junshi Huang,Jason Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dynamic-TreeRPO is a novel RL-enhanced flow matching model for text-to-image generation that uses tree-structured sampling with dynamic noise intensities and integrates SFT as a weighted Progress Reward Model, achieving superior performance and 50% training efficiency improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL-enhanced text-to-image generation models suffer from exhaustive exploration and inefficient sampling due to slight variations in sampling groups, limiting their practical deployment despite quality improvements.

Method: Proposes Dynamic-TreeRPO with sliding-window sampling as tree-structured search using dynamic noise intensities, GRPO-guided optimization, constrained SDE sampling, and LayerTuning-RL that reformulates SFT loss as dynamically weighted Progress Reward Model with adaptive clipping bounds.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art by 4.9% on HPS-v2.1, 5.91% on PickScore, and 8.66% on ImageReward benchmarks while improving training efficiency by nearly 50%, demonstrating superior semantic consistency, visual fidelity, and human preference alignment.

Conclusion: The tree-structured sampling and LayerTuning-RL paradigm enable dynamic exploration of diverse search spaces along effective directions, achieving significant performance gains and efficiency improvements in text-to-image generation.

Abstract: The integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) into flow matching models for
text-to-image (T2I) generation has driven substantial advances in generation
quality. However, these gains often come at the cost of exhaustive exploration
and inefficient sampling strategies due to slight variation in the sampling
group. Building on this insight, we propose Dynamic-TreeRPO, which implements
the sliding-window sampling strategy as a tree-structured search with dynamic
noise intensities along depth. We perform GRPO-guided optimization and
constrained Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) sampling within this tree
structure. By sharing prefix paths of the tree, our design effectively
amortizes the computational overhead of trajectory search. With well-designed
noise intensities for each tree layer, Dynamic-TreeRPO can enhance the
variation of exploration without any extra computational cost. Furthermore, we
seamlessly integrate Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and RL paradigm within
Dynamic-TreeRPO to construct our proposed LayerTuning-RL, reformulating the
loss function of SFT as a dynamically weighted Progress Reward Model (PRM)
rather than a separate pretraining method. By associating this weighted PRM
with dynamic-adaptive clipping bounds, the disruption of exploration process in
Dynamic-TreeRPO is avoided. Benefiting from the tree-structured sampling and
the LayerTuning-RL paradigm, our model dynamically explores a diverse search
space along effective directions. Compared to existing baselines, our approach
demonstrates significant superiority in terms of semantic consistency, visual
fidelity, and human preference alignment on established benchmarks, including
HPS-v2.1, PickScore, and ImageReward. In particular, our model outperforms SoTA
by $4.9\%$, $5.91\%$, and $8.66\%$ on those benchmarks, respectively, while
improving the training efficiency by nearly $50\%$.

### [82] [Test-time Uncertainty Estimation for Medical Image Registration via Transformation Equivariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23355)
*Lin Tian,Xiaoling Hu,Juan Eugenio Iglesias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A test-time uncertainty estimation framework for medical image registration that works with any pretrained network by analyzing prediction variance under spatial perturbations, without requiring architectural changes or retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep registration networks lack reliability indicators, and existing uncertainty methods require architectural modifications or retraining, limiting their applicability to pretrained networks.

Method: Leverages transformation equivariance property of registration to analyze prediction variance under spatial perturbations, decomposing uncertainty into intrinsic spread (epistemic noise) and bias jitter (systematic error drift).

Result: Across four anatomical structures and multiple registration models, the uncertainty maps consistently correlate with registration errors and identify regions requiring caution.

Conclusion: The framework transforms any pretrained registration network into a risk-aware tool, advancing toward safe deployment in clinical and research settings.

Abstract: Accurate image registration is essential for downstream applications, yet
current deep registration networks provide limited indications of whether and
when their predictions are reliable. Existing uncertainty estimation
strategies, such as Bayesian methods, ensembles, or MC dropout, require
architectural changes or retraining, limiting their applicability to pretrained
registration networks. Instead, we propose a test-time uncertainty estimation
framework that is compatible with any pretrained networks. Our framework is
grounded in the transformation equivariance property of registration, which
states that the true mapping between two images should remain consistent under
spatial perturbations of the input. By analyzing the variance of network
predictions under such perturbations, we derive a theoretical decomposition of
perturbation-based uncertainty in registration. This decomposition separates
into two terms: (i) an intrinsic spread, reflecting epistemic noise, and (ii) a
bias jitter, capturing how systematic error drifts under perturbations. Across
four anatomical structures (brain, cardiac, abdominal, and lung) and multiple
registration models (uniGradICON, SynthMorph), the uncertainty maps correlate
consistently with registration errors and highlight regions requiring caution.
Our framework turns any pretrained registration network into a risk-aware tool
at test time, placing medical image registration one step closer to safe
deployment in clinical and large-scale research settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRAPE is a plug-and-play enhancement approach that uses ranking-aware policy optimization to improve CLIP-based retrieval performance under distribution shifts like multilingual, long-form, and multimodal differences, achieving 4.9% average improvement in Recall@10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP struggles with distribution shifts in retrieval tasks (multilingual, long-form, multimodal) and existing LLM-based query rewriting methods lack supervision signals to generate optimal queries aligned with the retriever's training distribution.

Method: GRAPE incorporates ranking signals into retrieval-guided query rewriting using Grouped Ranking-Aware Policy Optimization (GRPO), with a corpus-relative ranking-based reward to address score inflation issues from naive similarity score finetuning.

Result: Extensive experiments show GRAPE consistently improves retrieval performance under various distributional shifts - multilingual (Flickr30k-CN, CVLUE, XM3600), length (Wikipedia), and multimodal (CIRR) - with average 4.9% improvement in Recall@10.

Conclusion: GRAPE effectively bridges distributional gaps in CLIP-based retrieval systems by incorporating ranking signals into query rewriting, demonstrating significant performance improvements across diverse distribution shift scenarios without costly retraining.

Abstract: The CLIP model has become a cornerstone of large-scale retrieval systems by
aligning text and image data in a unified embedding space. Despite its
simplicity and efficiency, CLIP struggles when applied to tasks whose input
distributions diverge from its training corpus, such as queries with
multilingual, long-form, or multimodal differences. To avoid costly retraining,
existing methods mainly adopt query-rewriting strategies with large language
models (LLMs), aiming to mitigate distribution gaps at the query level.
However, due to the lack of supervision signals, LLMs fail to generate the
optimal one that fits the training distribution. We address this challenge with
GRAPE (Grouped Ranking-Aware Policy Optimization Enhancement), a plug-and-play
enhancement approach that incorporates ranking signals into retrieval-guided
query rewriting with LLMs. Intuitively, GRAPE proposes to leverage GRPO to
bridge distributional differences -- including length, multilingual, and
modality shifts -- by transforming queries into forms better aligned with the
retriever's training distribution. However, our preliminary experiment finds
that naively finetuning LLM with similarity scores can lead to score inflation,
where nearly all candidates are assigned unexpectedly high scores regardless of
their true relevance. To address score inflation, we propose a corpus-relative
ranking-based reward, which explicitly aligns optimization with ranking metrics
while suppressing spurious score inflation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that GRAPE consistently improves retrieval performance under distributional
shifts -- including multilingual differences (Flickr30k-CN, CVLUE, XM3600),
length differences (Wikipedia), and multimodal differences (CIRR) -- achieving
an average improvement of 4.9\% in Recall\@10. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CasPoinTr is a point cloud completion framework using cascaded networks and knowledge distillation to address incomplete point clouds from real-world environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point clouds from real-world environments are often incomplete due to limited sensor resolution, single viewpoints, occlusions, and noise, making completion essential for various applications.

Method: Two-stage cascaded framework: Shape Reconstruction generates auxiliary information, and Fused Completion leverages this information with knowledge distillation from a teacher model trained on denser point clouds.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on ShapeNet-55 under different difficulty settings in shape recovery and detail preservation.

Conclusion: The cascaded structure and distillation strategy effectively bridge the gap between incomplete inputs and complete targets by enhancing global shape context capture and local detail refinement.

Abstract: Point clouds collected from real-world environments are often incomplete due
to factors such as limited sensor resolution, single viewpoints, occlusions,
and noise. These challenges make point cloud completion essential for various
applications. A key difficulty in this task is predicting the overall shape and
reconstructing missing regions from highly incomplete point clouds. To address
this, we introduce CasPoinTr, a novel point cloud completion framework using
cascaded networks and knowledge distillation. CasPoinTr decomposes the
completion task into two synergistic stages: Shape Reconstruction, which
generates auxiliary information, and Fused Completion, which leverages this
information alongside knowledge distillation to generate the final output.
Through knowledge distillation, a teacher model trained on denser point clouds
transfers incomplete-complete associative knowledge to the student model,
enhancing its ability to estimate the overall shape and predict missing
regions. Together, the cascaded networks and knowledge distillation enhance the
model's ability to capture global shape context while refining local details,
effectively bridging the gap between incomplete inputs and complete targets.
Experiments on ShapeNet-55 under different difficulty settings demonstrate that
CasPoinTr outperforms existing methods in shape recovery and detail
preservation, highlighting the effectiveness of our cascaded structure and
distillation strategy.

*Jinghong Zheng,Changlong Jiang,Jiaqi Li,Haohong Kuang,Hang Xu,Tingbing Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniPose is a unified cross-modality method for weakly supervised 3D human pose estimation that transfers 2D pose annotations to 3D using RGB-D sequences without needing 3D keypoint annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate the need for labor-intensive 3D keypoint annotations in 3D human pose estimation by leveraging easily acquired RGB-D sequences and bridging the gap between 2D and 3D domains without multi-view camera calibration issues.

Method: Uses self-supervised learning on RGB-D sequences to transfer 2D HPE annotations to 3D domain. Leverages off-the-shelf 2D pose estimations as weak supervision for point cloud networks with spatial-temporal constraints, 2D-to-3D back-projection loss, and cross-modality interaction. Employs anchor-to-joint prediction for 3D lifting on RGB and depth networks.

Result: Achieves comparable performance to fully supervised methods on CMU Panoptic and ITOP datasets. Incorporation of large-scale unlabeled data (NTU RGB+D 60) enhances performance under challenging conditions. The proposed 3D lifting method achieves state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: UniPose demonstrates effective weakly supervised 3D human pose estimation by bridging 2D and 3D domains without requiring expensive 3D annotations, showing strong potential for practical applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we present UniPose, a unified cross-modality pose prior
propagation method for weakly supervised 3D human pose estimation (HPE) using
unannotated single-view RGB-D sequences (RGB, depth, and point cloud data).
UniPose transfers 2D HPE annotations from large-scale RGB datasets (e.g., MS
COCO) to the 3D domain via self-supervised learning on easily acquired RGB-D
sequences, eliminating the need for labor-intensive 3D keypoint annotations.
This approach bridges the gap between 2D and 3D domains without suffering from
issues related to multi-view camera calibration or synthetic-to-real data
shifts. During training, UniPose leverages off-the-shelf 2D pose estimations as
weak supervision for point cloud networks, incorporating spatial-temporal
constraints like body symmetry and joint motion. The 2D-to-3D back-projection
loss and cross-modality interaction further enhance this process. By treating
the point cloud network's 3D HPE results as pseudo ground truth, our
anchor-to-joint prediction method performs 3D lifting on RGB and depth
networks, making it more robust against inaccuracies in 2D HPE results compared
to state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on CMU Panoptic and ITOP datasets show
that UniPose achieves comparable performance to fully supervised methods.
Incorporating large-scale unlabeled data (e.g., NTU RGB+D 60) enhances its
performance under challenging conditions, demonstrating its potential for
practical applications. Our proposed 3D lifting method also achieves
state-of-the-art results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Goliath-SC, the first extensive self-contact dataset with precise body shape registration, and proposes a shape-conditioned generative model for self-contact poses that improves single-view human pose estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-contact datasets lack variety of poses and precise body shapes, limiting analysis between self-contact poses and body shapes. Body shape significantly affects self-contact (e.g., hand-belly contact differs for low vs high BMI individuals).

Method: Created Goliath-SC dataset with 383K self-contact poses across 130 subjects. Proposed body-part-wise latent diffusion with self-attention for generative modeling of self-contact prior conditioned by body shape parameters. Incorporated this prior into single-view pose estimation with contact refinement.

Result: Shape conditioning proved vital for successfully modeling self-contact pose distribution. The approach improved single-view pose estimation performance in self-contact scenarios.

Conclusion: Body shape conditioning is essential for accurate self-contact pose modeling and improves pose estimation in self-contact situations.

Abstract: One can hardly model self-contact of human poses without considering
underlying body shapes. For example, the pose of rubbing a belly for a person
with a low BMI leads to penetration of the hand into the belly for a person
with a high BMI. Despite its relevance, existing self-contact datasets lack the
variety of self-contact poses and precise body shapes, limiting conclusive
analysis between self-contact poses and shapes. To address this, we begin by
introducing the first extensive self-contact dataset with precise body shape
registration, Goliath-SC, consisting of 383K self-contact poses across 130
subjects. Using this dataset, we propose generative modeling of self-contact
prior conditioned by body shape parameters, based on a body-part-wise latent
diffusion with self-attention. We further incorporate this prior into
single-view human pose estimation while refining estimated poses to be in
contact. Our experiments suggest that shape conditioning is vital to the
successful modeling of self-contact pose distribution, hence improving
single-view pose estimation in self-contact.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between scene generation (which lacks 3D consistency) and reconstruction (which lacks generative capabilities) in autonomous driving systems, enabling scalable and controllable training data with convenient novel-view synthesis.

Method: Two-step approach: (1) 4D-aware latent diffusion model that generates pixel-aligned 4D Gaussians using multi-modal information, (2) Enhanced video diffusion model to refine novel view videos rendered from the Gaussians.

Result: Extensive experiments show WorldSplat effectively generates high-fidelity, temporally and spatially consistent multi-track novel view driving videos on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: WorldSplat successfully overcomes the dilemma between scene generation and reconstruction, providing a framework for generating consistent 4D driving scenes with improved novel-view synthesis capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in driving-scene generation and reconstruction have
demonstrated significant potential for enhancing autonomous driving systems by
producing scalable and controllable training data. Existing generation methods
primarily focus on synthesizing diverse and high-fidelity driving videos;
however, due to limited 3D consistency and sparse viewpoint coverage, they
struggle to support convenient and high-quality novel-view synthesis (NVS).
Conversely, recent 3D/4D reconstruction approaches have significantly improved
NVS for real-world driving scenes, yet inherently lack generative capabilities.
To overcome this dilemma between scene generation and reconstruction, we
propose \textbf{WorldSplat}, a novel feed-forward framework for 4D
driving-scene generation. Our approach effectively generates consistent
multi-track videos through two key steps: ((i)) We introduce a 4D-aware latent
diffusion model integrating multi-modal information to produce pixel-aligned 4D
Gaussians in a feed-forward manner. ((ii)) Subsequently, we refine the novel
view videos rendered from these Gaussians using a enhanced video diffusion
model. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
\textbf{WorldSplat} effectively generates high-fidelity, temporally and
spatially consistent multi-track novel view driving videos.

TL;DR: SPIKE is an inference-time framework that uses Bayesian Surprise to identify memorable moments in videos, enabling more effective frame sampling for Video-LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video-LLMs sample frames uniformly, often missing critical narrative-defining moments in videos where surprising events occur.

Method: SPIKE quantifies Bayesian Surprise as belief updates from new visual evidence, and SPIKE-RL uses GRPO to optimize belief hypotheses based on video caption rewards for surprise-weighted frame sampling.

Result: Achieved strong correlation with human surprise benchmarks (FunQA and Oops!) and consistent performance gains on five downstream benchmarks over uniform sampling.

Conclusion: By enabling Video-LLMs to track beliefs and register surprise, this work paves the way for more robust models that can revise their understanding in response to new information.

Abstract: Real-world videos often show routine activities punctuated by memorable,
surprising events. However, most Video-LLMs process videos by sampling frames
uniformly, likely missing critical moments that define a video's narrative. We
introduce SPIKE, an inference-time framework that quantifies Bayesian Surprise
as the belief update triggered by new visual evidence in the video stream,
identifying moments where new visual evidence conflicts with prior beliefs.
SPIKE effectively localizes surprise in videos, strongly correlated with humans
on positive (FunQA) and negative (Oops!) surprise benchmarks. Since the beliefs
of zero-shot Video-LLMs are often suboptimal, we develop SPIKE-RL, which
leverages GRPO to optimize belief hypotheses based on a reward signal from the
video caption. SPIKE and SPIKE-RL guide query-agnostic surprise-weighted frame
sampling, which allocates more frames to interesting moments in the video. With
this strategy, we achieve consistent performance gains on five downstream
benchmarks over uniform sampling. By enabling Video-LLMs to track beliefs and
register surprise, our work paves the way for more robust models that can
revise their understanding in response to new information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing periodic activation-based INR networks like SIREN and FINER suffer from hidden feature redundancy due to fixed frequency multipliers, limiting MLP expressive capacity.

Method: Proposed FM-SIREN and FM-FINER with Nyquist-informed, neuron-specific frequency multipliers for periodic activations, introducing frequency diversity without hyperparameter tuning or extra network depth.

Result: Reduces feature redundancy by nearly 50% and consistently improves signal reconstruction across 1D audio, 2D image, 3D shape fitting, and NeRF synthesis tasks while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: The neuron-specific frequency multiplier approach effectively addresses feature redundancy in periodic activation-based INRs, enhancing performance across diverse applications.

Abstract: Existing periodic activation-based implicit neural representation (INR)
networks, such as SIREN and FINER, suffer from hidden feature redundancy, where
neurons within a layer capture overlapping frequency components due to the use
of a fixed frequency multiplier. This redundancy limits the expressive capacity
of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). Drawing inspiration from classical signal
processing methods such as the Discrete Sine Transform (DST), we propose
FM-SIREN and FM-FINER, which assign Nyquist-informed, neuron-specific frequency
multipliers to periodic activations. Unlike existing approaches, our design
introduces frequency diversity without requiring hyperparameter tuning or
additional network depth. This simple yet principled modification reduces the
redundancy of features by nearly 50% and consistently improves signal
reconstruction across diverse INR tasks, including fitting 1D audio, 2D image
and 3D shape, and synthesis of neural radiance fields (NeRF), outperforming
their baseline counterparts while maintaining efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoR-SALE is a framework that enhances text-to-image generation by incorporating Frame of Reference concepts to better handle spatial descriptions from different perspectives, using vision modules and latent-space operations to correct misalignments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art text-to-image models struggle with spatial descriptions from perspectives other than the camera view, creating a performance gap in spatial reasoning that humans naturally handle through Frame of Reference concepts.

Method: Extends the SLD framework by evaluating text-image alignment using Frame of Reference, employing vision modules to extract spatial configurations and map spatial expressions to camera perspectives, then applying latent-space operations to adjust facing direction and depth when misalignment is detected.

Result: Improves performance of state-of-the-art T2I models by up to 5.3% on spatial understanding benchmarks using only a single round of correction.

Conclusion: Integrating Frame of Reference concepts into multimodal language models significantly enhances their spatial reasoning capabilities in text-to-image generation, addressing a fundamental limitation in current approaches.

Abstract: Frame of Reference (FoR) is a fundamental concept in spatial reasoning that
humans utilize to comprehend and describe space. With the rapid progress in
Multimodal Language models, the moment has come to integrate this
long-overlooked dimension into these models. In particular, in text-to-image
(T2I) generation, even state-of-the-art models exhibit a significant
performance gap when spatial descriptions are provided from perspectives other
than the camera. To address this limitation, we propose Frame of
Reference-guided Spatial Adjustment in LLM-based Diffusion Editing (FoR-SALE),
an extension of the Self-correcting LLM-controlled Diffusion (SLD) framework
for T2I. For-Sale evaluates the alignment between a given text and an initially
generated image, and refines the image based on the Frame of Reference
specified in the spatial expressions. It employs vision modules to extract the
spatial configuration of the image, while simultaneously mapping the spatial
expression to a corresponding camera perspective. This unified perspective
enables direct evaluation of alignment between language and vision. When
misalignment is detected, the required editing operations are generated and
applied. FoR-SALE applies novel latent-space operations to adjust the facing
direction and depth of the generated images. We evaluate FoR-SALE on two
benchmarks specifically designed to assess spatial understanding with FoR. Our
framework improves the performance of state-of-the-art T2I models by up to 5.3%
using only a single round of correction.

Motivation: Monocular 3D pose estimators produce camera-centered skeletons with view-dependent signals, complicating comparative motion analysis in applications like health and sports science.

Method: A hybrid encoder fuses local skeletal features from graph convolutional networks with global context from transformers via gated cross-attention, predicting a continuous 6D rotation mapped to SO(3) matrix for pose alignment. Trained self-supervised on synthetically rotated poses using composite loss.

Result: On MM-Fi benchmark: reduces mean rotation error from over 20° to 3.4° and Mean Per Joint Position Error from ~64 mm to 47 mm compared to geometric baseline. Qualitative evaluation on TotalCapture shows strong correspondence to ground-truth IMU data.

Conclusion: 3DPCNet effectively removes viewpoint variability to enable physically plausible motion analysis by producing consistent body-centered canonical frames from any input pose.

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimators produce camera-centered skeletons, creating
view-dependent kinematic signals that complicate comparative analysis in
applications such as health and sports science. We present 3DPCNet, a compact,
estimator-agnostic module that operates directly on 3D joint coordinates to
rectify any input pose into a consistent, body-centered canonical frame. Its
hybrid encoder fuses local skeletal features from a graph convolutional network
with global context from a transformer via a gated cross-attention mechanism.
From this representation, the model predicts a continuous 6D rotation that is
mapped to an $SO(3)$ matrix to align the pose. We train the model in a
self-supervised manner on the MM-Fi dataset using synthetically rotated poses,
guided by a composite loss ensuring both accurate rotation and pose
reconstruction. On the MM-Fi benchmark, 3DPCNet reduces the mean rotation error
from over 20$^{\circ}$ to 3.4$^{\circ}$ and the Mean Per Joint Position Error
from ~64 mm to 47 mm compared to a geometric baseline. Qualitative evaluations
on the TotalCapture dataset further demonstrate that our method produces
acceleration signals from video that show strong visual correspondence to
ground-truth IMU sensor data, confirming that our module removes viewpoint
variability to enable physically plausible motion analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fine-grained test-time optimization framework that improves compositional faithfulness in text-to-image generation by decomposing prompts into semantic concepts and using concept-level alignment feedback to iteratively refine prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models often fail to faithfully render all elements of complex prompts, frequently omitting or misrepresenting specific objects and attributes. Test-time optimization shows promise but existing approaches rely only on global image/text similarity scores.

Method: Decomposes input prompts into semantic concepts and evaluates alignment at both global and concept levels using a fine-grained CLIP variant. Produces detailed feedback on missing/inaccurate concepts, which feeds into an iterative prompt refinement loop using a large language model.

Result: Experiments on DrawBench and CompBench prompts show significant improvements in concept coverage and human-judged faithfulness over both standard test-time optimization and the base T2I model.

Conclusion: The proposed fine-grained test-time optimization framework effectively enhances compositional faithfulness in text-to-image generation by addressing concept-level misalignments through iterative prompt refinement.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, they often fail to
faithfully render all elements of complex prompts, frequently omitting or
misrepresenting specific objects and attributes. Test-time optimization has
emerged as a promising approach to address this limitation by refining
generation without the need for retraining. In this paper, we propose a
fine-grained test-time optimization framework that enhances compositional
faithfulness in T2I generation. Unlike most of prior approaches that rely
solely on a global image/text similarity score, our method decomposes the input
prompt into semantic concepts and evaluates alignment at both the global and
concept levels. A fine-grained variant of CLIP is used to compute concept-level
correspondence, producing detailed feedback on missing or inaccurate concepts.
This feedback is fed into an iterative prompt refinement loop, enabling the
large language model to propose improved prompts. Experiments on DrawBench and
CompBench prompts demonstrate that our method significantly improves concept
coverage and human-judged faithfulness over both standard test-time
optimization and the base T2I model. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MFAS-DANet is a novel framework for multi-modal face anti-spoofing under domain adaptation, addressing missing modalities, noisy pseudo labels, and model degradation through complementary feature extraction, uncertainty-based pseudo labeling, and adaptive loss weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal FAS models fail to detect unseen attacks from new target domains, and domain adaptation remains unexplored in multi-modal FAS despite being proposed for single-modal FAS.

Method: Proposes three key components: 1) Complementary feature extraction from other modalities to handle missing modalities, 2) Uncertainty-based pseudo labeling to reduce noise, 3) Adaptive loss weighting mechanism to prevent model degradation during unstable adaptations.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of MFAS-DANet in multi-modal face anti-spoofing under domain adaptation scenarios.

Conclusion: MFAS-DANet successfully addresses the three major challenges in multi-modal FAS domain adaptation and achieves superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Recent multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have investigated the
potential of leveraging multiple modalities to distinguish live and spoof
faces. However, pre-adapted multi-modal FAS models often fail to detect unseen
attacks from new target domains. Although a more realistic domain adaptation
(DA) scenario has been proposed for single-modal FAS to learn specific spoof
attacks during inference, DA remains unexplored in multi-modal FAS methods. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework, MFAS-DANet, to address three major
challenges in multi-modal FAS under the DA scenario: missing modalities, noisy
pseudo labels, and model degradation. First, to tackle the issue of missing
modalities, we propose extracting complementary features from other modalities
to substitute missing modality features or enhance existing ones. Next, to
reduce the impact of noisy pseudo labels during model adaptation, we propose
deriving reliable pseudo labels by leveraging prediction uncertainty across
different modalities. Finally, to prevent model degradation, we design an
adaptive mechanism that decreases the loss weight during unstable adaptations
and increasing it during stable ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of our proposed MFAS-DANet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RestoRect is a novel knowledge distillation method for image restoration that uses rectified flow to enable students to synthesize teacher-quality features through learnable latent trajectories, achieving better training stability, faster convergence and inference while maintaining restoration quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image restoration approaches face a trade-off between high performance (slow models) and fast inference (poor results). Existing static feature matching methods cannot capture how modern transformer architectures dynamically generate features.

Method: Proposes RestoRect - a Latent Rectified Flow Feature Distillation method that applies rectified flow to reformulate feature distillation as a generative process. Combines Retinex theory for physics-based decomposition with learnable anisotropic diffusion constraints and trigonometric color space polarization. Introduces Feature Layer Extraction loss for robust knowledge transfer between different architectures through cross-normalized transformer feature alignment with percentile-based outlier detection.

Result: Achieves superior results across 15 image restoration datasets covering 4 tasks on 8 metrics. Demonstrates better training stability, faster convergence and inference while preserving restoration quality.

Conclusion: RestoRect successfully addresses the performance-speed trade-off in image restoration through its novel latent rectified flow feature distillation approach, enabling efficient knowledge transfer from high-performance teachers to fast student models.

Abstract: Current approaches for restoration of degraded images face a critical
trade-off: high-performance models are too slow for practical use, while fast
models produce poor results. Knowledge distillation transfers teacher knowledge
to students, but existing static feature matching methods cannot capture how
modern transformer architectures dynamically generate features. We propose
'RestoRect', a novel Latent Rectified Flow Feature Distillation method for
restoring degraded images. We apply rectified flow to reformulate feature
distillation as a generative process where students learn to synthesize
teacher-quality features through learnable trajectories in latent space. Our
framework combines Retinex theory for physics-based decomposition with
learnable anisotropic diffusion constraints, and trigonometric color space
polarization. We introduce a Feature Layer Extraction loss for robust knowledge
transfer between different network architectures through cross-normalized
transformer feature alignment with percentile-based outlier detection.
RestoRect achieves better training stability, and faster convergence and
inference while preserving restoration quality. We demonstrate superior results

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Orientation-anchored Gaussian Splatting (OriGS) is a novel 4D reconstruction framework that uses scene orientation as stable guidance for modeling complex dynamic scenes from monocular videos, overcoming limitations of existing motion anchor methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods extending 3D Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes rely on low-rank assumptions and fail to model complex, region-specific deformations in unconstrained dynamic scenes.

Method: Estimates a Global Orientation Field to propagate principal forward directions across space and time, then introduces Orientation-aware Hyper-Gaussian that embeds time, space, geometry, and orientation into a unified probabilistic state for inferring region-specific deformations.

Result: Experiments show superior reconstruction fidelity over mainstream methods in challenging real-world dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: OriGS provides an effective framework for high-quality 4D reconstruction by leveraging orientation-based guidance and principled conditioned slicing to capture diverse local dynamics aligned with global motion intent.

Abstract: We present Orientation-anchored Gaussian Splatting (OriGS), a novel framework
for high-quality 4D reconstruction from casually captured monocular videos.
While recent advances extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes via
various motion anchors, such as graph nodes or spline control points, they
often rely on low-rank assumptions and fall short in modeling complex,
region-specific deformations inherent to unconstrained dynamics. OriGS
addresses this by introducing a hyperdimensional representation grounded in
scene orientation. We first estimate a Global Orientation Field that propagates
principal forward directions across space and time, serving as stable
structural guidance for dynamic modeling. Built upon this, we propose
Orientation-aware Hyper-Gaussian, a unified formulation that embeds time,
space, geometry, and orientation into a coherent probabilistic state. This
enables inferring region-specific deformation through principled conditioned
slicing, adaptively capturing diverse local dynamics in alignment with global
motion intent. Experiments demonstrate the superior reconstruction fidelity of
OriGS over mainstream methods in challenging real-world dynamic scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Large-scale empirical study reveals that multi-modal benchmarks often have imbalanced dependencies on individual modalities rather than true multi-modal reasoning, with many benchmarks inadvertently amplifying image-only dependencies despite attempts to mitigate text-only biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the interplay between intra-modality dependencies (individual modality contributions) and inter-modality dependencies (relationships between modalities) in multi-modal learning, as current benchmark evaluations poorly characterize these interactions.

Method: Conducted large-scale empirical study across 23 visual question-answering benchmarks using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), covering domains including general/expert knowledge reasoning, OCR, and document understanding.

Result: Found significant variation in reliance on vision, text, and their interactions across and within benchmarks. Many benchmarks intended to reduce text-only biases actually amplified image-only dependencies. Larger models often use intra-modality dependencies to achieve high performance that masks lack of true multi-modal reasoning.

Conclusion: Provides quantitative characterization of multi-modal datasets, enabling principled approach to multi-modal benchmark design and evaluation by revealing imbalanced modality dependencies in current benchmarks.

Abstract: Understanding the interplay between intra-modality dependencies (the
contribution of an individual modality to a target task) and inter-modality
dependencies (the relationships between modalities and the target task) is
fundamental to advancing multi-modal learning. However, the nature of and
interaction between these dependencies within current benchmark evaluations
remains poorly characterized. In this work, we present a large-scale empirical
study to quantify these dependencies across 23 visual question-answering
benchmarks using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) covering domains
such as general and expert knowledge reasoning, optical character recognition,
and document understanding. Our findings show that the reliance on vision,
question (text), and their interaction varies significantly, both across and
within benchmarks. We discover that numerous benchmarks intended to mitigate
text-only biases have inadvertently amplified image-only dependencies. This
characterization persists across model sizes, as larger models often use these
intra-modality dependencies to achieve high performance that mask an underlying
lack of multi-modal reasoning. We provide a quantitative characterization of
multi-modal datasets, enabling a principled approach to multi-modal benchmark
design and evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Polyp segmentation is challenging due to diverse shapes, sizes, and low contrast boundaries in medical imaging, requiring improved accuracy for colorectal cancer detection.

Method: Combines Dynamic Kernel mechanism initialized by global context from Encoder Attention module with Unified Channel Adaptation in decoder for standardized feature dimensions and efficient information fusion.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on KvasirSEG and CVC ClinicDB datasets with superior Dice and Intersection over Union scores, while reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: Provides a robust and adaptable solution for polyp segmentation with promising clinical applications in automated diagnostic systems.

Abstract: Polyp segmentation is a critical step in colorectal cancer detection, yet it
remains challenging due to the diverse shapes, sizes, and low contrast
boundaries of polyps in medical imaging. In this work, we propose a novel
framework that improves segmentation accuracy and efficiency by integrating a
Dynamic Kernel (DK) mechanism with a global Encoder Attention module. The DK
mechanism, initialized by a global context vector from the EA module,
iteratively refines segmentation predictions across decoding stages, enabling
the model to focus on and accurately delineate complex polyp boundaries. The EA
module enhances the network's ability to capture critical lesion features by
aggregating multi scale information from all encoder layers. In addition, we
employ Unified Channel Adaptation (UCA) in the decoder to standardize feature
dimensions across stages, ensuring consistent and computationally efficient
information fusion. Our approach extends the lesion-aware kernel framework by
introducing a more flexible, attention driven kernel initialization and a
unified decoder design. Extensive experiments on the KvasirSEG and CVC ClinicDB
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms several state of the
art segmentation methods, achieving superior Dice and Intersection over Union
scores. Moreover, UCA simplifies the decoder structure, reducing computational
cost without compromising accuracy. Overall, the proposed method provides a
robust and adaptable solution for polyp segmentation, with promising
applications in clinical and automated diagnostic systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans can extract rich semantic information from minimal visual cues like point-light displays, which isolate body motion as the sole source of meaning. This ability emerges early in development and is attributed to human embodied experience, making PLDs ideal for testing action understanding constraints in AI systems.

Method: The researchers introduced ActPLD benchmark to evaluate action processing in MLLMs using human point-light displays. They tested state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models on both single-actor and socially interacting PLDs.

Result: The results reveal consistently low performance across all tested models, indicating fundamental gaps in action and spatiotemporal understanding in current MLLMs.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs show significant limitations in understanding human actions from minimal visual motion cues, highlighting fundamental gaps in their action and spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities compared to human embodied understanding.

Abstract: Humans can extract rich semantic information from minimal visual cues, as
demonstrated by point-light displays (PLDs), which consist of sparse sets of
dots localized to key joints of the human body. This ability emerges early in
development and is largely attributed to human embodied experience. Since PLDs
isolate body motion as the sole source of meaning, they represent key stimuli
for testing the constraints of action understanding in these systems. Here we
introduce ActPLD, the first benchmark to evaluate action processing in MLLMs
from human PLDs. Tested models include state-of-the-art proprietary and
open-source systems on single-actor and socially interacting PLDs. Our results
reveal consistently low performance across models, introducing fundamental gaps

TL;DR: This study developed a deep learning framework using chest CT scans to predict mortality in systemic sclerosis patients with interstitial lung disease, achieving AUCs of 0.769, 0.801, and 0.709 for 1-, 3-, and 5-year mortality prediction respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interstitial lung disease is a major cause of death in systemic sclerosis patients, but the role of CT imaging in predicting disease progression and mortality hasn't been fully established.

Method: Used a large-scale longitudinal analysis of 2,125 CT scans from SSc patients, employing pre-trained deep learning models (ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, Swin Transformer) fine-tuned for mortality prediction at 1-, 3-, and 5-year intervals.

Result: Models achieved AUCs of 0.769 (1-year), 0.801 (3-year), and 0.709 (5-year) for mortality prediction, with 181, 326, and 428 deaths recorded in the respective time intervals.

Conclusion: Both radiomics and deep learning methods show significant potential for improving early detection and risk assessment of SSc-related interstitial lung disease, representing an important advancement in the field.

Abstract: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality
in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Chest computed tomography (CT) is the primary
imaging modality for diagnosing and monitoring lung complications in SSc
patients. However, its role in disease progression and mortality prediction has
not yet been fully clarified. This study introduces a novel, large-scale
longitudinal chest CT analysis framework that utilizes radiomics and deep
learning to predict mortality associated with lung complications of SSc. We
collected and analyzed 2,125 CT scans from SSc patients enrolled in the
Northwestern Scleroderma Registry, conducting mortality analyses at one, three,
and five years using advanced imaging analysis techniques. Death labels were
assigned based on recorded deaths over the one-, three-, and five-year
intervals, confirmed by expert physicians. In our dataset, 181, 326, and 428 of
the 2,125 CT scans were from patients who died within one, three, and five
years, respectively. Using ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, and Swin Transformer we use
pre-trained models, and fine-tuned on 2,125 images of SSc patients. Models
achieved an AUC of 0.769, 0.801, 0.709 for predicting mortality within one-,
three-, and five-years, respectively. Our findings highlight the potential of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Driver monitoring systems require not just high accuracy but reliable, well-calibrated confidence scores for safety-critical deployment. Direct low-resolution training yields high accuracy but produces poorly calibrated predictions that can be dangerous in safety-critical scenarios.

Method: Proposes a resource-aware adaptive super-resolution framework that optimizes for model calibration and high precision-recall on critical events. Includes a lightweight artifact detector (0.3M parameters, 5.2ms overhead) to filter super-resolution-induced hallucinations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance: best calibration (ECE of 5.8% vs 6.2% for baselines), highest AUPR for drowsiness detection (0.78 vs 0.74), and superior precision-recall for phone use detection (0.74 vs 0.71).

Conclusion: While low-resolution trained video models serve as strong general-purpose baselines, the adaptive super-resolution framework represents the state-of-the-art solution for safety-critical applications where reliability is paramount.

Abstract: Driver monitoring systems require not just high accuracy but reliable,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OVSeg3R is a training scheme that learns open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation from 2D models using 3D reconstruction, achieving significant performance improvements on ScanNet200 benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation without costly manual annotation by leveraging existing 2D perception models and 3D reconstruction techniques.

Method: Uses 3D reconstruction from 2D videos as input, projects 2D instance masks to 3D for annotation, employs View-wise Instance Partition to handle partial annotations, and introduces 2D Instance Boundary-aware Superpoint clustering to preserve instance boundaries.

Result: +2.3 mAP overall improvement on ScanNet200 benchmark, +7.1 mAP improvement on novel classes under open-vocabulary setting, and reduced performance gap between tail and head classes.

Conclusion: OVSeg3R effectively extends closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation to open-vocabulary by leveraging 2D-3D correspondences and boundary-aware clustering, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a training scheme called OVSeg3R to learn
open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation from well-studied 2D perception models
with the aid of 3D reconstruction. OVSeg3R directly adopts reconstructed scenes
from 2D videos as input, avoiding costly manual adjustment while aligning input
with real-world applications. By exploiting the 2D to 3D correspondences
provided by 3D reconstruction models, OVSeg3R projects each view's 2D instance
mask predictions, obtained from an open-vocabulary 2D model, onto 3D to
generate annotations for the view's corresponding sub-scene. To avoid
incorrectly introduced false positives as supervision due to partial
annotations from 2D to 3D, we propose a View-wise Instance Partition algorithm,
which partitions predictions to their respective views for supervision,
stabilizing the training process. Furthermore, since 3D reconstruction models
tend to over-smooth geometric details, clustering reconstructed points into
representative super-points based solely on geometry, as commonly done in
mainstream 3D segmentation methods, may overlook geometrically non-salient
objects. We therefore introduce 2D Instance Boundary-aware Superpoint, which
leverages 2D masks to constrain the superpoint clustering, preventing
superpoints from violating instance boundaries. With these designs, OVSeg3R not
only extends a state-of-the-art closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation
model to open-vocabulary, but also substantially narrows the performance gap
between tail and head classes, ultimately leading to an overall improvement of
+2.3 mAP on the ScanNet200 benchmark. Furthermore, under the standard
open-vocabulary setting, OVSeg3R surpasses previous methods by about +7.1 mAP
on the novel classes, further validating its effectiveness.

TL;DR: This survey examines how 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is displacing NeRF-based approaches across various domains including SLAM, telepresence, robotic manipulation, and 3D content generation, highlighting its advantages in photorealism, geometric fidelity, and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why 3DGS is increasingly replacing NeRF-based approaches and to provide a systematic comparison of domain-specific pipelines that leverage neural rendering for both image synthesis and practical applications.

Method: The survey organizes the review around unified research questions examining 3DGS's technical advantages, adaptability to different input modalities and constraints, and remaining limitations through systematic comparison of domain-specific pipelines.

Result: The analysis shows that 3DGS effectively balances photorealism, geometric fidelity, and computational efficiency across multiple domains, making it suitable for perception, interaction, and content creation in both real and virtual environments.

Conclusion: 3DGS represents a significant advancement in neural scene representations that offers a roadmap for leveraging neural rendering beyond image synthesis to include practical applications in perception, interaction, and content creation across diverse environments.

Abstract: Neural scene representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have transformed how 3D environments are modeled,
rendered, and interpreted. NeRF introduced view-consistent photorealism via
volumetric rendering; 3DGS has rapidly emerged as an explicit, efficient
alternative that supports high-quality rendering, faster optimization, and
integration into hybrid pipelines for enhanced photorealism and task-driven
scene understanding. This survey examines how 3DGS is being adopted across
SLAM, telepresence and teleoperation, robotic manipulation, and 3D content
generation. Despite their differences, these domains share common goals:
photorealistic rendering, meaningful 3D structure, and accurate downstream
tasks. We organize the review around unified research questions that explain
why 3DGS is increasingly displacing NeRF-based approaches: What technical
advantages drive its adoption? How does it adapt to different input modalities
and domain-specific constraints? What limitations remain? By systematically
comparing domain-specific pipelines, we show that 3DGS balances photorealism,
geometric fidelity, and computational efficiency. The survey offers a roadmap
for leveraging neural rendering not only for image synthesis but also for
perception, interaction, and content creation across real and virtual

TL;DR: First federated learning approach for pancreas part segmentation in MRI using privacy-preserving collaborative training across 7 institutions with 711 T1W and 726 T2W MRI scans, achieving clinically viable performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pancreatic diseases show regional heterogeneity (cancers in head, chronic pancreatitis in tail), requiring accurate head/body/tail segmentation for diagnosis and treatment planning, which is challenging in MRI due to variable morphology and poor contrast.

Method: Privacy-preserving FL framework with evaluation of 3 segmentation architectures (U-Net, Attention U-Net, Swin UNETR) paired with 2 FL algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx), plus novel anatomically-informed loss function for region-specific texture contrasts.

Result: Attention U-Net with FedAvg identified as optimal for pancreatic heterogeneity, achieving clinically viable performance despite training on distributed, heterogeneous datasets.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses both technical complexity of pancreas part delineation in MRI and data scarcity problem through federated learning, enabling collaborative training without direct data sharing.

Abstract: We present the first federated learning (FL) approach for pancreas part(head,
body and tail) segmentation in MRI, addressing a critical clinical challenge as
a significant innovation. Pancreatic diseases exhibit marked regional
heterogeneity cancers predominantly occur in the head region while chronic
pancreatitis causes tissue loss in the tail, making accurate segmentation of
the organ into head, body, and tail regions essential for precise diagnosis and
treatment planning. This segmentation task remains exceptionally challenging in
MRI due to variable morphology, poor soft-tissue contrast, and anatomical
variations across patients. Our novel contribution tackles two fundamental
challenges: first, the technical complexity of pancreas part delineation in
MRI, and second the data scarcity problem that has hindered prior approaches.
We introduce a privacy-preserving FL framework that enables collaborative model
training across seven medical institutions without direct data sharing,
leveraging a diverse dataset of 711 T1W and 726 T2W MRI scans. Our key
innovations include: (1) a systematic evaluation of three state-of-the-art
segmentation architectures (U-Net, Attention U-Net,Swin UNETR) paired with two
FL algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx), revealing Attention U-Net with FedAvg as
optimal for pancreatic heterogeneity, which was never been done before; (2) a
novel anatomically-informed loss function prioritizing region-specific texture
contrasts in MRI. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach
achieves clinically viable performance despite training on distributed,
heterogeneous datasets.

TL;DR: NeuroAdapter is a brain-to-image decoding framework that directly conditions latent diffusion models on brain signals, bypassing intermediate feature spaces and providing better interpretability of how different brain areas influence image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches mask the contributions of different brain areas by using intermediate image/text feature spaces before guiding generative models, limiting understanding of how brain signals shape reconstruction outputs.

Method: Proposes NeuroAdapter framework that directly conditions latent diffusion models on brain representations, and introduces IBBI (Image-Brain BI-directional interpretability) framework to analyze cross-attention mechanisms across diffusion denoising steps.

Result: Demonstrates competitive visual reconstruction quality on public fMRI datasets compared to prior work, while providing greater transparency into how brain signals shape the generation process.

Conclusion: Highlights the potential of end-to-end brain-to-image decoding and establishes a path toward interpreting diffusion models through the lens of visual neuroscience.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that complex visual stimuli can be decoded from
human brain activity using deep generative models, helping brain science
researchers interpret how the brain represents real-world scenes. However, most
current approaches leverage mapping brain signals into intermediate image or
text feature spaces before guiding the generative process, masking the effect
of contributions from different brain areas on the final reconstruction output.
In this work, we propose NeuroAdapter, a visual decoding framework that
directly conditions a latent diffusion model on brain representations,
bypassing the need for intermediate feature spaces. Our method demonstrates
competitive visual reconstruction quality on public fMRI datasets compared to
prior work, while providing greater transparency into how brain signals shape
the generation process. To this end, we contribute an Image-Brain
BI-directional interpretability framework (IBBI) which investigates
cross-attention mechanisms across diffusion denoising steps to reveal how
different cortical areas influence the unfolding generative trajectory. Our
results highlight the potential of end-to-end brain-to-image decoding and
establish a path toward interpreting diffusion models through the lens of
visual neuroscience.

*Kaicheng Yang,Xun Zhang,Haotong Qin,Yucheng Lin,Kaisen Yang,Xianglong Yan,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RobuQ is a systematic QAT framework for Diffusion Transformers that addresses activation quantization challenges, enabling stable sub-4-bit quantization and achieving competitive image generation on ImageNet-1K with average 2-bit activations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) show superior performance but face practical deployment challenges due to high computational and memory costs, with activation quantization being the primary bottleneck for low-bit settings.

Method: Proposes RobuQ framework with: 1) ternary weight baseline (W1.58A4), 2) RobustQuantizer using Hadamard transform to normalize distributions, and 3) AMPN pipeline for activation-only mixed-precision allocation across layers.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance for DiT quantization in sub-4-bit configurations, with stable and competitive image generation on ImageNet-1K using average 2-bit activations.

Conclusion: RobuQ successfully overcomes activation quantization challenges in DiTs, enabling practical deployment of high-performance diffusion models with significantly reduced computational and memory requirements.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone
for image generation, demonstrating superior scalability and performance over
U-Net architectures. However, their practical deployment is hindered by
substantial computational and memory costs. While Quantization-Aware Training
(QAT) has shown promise for U-Nets, its application to DiTs faces unique
challenges, primarily due to the sensitivity and distributional complexity of
activations. In this work, we identify activation quantization as the primary
bottleneck for pushing DiTs to extremely low-bit settings. To address this, we
propose a systematic QAT framework for DiTs, named RobuQ. We start by
establishing a strong ternary weight (W1.58A4) DiT baseline. Building upon
this, we propose RobustQuantizer to achieve robust activation quantization. Our
theoretical analyses show that the Hadamard transform can convert unknown
per-token distributions into per-token normal distributions, providing a strong
foundation for this method. Furthermore, we propose AMPN, the first
Activation-only Mixed-Precision Network pipeline for DiTs. This method applies
ternary weights across the entire network while allocating different activation
precisions to each layer to eliminate information bottlenecks. Through
extensive experiments on unconditional and conditional image generation, our
RobuQ framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for DiT quantization in
sub-4-bit quantization configuration. To the best of our knowledge, RobuQ is
the first achieving stable and competitive image generation on large datasets
like ImageNet-1K with activations quantized to average 2 bits. The code and
models will be available at https://github.com/racoonykc/RobuQ .

### [108] [VividFace: High-Quality and Efficient One-Step Diffusion For Video Face Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23584)
*Shulian Zhang,Yong Guo,Long Peng,Ziyang Wang,Ye Chen,Wenbo Li,Xiao Zhang,Yulun Zhang,Jian Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VividFace is an efficient one-step diffusion framework for video face enhancement that addresses challenges in facial texture modeling, temporal consistency, model generalization, and inference efficiency through flow matching, joint latent-pixel training, and automated data curation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video face enhancement methods face three key challenges: difficulty in modeling intricate facial textures while maintaining temporal consistency, limited model generalization due to lack of high-quality training data, and low efficiency from repeated denoising steps during inference.

Method: Built on pretrained WANX video generation model, VividFace uses single-step flow matching for direct mapping from degraded inputs to high-quality outputs. It employs Joint Latent-Pixel Face-Focused Training with stochastic switching between facial region optimization and global reconstruction, and uses an MLLM-driven data curation pipeline for automated dataset selection.

Result: Extensive experiments show VividFace achieves state-of-the-art results in perceptual quality, identity preservation, and temporal stability, while significantly reducing inference time compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: VividFace provides an efficient and effective solution for video face enhancement that overcomes fundamental challenges in the field, offering both superior performance and practical resources for the research community.

Abstract: Video Face Enhancement (VFE) seeks to reconstruct high-quality facial regions
from degraded video sequences, a capability that underpins numerous
applications including video conferencing, film restoration, and surveillance.
Despite substantial progress in the field, current methods that primarily rely
on video super-resolution and generative frameworks continue to face three
fundamental challenges: (1) faithfully modeling intricate facial textures while
preserving temporal consistency; (2) restricted model generalization due to the
lack of high-quality face video training data; and (3) low efficiency caused by
repeated denoising steps during inference. To address these challenges, we
propose VividFace, a novel and efficient one-step diffusion framework for video
face enhancement. Built upon the pretrained WANX video generation model, our
method leverages powerful spatiotemporal priors through a single-step flow
matching paradigm, enabling direct mapping from degraded inputs to high-quality
outputs with significantly reduced inference time. To further boost efficiency,
we propose a Joint Latent-Pixel Face-Focused Training strategy that employs
stochastic switching between facial region optimization and global
reconstruction, providing explicit supervision in both latent and pixel spaces
through a progressive two-stage training process. Additionally, we introduce an
MLLM-driven data curation pipeline for automated selection of high-quality
video face datasets, enhancing model generalization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that VividFace achieves state-of-the-art results in perceptual
quality, identity preservation, and temporal stability, while offering
practical resources for the research community.

### [109] [Multi-Level Heterogeneous Knowledge Transfer Network on Forward Scattering Center Model for Limited Samples SAR ATR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23596)
*Chenxi Zhao,Daochang Wang,Siqian Zhang,Gangyao Kuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-level heterogeneous knowledge transfer network that uses forward scattering center model (FSCM) data instead of simulated images to enable purer target knowledge transfer for SAR target recognition with limited samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing simulated data-assisted methods use simulated images containing irrelevant information like background and noise, which affects the quality of migrated knowledge. The authors aim to use FSCM data which models actual target structure with strong physical meaning and interpretability.

Method: Proposes MHKT network with three key modules: task-associated information selector (TAIS) for purer feature migration, target generic knowledge transfer (TGKT) with maximum discrimination divergence metric for distribution alignment, and category relation knowledge transfer (CRKT) for handling optimization bias from data imbalance.

Result: Extensive experiments on two new datasets combining FSCM data and measured SAR images demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Using FSCM data enables purer target knowledge transfer through stepwise knowledge selection and migration, overcoming limitations of traditional simulated image approaches in SAR target recognition with limited samples.

Abstract: Simulated data-assisted SAR target recognition methods are the research
hotspot currently, devoted to solving the problem of limited samples. Existing
works revolve around simulated images, but the large amount of irrelevant
information embedded in the images, such as background, noise, etc., seriously
affects the quality of the migrated information. Our work explores a new
simulated data to migrate purer and key target knowledge, i.e., forward
scattering center model (FSCM) which models the actual local structure of the
target with strong physical meaning and interpretability. To achieve this
purpose, multi-level heterogeneous knowledge transfer (MHKT) network is
proposed, which fully migrates FSCM knowledge from the feature, distribution
and category levels, respectively. Specifically, we permit the more suitable
feature representations for the heterogeneous data and separate non-informative
knowledge by task-associated information selector (TAIS), to complete purer
target feature migration. In the distribution alignment, the new metric
function maximum discrimination divergence (MDD) in target generic knowledge
transfer (TGKT) module perceives transferable knowledge efficiently while
preserving discriminative structure about classes. Moreover, category relation
knowledge transfer (CRKT) module leverages the category relation consistency
constraint to break the dilemma of optimization bias towards simulation data
due to imbalance between simulated and measured data. Such stepwise knowledge
selection and migration will ensure the integrity of the migrated FSCM
knowledge. Notably, extensive experiments on two new datasets formed by FSCM
data and measured SAR images demonstrate the superior performance of our
method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VAMamba is a Visual Adaptive Mamba framework that overcomes limitations of fixed scanning patterns and inefficient feature utilization in Mamba-based image restoration through two innovations: QCLAM for dynamic feature fusion and GPS-SS2D for adaptive scanning paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent Mamba-based image restoration methods have promising results but are limited by fixed scanning patterns and inefficient feature utilization, constraining both restoration performance and computational efficiency.

Method: Proposes VAMamba with two key innovations: 1) QCLAM (Queue-based Cache Low-rank Adaptive Memory) uses FIFO cache to store historical representations and intelligently fuse features; 2) GPS-SS2D (Greedy Path Scan SS2D) uses Vision Transformer-generated score maps and greedy strategy to determine optimal adaptive scanning paths.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that VAMamba consistently outperforms existing approaches in both restoration quality and efficiency, establishing new benchmarks for adaptive image restoration.

Conclusion: VAMamba successfully addresses the limitations of conventional Mamba architectures by enabling adaptive focus on degraded regions while maintaining high computational efficiency, setting new standards for adaptive image restoration.

Abstract: Recent Mamba-based image restoration methods have achieved promising results
but remain
  limited by fixed scanning patterns and inefficient feature utilization.
Conventional Mamba
  architectures rely on predetermined paths that cannot adapt to diverse
degradations, constraining
  both restoration performance and computational efficiency. To overcome these
limitations, we
  propose VAMamba, a Visual Adaptive Mamba framework with two key innovations.
First,
  QCLAM(Queue-basedCacheLow-rankAdaptiveMemory)enhancesfeaturelearningthrougha
  FIFO cache that stores historical representations. Similarity between current
LoRA-adapted and
  cached features guides intelligent fusion, enabling dynamic reuse while
effectively controlling
  memorygrowth.Second, GPS-SS2D(GreedyPathScanSS2D)introducesadaptive scanning.
A
  Vision Transformer generates score maps to estimate pixel importance, and a
greedy strategy de termines optimal forward and backward scanning paths. These
learned trajectories replace rigid
  patterns, enabling SS2D to perform targeted feature extraction. The
integration of QCLAM and
  GPS-SS2D allows VAMamba to adaptively focus on degraded regions while
maintaining high
  computational efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse restoration
tasks demonstrate
  that VAMamba consistently outperforms existing approaches in both restoration
quality and
  efficiency, establishing new benchmarks for adaptive image restoration. Our

*Zekun Wang,Ethan Haarer,Zhiyi Dai,Tianyi Zhu,Christopher J. MacLellan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep taxonomic networks use a complete binary tree mixture-of-Gaussian prior in variational inference to automatically discover hierarchical taxonomies and prototype clusters from unlabeled data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in current deep hierarchical clustering methods that tie structure to class numbers and underutilize prototype information at intermediate hierarchical levels, inspired by human ability to organize knowledge hierarchically.

Method: Deep latent variable approach with complete binary tree structured mixture-of-Gaussian prior in variational inference framework, optimizing ELBO to discover taxonomic structures and prototype clusters without assuming true label sizes.

Result: Strong hierarchical clustering performance outperforming baselines across diverse image datasets, with qualitative results showing rich interpretable taxonomies capturing both coarse-grained semantic categories and fine-grained visual distinctions.

Conclusion: Deep taxonomic networks effectively bridge gaps in hierarchical clustering by automatically discovering meaningful taxonomic structures and leveraging prototype information across all hierarchical levels.

Abstract: Inspired by the human ability to learn and organize knowledge into
hierarchical taxonomies with prototypes, this paper addresses key limitations
in current deep hierarchical clustering methods. Existing methods often tie the
structure to the number of classes and underutilize the rich prototype
information available at intermediate hierarchical levels. We introduce deep
taxonomic networks, a novel deep latent variable approach designed to bridge
these gaps. Our method optimizes a large latent taxonomic hierarchy,
specifically a complete binary tree structured mixture-of-Gaussian prior within
a variational inference framework, to automatically discover taxonomic
structures and associated prototype clusters directly from unlabeled data
without assuming true label sizes. We analytically show that optimizing the
ELBO of our method encourages the discovery of hierarchical relationships among
prototypes. Empirically, our learned models demonstrate strong hierarchical
clustering performance, outperforming baselines across diverse image
classification datasets using our novel evaluation mechanism that leverages
prototype clusters discovered at all hierarchical levels. Qualitative results
further reveal that deep taxonomic networks discover rich and interpretable
hierarchical taxonomies, capturing both coarse-grained semantic categories and
fine-grained visual distinctions.

*Tangtangfang Fang,Jingxi Hu,Xiangjian He,Jiaqi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAN is a latent diffusion model for LDCT denoising that achieves high quality results while being 60x faster than pixel-space diffusion models, making it clinically viable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models provide high-quality LDCT denoising but are too slow for clinical use, with inference times exceeding thousands of seconds per scan.

Method: Uses a compressed latent space via perceptually-optimized autoencoder and attention-based conditional U-Net for fast deterministic denoising diffusion process.

Result: Achieves superior perceptual quality over CNN/GAN methods, rivals heavy diffusion models' fidelity, and is 60x faster than pixel-space diffusion denoisers while remaining competitive on PSNR/SSIM scores.

Conclusion: MAN bridges the gap between high fidelity and clinical viability, demonstrating a practical path for advanced generative models in medical imaging.

Abstract: While diffusion models have set a new benchmark for quality in Low-Dose
Computed Tomography (LDCT) denoising, their clinical adoption is critically
hindered by extreme computational costs, with inference times often exceeding
thousands of seconds per scan. To overcome this barrier, we introduce MAN, a
Latent Diffusion Enhanced Multistage Anti-Noise Network for Efficient and
High-Quality Low-Dose CT Image Denoising task. Our method operates in a
compressed latent space via a perceptually-optimized autoencoder, enabling an
attention-based conditional U-Net to perform the fast, deterministic
conditional denoising diffusion process with drastically reduced overhead. On
the LDCT and Projection dataset, our model achieves superior perceptual
quality, surpassing CNN/GAN-based methods while rivaling the reconstruction
fidelity of computationally heavy diffusion models like DDPM and Dn-Dp. Most
critically, in the inference stage, our model is over 60x faster than
representative pixel space diffusion denoisers, while remaining competitive on
PSNR/SSIM scores. By bridging the gap between high fidelity and clinical
viability, our work demonstrates a practical path forward for advanced
generative models in medical imaging.

*Yixiao Chen,Ruining Yang,Xin Chen,Jia He,Dongliang Xu,Yue Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This survey reviews topology-aware perception for autonomous driving, covering four key research directions: vectorized map construction, topological structure modeling, prior knowledge fusion, and language model-based perception, highlighting a paradigm shift from static maps to dynamic, sensor-driven perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional static maps are costly to build, difficult to update in real-time, and lack generalization across regions, limiting scalability for autonomous driving systems.

Method: Systematic review of four core research directions: vectorized map construction, topological structure modeling, prior knowledge fusion, and language model-based perception.

Result: Identifies a unifying trend of paradigm shift from static pre-built maps to dynamic sensor-driven perception, enabling more compact spatial modeling, semantic relational reasoning, robust domain knowledge integration, and multimodal scene understanding.

Conclusion: The reviewed approaches collectively pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and explainable autonomous driving systems through dynamic topology-aware perception.

Abstract: The key to achieving autonomous driving lies in topology-aware perception,
the structured understanding of the driving environment with an emphasis on
lane topology and road semantics. This survey systematically reviews four core
research directions under this theme: vectorized map construction, topological
structure modeling, prior knowledge fusion, and language model-based
perception. Across these directions, we observe a unifying trend: a paradigm
shift from static, pre-built maps to dynamic, sensor-driven perception.
Specifically, traditional static maps have provided semantic context for
autonomous systems. However, they are costly to construct, difficult to update
in real time, and lack generalization across regions, limiting their
scalability. In contrast, dynamic representations leverage on-board sensor data
for real-time map construction and topology reasoning. Each of the four
research directions contributes to this shift through compact spatial modeling,
semantic relational reasoning, robust domain knowledge integration, and
multimodal scene understanding powered by pre-trained language models.
Together, they pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and explainable
autonomous driving systems.

*Zeren Xiong,Yue Yu,Zedong Zhang,Shuo Chen,Jian Yang,Jun Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VMDiff is a diffusion-based framework that synthesizes coherent objects by fusing two input images at noise and latent levels, addressing coexistent generation and semantic bias through hybrid sampling and adaptive parameter adjustment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image fusion methods suffer from coexistent generation (objects simply juxtaposed without integration) and bias generation (one object dominates due to semantic imbalance), limiting their practical applications in artistic creation and visual media.

Method: VMDiff uses: (1) hybrid sampling combining guided denoising, inversion, and spherical interpolation for structure-aware fusion; (2) adaptive adjustment module with similarity-based score to automatically find optimal parameters and counter semantic bias.

Result: Experiments on 780 concept pairs show VMDiff outperforms strong baselines in visual quality, semantic consistency, and human-rated creativity.

Conclusion: VMDiff effectively addresses key challenges in image fusion through its dual-level integration approach and adaptive parameter optimization, enabling coherent and balanced visual synthesis.

Abstract: Creating novel images by fusing visual cues from multiple sources is a
fundamental yet underexplored problem in image-to-image generation, with broad
applications in artistic creation, virtual reality and visual media. Existing
methods often face two key challenges: coexistent generation, where multiple
objects are simply juxtaposed without true integration, and bias generation,
where one object dominates the output due to semantic imbalance. To address
these issues, we propose Visual Mixing Diffusion (VMDiff), a simple yet
effective diffusion-based framework that synthesizes a single, coherent object
by integrating two input images at both noise and latent levels. Our approach
comprises: (1) a hybrid sampling process that combines guided denoising,
inversion, and spherical interpolation with adjustable parameters to achieve
structure-aware fusion, mitigating coexistent generation; and (2) an efficient
adaptive adjustment module, which introduces a novel similarity-based score to
automatically and adaptively search for optimal parameters, countering semantic
bias. Experiments on a curated benchmark of 780 concept pairs demonstrate that
our method outperforms strong baselines in visual quality, semantic
consistency, and human-rated creativity.

*Xingjian Yang,Ashis G. Banerjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework for 6D pose estimation that combines robust initial pose estimation with fast motion-based tracking using shared lighting-invariant color-pair features, designed for efficient edge device execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of robust 6D pose estimation under difficult lighting conditions while maintaining the trade-off between accurate initial estimation and real-time tracking efficiency, particularly for edge devices.

Method: Uses a shared lighting-invariant color-pair feature representation that serves both initial estimation (registration between RGB-D view and 3D mesh) and tracking (temporal correspondence validation). Combines robust initial estimation module with lightweight motion-based tracker.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach is effective and robust, achieving competitive pose estimation accuracy while maintaining high-fidelity tracking through abrupt pose changes.

Conclusion: The integrated framework successfully provides both accurate pose estimation and efficient real-time tracking using a unified feature representation, demonstrating strong performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Robust 6D pose estimation of novel objects under challenging illumination
remains a significant challenge, often requiring a trade-off between accurate
initial pose estimation and efficient real-time tracking. We present a unified
framework explicitly designed for efficient execution on edge devices, which
synergizes a robust initial estimation module with a fast motion-based tracker.
The key to our approach is a shared, lighting-invariant color-pair feature
representation that forms a consistent foundation for both stages. For initial
estimation, this feature facilitates robust registration between the live RGB-D
view and the object's 3D mesh. For tracking, the same feature logic validates
temporal correspondences, enabling a lightweight model to reliably regress the
object's motion. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our integrated approach is both effective and robust, providing competitive
pose estimation accuracy while maintaining high-fidelity tracking even through
abrupt pose changes.

*Liubing Hu,Chen Wu,Anrui Wang,Dianjie Lu,Guijuan Zhang,Zhuoran Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowLUT is an end-to-end image enhancement model that combines the efficiency of 3D LUTs with flow matching to achieve real-time processing while overcoming the representational limitations of traditional LUTs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fundamental trade-off between computational efficiency and representational capacity in deep learning-based image enhancement, where conventional 3D LUTs are fast but lack flexibility and depend on fixed priors.

Method: 1) Uses a collection of differentiable 3D LUTs with different priors for color space transformation; 2) Employs a lightweight content-aware network to predict fusion weights for scene-adaptive color correction with O(1) complexity; 3) Designs an iterative flow matching method to restore local structural details and eliminate artifacts; 4) Jointly optimizes the entire model under a composite loss function.

Result: Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on three benchmarks, achieving real-time processing while maintaining high image quality.

Conclusion: FlowLUT successfully integrates the efficiency of LUTs with the representational power of flow matching, providing an effective solution to the efficiency-capacity trade-off in image enhancement.

Abstract: Deep learning-based image enhancement methods face a fundamental trade-off
between computational efficiency and representational capacity. For example,
although a conventional three-dimensional Look-Up Table (3D LUT) can process a
degraded image in real time, it lacks representational flexibility and depends
solely on a fixed prior. To address this problem, we introduce FlowLUT, a novel
end-to-end model that integrates the efficiency of LUTs, multiple priors, and
the parameter-independent characteristic of flow-matched reconstructed images.
Specifically, firstly, the input image is transformed in color space by a
collection of differentiable 3D LUTs (containing a large number of 3D LUTs with
different priors). Subsequently, a lightweight content-aware dynamically
predicts fusion weights, enabling scene-adaptive color correction with
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity. Next, a lightweight fusion prediction network runs
on multiple 3D LUTs, with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity for scene-adaptive color
correction.Furthermore, to address the inherent representation limitations of
LUTs, we design an innovative iterative flow matching method to restore local
structural details and eliminate artifacts. Finally, the entire model is
jointly optimized under a composite loss function enforcing perceptual and
structural fidelity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on three benchmarks.

*Xinhao Cai,Minghang Zheng,Xin Jin,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel task of text-controlled human-object interaction generation in 3D scenes with movable objects, introduces the InteractMove dataset, and presents a pipeline solution for physically plausible interaction generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human-scene interaction datasets have insufficient interaction categories and only consider static objects. Collecting datasets with movable objects is difficult and costly, creating a need for better solutions.

Method: A three-stage pipeline: 1) Use 3D visual grounding to identify interaction objects, 2) Hand-object joint affordance learning to predict contact regions for different hand joints and object parts, 3) Optimize interactions with local-scene modeling and collision avoidance constraints.

Result: The method demonstrates superiority in generating physically plausible, text-compliant interactions compared to existing approaches, handling diverse object types and sizes with varied interaction patterns.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the challenges of text-controlled human-object interaction generation with movable objects in 3D scenes, enabling accurate object identification, diverse interaction learning, and collision avoidance.

Abstract: We propose a novel task of text-controlled human object interaction
generation in 3D scenes with movable objects. Existing human-scene interaction
datasets suffer from insufficient interaction categories and typically only
consider interactions with static objects (do not change object positions), and
the collection of such datasets with movable objects is difficult and costly.
To address this problem, we construct the InteractMove dataset for Movable
Human-Object Interaction in 3D Scenes by aligning existing human object
interaction data with scene contexts, featuring three key characteristics: 1)
scenes containing multiple movable objects with text-controlled interaction
specifications (including same-category distractors requiring spatial and 3D
scene context understanding), 2) diverse object types and sizes with varied
interaction patterns (one-hand, two-hand, etc.), and 3) physically plausible
object manipulation trajectories. With the introduction of various movable
objects, this task becomes more challenging, as the model needs to identify
objects to be interacted with accurately, learn to interact with objects of
different sizes and categories, and avoid collisions between movable objects
and the scene. To tackle such challenges, we propose a novel pipeline solution.
We first use 3D visual grounding models to identify the interaction object.
Then, we propose a hand-object joint affordance learning to predict contact
regions for different hand joints and object parts, enabling accurate grasping
and manipulation of diverse objects. Finally, we optimize interactions with
local-scene modeling and collision avoidance constraints, ensuring physically
plausible motions and avoiding collisions between objects and the scene.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our method's superiority in generating
physically plausible, text-compliant interactions compared to existing
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DUSt3R-based SLAM methods only use image pairs to estimate pointmaps, overlooking spatial memory and global consistency, which limits their reconstruction accuracy.

Method: The framework uses sequentialized input, incremental metric-scale point cloud estimation, a transformer-based gated update module for spatial memory, and submap partitioning with local alignment and global registration.

Result: Experiments show superior reconstruction accuracy while maintaining real-time performance across various datasets.

Conclusion: GRS-SLAM3R effectively addresses the limitations of previous methods by incorporating spatial memory and global consistency mechanisms, achieving better dense scene reconstruction results.

Abstract: DUSt3R-based end-to-end scene reconstruction has recently shown promising
results in dense visual SLAM. However, most existing methods only use image
pairs to estimate pointmaps, overlooking spatial memory and global
consistency.To this end, we introduce GRS-SLAM3R, an end-to-end SLAM framework
for dense scene reconstruction and pose estimation from RGB images without any
prior knowledge of the scene or camera parameters. Unlike existing DUSt3R-based
frameworks, which operate on all image pairs and predict per-pair point maps in
local coordinate frames, our method supports sequentialized input and
incrementally estimates metric-scale point clouds in the global coordinate. In
order to improve consistent spatial correlation, we use a latent state for
spatial memory and design a transformer-based gated update module to reset and
update the spatial memory that continuously aggregates and tracks relevant 3D
information across frames. Furthermore, we partition the scene into submaps,
apply local alignment within each submap, and register all submaps into a
common world frame using relative constraints, producing a globally consistent
map. Experiments on various datasets show that our framework achieves superior
reconstruction accuracy while maintaining real-time performance.

Abstract: Structural changes in retinal blood vessels are critical biomarkers for the
onset and progression of glaucoma and other ocular diseases. However, current
vessel segmentation approaches largely rely on supervised learning and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A closed-loop evaluation framework for autonomous driving that integrates real-world traffic scenarios into CARLA simulator using infrastructure sensors and digital twins of intersections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CARLA benchmarks use manually configured traffic scenarios that diverge from real-world conditions, limiting their ability to reflect actual driving performance.

Method: Extracted 800 dynamic traffic scenarios from 100-hour video dataset captured by infrastructure sensors, and created static digital twin assets for 15 real-world intersections with consistent visual appearance in CARLA.

Result: Created a challenging closed-loop evaluation framework that accurately replicates real-world traffic and environmental characteristics, enabling more realistic simulations.

Conclusion: The framework provides comprehensive closed-loop benchmark for evaluating end-to-end autonomous driving models with diverse driving behaviors, locations, weather conditions, and times of day at complex urban intersections.

Abstract: Closed-loop evaluation is increasingly critical for end-to-end autonomous
driving. Current closed-loop benchmarks using the CARLA simulator rely on
manually configured traffic scenarios, which can diverge from real-world
conditions, limiting their ability to reflect actual driving performance. To
address these limitations, we introduce a simple yet challenging closed-loop
evaluation framework that closely integrates real-world driving scenarios into
the CARLA simulator with infrastructure cooperation. Our approach involves
extracting 800 dynamic traffic scenarios selected from a comprehensive 100-hour
video dataset captured by high-mounted infrastructure sensors, and creating
static digital twin assets for 15 real-world intersections with consistent
visual appearance. These digital twins accurately replicate the traffic and
environmental characteristics of their real-world counterparts, enabling more
realistic simulations in CARLA. This evaluation is challenging due to the
diversity of driving behaviors, locations, weather conditions, and times of day
at complex urban intersections. In addition, we provide a comprehensive
closed-loop benchmark for evaluating end-to-end autonomous driving models.

*Wei Pan,Huiguo He,Hiuyi Cheng,Yilin Shi,Lianwen Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffInk is a latent diffusion Transformer framework for full-line handwriting generation that uses a sequential VAE with dual regularization and a diffusion Transformer to achieve better glyph accuracy and style fidelity than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-online handwriting generation methods focus on character- or word-level generation, leading to inefficiency and lack of holistic structural modeling for full text lines.

Method: Proposes DiffInk with two main components: (1) InkVAE - a sequential variational autoencoder with OCR-based loss for glyph accuracy and style-classification loss for style preservation, creating a disentangled latent space; (2) InkDiT - a latent diffusion Transformer that integrates text and style references to generate pen trajectories.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both glyph accuracy and style fidelity, while significantly improving generation efficiency.

Conclusion: DiffInk provides an effective framework for full-line handwriting generation with improved accuracy, style preservation, and efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Deep generative models have advanced text-to-online handwriting generation
(TOHG), which aims to synthesize realistic pen trajectories conditioned on
textual input and style references. However, most existing methods still
primarily focus on character- or word-level generation, resulting in
inefficiency and a lack of holistic structural modeling when applied to full
text lines. To address these issues, we propose DiffInk, the first latent
diffusion Transformer framework for full-line handwriting generation. We first
introduce InkVAE, a novel sequential variational autoencoder enhanced with two
complementary latent-space regularization losses: (1) an OCR-based loss
enforcing glyph-level accuracy, and (2) a style-classification loss preserving
writing style. This dual regularization yields a semantically structured latent
space where character content and writer styles are effectively disentangled.
We then introduce InkDiT, a novel latent diffusion Transformer that integrates
target text and reference styles to generate coherent pen trajectories.
Experimental results demonstrate that DiffInk outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in both glyph accuracy and style fidelity, while
significantly improving generation efficiency. Code will be made publicly
available.

TL;DR: SMART-R1 is a novel R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning framework for multi-agent traffic simulation that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Sim Agents Challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data-driven simulators rely on supervised learning and suffer from distributional shift between training and testing, which undermines model generalization in unseen environments.

Method: Proposes an R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning paradigm with metric-oriented policy optimization and an iterative "SFT-RFT-SFT" training strategy that alternates between Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with an overall realism meta score of 0.7858 on the Waymo Open Sim Agents Challenge, ranking first on the leaderboard.

Conclusion: SMART-R1 demonstrates the effectiveness of R1-style training in enhancing foundation models for realistic multi-agent traffic simulation.

Abstract: Scalable and realistic simulation of multi-agent traffic behavior is critical
for advancing autonomous driving technologies. Although existing data-driven
simulators have made significant strides in this domain, they predominantly
rely on supervised learning to align simulated distributions with real-world
driving scenarios. A persistent challenge, however, lies in the distributional
shift that arises between training and testing, which often undermines model
generalization in unseen environments. To address this limitation, we propose
SMART-R1, a novel R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning paradigm tailored for
next-token prediction models to better align agent behavior with human
preferences and evaluation metrics. Our approach introduces a metric-oriented
policy optimization algorithm to improve distribution alignment and an
iterative "SFT-RFT-SFT" training strategy that alternates between Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to maximize performance
gains. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset
(WOMD) validate the effectiveness of this simple yet powerful R1-style training
framework in enhancing foundation models. The results on the Waymo Open Sim
Agents Challenge (WOSAC) showcase that SMART-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance with an overall realism meta score of 0.7858, ranking first on the
leaderboard at the time of submission.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RIV introduces self-correction to Mask Diffusion Vision Language Models through Introspection Training and Recursive Inference, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MDVLMs lack self-correction capability and cannot fix errors in generated tokens, limiting their reliability.

Method: Two mechanisms: 1) Introspection Training with an Introspection Model to detect errors including logical ones; 2) Recursive Inference with alternating unmask→introspection→remask process.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, outperforming most existing MDVLMs.

Conclusion: RIV successfully equips MDVLMs with self-correction ability through recursive introspection, significantly improving model reliability and performance.

Abstract: Mask Diffusion-based Vision Language Models (MDVLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in multimodal understanding tasks. However, these models are unable to
correct errors in generated tokens, meaning they lack self-correction
capability. In this paper, we propose Recursive Introspection Mask Diffusion
Vision Language Model (RIV), which equips the model with self-correction
ability through two novel mechanisms. The first is Introspection Training,
where an Introspection Model is introduced to identify errors within generated
sequences. Introspection Training enables the model to detect not only
grammatical and spelling mistakes, but more importantly, logical errors. The
second is Recursive Inference. Beginning with the standard unmasking step, the
learned Introspection Model helps to identify errors in the output sequence and
remask them. This alternating
($\text{unmask}\rightarrow\text{introspection}\rightarrow\text{remask}$)
process is repeated recursively until reliable results are obtained.
Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed RIV
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming most existing MDVLMs.

quantifying the practical limitations of current methods. We conclude by
discussing these limitations and offering recommendations on how to best
integrate gaze estimation as a modality in HRI systems.

TL;DR: FAMDA is a multi-task unsupervised domain adaptation framework that uses Vision Foundation Models as teachers to generate pseudo-labels for target domains, enabling efficient domain adaptation for semantic segmentation and depth estimation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-task dense prediction for robotics suffers from domain shift when deploying in new environments. Existing multi-task UDA methods rely on adversarial learning, which is less effective than recent self-training techniques.

Method: Integrates Segmentation and Depth foundation models into a self-training paradigm to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for target domains, distilling their robust generalization into a single efficient student network.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic-to-real UDA benchmarks and a challenging day-to-night adaptation task. Lightweight variant achieves SOTA accuracy while being 10x smaller than foundation models.

Conclusion: FAMDA enables training of highly efficient, domain-adaptive models suitable for resource-constrained robotics applications through foundation model distillation.

Abstract: Multi-task dense prediction, which aims to jointly solve tasks like semantic
segmentation and depth estimation, is crucial for robotics applications but
suffers from domain shift when deploying models in new environments. While
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) addresses this challenge for single tasks,
existing multi-task UDA methods primarily rely on adversarial learning
approaches that are less effective than recent self-training techniques. In
this paper, we introduce FAMDA, a simple yet effective UDA framework that
bridges this gap by leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as powerful
teachers. Our approach integrates Segmentation and Depth foundation models into
a self-training paradigm to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for the target
domain, effectively distilling their robust generalization capabilities into a
single, efficient student network. Extensive experiments show that FAMDA
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard synthetic-to-real UDA
multi-task learning (MTL) benchmarks and a challenging new day-to-night
adaptation task. Our framework enables the training of highly efficient models;
a lightweight variant achieves SOTA accuracy while being more than 10$\times$
smaller than foundation models, highlighting FAMDA's suitability for creating
domain-adaptive and efficient models for resource-constrained robotics
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a comprehensive framework that leverages LLMs for human motion tasks while addressing challenges in motion representation, computational efficiency, and modality interference between motion and language.

Method: Uses motion tokenizer with residual quantization to convert motion sequences into discrete tokens, employs Delay Parallel Modeling to capture inter-stream dependencies efficiently, and implements dual-tower architecture to separate motion and language modalities.

Result: The framework demonstrates superior performance across various motion-relevant tasks through comprehensive ablation studies and extensive experiments.

Conclusion: MotionVerse successfully integrates LLMs with motion processing through innovative techniques for tokenization, modeling, and modality separation, enabling effective motion comprehension, generation, and editing.

Abstract: This paper proposes MotionVerse, a unified framework that harnesses the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to comprehend, generate, and edit
human motion in both single-person and multi-person scenarios. To efficiently
represent motion data, we employ a motion tokenizer with residual quantization,
which converts continuous motion sequences into multi-stream discrete tokens.
Furthermore, we introduce a \textit{Delay Parallel} Modeling strategy, which
temporally staggers the encoding of residual token streams. This design enables
LLMs to effectively capture inter-stream dependencies while maintaining
computational efficiency comparable to single-stream modeling. Moreover, to
alleviate modality interference between motion and language, we design a
\textit{dual-tower architecture} with modality-specific parameters, ensuring
stable integration of motion information for both comprehension and generation
tasks. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each
component in MotionVerse, and extensive experiments showcase its superior
performance across a wide range of motion-relevant tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces two training-free inference techniques for robot video generation that actively use action parameters to guide diffusion models, improving motion control and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build better world models and robotics foundation models by generating realistic robot videos from action trajectories, addressing the need for more effective use of explicit action parameters in video generation.

Method: Two inference-time techniques: 1) Action-scaled classifier-free guidance that modulates guidance strength based on action magnitude, and 2) Action-scaled noise truncation that adjusts initial noise sampling to align with motion dynamics.

Result: Experiments on real robot manipulation datasets show significant improvements in action coherence and visual quality across diverse robot environments.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free techniques effectively exploit explicit action parameters in diffusion models, enhancing robot video generation without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Generating realistic robot videos from explicit action trajectories is a
critical step toward building effective world models and robotics foundation
models. We introduce two training-free, inference-time techniques that fully
exploit explicit action parameters in diffusion-based robot video generation.
Instead of treating action vectors as passive conditioning signals, our methods
actively incorporate them to guide both the classifier-free guidance process
and the initialization of Gaussian latents. First, action-scaled
classifier-free guidance dynamically modulates guidance strength in proportion
to action magnitude, enhancing controllability over motion intensity. Second,
action-scaled noise truncation adjusts the distribution of initially sampled
noise to better align with the desired motion dynamics. Experiments on real
robot manipulation datasets demonstrate that these techniques significantly
improve action coherence and visual quality across diverse robot environments.

*Boyu Han,Qianqian Xu,Shilong Bao,Zhiyong Yang,Kangli Zi,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LightFair is a lightweight method that improves fairness in text-to-image diffusion models by fine-tuning text embeddings rather than the entire model, using distance-constrained debiasing and two-stage sampling to maintain generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for fair T2I DMs require full-parameter training or auxiliary networks, which are computationally expensive and perform poorly. Since the text encoder is the most fine-tunable front-end component, addressing bias at this level could be more efficient.

Method: Proposes collaborative distance-constrained debiasing strategy to balance embedding distances in CLIP space, and a two-stage text-guided sampling strategy that limits when the debiased text encoder intervenes to preserve generation quality.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art debiasing performance on Stable Diffusion v1.5 with only 1/4 of the training burden and virtually no increase in sampling burden.

Conclusion: LightFair provides an effective and efficient approach to fairness in text-to-image diffusion models by focusing on text encoder optimization, demonstrating that significant bias mitigation can be achieved with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: This paper explores a novel lightweight approach LightFair to achieve fair
text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs) by addressing the adverse effects of
the text encoder. Most existing methods either couple different parts of the
diffusion model for full-parameter training or rely on auxiliary networks for
correction. They incur heavy training or sampling burden and unsatisfactory
performance. Since T2I DMs consist of multiple components, with the text
encoder being the most fine-tunable and front-end module, this paper focuses on
mitigating bias by fine-tuning text embeddings. To validate feasibility, we
observe that the text encoder's neutral embedding output shows substantial
skewness across image embeddings of various attributes in the CLIP space. More
importantly, the noise prediction network further amplifies this imbalance. To
finetune the text embedding, we propose a collaborative distance-constrained
debiasing strategy that balances embedding distances to improve fairness
without auxiliary references. However, mitigating bias can compromise the
original generation quality. To address this, we introduce a two-stage
text-guided sampling strategy to limit when the debiased text encoder
intervenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LightFair is effective and
efficient. Notably, on Stable Diffusion v1.5, our method achieves SOTA
debiasing at just $1/4$ of the training burden, with virtually no increase in
sampling burden. The code is available at https://github.com/boyuh/LightFair.

Conclusion: EfficientMIL achieves significant computational efficiency improvements while outperforming other MIL methods across multiple histopathology datasets, with APS proving more effective for patches selection than conventional strategies.

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) classification represents a fundamental challenge
in computational pathology, where multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged
as the dominant paradigm. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL methods rely on

EfficientMIL, a novel linear-complexity MIL approach for WSIs classification
with the patches selection module Adaptive Patch Selector (APS) that we
designed, replacing the quadratic-complexity self-attention mechanisms in
Transformer-based MIL methods with efficient sequence models including

Motivation: Robots in open environments encounter unknown objects, requiring semantic understanding to generalize beyond known categories. Current methods rely on discrete category labels, limiting their ability to handle objects outside training distributions.

Method: Uses diffusion-based approach with DINOv2 features as continuous semantic priors via cross-attention. Combines photorealistic training data with noise model for point normals to reduce Sim2Real gap. Learns canonicalized object coordinate systems across instances.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art in synthetically trained category-level object pose estimation with 31.9% relative improvement on 5°5cm metric. Achieves up to 100% success rate grasping unseen objects from unknown categories on two instance-level datasets.

Conclusion: SCOPE demonstrates effective generalization beyond known object categories by leveraging continuous semantic priors, enabling robots to manipulate unseen objects in open environments without requiring discrete category labels.

Abstract: Object manipulation requires accurate object pose estimation. In open
environments, robots encounter unknown objects, which requires semantic
understanding in order to generalize both to known categories and beyond. To
resolve this challenge, we present SCOPE, a diffusion-based category-level
object pose estimation model that eliminates the need for discrete category
labels by leveraging DINOv2 features as continuous semantic priors. By
combining these DINOv2 features with photorealistic training data and a noise
model for point normals, we reduce the Sim2Real gap in category-level object
pose estimation. Furthermore, injecting the continuous semantic priors via
cross-attention enables SCOPE to learn canonicalized object coordinate systems
across object instances beyond the distribution of known categories. SCOPE
outperforms the current state of the art in synthetically trained
category-level object pose estimation, achieving a relative improvement of
31.9\% on the 5$^\circ$5cm metric. Additional experiments on two instance-level
datasets demonstrate generalization beyond known object categories, enabling
grasping of unseen objects from unknown categories with a success rate of up to
100\%. Code available: https://github.com/hoenigpeter/scope.

TL;DR: Polarimetric imaging improves debris segmentation on water by reducing glare and reflection artifacts, but increases computational load and potential false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of floating debris is challenging due to surface glare and changing outdoor illumination, which polarimetric imaging can help mitigate.

Method: Benchmark state-of-the-art fusion networks on PoTATO dataset (polarimetric images of plastic bottles) and compare with single-image baselines using traditional models.

Result: Polarimetric cues help recover low-contrast objects and suppress reflection-induced false positives, improving mean IoU and reducing contour error compared to RGB inputs.

Conclusion: Polarized cameras can improve segmentation accuracy but come with computational costs and potential new false positives; the benchmark helps researchers evaluate suitability for their applications.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of floating debris on water is often compromised by
surface glare and changing outdoor illumination. Polarimetric imaging offers a
single-sensor route to mitigate water-surface glare that disrupts semantic
segmentation of floating objects. We benchmark state-of-the-art fusion networks
on PoTATO, a public dataset of polarimetric images of plastic bottles in inland
waterways, and compare their performance with single-image baselines using
traditional models. Our results indicate that polarimetric cues help recover
low-contrast objects and suppress reflection-induced false positives, raising
mean IoU and lowering contour error relative to RGB inputs. These sharper masks
come at a cost: the additional channels enlarge the models increasing the
computational load and introducing the risk of new false positives. By
providing a reproducible, diagnostic benchmark and publicly available code, we
hope to help researchers choose if polarized cameras are suitable for their
applications and to accelerate related research.

TL;DR: Training-free method for multi-image layout control using image references instead of text, enabling precise object placement and composition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models lack explicit control for precise object placement and layout, limiting their utility for fine-grained composition tasks.

Method: Training-free approach that uses single image references for content specification and provides explicit control over object and part-level composition without requiring model retraining.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness across various image composition tasks with precise layout control using image-based references.

Conclusion: The method enables finer control over image composition by using image references rather than text, providing explicit layout guidance while remaining training-free and requiring only single image references.

Abstract: Text-to-image models have achieved a level of realism that enables the
generation of highly convincing images. However, text-based control can be a
limiting factor when more explicit guidance is needed. Defining both the
content and its precise placement within an image is crucial for achieving
finer control. In this work, we address the challenge of multi-image layout
control, where the desired content is specified through images rather than
text, and the model is guided on where to place each element. Our approach is
training-free, requires a single image per reference, and provides explicit and
simple control for object and part-level composition. We demonstrate its
effectiveness across various image composition tasks.

Conclusion: ThermalGen is the first RGB-T image translation model capable of synthesizing thermal images that reflect significant variations in viewpoints, sensor characteristics, and environmental conditions.

Abstract: Paired RGB-thermal data is crucial for visual-thermal sensor fusion and
cross-modality tasks, including important applications such as multi-modal
image alignment and retrieval. However, the scarcity of synchronized and
calibrated RGB-thermal image pairs presents a major obstacle to progress in
these areas. To overcome this challenge, RGB-to-Thermal (RGB-T) image
translation has emerged as a promising solution, enabling the synthesis of
thermal images from abundant RGB datasets for training purposes. In this study,
we propose ThermalGen, an adaptive flow-based generative model for RGB-T image
translation, incorporating an RGB image conditioning architecture and a
style-disentangled mechanism. To support large-scale training, we curated eight
public satellite-aerial, aerial, and ground RGB-T paired datasets, and
introduced three new large-scale satellite-aerial RGB-T datasets--DJI-day,
Bosonplus-day, and Bosonplus-night--captured across diverse times, sensor
types, and geographic regions. Extensive evaluations across multiple RGB-T
benchmarks demonstrate that ThermalGen achieves comparable or superior
translation performance compared to existing GAN-based and diffusion-based
methods. To our knowledge, ThermalGen is the first RGB-T image translation
model capable of synthesizing thermal images that reflect significant
variations in viewpoints, sensor characteristics, and environmental conditions.

### [135] [Sparse-Up: Learnable Sparse Upsampling for 3D Generation with High-Fidelity Textures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23646)
*Lu Xiao,Jiale Zhang,Yang Liu,Taicheng Huang,Xin Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sparse-Up is a memory-efficient 3D texture modeling framework that preserves high-frequency details using sparse voxels, surface anchoring, and view-domain partitioning to overcome resolution constraints while maintaining cross-view consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D asset creation methods face a 'pixel-level pain point' where they either sacrifice cross-view consistency (causing torn/drifting textures) or remain limited by explicit voxel resolution constraints, losing fine texture details.

Method: Uses sparse voxels for texture reconstruction with multi-view consistency. Employs surface anchoring with learnable upsampling to constrain voxels to mesh surfaces (eliminating 70% redundant voxels) and view-domain partitioning with image patch-guided voxel partitioning for gradient supervision on visible local patches only.

Result: Significantly reduces memory consumption during high-resolution voxel training without sacrificing geometric consistency, while effectively preserving high-frequency texture details.

Conclusion: Sparse-Up provides an effective solution for high-fidelity 3D texture modeling that breaks through traditional resolution constraints while maintaining memory efficiency and preserving fine texture details.

Abstract: The creation of high-fidelity 3D assets is often hindered by a 'pixel-level
pain point': the loss of high-frequency details. Existing methods often trade
off one aspect for another: either sacrificing cross-view consistency,
resulting in torn or drifting textures, or remaining trapped by the resolution
ceiling of explicit voxels, forfeiting fine texture detail. In this work, we
propose Sparse-Up, a memory-efficient, high-fidelity texture modeling framework
that effectively preserves high-frequency details. We use sparse voxels to
guide texture reconstruction and ensure multi-view consistency, while
leveraging surface anchoring and view-domain partitioning to break through
resolution constraints. Surface anchoring employs a learnable upsampling
strategy to constrain voxels to the mesh surface, eliminating over 70% of
redundant voxels present in traditional voxel upsampling. View-domain
partitioning introduces an image patch-guided voxel partitioning scheme,
supervising and back-propagating gradients only on visible local patches.
Through these two strategies, we can significantly reduce memory consumption
during high-resolution voxel training without sacrificing geometric
consistency, while preserving high-frequency details in textures.

*Richeek Das,Kostas Daniilidis,Pratik Chaudhari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fast Feature Field (F³) is a novel representation for event-based camera data that learns by predicting future events from past events, enabling efficient processing at 120-440 Hz and achieving state-of-the-art performance on optical flow, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation across various robotic platforms and conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient representations for event-based camera data that can handle the sparsity and noise of event streams while preserving scene structure and motion information for downstream robotic vision tasks.

Method: Uses multi-resolution hash encoding and deep sets to learn F³ representations by predicting future events from past events, exploiting event sparsity and being robust to noise and event rate variations.

Result: Achieves processing speeds of 120 Hz at HD and 440 Hz at VGA resolutions, with state-of-the-art performance on optical flow, semantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation across multiple robotic platforms (car, quadruped, flying platform) and diverse conditions (day/night, indoor/outdoor, urban/off-road).

Conclusion: F³ provides an efficient, robust representation for event-based vision that enables high-performance downstream tasks at real-time rates, demonstrating broad applicability across different robotic systems and environmental conditions.

Abstract: This paper develops a mathematical argument and algorithms for building
representations of data from event-based cameras, that we call Fast Feature
Field ($\text{F}^3$). We learn this representation by predicting future events
from past events and show that it preserves scene structure and motion
information. $\text{F}^3$ exploits the sparsity of event data and is robust to
noise and variations in event rates. It can be computed efficiently using ideas
from multi-resolution hash encoding and deep sets - achieving 120 Hz at HD and
440 Hz at VGA resolutions. $\text{F}^3$ represents events within a contiguous
spatiotemporal volume as a multi-channel image, enabling a range of downstream
tasks. We obtain state-of-the-art performance on optical flow estimation,
semantic segmentation, and monocular metric depth estimation, on data from
three robotic platforms (a car, a quadruped robot and a flying platform),
across different lighting conditions (daytime, nighttime), environments
(indoors, outdoors, urban, as well as off-road) and dynamic vision sensors
(resolutions and event rates). Our implementations can predict these tasks at
25-75 Hz at HD resolution.

*Congzhi Zhang,Zhibin Wang,Yinchao Ma,Jiawei Peng,Yihan Wang,Qiang Zhou,Jun Song,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReWatch introduces a large-scale dataset and framework for advanced video reasoning, addressing the data bottleneck in RLVR for LVLMs through multi-stage synthesis and a novel Multi-Agent ReAct framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The gap in applying RLVR to complex video reasoning due to lack of challenging multi-hop questions and high-quality video-grounded Chain-of-Thought data.

Method: Multi-stage synthesis pipeline for dataset creation (ReWatch-Caption, ReWatch-QA, ReWatch-CoT) using Multi-Agent ReAct framework, followed by SFT and RLVR with Observation & Reasoning reward mechanism.

Result: ReWatch-R1 achieves state-of-the-art average performance on five challenging video reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed ReWatch dataset and framework effectively address the video reasoning data bottleneck and enable superior performance in complex video reasoning tasks.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) significantly
advances image reasoning in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), its
application to complex video reasoning remains underdeveloped. This gap stems
primarily from a critical data bottleneck: existing datasets lack the
challenging, multi-hop questions and high-quality, video-grounded
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data necessary to effectively bootstrap RLVR. To address
this, we introduce ReWatch, a large-scale dataset built to foster advanced
video reasoning. We propose a novel multi-stage synthesis pipeline to
synthesize its three components: ReWatch-Caption, ReWatch-QA, and ReWatch-CoT.
A core innovation is our Multi-Agent ReAct framework for CoT synthesis, which
simulates a human-like "re-watching" process to generate video-grounded
reasoning traces by explicitly modeling information retrieval and verification.
Building on this dataset, we develop ReWatch-R1 by post-training a strong
baseline LVLM with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and our RLVR framework. This
framework incorporates a novel Observation \& Reasoning (O\&R) reward mechanism
that evaluates both the final answer's correctness and the reasoning's
alignment with video content, directly penalizing hallucination. Our
experiments show that ReWatch-R1 achieves state-of-the-art average performance
on five challenging video reasoning benchmarks.

### [139] [HIVTP: A Training-Free Method to Improve VLMs Efficiency via Hierarchical Visual Token Pruning Using Middle-Layer-Based Importance Score](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23663)
*Jingqi Xu,Jingxi Lu,Chenghao Li,Sreetama Sarkar,Peter A. Beerel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HIVTP is a training-free method that improves Vision-Language Models efficiency through hierarchical visual token pruning using middle-layer attention maps, achieving up to 55.1% reduction in time-to-first-token without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models suffer from inefficient inference due to excessive visual tokens from vision encoders, with many tokens being unimportant and prunable.

Method: Uses middle-layer attention maps from vision encoder to estimate token importance, then applies hierarchical pruning: global stage retains important tokens per region, local stage retains most important token per window.

Result: Reduces TTFT by up to 50.0% for LLaVA-v1.5-7B and 55.1% for LLaVA-Next-7B, improves token generation throughput by up to 60.9% and 47.3%, maintains or improves accuracy on benchmarks.

Conclusion: HIVTP achieves superior accuracy and higher inference efficiency compared to prior works through effective hierarchical visual token pruning.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong capabilities on diverse
multimodal tasks. However, the large number of visual tokens output by the
vision encoder severely hinders inference efficiency, and prior studies have
shown that many of these tokens are not important and can therefore be safely
pruned. In this work, we propose HIVTP, a training-free method to improve VLMs
efficiency via hierarchical visual token pruning using a novel
middle-layer-based importance score. Specifically, we utilize attention maps
extracted from the middle layers of the vision encoder, which better reflect
fine-grained and object-level attention, to estimate visual token importance.
Based on this, we propose a hierarchical visual token pruning method to retain
both globally and locally important visual tokens. Specifically, we reshape the
1-D visual token sequence output by the vision encoder into a 2-D spatial
layout. In the global retaining stage, we divide the image into regions and
retain tokens with higher importance scores in each region; in the local
retaining stage, we then divide the image into small windows and retain the
most important token in each local window. Experimental results show that our
proposed method, HIVTP, can reduce the time-to-first-token (TTFT) of
LLaVA-v1.5-7B and LLaVA-Next-7B by up to 50.0% and 55.1%, respectively, and
improve the token generation throughput by up to 60.9% and 47.3%, without
sacrificing accuracy, and even achieving improvements on certain benchmarks.
Compared with prior works, HIVTP achieves better accuracy while offering higher
inference efficiency.

TL;DR: STIM-TM is a training-free token merging method for surgical video understanding that reduces computational costs by 65%+ GFLOPs while maintaining accuracy through spatiotemporal information mining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision Transformer methods for surgical video understanding suffer from high computational costs due to processing massive spatiotemporal tokens, and existing token merging approaches fail to consider video structure and heterogeneous information distribution.

Method: Proposes STIM-TM with decoupled temporal and spatial merging: temporal component merges corresponding tokens from consecutive frames using saliency weighting; spatial component prioritizes merging static tokens through temporal stability analysis to protect dynamic surgical regions.

Result: Achieves over 65% GFLOPs reduction while preserving competitive accuracy across comprehensive surgical video tasks, and enables efficient training of long-sequence surgical videos.

Conclusion: STIM-TM effectively addresses computational bottlenecks in surgical video applications through spatiotemporal-aware token merging, maintaining performance while significantly improving efficiency.

Abstract: Vision Transformer models have shown impressive effectiveness in the surgical
video understanding tasks through long-range dependency modeling. However,
current methods suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to processing
massive spatiotemporal tokens across video frames. While prior work on token
merging has advanced model efficiency, they fail to adequately consider the
inherent spatiotemporal structure of video data and overlook the heterogeneous
nature of information distribution, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
paper, we propose a spatiotemporal information mining token merging (STIM-TM)
method, representing the first dedicated approach for surgical video
understanding. STIM-TM introduces a decoupled strategy that reduces token
redundancy along temporal and spatial dimensions independently. Specifically,
the temporal component merges spatially corresponding tokens from consecutive
frames using saliency weighting, preserving critical sequential information and
maintaining continuity. Meanwhile, the spatial component prioritizes merging
static tokens through temporal stability analysis, protecting dynamic regions
containing essential surgical information. Operating in a training-free manner,
STIM-TM achieves significant efficiency gains with over $65\%$ GFLOPs reduction
while preserving competitive accuracy across comprehensive surgical video
tasks. Our method also supports efficient training of long-sequence surgical
videos, addressing computational bottlenecks in surgical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal benchmarks don't clearly distinguish between genuine global reasoning and success via localized visual cues, hindering effective dataset curation and real-world focused model development.

Method: RCI systematically compares reference-model performance on image patches versus full images to quantify a dataset's reliance on global versus local visual information.

Result: Application of RCI to 13 multimodal benchmarks showed most favor localized reasoning and exhibit significant spatial biases, posing risks for real-world applications.

Conclusion: RCI provides researchers with an actionable tool for diagnosing and mitigating spatial biases, enabling construction of better datasets to develop robust multimodal systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive results on
vision-language benchmarks, yet it remains unclear whether these benchmarks
assess genuine global reasoning or allow success via localized visual cues.
Existing evaluation methods do not explicitly measure this distinction,
hindering effective dataset curation and real-world focused model development.
  We introduce Region Comprehension Index (RCI), the first model-based score to
directly quantify a dataset's reliance on global versus local visual
information. RCI systematically compares reference-model performance on image
patches versus full images, revealing if tasks require holistic image
understanding or can be solved with partial or localized visual cues.
  When applying RCI to 13 widely used multimodal benchmarks, we observed that
most of them favor localized reasoning and exhibit significant spatial biases,
indicating potential risks in real-world applications. RCI equips researchers &
practitioners with an actionable tool for diagnosing & mitigating these biases,
enabling the construction of datasets and benchmarks to foster the development
of robust, enterprise-ready multimodal systems.

TL;DR: MSD-KMamba is a 3D multi-modal image segmentation framework that combines bidirectional spatial perception with multi-scale self-distillation to achieve high accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNN-Transformer hybrid models suffer from high computational complexity due to global attention mechanisms, making it challenging to balance performance and efficiency in complex segmentation tasks.

Method: The framework integrates bidirectional spatial perception to capture long-range dependencies and multi-scale self-distilled fusion to enhance hierarchical feature representations, avoiding quadratic computational complexity.

Result: Extensive experiments show MSD-KMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy, robustness, and generalization while maintaining high computational efficiency.

Conclusion: MSD-KMamba effectively addresses the computational bottleneck of volumetric segmentation while improving global perception capabilities, offering a scalable solution for complex medical image segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Numerous CNN-Transformer hybrid models rely on high-complexity global
attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies, which introduces
non-linear computational complexity and leads to significant resource
consumption. Although knowledge distillation and sparse attention mechanisms
can improve efficiency, they often fall short of delivering the high
segmentation accuracy necessary for complex tasks. Balancing model performance
with computational efficiency remains a critical challenge. In this work, we
propose a novel 3D multi-modal image segmentation framework, termed MSD-KMamba,
which integrates bidirectional spatial perception with multi-scale
self-distillation. The bidirectional spatial aware branch effectively captures
long-range spatial context dependencies across brain regions, while also
incorporating a powerful nonlinear feature extraction mechanism that further
enhances the model's ability to learn complex and heterogeneous patterns. In
addition, the proposed multi-scale self-distilled fusion strategy strengthens
hierarchical feature representations and improves the transfer of semantic
information at different resolution levels. By jointly leveraging the
bidirectional spatial perception branch and the multi-scale self-distilled
fusion strategy, our framework effectively mitigates the bottleneck of
quadratic computational complexity in volumetric segmentation, while
simultaneously addressing the limitation of insufficient global perception.
Extensive experiments on multiple standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that
MSD-KMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation
accuracy, robustness, and generalization, while maintaining high computational
efficiency and favorable scalability. The source code of MSD-KMamba is publicly

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuantSparse is a unified framework that combines model quantization and attention sparsification to compress diffusion transformers for video generation, achieving significant efficiency gains without performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion transformers have excellent video generation capabilities but suffer from prohibitive computational and memory costs that hinder practical deployment. While quantization and attention sparsification individually offer compression benefits, each alone causes severe performance degradation under aggressive compression.

Method: QuantSparse integrates model quantization with attention sparsification through two key techniques: 1) Multi-Scale Salient Attention Distillation for mitigating quantization-induced bias using global structural guidance and local salient supervision, and 2) Second-Order Sparse Attention Reparameterization that exploits temporal stability of second-order residuals to recover information lost under sparsity.

Result: Experiments on HunyuanVideo-13B show QuantSparse achieves 20.88 PSNR, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art quantization baseline Q-VDiT (16.85 PSNR), while delivering 3.68× reduction in storage and 1.88× acceleration in end-to-end inference.

Conclusion: QuantSparse successfully combines quantization and sparsification to achieve compounded efficiency gains for diffusion transformers in video generation, overcoming the limitations of applying each technique individually and enabling practical deployment of these models.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers exhibit remarkable video generation capability, yet
their prohibitive computational and memory costs hinder practical deployment.
Model quantization and attention sparsification are two promising directions
for compression, but each alone suffers severe performance degradation under
aggressive compression. Combining them promises compounded efficiency gains,
but naive integration is ineffective. The sparsity-induced information loss
exacerbates quantization noise, leading to amplified attention shifts. To
address this, we propose \textbf{QuantSparse}, a unified framework that
integrates model quantization with attention sparsification. Specifically, we
introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Salient Attention Distillation}, which leverages
both global structural guidance and local salient supervision to mitigate
quantization-induced bias. In addition, we develop \textit{Second-Order Sparse
Attention Reparameterization}, which exploits the temporal stability of
second-order residuals to efficiently recover information lost under sparsity.
Experiments on HunyuanVideo-13B demonstrate that QuantSparse achieves 20.88
PSNR, substantially outperforming the state-of-the-art quantization baseline
Q-VDiT (16.85 PSNR), while simultaneously delivering a \textbf{3.68$\times$}
reduction in storage and \textbf{1.88$\times$} acceleration in end-to-end

TL;DR: HomeSafeBench is a new benchmark for evaluating embodied agents' home safety inspection capabilities using dynamic first-person perspective images from simulated environments, addressing limitations of existing text-based and single-viewpoint benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks oversimplify safety inspection tasks by using textual descriptions instead of visual information and restrict agents to single static viewpoints, hindering accurate evaluation of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and causing omission of occluded safety hazards.

Method: Proposed HomeSafeBench with 12,900 data points covering five common home safety hazards (fire, electric shock, falling object, trips, child safety), providing dynamic first-person perspective images from simulated home environments that allow embodied agents to freely explore rooms.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation of mainstream VLMs shows poor performance, with the best model achieving only 10.23% F1-score, indicating significant limitations in identifying safety hazards and selecting effective exploration strategies.

Conclusion: HomeSafeBench reveals substantial gaps in current VLM capabilities for home safety inspection and provides a valuable benchmark for future research, with the dataset and code to be publicly available.

Abstract: Embodied agents can identify and report safety hazards in the home
environments. Accurately evaluating their capabilities in home safety
inspection tasks is curcial, but existing benchmarks suffer from two key
limitations. First, they oversimplify safety inspection tasks by using textual
descriptions of the environment instead of direct visual information, which
hinders the accurate evaluation of embodied agents based on Vision-Language
Models (VLMs). Second, they use a single, static viewpoint for environmental
observation, which restricts the agents' free exploration and cause the
omission of certain safety hazards, especially those that are occluded from a
fixed viewpoint. To alleviate these issues, we propose HomeSafeBench, a
benchmark with 12,900 data points covering five common home safety hazards:
fire, electric shock, falling object, trips, and child safety. HomeSafeBench
provides dynamic first-person perspective images from simulated home
environments, enabling the evaluation of VLM capabilities for home safety
inspection. By allowing the embodied agents to freely explore the room,
HomeSafeBench provides multiple dynamic perspectives in complex environments
for a more thorough inspection. Our comprehensive evaluation of mainstream VLMs
on HomeSafeBench reveals that even the best-performing model achieves an
F1-score of only 10.23%, demonstrating significant limitations in current VLMs.
The models particularly struggle with identifying safety hazards and selecting
effective exploration strategies. We hope HomeSafeBench will provide valuable
reference and support for future research related to home security inspections.
Our dataset and code will be publicly available soon.

*Atharva Jadhav,Arush Karekar,Manas Divekar,Shachi Natu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ensemble of SSD models with diverse backbones using Weighted Boxes Fusion improves weapon detection robustness in surveillance systems, achieving 2.948% mAP improvement over single models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public safety requires robust surveillance systems for weapon detection, but existing single-model detectors struggle with challenges like occlusion, varying lighting, and cluttered backgrounds.

Method: Trained multiple SSD models with different backbone networks (VGG16, ResNet50, EfficientNet, MobileNetV3) and combined predictions using Weighted Boxes Fusion with max confidence scoring strategy.

Result: The ensemble achieved mAP of 0.838, representing 2.948% relative improvement over the best single model, and consistently outperformed other fusion methods.

Conclusion: Confidence-aware fusion is crucial for ensemble performance, and this approach provides a robust solution for real-time weapon detection in surveillance applications.

Abstract: The safety and security of public spaces is of vital importance, driving the
need for sophisticated surveillance systems capable of accurately detecting
weapons, which are often hampered by issues like partial occlusion, varying
lighting, and cluttered backgrounds. While single-model detectors are advanced,
they often lack robustness in these challenging conditions. This paper presents
the hypothesis that ensemble of Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) models with
diverse feature extraction backbones can significantly enhance detection
robustness. To leverage diverse feature representations, individual SSD models
were trained using a selection of backbone networks: VGG16, ResNet50,
EfficientNet, and MobileNetV3. The study is conducted on a dataset consisting
of images of three distinct weapon classes: guns, heavy weapons and knives. The
predictions from these models are combined using the Weighted Boxes Fusion
(WBF) method, an ensemble technique designed to optimize bounding box accuracy.
Our key finding is that the fusion strategy is as critical as the ensemble's
diversity, a WBF approach using a 'max' confidence scoring strategy achieved a
mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.838. This represents a 2.948% relative
improvement over the best-performing single model and consistently outperforms
other fusion heuristics. This research offers a robust approach to enhancing
real-time weapon detection capabilities in surveillance applications by
demonstrating that confidence-aware fusion is a key mechanism for improving
accuracy metrics of ensembles.

*Yunjiang Xu,Lingzhi Li,Jin Wang,Yupeng Ouyang,Benyuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: INSTINCT is a novel collaborative perception framework that improves multi-agent detection accuracy while significantly reducing communication bandwidth requirements through instance-level interaction and quality-aware filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current collaborative perception systems face bandwidth constraints due to frequent cooperative interactions and real-time requirements. LiDAR-focused instance-level interaction approaches are underdeveloped and trail state-of-the-art performance.

Method: INSTINCT features three core components: 1) quality-aware filtering for high-quality instance feature selection, 2) dual-branch detection routing to separate collaboration-irrelevant and collaboration-relevant instances, and 3) Cross Agent Local Instance Fusion module to aggregate local hybrid instance features. Enhanced ground truth sampling facilitates training with diverse hybrid instance features.

Result: Extensive experiments show INSTINCT achieves superior performance with 13.23%/33.08% accuracy improvement in DAIR-V2X and V2V4Real datasets while reducing communication bandwidth to 1/281 and 1/264 compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: INSTINCT successfully bridges the gap in LiDAR-focused collaborative perception by providing an efficient instance-level interaction architecture that significantly improves detection accuracy while dramatically reducing bandwidth requirements.

Abstract: Collaborative perception systems overcome single-vehicle limitations in
long-range detection and occlusion scenarios by integrating multi-agent sensory
data, improving accuracy and safety. However, frequent cooperative interactions
and real-time requirements impose stringent bandwidth constraints. Previous
works proves that query-based instance-level interaction reduces bandwidth
demands and manual priors, however, LiDAR-focused implementations in
collaborative perception remain underdeveloped, with performance still trailing
state-of-the-art approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose INSTINCT

TL;DR: CrimEdit is a unified diffusion model that jointly handles object removal and insertion tasks using classifier-free guidance, enabling efficient object movement in a single denoising step without separate training stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored impact of classifier-free guidance on handling object effects in unified removal/insertion models and improve efficiency in composite editing tasks.

Method: Jointly trains task embeddings for removal and insertion in a single model, leverages them in classifier-free guidance scheme, and extends task prompts to spatially distinct regions for object movement.

Result: Achieves superior object removal, controllable effect insertion, and efficient object movement without requiring additional training or separate removal/insertion stages.

Conclusion: CrimEdit demonstrates that unified training with classifier-free guidance enables effective handling of object effects across multiple editing tasks in a single model.

Abstract: Recent works on object removal and insertion have enhanced their performance
by handling object effects such as shadows and reflections, using diffusion
models trained on counterfactual datasets. However, the performance impact of
applying classifier-free guidance to handle object effects across removal and
insertion tasks within a unified model remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap and improve efficiency in composite editing, we propose CrimEdit,
which jointly trains the task embeddings for removal and insertion within a
single model and leverages them in a classifier-free guidance scheme --
enhancing the removal of both objects and their effects, and enabling
controllable synthesis of object effects during insertion. CrimEdit also
extends these two task prompts to be applied to spatially distinct regions,
enabling object movement (repositioning) within a single denoising step. By
employing both guidance techniques, extensive experiments show that CrimEdit
achieves superior object removal, controllable effect insertion, and efficient
object movement without requiring additional training or separate removal and
insertion stages.

*Shuai Shao,Shu Jiang,Shiyuan Zhao,Di Yang,Yan Wang,Yutong Bai,Jianguo Zhang,Jiangtao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PD-Diag-Net is an automated Parkinson's disease diagnostic system that uses MRI scans with clinical priors to achieve high accuracy in early detection and external validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Parkinson's disease diagnosis is complex, relies heavily on neurologist expertise, and often leads to delayed detection and missed early intervention opportunities.

Method: End-to-end framework with MRI preprocessing, two clinical priors (brain region relevance and aging), and dedicated modules for feature aggregation and diagnosis using brain age gaps as auxiliary constraints.

Result: Achieved 86% accuracy on external tests and over 96% accuracy in early-stage diagnosis, outperforming existing methods by more than 20%.

Conclusion: PD-Diag-Net provides an effective automated solution for Parkinson's disease diagnosis with high accuracy and clinical interpretability, addressing current diagnostic limitations.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that severely
diminishes patients' quality of life. Its global prevalence has increased
markedly in recent decades. Current diagnostic workflows are complex and
heavily reliant on neurologists' expertise, often resulting in delays in early
detection and missed opportunities for timely intervention. To address these
issues, we propose an end-to-end automated diagnostic method for PD, termed
PD-Diag-Net, which performs risk assessment and auxiliary diagnosis directly
from raw MRI scans. This framework first introduces an MRI Pre-processing
Module (MRI-Processor) to mitigate inter-subject and inter-scanner variability
by flexibly integrating established medical imaging preprocessing tools. It
then incorporates two forms of clinical prior knowledge: (1)
Brain-Region-Relevance-Prior (Relevance-Prior), which specifies brain regions
strongly associated with PD; and (2) Brain-Region-Aging-Prior (Aging-Prior),
which reflects the accelerated aging typically observed in PD-associated
regions. Building on these priors, we design two dedicated modules: the
Relevance-Prior Guided Feature Aggregation Module (Aggregator), which guides
the model to focus on PD-associated regions at the inter-subject level, and the
Age-Prior Guided Diagnosis Module (Diagnoser), which leverages brain age gaps
as auxiliary constraints at the intra-subject level to enhance diagnostic
accuracy and clinical interpretability. Furthermore, we collected external test
data from our collaborating hospital. Experimental results show that
PD-Diag-Net achieves 86\% accuracy on external tests and over 96% accuracy in
early-stage diagnosis, outperforming existing advanced methods by more than
20%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffPCN is a diffusion-based coarse-to-fine framework for point cloud completion that uses depth image projections and LDMs to generate high-quality coarse point clouds, followed by denoising and upsampling for refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) have shown strong generative capabilities but remain underexplored for point cloud completion due to the unstructured and irregular nature of point clouds.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Project partial point clouds to depth images, use DepthLDM to synthesize completed multi-view depth images for coarse point clouds; 2) Point Denoising Network removes artifacts and Association-Aware Point Upsampler refines with local association features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometric accuracy and shape completeness, significantly improving robustness and consistency of point cloud completion.

Conclusion: DiffPCN effectively leverages LDMs' generation capabilities for point cloud completion through a novel coarse-to-fine framework with depth image conditioning and refinement stages.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities across various low-level vision tasks. However, their potential
for point cloud completion remains underexplored due to the unstructured and
irregular nature of point clouds. In this work, we propose DiffPCN, a novel
diffusion-based coarse-to-fine framework for point cloud completion. Our
approach comprises two stages: an initial stage for generating coarse point
clouds, and a refinement stage that improves their quality through point
denoising and upsampling. Specifically, we first project the unordered and
irregular partial point cloud into structured depth images, which serve as
conditions for a well-designed DepthLDM to synthesize completed multi-view
depth images that are used to form coarse point clouds. In this way, our
DiffPCN can yield high-quality and high-completeness coarse point clouds by
leveraging LDM' s powerful generation and comprehension capabilities. Then,
since LDMs inevitably introduce outliers into the generated depth maps, we
design a Point Denoising Network to remove artifacts from the coarse point
cloud by predicting a per-point distance score. Finally, we devise an
Association-Aware Point Upsampler, which guides the upsampling process by
leveraging local association features between the input point cloud and the
corresponding coarse points, further yielding a dense and high-fidelity output.
Experimental results demonstrate that our DiffPCN achieves state-of-the-art
performance in geometric accuracy and shape completeness, significantly
improving the robustness and consistency of point cloud completion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free visual prompting method that combines multiple video frames into single panel images to improve long-video understanding in VLMs without additional parameters or fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video-Language Models underperform on long videos compared to images/short videos. Instead of complex fine-tuning with limited data, the authors aim to maximize existing model performance through efficient visual prompting.

Method: Proposes a novel visual prompting strategy that trades spatial details for temporal resolution by combining multiple frames as panels into one image. The approach is training-free, parameter-free, and model-agnostic.

Result: Extensive experiments on 5 benchmarks show consistent improvements across various model architectures. On TimeScope (Long) dataset with longest videos, video QA accuracy improved by up to 19.4%.

Conclusion: The method effectively raises the bar for long video understanding models by providing a simple yet powerful visual prompting approach that can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLMs.

Abstract: Recent Video-Language Models (VLMs) achieve promising results on long-video
understanding, but their performance still lags behind that achieved on tasks
involving images or short videos. This has led to great interest in improving
the long context modeling of VLMs by introducing novel modules and additional
complexity. % additional training time. In this paper, we take a different
approach: rather than fine-tuning VLMs with the limited data available, we
attempt to maximize the performance of existing models. To this end, we propose
a novel visual prompting strategy specifically designed for long-video
understanding. By combining multiple frames as panels into one image, we
effectively trade off spatial details for temporal resolution. Our approach is
training-free, parameter-free, and model-agnostic, and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing VLMs. Extensive experiments on five established
benchmarks across a wide range of model architectures, sizes, and context
windows confirm the consistency of our approach. For the TimeScope (Long)
dataset, which has the longest videos, the accuracy for video question
answering is improved by up to 19.4\%. Overall, our method raises the bar for
long video understanding models. We will make our code available upon
acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M3DLayout is a large-scale, multi-source dataset for 3D indoor layout generation that integrates real-world scans, CAD designs, and procedural scenes to address limitations in existing datasets and improve text-driven 3D scene generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D indoor layout generation models are constrained by limited scale, diversity, and annotation quality of existing datasets, which hinders their ability to learn complex spatial and semantic patterns for text-driven 3D scene generation.

Method: Created M3DLayout dataset with 15,080 layouts and 258k+ object instances from three sources: real-world scans, professional CAD designs, and procedurally generated scenes. Each layout includes structured text descriptions covering global scene summaries, relational furniture placements, and fine-grained small object arrangements.

Result: Experimental results using a text-conditioned diffusion model demonstrate that M3DLayout provides a solid foundation for training layout generation models. The multi-source composition enhances diversity, particularly through the Inf3DLayout subset which enables generation of more complex and detailed scenes with rich small-object information.

Conclusion: M3DLayout serves as a valuable resource for advancing research in text-driven 3D scene synthesis by providing diverse and richly annotated data that enables models to learn complex spatial and semantic patterns across various indoor environments.

Abstract: In text-driven 3D scene generation, object layout serves as a crucial
intermediate representation that bridges high-level language instructions with
detailed geometric output. It not only provides a structural blueprint for
ensuring physical plausibility but also supports semantic controllability and
interactive editing. However, the learning capabilities of current 3D indoor
layout generation models are constrained by the limited scale, diversity, and
annotation quality of existing datasets. To address this, we introduce
M3DLayout, a large-scale, multi-source dataset for 3D indoor layout generation.
M3DLayout comprises 15,080 layouts and over 258k object instances, integrating
three distinct sources: real-world scans, professional CAD designs, and
procedurally generated scenes. Each layout is paired with detailed structured
text describing global scene summaries, relational placements of large
furniture, and fine-grained arrangements of smaller items. This diverse and
richly annotated resource enables models to learn complex spatial and semantic
patterns across a wide variety of indoor environments. To assess the potential
of M3DLayout, we establish a benchmark using a text-conditioned diffusion
model. Experimental results demonstrate that our dataset provides a solid
foundation for training layout generation models. Its multi-source composition
enhances diversity, notably through the Inf3DLayout subset which provides rich
small-object information, enabling the generation of more complex and detailed
scenes. We hope that M3DLayout can serve as a valuable resource for advancing
research in text-driven 3D scene synthesis.

### [152] [LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit Quantization for Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23729)
*Shubhang Bhatnagar,Andy Xu,Kar-Han Tan,Narendra Ahuja*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LUQ is a novel layerwise ultra-low bit quantization method for multimodal LLMs that selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to resilient layers, reducing memory usage by 31-40% compared to 4-bit models while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs require huge memory and computational resources, but existing post-training quantization methods designed for language models don't work well for multimodal models due to higher statistical variance in multimodal tokens.

Method: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit Quantization (LUQ) that selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to layers with lower entropy activation distributions, plus using mixed multimodal tokens for PTQ to boost VQA performance.

Result: LUQ reduces memory usage by 40% for LLaVA-1.5 and 31% for Qwen-2.5-VL compared to 4-bit models, with less than 10% performance degradation on MME benchmark across 9 VQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Layerwise selective quantization based on activation entropy analysis enables effective ultra-low bit compression for multimodal LLMs, making them more deployable while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with multimodal capabilities have revolutionized
vision-language tasks, but their deployment often requires huge memory and
computational resources. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has
successfully compressed language models to as low as 1-bit precision without
significant performance loss, its effectiveness for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs)
remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present the first study on
ultra-low bit (<4-bit) quantization for multimodal LLMs. Our analysis reveals
that multimodal tokens and intermediate layer activations produced by them
exhibit significantly higher statistical variance and entropy compared to text
tokens, making them less tolerant to ultra-low bit quantization. However, the
activation distributions of multimodal tokens varies significantly over
different layers, with some layers having lower entropy activation
distributions. We empirically show that such layers in these models can better
tolerate ultra-low bit quantization. Building on these insights, we propose a
novel strategy for MLLM quantization, LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit
Quantization, which selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to layers
that are more resilient to it. Additionally, we also show that using a mix of
multimodal tokens (image and text) for PTQ boosts VQA performance in the
ultra-low bit regime. We evaluate our method on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL
across 9 popular VQA benchmarks. The resulting LUQ models use 40% and 31% less
memory than their 4-bit counterparts, respectively, while exhibiting a
performance degradation of less than 10% on the MME benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HieraTok is a multi-scale Vision Transformer tokenizer that uses multi-scale downsampling and scale-causal attention to improve image reconstruction and generation, achieving significant performance gains over single-scale approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation of single-scale representations in Vision Transformer tokenizers, which fail to capture both global semantic features and high-resolution structural details effectively.

Method: Two key designs: (1) multi-scale downsampling applied to token maps to produce multi-scale tokens, and (2) scale-causal attention mechanism that enables progressive information flow from low-resolution global features to high-resolution details.

Result: 27.2% improvement in rFID (1.47 → 1.07), 1.38× faster convergence rate, 18.9% boost in gFID (16.4 → 13.3), and state-of-the-art performance with rFID of 0.45 and gFID of 1.82 among ViT tokenizers.

Conclusion: HieraTok is the first multi-scale ViT-based tokenizer that advances visual generation tasks through its multi-scale architecture and attention mechanism, creating smoother and more uniformly distributed latent spaces.

Abstract: In this work, we present HieraTok, a novel multi-scale Vision Transformer
(ViT)-based tokenizer that overcomes the inherent limitation of modeling
single-scale representations. This is realized through two key designs: (1)
multi-scale downsampling applied to the token map generated by the tokenizer
encoder, producing a sequence of multi-scale tokens, and (2) a scale-causal
attention mechanism that enables the progressive flow of information from
low-resolution global semantic features to high-resolution structural details.
Coupling these designs, HieraTok achieves significant improvements in both
image reconstruction and generation tasks. Under identical settings, the
multi-scale visual tokenizer outperforms its single-scale counterpart by a
27.2\% improvement in rFID ($1.47 \rightarrow 1.07$). When integrated into
downstream generation frameworks, it achieves a $1.38\times$ faster convergence
rate and an 18.9\% boost in gFID ($16.4 \rightarrow 13.3$), which may be
attributed to the smoother and more uniformly distributed latent space.
Furthermore, by scaling up the tokenizer's training, we demonstrate its
potential by a sota rFID of 0.45 and a gFID of 1.82 among ViT tokenizers. To
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce multi-scale ViT-based
tokenizer in image reconstruction and image generation. We hope our findings
and designs advance the ViT-based tokenizers in visual generation tasks.

*Xincheng Yao,Chao Shi,Muming Zhao,Guangtao Zhai,Chongyang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ResAD++ for class-agnostic anomaly detection by learning residual feature distributions rather than initial features, achieving better generalization to new classes without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AD methods fail in class-agnostic scenarios due to class-related feature correlation. Need for models that can generalize to diverse new classes without target data retraining.

Method: Uses residual features (normal reference features subtracted from initial features) for decorrelation, feature hypersphere constraining for scale consistency, logbarrier bidirectional contraction OCC loss, and vector quantization feature distribution matching.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 8 real-world AD datasets, achieving remarkable AD results when directly applied to new classes without retraining.

Conclusion: ResAD++ effectively addresses feature correlation issues in class-agnostic AD through residual learning and feature decorrelation, enabling superior generalization to new classes across domains.

Abstract: This paper explores the problem of class-agnostic anomaly detection (AD),
where the objective is to train one class-agnostic AD model that can generalize
to detect anomalies in diverse new classes from different domains without any
retraining or fine-tuning on the target data. When applied for new classes, the
performance of current single- and multi-class AD methods is still
unsatisfactory. One fundamental reason is that representation learning in
existing methods is still class-related, namely, feature correlation. To
address this issue, we propose residual features and construct a simple but
effective framework, termed ResAD. Our core insight is to learn the residual
feature distribution rather than the initial feature distribution. Residual
features are formed by matching and then subtracting normal reference features.
In this way, we can effectively realize feature decorrelation. Even in new
classes, the distribution of normal residual features would not remarkably
shift from the learned distribution. In addition, we think that residual
features still have one issue: scale correlation. To this end, we propose a
feature hypersphere constraining approach, which learns to constrain initial
normal residual features into a spatial hypersphere for enabling the feature
scales of different classes as consistent as possible. Furthermore, we propose
a novel logbarrier bidirectional contraction OCC loss and vector quantization
based feature distribution matching module to enhance ResAD, leading to the
improved version of ResAD (ResAD++). Comprehensive experiments on eight
real-world AD datasets demonstrate that our ResAD++ can achieve remarkable AD
results when directly used in new classes, outperforming state-of-the-art
competing methods and also surpassing ResAD. The code is available at

*Wenjie Yang,Zengfeng Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Poivre introduces a self-refining procedure for visual pointing that enables VLMs to iteratively refine coordinates through reinforcement learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Point-Bench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs perform poorly on visual pointing tasks compared to humans, primarily because they must complete pointing in a single step without visual feedback, unlike humans who can see and adjust their pointing.

Method: Proposes Point, Visualize, then Refine (Poivre) procedure using reinforcement learning to enable iterative coordinate refinement. Uses a process reward that is both empirically effective and theoretically grounded.

Result: Poivre-7B achieves new state-of-the-art on Point-Bench, outperforming proprietary models like Gemini-2.5-Pro and large open-source models like Molmo-72B by over 3%.

Conclusion: The self-refining approach with RL training significantly improves visual pointing performance, demonstrating that iterative refinement is crucial for bridging the gap between VLM and human performance on this task.

Abstract: Visual pointing, which aims to localize a target by predicting its
coordinates on an image, has emerged as an important problem in the realm of
vision-language models (VLMs). Despite its broad applicability, recent
benchmarks show that current VLMs still fall far behind human performance on
this task. A key limitation is that VLMs are typically required to complete the
pointing task in a single step, akin to asking humans to point at an object
without seeing their own fingers. To address this issue, we propose a simple
yet effective self-refining procedure: Point, Visualize, then Refine (Poivre).
This procedure enables a VLM to first mark its estimated point, then
iteratively refine the coordinates if necessary. Inspired by advances of
reasoning models in the natural language domain, we employ reinforcement
learning (RL) to incentivize this self-refining ability. For the RL training,
we design a neat process reward that is not only empirically effective but also
grounded in appealing properties. Our trained model, Poivre-7B, sets a new
state of the art on Point-Bench, outperforming both proprietary models such as
Gemini-2.5-Pro and large open-source models such as Molmo-72B by over 3%. To
support future research, we release our training and inference code, dataset,
and the Poivre-7B checkpoint.

Conclusion: PVTAdpNet provides highly suitable solution for clinical applications in colorectal cancer detection with real-time, accurate polyp segmentation performance.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer ranks among the most common and deadly cancers, emphasizing
the need for effective early detection and treatment. To address the
limitations of traditional colonoscopy, including high miss rates due to polyp
variability, we introduce the Pyramid Vision Transformer Adapter Residual
Network (PVTAdpNet). This model integrates a U-Net-style encoder-decoder
structure with a Pyramid Vision Transformer backbone, novel residual blocks,
and adapter-based skip connections. The design enhances feature extraction,
dense prediction, and gradient flow, supported by squeeze-and-excitation
attention for improved channel-wise feature refinement. PVTAdpNet achieves
real-time, accurate polyp segmentation, demonstrating superior performance on
benchmark datasets with high mDice and mIoU scores, making it highly suitable
for clinical applications. PVTAdpNet obtains a high Dice coefficient of 0.8851
and a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.8167 on out-of-distribution
polyp datasets. Evaluation of the PolypGen dataset demonstrates PVTAdpNet's
capability for real-time, accurate performance within familiar distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for multimodal tasks rely on fragmented architectures using vision-language models or modular designs, leading to computational inefficiency and poor semantic comprehension across complex instructions.

Method: Proposes UniAlignment framework with dual-stream diffusion training strategy incorporating both intrinsic-modal and cross-modal semantic alignment within a single diffusion transformer.

Result: Extensive experiments show UniAlignment outperforms existing baselines across multiple tasks and benchmarks, demonstrating superior multimodal semantic consistency.

Conclusion: UniAlignment shows significant potential of diffusion models in unified multimodal generation, offering enhanced cross-modal consistency and instruction-following robustness.

Abstract: The remarkable success of diffusion models in text-to-image generation has
sparked growing interest in expanding their capabilities to a variety of
multi-modal tasks, including image understanding, manipulation, and perception.
These tasks require advanced semantic comprehension across both visual and
textual modalities, especially in scenarios involving complex semantic
instructions. However, existing approaches often rely heavily on
vision-language models (VLMs) or modular designs for semantic guidance, leading
to fragmented architectures and computational inefficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose UniAlignment, a unified multimodal generation framework
within a single diffusion transformer. UniAlignment introduces a dual-stream
diffusion training strategy that incorporates both intrinsic-modal semantic
alignment and cross-modal semantic alignment, thereby enhancing the model's
cross-modal consistency and instruction-following robustness. Additionally, we
present SemGen-Bench, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
multimodal semantic consistency under complex textual instructions. Extensive
experiments across multiple tasks and benchmarks demonstrate that UniAlignment
outperforms existing baselines, underscoring the significant potential of
diffusion models in unified multimodal generation.

*Xiaojie Li,Bei Wang,Jianlong Wu,Yue Yu,Liqiang Nie,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenView++ is a unified framework that improves contrastive learning through multi-source adaptive view generation and quality-driven contrastive learning, achieving significant performance gains in both vision and vision-language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current contrastive learning methods face limitations in both construction and learning aspects: limited diversity and semantic corruption in augmentations, and lack of quality assessment leading to suboptimal supervision where all pairs are treated equally.

Method: Introduces two innovations: 1) Multi-source adaptive view generation that synthesizes diverse yet semantically coherent views using image-conditioned, text-conditioned, and image-text-conditioned strategies with dynamic parameter modulation; 2) Quality-driven contrastive learning that assesses semantic alignment and diversity to dynamically reweight training contributions.

Result: Significant performance improvements: +2.5% on ImageNet linear classification with MoCov2; +12.31% average zero-shot classification accuracy over CLIP and +5.31% over SLIP across ten datasets; +3.2% improvement on Flickr30k text retrieval R@5.

Conclusion: GenView++ effectively addresses the dual challenges of contrastive learning by improving both view construction quality and learning mechanisms, demonstrating strong performance across diverse vision and vision-language tasks.

Abstract: The success of contrastive learning depends on the construction and
utilization of high-quality positive pairs. However, current methods face
critical limitations on two fronts: on the construction side, both handcrafted
and generative augmentations often suffer from limited diversity and risk
semantic corruption; on the learning side, the absence of a quality assessment
mechanism leads to suboptimal supervision where all pairs are treated equally.
To tackle these challenges, we propose GenView++, a unified framework that
addresses both fronts by introducing two synergistic innovations. To improve
pair construction, GenView++ introduces a multi-source adaptive view generation
mechanism to synthesize diverse yet semantically coherent views by dynamically
modulating generative parameters across image-conditioned, text-conditioned,
and image-text-conditioned strategies. Second, a quality-driven contrastive
learning mechanism assesses each pair's semantic alignment and diversity to
dynamically reweight their training contribution, prioritizing high-quality
pairs while suppressing redundant or misaligned pairs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of GenView++ across both vision and
vision-language tasks. For vision representation learning, it improves MoCov2
by +2.5% on ImageNet linear classification. For vision-language learning, it
raises the average zero-shot classification accuracy by +12.31% over CLIP and
+5.31% over SLIP across ten datasets, and further improves Flickr30k text
retrieval R@5 by +3.2%. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based models for urban data use identical architectures across all modalities and neglect spatial heterogeneity during fusion, leading to suboptimal region representations.

Method: Categorizes modalities into aggregated-level and point-level groups, uses mixture-of-experts GNN for aggregated modalities and dual-level GNN for point-level visual data, implements spatially-aware multimodal fusion with dynamic region-specific weights, and employs joint contrastive learning.

Result: MTGRR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on two real-world datasets across six modalities and three tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed modality-tailored approach with spatially-aware fusion effectively captures modality-specific characteristics and spatial heterogeneity, leading to superior urban region representations.

Abstract: Graph-based models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modeling
multimodal urban data and learning region representations for various
downstream tasks. However, existing approaches face two major limitations. (1)
They typically employ identical graph neural network architectures across all
modalities, failing to capture modality-specific structures and
characteristics. (2) During the fusion stage, they often neglect spatial
heterogeneity by assuming that the aggregation weights of different modalities
remain invariant across regions, resulting in suboptimal representations. To
address these issues, we propose MTGRR, a modality-tailored graph modeling
framework for urban region representation, built upon a multimodal dataset
comprising point of interest (POI), taxi mobility, land use, road element,
remote sensing, and street view images. (1) MTGRR categorizes modalities into
two groups based on spatial density and data characteristics: aggregated-level
and point-level modalities. For aggregated-level modalities, MTGRR employs a
mixture-of-experts (MoE) graph architecture, where each modality is processed
by a dedicated expert GNN to capture distinct modality-specific
characteristics. For the point-level modality, a dual-level GNN is constructed
to extract fine-grained visual semantic features. (2) To obtain effective
region representations under spatial heterogeneity, a spatially-aware
multimodal fusion mechanism is designed to dynamically infer region-specific
modality fusion weights. Building on this graph modeling framework, MTGRR
further employs a joint contrastive learning strategy that integrates region
aggregated-level, point-level, and fusion-level objectives to optimize region
representations. Experiments on two real-world datasets across six modalities
and three tasks demonstrate that MTGRR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness.

### [160] [Texture Vector-Quantization and Reconstruction Aware Prediction for Generative Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23774)
*Qifan Li,Jiale Zou,Jinhua Zhang,Wei Long,Xinyu Zhou,Shuhang Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes TVQ&RAP, a generative super-resolution model that improves vector-quantized prior modeling through texture-specific quantization and reconstruction-aware prediction to reduce quantization error and enhance accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQ-based methods have large quantization errors due to encoding all visual features and train predictors with code-level supervision that ignores reconstruction errors, leading to sub-optimal prior modeling.

Method: Proposes Texture Vector-Quantization that only models missing textures' prior and Reconstruction Aware Prediction using straight-through estimator to train index predictor with image-level supervision.

Result: The model delivers photo-realistic super-resolution results with small computational cost.

Conclusion: TVQ&RAP effectively addresses quantization error and sub-optimal training in VQ-based methods, achieving high-quality super-resolution efficiently.

Abstract: Vector-quantized based models have recently demonstrated strong potential for
visual prior modeling. However, existing VQ-based methods simply encode visual
features with nearest codebook items and train index predictor with code-level
supervision. Due to the richness of visual signal, VQ encoding often leads to
large quantization error. Furthermore, training predictor with code-level
supervision can not take the final reconstruction errors into consideration,
result in sub-optimal prior modeling accuracy. In this paper we address the
above two issues and propose a Texture Vector-Quantization and a Reconstruction
Aware Prediction strategy. The texture vector-quantization strategy leverages
the task character of super-resolution and only introduce codebook to model the
prior of missing textures. While the reconstruction aware prediction strategy
makes use of the straight-through estimator to directly train index predictor
with image-level supervision. Our proposed generative SR model (TVQ&RAP) is
able to deliver photo-realistic SR results with small computational cost.

*Nayeong Kim,Seong Joon Oh,Suha Kwak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GroupCoOp is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that uses group-specific text prompts to address spurious correlations in vision-language models, achieving state-of-the-art debiasing performance while training only 0.016% of parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parameter-efficient fine-tuned VLMs are vulnerable to spurious correlations from subgroup imbalance in training datasets, which leads to poor group robustness.

Method: Uses group-specific text prompts as multiple classifiers per class, leveraging the semantic knowledge of VLM text encoders to discover effective prompts even for minority groups.

Result: Achieved best results on five benchmarks across five CLIP architectures, occasionally outperforming methods that fine-tune the entire network.

Conclusion: GroupCoOp effectively enhances group robustness of fine-tuned VLMs while maintaining parameter efficiency, addressing subgroup imbalance issues through group-specific prompts.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of vision-language models (VLMs)
excels in various vision tasks thanks to the rich knowledge and generalization
ability of VLMs. However, recent studies revealed that such fine-tuned VLMs are
vulnerable to spurious correlations stemming from the subgroup imbalance in the
fine-tuning datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Group Context
Optimization (GroupCoOp), a simple and effective debiased fine-tuning algorithm
that enhances the group robustness of fine-tuned VLMs. Its key idea is to
employ group-specific text prompts as group representatives serving as multiple
classifiers for their target class. The rich semantic knowledge of the text
encoder of VLM enables the discovery of effective group prompts even for groups
with a small number of training samples. Leveraging the group prompts for each
class addresses the issues caused by the group-imbalanced training set, such as
the neglect of minority groups and the scattered distribution of each class in
the embedding space. GroupCoOp achieved the best results on five benchmarks
across five CLIP architectures and occasionally outperformed prior methods that
fine-tune the entire network, despite training only 0.016\% of the network's
parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring consistently high-quality, industry-standard content from PCG techniques remains challenging despite enabling efficient content creation.

Method: Leverages object segmentation and visual analysis of level images to detect structural gaps and perform targeted repairs, evaluating multiple segmentation models.

Result: Experimental results show improved stability and playability of AI-generated levels.

Conclusion: The image-based approach is designed to be applicable to a wide range of 2D games with similar level structures, despite specific evaluation on Angry Birds.

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation (PCG) techniques enable automatic creation of
diverse and complex environments. While PCG facilitates more efficient content
creation, ensuring consistently high-quality, industry-standard content remains
a significant challenge. In this research, we propose a method to identify and
repair unstable levels generated by existing PCG models. We use Angry Birds as
a case study, demonstrating our method on game levels produced by established
PCG approaches. Our method leverages object segmentation and visual analysis of
level images to detect structural gaps and perform targeted repairs. We
evaluate multiple object segmentation models and select the most effective one
as the basis for our repair pipeline. Experimental results show that our method
improves the stability and playability of AI-generated levels. Although our
evaluation is specific to Angry Birds, our image-based approach is designed to
be applicable to a wide range of 2D games with similar level structures.

TL;DR: A controllable framework for generating large-scale 3D vector urban layouts that combines geometric continuity with semantic control, enabling realistic 3D urban modeling from 2D layouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing urban modeling methods have limitations - image-based approaches lack geometric continuity and scalability, while graph-based methods ignore parcel semantics. There's a need for methods that can generate large-scale 3D urban layouts with both geometric and semantic control.

Method: Fuses geometric and semantic attributes, introduces edge weights, and embeds building height in the graph structure to extend 2D layouts to realistic 3D urban models. Allows direct user control through semantic attribute modification.

Result: The method successfully produces valid, large-scale urban models that maintain geometric continuity while incorporating semantic information. Experiments demonstrate the framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: This framework provides an effective tool for data-driven urban planning and design, offering controllable generation of realistic 3D urban layouts that address limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Urban modeling is essential for city planning, scene synthesis, and gaming.
Existing image-based methods generate diverse layouts but often lack geometric
continuity and scalability, while graph-based methods capture structural
relations yet overlook parcel semantics. We present a controllable framework
for large-scale 3D vector urban layout generation, conditioned on both geometry
and semantics. By fusing geometric and semantic attributes, introducing edge
weights, and embedding building height in the graph, our method extends 2D
layouts to realistic 3D structures. It also enables users to directly control
the output by modifying semantic attributes. Experiments show that it produces
valid, large-scale urban models, offering an effective tool for data-driven

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of single-view imaging and manual inspection in manufacturing quality control, which suffer from occlusions, restricted perspectives, and lighting inconsistencies, requiring additional inspection stations that disrupt assembly lines.

Method: Multi-camera imaging system with three views, combined with advanced object detection algorithms and tailored image fusion methodology to resolve ambiguities and enhance detection reliability. A unique annotated dataset was developed for training and testing.

Result: Significantly outperforms single-view methods, achieving high precision and recall rates in identifying improperly fastened small assembly parts like screws. The approach provides comprehensive visual coverage and resolves detection ambiguities.

Conclusion: Contributes to industrial automation by overcoming single-view limitations with a scalable, cost-effective, and accurate quality control mechanism that ensures assembly line reliability and safety. The dataset is publicly available to support further research.

Abstract: Quality control is a critical aspect of manufacturing, particularly in
ensuring the proper assembly of small components in production lines. Existing
solutions often rely on single-view imaging or manual inspection, which are
prone to errors due to occlusions, restricted perspectives, or lighting
inconsistencies. These limitations require the installation of additional
inspection stations, which could disrupt the assembly line and lead to
increased downtime and costs. This paper introduces a novel multi-view quality
control module designed to address these challenges, integrating a multi-camera
imaging system with advanced object detection algorithms. By capturing images
from three camera views, the system provides comprehensive visual coverage of
components of an assembly process. A tailored image fusion methodology combines
results from multiple views, effectively resolving ambiguities and enhancing
detection reliability. To support this system, we developed a unique dataset
comprising annotated images across diverse scenarios, including varied lighting
conditions, occlusions, and angles, to enhance applicability in real-world
manufacturing environments. Experimental results show that our approach
significantly outperforms single-view methods, achieving high precision and
recall rates in the identification of improperly fastened small assembly parts
such as screws. This work contributes to industrial automation by overcoming
single-view limitations, and providing a scalable, cost-effective, and accurate
quality control mechanism that ensures the reliability and safety of the
assembly line. The dataset used in this study is publicly available to

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper examines LLMs' limitations in understanding privacy concepts and introduces a Visual Privacy Taxonomy to evaluate Vision-Language Models' privacy awareness, revealing significant inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs show impressive capabilities, they lack understanding of privacy principles. There's a need to test how these models can understand and enforce privacy, especially given the lack of resources for such evaluation.

Method: The authors introduce a comprehensive, multi-level Visual Privacy Taxonomy to capture privacy issues, and evaluate several state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models using this framework.

Result: Evaluation reveals significant inconsistencies in VLMs' understanding of contextual privacy, highlighting current model limitations.

Conclusion: There is an urgent need for more robust, privacy-aware AI systems. The work provides both a foundational taxonomy for future research and a critical benchmark of current model limitations.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence have profoundly transformed the technological
landscape in recent years. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive abilities in reasoning, text comprehension, contextual pattern
recognition, and integrating language with visual understanding. While these
advances offer significant benefits, they also reveal critical limitations in
the models' ability to grasp the notion of privacy. There is hence substantial
interest in determining if and how these models can understand and enforce
privacy principles, particularly given the lack of supporting resources to test
such a task. In this work, we address these challenges by examining how legal
frameworks can inform the capabilities of these emerging technologies. To this
end, we introduce a comprehensive, multi-level Visual Privacy Taxonomy that
captures a wide range of privacy issues, designed to be scalable and adaptable
to existing and future research needs. Furthermore, we evaluate the
capabilities of several state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
revealing significant inconsistencies in their understanding of contextual
privacy. Our work contributes both a foundational taxonomy for future research
and a critical benchmark of current model limitations, demonstrating the urgent
need for more robust, privacy-aware AI systems.

### [166] [Uni4D-LLM: A Unified SpatioTemporal-Aware VLM for 4D Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23828)
*Hanyu Zhou,Gim Hee Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni4D-LLM is the first unified vision-language model that jointly handles 4D scene understanding and generation through a spatiotemporal-aware framework, bridging the gap between autoregressive understanding and diffusion-based generation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D/4D approaches use separate models for scene understanding (autoregressive) and generation (diffusion), creating a paradigm gap that prevents unified handling of both tasks, especially in dynamic 4D settings requiring spatiotemporal modeling.

Method: Proposes Uni4D-LLM with two key designs: 1) shared representation extracting semantic features for understanding and noisy-injected appearance features for generation, fused with 4D geometric cues via adaptive cross-attention; 2) shared Transformer architecture integrating both autoregressive and diffusion components with task-specific heads.

Result: Extensive experiments show Uni4D-LLM achieves competitive or superior results compared to state-of-the-art models across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating effective unification of 4D scene understanding and generation.

Conclusion: Uni4D-LLM successfully unifies 4D scene understanding and generation within a single Transformer-based framework, representing the first true unification of these tasks in the 4D domain.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in 2D
scene understanding and generation, but extending this unification to the
physical world remains an open challenge. Existing 3D and 4D approaches
typically embed scene geometry into autoregressive model for semantic
understanding and diffusion model for content generation. This paradigm gap
prevents a single model from jointly handling both tasks, especially in dynamic
4D settings where spatiotemporal modeling is critical. We propose Uni4D-LLM,
the first unified VLM framework with spatiotemporal awareness for 4D scene
understanding and generation. Our design is guided by two key insights: 1)
Unification requires a shared representation. We extract semantic features for
understanding and noisy-injected appearance features for generation,
incorporate 4D geometric cues, and fuse them into a spatiotemporal-aware visual
representation through adaptive cross-attention. 2) Unification requires a
shared architecture. Both autoregression and diffusion are built on Transformer
backbones, and this enables integration into a single LLM with task-specific
heads. By aligning visual and linguistic representations, our Uni4D-LLM
produces predictions for both understanding and generation within one
Transformer-based framework. We further apply instruction fine-tuning on
diverse 4D vision-language datasets to improve generalization across tasks.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Uni4D-LLM
achieves competitive or superior results compared to state-of-the-art models
and offers the first true unification of 4D scene understanding and generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the Segment Concept (SeC) framework's zero-shot performance on the challenging MOSEv2 dataset for semi-supervised video object segmentation, achieving 39.7 JFn score and ranking 2nd place without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods rely heavily on appearance-based pattern matching and lack robustness against challenges like visual changes, occlusions, and scene shifts due to insufficient high-level conceptual understanding of targets.

Method: Uses the Segment Concept (SeC) framework which employs a Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to establish deep semantic understanding of objects for more persistent segmentation.

Result: Achieved 39.7 JFn on the MOSEv2 test set and ranked 2nd place in the Complex VOS track of the 7th Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge in zero-shot setting without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The SeC framework demonstrates strong zero-shot performance on complex video object segmentation tasks by leveraging semantic understanding through LVLMs, showing robustness against challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation aims to segment a specified target
throughout a video sequence, initialized by a first-frame mask. Previous
methods rely heavily on appearance-based pattern matching and thus exhibit
limited robustness against challenges such as drastic visual changes,
occlusions, and scene shifts. This failure is often attributed to a lack of
high-level conceptual understanding of the target. The recently proposed
Segment Concept (SeC) framework mitigated this limitation by using a Large
Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to establish a deep semantic understanding of the
object for more persistent segmentation. In this work, we evaluate its
zero-shot performance on the challenging coMplex video Object SEgmentation v2
(MOSEv2) dataset. Without any fine-tuning on the training set, SeC achieved
39.7 \JFn on the test set and ranked 2nd place in the Complex VOS track of the
7th Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge.

TL;DR: T23D-CompBench is a comprehensive benchmark for compositional Text-to-3D quality assessment with 3,600 meshes and 129,600 human ratings. Rank2Score is proposed as a two-stage evaluator that outperforms existing metrics and can optimize generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Text-to-3D quality assessment faces challenges: outdated/fragmented benchmarks and limited objective metrics with non-representative feature extraction and poor robustness.

Method: 1) Create T23D-CompBench with 5 components and 12 sub-components for compositional prompts; 2) Propose Rank2Score with two-stage training: supervised contrastive regression with curriculum learning, then refinement using mean opinion scores.

Result: Rank2Score consistently outperforms existing metrics across multiple dimensions and can serve as a reward function to optimize generative models.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark and evaluator address limitations in T23D quality assessment, providing reliable evaluation and optimization capabilities for Text-to-3D generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-3D (T23D) generative models have enabled the
synthesis of diverse, high-fidelity 3D assets from textual prompts. However,
existing challenges restrict the development of reliable T23D quality
assessment (T23DQA). First, existing benchmarks are outdated, fragmented, and
coarse-grained, making fine-grained metric training infeasible. Moreover,
current objective metrics exhibit inherent design limitations, resulting in
non-representative feature extraction and diminished metric robustness. To
address these limitations, we introduce T23D-CompBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for compositional T23D generation. We define five components with
twelve sub-components for compositional prompts, which are used to generate
3,600 textured meshes from ten state-of-the-art generative models. A
large-scale subjective experiment is conducted to collect 129,600 reliable
human ratings across different perspectives. Based on T23D-CompBench, we
further propose Rank2Score, an effective evaluator with two-stage training for
T23DQA. Rank2Score enhances pairwise training via supervised contrastive
regression and curriculum learning in the first stage, and subsequently refines
predictions using mean opinion scores to achieve closer alignment with human
judgments in the second stage. Extensive experiments and downstream
applications demonstrate that Rank2Score consistently outperforms existing
metrics across multiple dimensions and can additionally serve as a reward
function to optimize generative models. The project is available at

TL;DR: CE-FAM is a concept-based explanation method that uses a branched network to identify what concepts an image classifier learns, which image regions correspond to them, and how they contribute to predictions, leveraging VLM embeddings without requiring annotated datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing saliency maps show important regions but leave interpretation to users, while concept-based explanations clarify concept contributions but few methods simultaneously reveal learned concepts, their regions, and prediction contributions.

Method: Uses branched network sharing activation maps with classifier, learns to mimic VLM embeddings, predicts concepts via weighted sum of activation maps using concept prediction gradients, quantifies contributions based on impact on classification score.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, excels in zero-shot inference for unseen concepts, provides general framework for concept regions and contributions without annotated datasets.

Conclusion: CE-FAM successfully provides comprehensive concept-based explanations that identify learned concepts, their regions, and contributions while leveraging VLM knowledge for arbitrary concepts without dataset annotations.

Abstract: Although saliency maps can highlight important regions to explain the
reasoning behind image classification in artificial intelligence (AI), the
meaning of these regions is left to the user's interpretation. In contrast,
conceptbased explanations decompose AI predictions into humanunderstandable
concepts, clarifying their contributions. However, few methods can
simultaneously reveal what concepts an image classifier learns, which regions
are associated with them, and how they contribute to predictions. We propose a
novel concept-based explanation method, Concept-based Explanation via Fusion of
Activation Maps (CE-FAM). It employs a branched network that shares activation
maps with an image classifier and learns to mimic the embeddings of a Vision
and Language Model (VLM). The branch network predicts concepts in an image, and
their corresponding regions are represented by a weighted sum of activation
maps, with weights given by the gradients of the concept prediction scores.
Their contributions are quantified based on their impact on the image
classification score. Our method provides a general framework for identifying
the concept regions and their contributions while leveraging VLM knowledge to
handle arbitrary concepts without requiring an annotated dataset. Furthermore,
we introduce a novel evaluation metric to assess the accuracy of the concept
regions. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate our method
outperforms existing approaches and excels in zero-shot inference for unseen
concepts.

TL;DR: FairViT-GAN is a hybrid CNN-ViT framework with adversarial debiasing that achieves state-of-the-art facial beauty prediction while significantly reducing ethnic bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FBP models have architectural limitations (CNNs miss global harmony, ViTs miss fine details), demographic biases, and lack transparency.

Method: Hybrid CNN-ViT framework with adversarial debiasing mechanism that trains feature extractor to produce protected-attribute-invariant representations.

Result: Achieved Pearson Correlation of 0.9230, RMSE of 0.2650, and 82.9% reduction in performance gap between ethnic subgroups with adversary accuracy dropping to 52.1%.

Conclusion: FairViT-GAN provides a robust, transparent, and significantly fairer blueprint for responsible AI in subjective visual assessment.

Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) has made significant strides with the
application of deep learning, yet state-of-the-art models often exhibit
critical limitations, including architectural constraints, inherent demographic
biases, and a lack of transparency. Existing methods, primarily based on
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), excel at capturing local texture but
struggle with global facial harmony, while Vision Transformers (ViTs)
effectively model long-range dependencies but can miss fine-grained details.
Furthermore, models trained on benchmark datasets can inadvertently learn and
perpetuate societal biases related to protected attributes like ethnicity. To
address these interconnected challenges, we propose \textbf{FairViT-GAN}, a
novel hybrid framework that synergistically integrates a CNN branch for local
feature extraction and a ViT branch for global context modeling. More
significantly, we introduce an adversarial debiasing mechanism where the
feature extractor is explicitly trained to produce representations that are
invariant to protected attributes, thereby actively mitigating algorithmic
bias. Our framework's transparency is enhanced by visualizing the distinct
focus of each architectural branch. Extensive experiments on the SCUT-FBP5500
benchmark demonstrate that FairViT-GAN not only sets a new state-of-the-art in
predictive accuracy, achieving a Pearson Correlation of \textbf{0.9230} and
reducing RMSE to \textbf{0.2650}, but also excels in fairness. Our analysis
reveals a remarkable \textbf{82.9\% reduction in the performance gap} between
ethnic subgroups, with the adversary's classification accuracy dropping to
near-random chance (52.1\%). We believe FairViT-GAN provides a robust,
transparent, and significantly fairer blueprint for developing responsible AI
systems for subjective visual assessment.

TL;DR: Sim-DETR improves temporal sentence grounding by addressing query conflicts in DETR through constrained self-attention and query-to-frame alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DETR enhancements degrade performance in temporal sentence grounding due to query conflicts between similar target moments and internal conflicts between global semantics and local localization.

Method: Extends DETR with two decoder modifications: (1) constraining self-attention between queries based on semantic and positional overlap, and (2) adding query-to-frame alignment to bridge global and local contexts.

Result: Sim-DETR unlocks the full potential of DETR for temporal sentence grounding, offering a strong baseline for future research.

Conclusion: The proposed Sim-DETR provides a simple yet powerful solution to address query conflicts in DETR for temporal sentence grounding, demonstrating superior performance over standard DETR approaches.

Abstract: Temporal sentence grounding aims to identify exact moments in a video that
correspond to a given textual query, typically addressed with detection
transformer (DETR) solutions. However, we find that typical strategies designed
to enhance DETR do not improve, and may even degrade, its performance in this
task. We systematically analyze and identify the root causes of this abnormal
behavior: (1) conflicts between queries from similar target moments and (2)
internal query conflicts due to the tension between global semantics and local
localization. Building on these insights, we propose a simple yet powerful
baseline, Sim-DETR, which extends the standard DETR with two minor
modifications in the decoder layers: (1) constraining self-attention between
queries based on their semantic and positional overlap and (2) adding
query-to-frame alignment to bridge the global and local contexts. Experiments
demonstrate that Sim-DETR unlocks the full potential of DETR for temporal
sentence grounding, offering a strong baseline for future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Information-Grounding Guidance (IGG) addresses information inconsistencies in autoregressive image generation by anchoring guidance to semantically important regions through attention, improving image quality and semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models for image generation suffer from information inconsistencies between patches across timesteps due to progressive resolution scaling, which scatters guidance signals and causes drift from conditioning information.

Method: Proposed Information-Grounding Guidance (IGG) that anchors guidance to semantically important regions through attention, adaptively reinforcing informative patches during sampling to maintain alignment between guidance and content.

Result: IGG delivers sharper, more coherent, and semantically grounded images across both class-conditioned and text-to-image generation tasks, setting a new benchmark for AR-based methods.

Conclusion: IGG effectively addresses the critical weakness of information inconsistencies in autoregressive image generation models, ensuring guidance and content remain tightly aligned for improved image quality.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models based on next-scale prediction are rapidly
emerging as a powerful tool for image generation, but they face a critical
weakness: information inconsistencies between patches across timesteps
introduced by progressive resolution scaling. These inconsistencies scatter
guidance signals, causing them to drift away from conditioning information and
leaving behind ambiguous, unfaithful features. We tackle this challenge with
Information-Grounding Guidance (IGG), a novel mechanism that anchors guidance
to semantically important regions through attention. By adaptively reinforcing
informative patches during sampling, IGG ensures that guidance and content
remain tightly aligned. Across both class-conditioned and text-to-image
generation tasks, IGG delivers sharper, more coherent, and semantically
grounded images, setting a new benchmark for AR-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation metrics fail to capture MLLM sensitivity to irrelevant visual context, undermining reliability in real-world settings.

Method: Developed Patch Context Robustness Index (PCRI) to quantify performance changes between localized image patches and full-image input across 19 MLLMs and 15 benchmarks.

Result: Most leading MLLMs remain brittle to background noise, with only InternVL2-26B and Qwen2VL-72B showing consistent robustness. PCRI reveals architectural differences in visual context handling.

Conclusion: PCRI enables rigorous comparison of context robustness, supporting principled model selection and guiding development of more robust MLLM architectures and training strategies.

Abstract: The reliability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world
settings is often undermined by sensitivity to irrelevant or distracting visual
context, an aspect not captured by existing evaluation metrics. We introduce
the \textbf{Patch Context Robustness Index (PCRI)}, the first systematic and
interpretable score for quantifying MLLM robustness to variations in visual
context granularity, measuring performance changes between localized image
patches and full-image input.
  Applying PCRI to 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs across 15 vision-language
benchmarks, we find that most leading models remain brittle to background
noise, with only a few, such as InternVL2-26B and Qwen2VL-72B, demonstrating
consistent robustness across tasks. PCRI analysis also highlights how different
model architectures handle and integrate visual context, offering actionable
diagnostic insight for both researchers and practitioners.
  PCRI enables rigorous comparison of context robustness, supporting principled
model selection and guiding the development of future architectures and
training strategies for robust, real-world deployment.

### [174] [Learning Adaptive Pseudo-Label Selection for Semi-Supervised 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23880)
*Taehun Kong,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel semi-supervised 3D object detection framework with learnable pseudo-labeling that automatically selects high-quality pseudo-labels using context-adaptive thresholds and score fusion networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce costly 3D annotations by utilizing unlabeled data more effectively in semi-supervised learning, addressing limitations of previous methods that use manual thresholds and overlook contextual information.

Method: Introduces a learnable pseudo-labeling module with two networks at teacher output level that assess pseudo-label quality via score fusion and determine context-adaptive thresholds, supervised by alignment with GT boxes. Also uses soft supervision strategy for robust learning under label noise.

Result: Extensive experiments on KITTI and Waymo datasets show the method selects high-precision pseudo-labels while maintaining wider context coverage and higher recall rate, significantly improving SS3DOD performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses pseudo-label selection challenges in semi-supervised 3D object detection by leveraging learnable adaptive thresholds and robust supervision strategies.

Abstract: Semi-supervised 3D object detection (SS3DOD) aims to reduce costly 3D
annotations utilizing unlabeled data. Recent studies adopt pseudo-label-based
teacher-student frameworks and demonstrate impressive performance. The main
challenge of these frameworks is in selecting high-quality pseudo-labels from
the teacher's predictions. Most previous methods, however, select pseudo-labels
by comparing confidence scores over thresholds manually set. The latest works
tackle the challenge either by dynamic thresholding or refining the quality of
pseudo-labels. Such methods still overlook contextual information e.g. object
distances, classes, and learning states, and inadequately assess the
pseudo-label quality using partial information available from the networks. In
this work, we propose a novel SS3DOD framework featuring a learnable
pseudo-labeling module designed to automatically and adaptively select
high-quality pseudo-labels. Our approach introduces two networks at the teacher
output level. These networks reliably assess the quality of pseudo-labels by
the score fusion and determine context-adaptive thresholds, which are
supervised by the alignment of pseudo-labels over GT bounding boxes.
Additionally, we introduce a soft supervision strategy that can learn robustly
under pseudo-label noises. This helps the student network prioritize cleaner
labels over noisy ones in semi-supervised learning. Extensive experiments on
the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The
proposed method selects high-precision pseudo-labels while maintaining a wider
coverage of contexts and a higher recall rate, significantly improving relevant
SS3DOD methods.

### [175] [Tunable-Generalization Diffusion Powered by Self-Supervised Contextual Sub-Data for Low-Dose CT Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23885)
*Guoquan Wei,Zekun Zhou,Liu Shi,Wenzhe Shan,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SuperDiff is a self-supervised method for low-dose CT denoising that combines contextual sub-data similarity sensing with latent diffusion models, enabling tunable generalization across different dose levels without requiring paired data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for low-dose CT denoising heavily depend on paired data and generalize poorly. Diffusion models require clean data distribution learning, which is difficult in medical applications, while self-supervised methods struggle with generalizability across different dose levels.

Method: Proposes a dual-domain cascade strategy: 1) Contextual sub-data similarity adaptive sensing in the projection domain for initial prior, 2) Knowledge distillation combined with latent diffusion models for detail optimization, 3) Pixel-level self-correcting fusion for fine-grained reconstruction using initial prior and LDCT image as guidance.

Result: SuperDiff consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on datasets and real data, showing superior reconstruction and generalization performance.

Conclusion: The proposed SuperDiff method effectively addresses the limitations of existing approaches by providing a self-supervised solution that requires only LDCT projection domain data, offers tunable generalization across dose levels, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-dose CT reconstruction.

Abstract: Current models based on deep learning for low-dose CT denoising rely heavily
on paired data and generalize poorly. Even the more concerned diffusion models
need to learn the distribution of clean data for reconstruction, which is
difficult to satisfy in medical clinical applications. At the same time,
self-supervised-based methods face the challenge of significant degradation of
generalizability of models pre-trained for the current dose to expand to other
doses. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel method of
tunable-generalization diffusion powered by self-supervised contextual sub-data
for low-dose CT reconstruction, named SuperDiff. Firstly, a contextual subdata
similarity adaptive sensing strategy is designed for denoising centered on the
LDCT projection domain, which provides an initial prior for the subsequent
progress. Subsequently, the initial prior is used to combine knowledge
distillation with a deep combination of latent diffusion models for optimizing
image details. The pre-trained model is used for inference reconstruction, and
the pixel-level self-correcting fusion technique is proposed for fine-grained
reconstruction of the image domain to enhance the image fidelity, using the
initial prior and the LDCT image as a guide. In addition, the technique is
flexibly applied to the generalization of upper and lower doses or even unseen
doses. Dual-domain strategy cascade for self-supervised LDCT denoising,
SuperDiff requires only LDCT projection domain data for training and testing.
Full qualitative and quantitative evaluations on both datasets and real data
show that SuperDiff consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
in terms of reconstruction and generalization performance.

### [176] [AssemblyHands-X: Modeling 3D Hand-Body Coordination for Understanding Bimanual Human Activities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23888)
*Tatsuro Banno,Takehiko Ohkawa,Ruicong Liu,Ryosuke Furuta,Yoichi Sato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AssemblyHands-X is the first markerless 3D hand-body benchmark for bimanual activities, showing that joint modeling of hand and body cues improves action recognition over using either alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack kinematic-level annotations for both hands and body in bimanual activities, and marker-based motion capture introduces visual artifacts that limit generalization to natural videos.

Method: Constructed a pipeline combining multi-view triangulation with SMPL-X mesh fitting for reliable 3D hand-body pose annotation from synchronized multi-view videos, then validated different input representations across action recognition models.

Result: Pose-based action inference is more efficient and accurate than video baselines, and joint modeling of hand and body cues improves action recognition over using hands or upper body alone.

Conclusion: Modeling interdependent hand-body dynamics is crucial for holistic understanding of bimanual activities, as hand-body coordination significantly impacts action recognition performance.

Abstract: Bimanual human activities inherently involve coordinated movements of both
hands and body. However, the impact of this coordination in activity
understanding has not been systematically evaluated due to the lack of suitable
datasets. Such evaluation demands kinematic-level annotations (e.g., 3D pose)
for the hands and body, yet existing 3D activity datasets typically annotate
either hand or body pose. Another line of work employs marker-based motion
capture to provide full-body pose, but the physical markers introduce visual
artifacts, thereby limiting models' generalization to natural, markerless
videos. To address these limitations, we present AssemblyHands-X, the first
markerless 3D hand-body benchmark for bimanual activities, designed to study
the effect of hand-body coordination for action recognition. We begin by
constructing a pipeline for 3D pose annotation from synchronized multi-view
videos. Our approach combines multi-view triangulation with SMPL-X mesh
fitting, yielding reliable 3D registration of hands and upper body. We then
validate different input representations (e.g., video, hand pose, body pose, or
hand-body pose) across recent action recognition models based on graph
convolution or spatio-temporal attention. Our extensive experiments show that
pose-based action inference is more efficient and accurate than video
baselines. Moreover, joint modeling of hand and body cues improves action
recognition over using hands or upper body alone, highlighting the importance
of modeling interdependent hand-body dynamics for a holistic understanding of
bimanual activities.

*Jinghan Xu Yuyang Zhang Qixuan Cai Jiancheng Chen Keqiu Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CCU is a cross-modal contrastive unlearning framework that selectively removes visual data while preserving cross-modal knowledge and intra-class structure, achieving 7.12% accuracy improvement with 7% unlearning time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual modality is most vulnerable to privacy leakage in multimodal applications, and existing unlearning methods fail to preserve cross-modal knowledge and maintain intra-class structural stability during visual unlearning.

Method: Proposes Cross-modal Contrastive Unlearning (CCU) with three components: selective visual unlearning using inverse contrastive learning, cross-modal knowledge retention via semantic consistency, and dual-set contrastive separation to isolate structural perturbations.

Result: Extensive experiments on three datasets show superiority of CCU, achieving 7.12% accuracy improvement with only 7% of the unlearning time compared to top-accuracy baseline.

Conclusion: CCU effectively addresses privacy leakage in multimodal applications by enabling selective visual unlearning while preserving cross-modal knowledge and model performance.

Abstract: Visual modality is the most vulnerable to privacy leakage in real-world
multimodal applications like autonomous driving with visual and radar data;
Machine unlearning removes specific training data from pre-trained models to
address privacy leakage, however, existing methods fail to preserve cross-modal
knowledge and maintain intra-class structural stability of retain data, leading
to reduced overall and other modalities' performance during visual unlearning;
to address these challenges, we propose a Cross-modal Contrastive Unlearning
(CCU) framework, which integrates three key components: (a) selective visual
unlearning: employing inverse contrastive learning to dissociate visual
representations from their original semantics, (b) cross-modal knowledge
retention: preserving other modalities' discriminability through semantic
consistency, and (c) dual-set contrastive separation: preserving the model
performance via isolation of structural perturbations between the unlearn set
and retain set; extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the
superiority of CCU, and our method achieves a 7.12% accuracy improvement with
only 7% of the unlearning time compared to the top-accuracy baseline.

TL;DR: Q-FSRU is a medical VQA model that combines frequency domain processing with quantum-inspired retrieval to improve accuracy and explainability in clinical image-text reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solving complex clinical questions requiring both image and text understanding remains a major challenge in healthcare AI, with existing models struggling with accuracy and reasoning capabilities.

Method: The model uses Fast Fourier Transform to shift image and text features into frequency domain for noise filtering, combined with quantum retrieval-augmented generation that fetches medical facts from external sources using quantum-based similarity techniques.

Result: Evaluation on VQA-RAD dataset showed Q-FSRU outperforms previous models, particularly on complex cases requiring image-text reasoning, with improved performance and explainability.

Conclusion: The combination of frequency processing and quantum information retrieval offers a promising approach for building intelligent, transparent, and helpful AI tools for medical professionals.

Abstract: Solving tough clinical questions that require both image and text
understanding is still a major challenge in healthcare AI. In this work, we
propose Q-FSRU, a new model that combines Frequency Spectrum Representation and
Fusion (FSRU) with a method called Quantum Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(Quantum RAG) for medical Visual Question Answering (VQA). The model takes in
features from medical images and related text, then shifts them into the
frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This helps it focus on
more meaningful data and filter out noise or less useful information. To
improve accuracy and ensure that answers are based on real knowledge, we add a
quantum inspired retrieval system. It fetches useful medical facts from
external sources using quantum-based similarity techniques. These details are
then merged with the frequency-based features for stronger reasoning. We
evaluated our model using the VQA-RAD dataset, which includes real radiology
images and questions. The results showed that Q-FSRU outperforms earlier
models, especially on complex cases needing image text reasoning. The mix of
frequency and quantum information improves both performance and explainability.
Overall, this approach offers a promising way to build smart, clear, and
helpful AI tools for doctors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging foundation models need to adapt over time, but full retraining is often prevented by privacy constraints and high costs.

Method: Pairs class-conditional diffusion replay with Elastic Weight Consolidation using a compact Vision Transformer backbone, avoiding storage of patient exemplars.

Result: Achieves 0.851 AUROC on CheXpert, reduces forgetting by >30% compared to DER++, approaches joint training performance (0.869 AUROC), while remaining efficient and privacy-preserving.

Conclusion: Provides a practical route for scalable, privacy-aware continual adaptation of clinical imaging models, with forgetting linked to replay fidelity and parameter drift.

Abstract: Medical imaging foundation models must adapt over time, yet full retraining
is often blocked by privacy constraints and cost. We present a continual
learning framework that avoids storing patient exemplars by pairing class
conditional diffusion replay with Elastic Weight Consolidation. Using a compact
Vision Transformer backbone, we evaluate across eight MedMNIST v2 tasks and
CheXpert. On CheXpert our approach attains 0.851 AUROC, reduces forgetting by
more than 30\% relative to DER\texttt{++}, and approaches joint training at
0.869 AUROC, while remaining efficient and privacy preserving. Analyses connect
forgetting to two measurable factors: fidelity of replay and Fisher weighted
parameter drift, highlighting the complementary roles of replay diffusion and
synaptic stability. The results indicate a practical route for scalable,
privacy aware continual adaptation of clinical imaging models.

TL;DR: Proposes FedDA, a federated domain adaptation framework for cross-domain medical image segmentation that uses feature-level adversarial learning to align feature maps across clients with different medical image modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of modality heterogeneity in federated learning for healthcare, where different clients possess medical images of different modalities due to resource imbalance or data issues.

Method: Feature-level adversarial learning among clients by aligning feature maps through embedding an adversarial training mechanism to enhance model generalization and mitigate domain-shift effects.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on three medical image datasets show FedDA achieves cross-domain federated aggregation, enables single modality clients with cross-modality processing capabilities, and outperforms state-of-the-art federated aggregation algorithms.

Conclusion: FedDA successfully addresses modality heterogeneity in federated medical image segmentation through adversarial domain adaptation, providing robust performance and cross-modality capabilities.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative training of machine learning models
among different clients while ensuring data privacy, emerging as the mainstream
for breaking data silos in the healthcare domain. However, the imbalance of
medical resources, data corruption or improper data preservation may lead to a
situation where different clients possess medical images of different modality.
This heterogeneity poses a significant challenge for cross-domain medical image
segmentation within the federated learning framework. To address this
challenge, we propose a new Federated Domain Adaptation (FedDA) segmentation
training framework. Specifically, we propose a feature-level adversarial
learning among clients by aligning feature maps across clients through
embedding an adversarial training mechanism. This design can enhance the
model's generalization on multiple domains and alleviate the negative impact
from domain-shift. Comprehensive experiments on three medical image datasets
demonstrate that our proposed FedDA substantially achieves cross-domain
federated aggregation, endowing single modality client with cross-modality
processing capabilities, and consistently delivers robust performance compared
to state-of-the-art federated aggregation algorithms in objective and
subjective assessment. Our code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instruction-guided image editing models struggle with complex instructions and often require multiple samples. Reinforcement Learning offers promise but has been hindered by the lack of high-fidelity, efficient reward signals.

Method: Developed EditReward-Bench as a comprehensive benchmark, then created EditScore reward models (7B-72B) through meticulous data curation and filtering. Used a self-ensemble strategy tailored for generative nature, and applied RL framework to OmniGen2 base model.

Result: EditScore matches performance of learning proprietary VLMs, with largest variant surpassing GPT-5 in benchmark. Enabled efficient and robust policy optimization, resulting in substantial and consistent performance uplift when applied to OmniGen2.

Conclusion: A high-fidelity, domain-specialized reward model is key to unlocking RL's full potential in image editing, providing the first systematic path from benchmarking to reward modeling to RL training in this domain.

Abstract: Instruction-guided image editing has achieved remarkable progress, yet
current models still face challenges with complex instructions and often
require multiple samples to produce a desired result. Reinforcement Learning
(RL) offers a promising solution, but its adoption in image editing has been
severely hindered by the lack of a high-fidelity, efficient reward signal. In
this work, we present a comprehensive methodology to overcome this barrier,
centered on the development of a state-of-the-art, specialized reward model. We
first introduce EditReward-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark to systematically
evaluate reward models on editing quality. Building on this benchmark, we
develop EditScore, a series of reward models (7B-72B) for evaluating the
quality of instruction-guided image editing. Through meticulous data curation
and filtering, EditScore effectively matches the performance of learning
proprietary VLMs. Furthermore, coupled with an effective self-ensemble strategy
tailored for the generative nature of EditScore, our largest variant even
surpasses GPT-5 in the benchmark. We then demonstrate that a high-fidelity
reward model is the key to unlocking online RL for image editing. Our
experiments show that, while even the largest open-source VLMs fail to provide
an effective learning signal, EditScore enables efficient and robust policy
optimization. Applying our framework to a strong base model, OmniGen2, results
in a final model that shows a substantial and consistent performance uplift.
Overall, this work provides the first systematic path from benchmarking to
reward modeling to RL training in image editing, showing that a high-fidelity,
domain-specialized reward model is the key to unlocking the full potential of
RL in this domain.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoReact is a diffusion-based method for text-driven human reaction generation that disentangles global trajectory and local motion generation to produce realistic, diverse, and controllable reactions that match counterpart movements and follow textual guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for human reaction generation either treat multiple individuals as a single entity or rely solely on one person's motion, failing to integrate rich semantic information and lacking adaptive responsiveness to diverse interaction scenarios.

Method: MoReact uses a diffusion-based approach that sequentially generates global trajectories first, then local motions, with a novel interaction loss to enhance realism of close interactions. The model generates motion sequences based on descriptive text of interaction scenarios.

Result: Experiments using adapted two-person motion data demonstrate MoReact's efficacy in producing realistic, diverse, and controllable reactions that closely match counterpart movements while adhering to textual guidance.

Conclusion: The proposed MoReact method successfully addresses limitations of existing models by focusing on text-driven human reaction generation, achieving better alignment with given actions and text through sequential trajectory and motion generation.

Abstract: Modeling and generating human reactions poses a significant challenge with
broad applications for computer vision and human-computer interaction. Existing
methods either treat multiple individuals as a single entity, directly
generating interactions, or rely solely on one person's motion to generate the
other's reaction, failing to integrate the rich semantic information that
underpins human interactions. Yet, these methods often fall short in adaptive
responsiveness, i.e., the ability to accurately respond to diverse and dynamic
interaction scenarios. Recognizing this gap, our work introduces an approach
tailored to address the limitations of existing models by focusing on
text-driven human reaction generation. Our model specifically generates
realistic motion sequences for individuals that responding to the other's
actions based on a descriptive text of the interaction scenario. The goal is to
produce motion sequences that not only complement the opponent's movements but
also semantically fit the described interactions. To achieve this, we present
MoReact, a diffusion-based method designed to disentangle the generation of
global trajectories and local motions sequentially. This approach stems from
the observation that generating global trajectories first is crucial for
guiding local motion, ensuring better alignment with given action and text.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel interaction loss to enhance the realism of
generated close interactions. Our experiments, utilizing data adapted from a
two-person motion dataset, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for this
novel task, which is capable of producing realistic, diverse, and controllable
reactions that not only closely match the movements of the counterpart but also
adhere to the textual guidance. Please find our webpage at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multi-task learning suffers from optimization imbalance where task interference leads to poor performance. The paper shows gradient norm correlates with this imbalance, and scaling losses by gradient norms achieves results comparable to expensive grid search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the persistent problem of 'unbalanced optimization' in multi-task learning where task interference causes subpar performance compared to single-task models.

Method: Systematic experimental analysis examining factors contributing to optimization imbalance, including investigation of gradient norms and proposing a strategy to scale task losses according to their gradient norms.

Result: Found strong correlation between optimization imbalance and task-specific gradient norms. The gradient-based loss scaling strategy achieved performance comparable to computationally expensive grid search methods.

Conclusion: Understanding and controlling gradient dynamics is a more direct path to stable multi-task learning than developing increasingly complex methods, with gradient norm-based loss scaling providing an effective solution.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to build general-purpose vision systems by
training a single network to perform multiple tasks jointly. While promising,
its potential is often hindered by "unbalanced optimization", where task
interference leads to subpar performance compared to single-task models. To
facilitate research in MTL, this paper presents a systematic experimental
analysis to dissect the factors contributing to this persistent problem. Our
investigation confirms that the performance of existing optimization methods
varies inconsistently across datasets, and advanced architectures still rely on
costly grid-searched loss weights. Furthermore, we show that while powerful
Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) provide strong initialization, they do not
inherently resolve the optimization imbalance, and merely increasing data
quantity offers limited benefits. A crucial finding emerges from our analysis:
a strong correlation exists between the optimization imbalance and the norm of
task-specific gradients. We demonstrate that this insight is directly
applicable, showing that a straightforward strategy of scaling task losses
according to their gradient norms can achieve performance comparable to that of
an extensive and computationally expensive grid search. Our comprehensive
analysis suggests that understanding and controlling gradient dynamics is a
more direct path to stable MTL than developing increasingly complex methods.

*Kuanrong Liu,Siyuan Liang,Cheng Qian,Ming Zhang,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes adversarial example transfer across CLIP-based models in different tasks, finding that fine-grained tasks generate stronger transferable attacks. The authors propose MT-AdvCLIP framework that enhances cross-task adversarial transfer through task-aware feature aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP shows strong generalization but struggles with fine-grained tasks and its adversarial robustness remains underexplored. Understanding adversarial transfer across tasks is crucial for assessing CLIP's security risks and generalization limits.

Method: Proposed MT-AdvCLIP framework with task-aware feature aggregation loss to generate perturbations with enhanced cross-task generalization capability, strengthening attack effectiveness of fine-grained task models on shared CLIP backbone.

Result: MT-AdvCLIP significantly improves adversarial transfer success rate (average attack success rate improved by over 39%) against various CLIP-derived models without increasing perturbation budget, as demonstrated on multiple public datasets.

Conclusion: The study reveals adversarial example transfer mechanisms in multi-task CLIP models, providing new insights for multi-task robustness evaluation and adversarial example design, highlighting security vulnerabilities in CLIP-based systems.

Abstract: As a general-purpose vision-language pretraining model, CLIP demonstrates
strong generalization ability in image-text alignment tasks and has been widely
adopted in downstream applications such as image classification and image-text
retrieval. However, it struggles with fine-grained tasks such as object
detection and semantic segmentation. While many variants aim to improve CLIP on
these tasks, its robustness to adversarial perturbations remains underexplored.
Understanding how adversarial examples transfer across tasks is key to
assessing CLIP's generalization limits and security risks. In this work, we
conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the cross-task transfer behavior of
CLIP-based models on image-text retrieval, object detection, and semantic
segmentation under adversarial perturbations. We find that adversarial examples
generated from fine-grained tasks (e.g., object detection and semantic
segmentation) often exhibit stronger transfer potential than those from
coarse-grained tasks, enabling more effective attacks against the original CLIP
model. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Task
Adversarial CLIP (MT-AdvCLIP), which introduces a task-aware feature
aggregation loss and generates perturbations with enhanced cross-task
generalization capability. This design strengthens the attack effectiveness of
fine-grained task models on the shared CLIP backbone. Experimental results on
multiple public datasets show that MT-AdvCLIP significantly improves the
adversarial transfer success rate (The average attack success rate across
multiple tasks is improved by over 39%.) against various CLIP-derived models,

### [187] [Token Painter: Training-Free Text-Guided Image Inpainting via Mask Autoregressive Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23919)
*Longtao Jiang,Mingfei Han,Lei Chen,Yongqiang Yu,Feng Zhao,Xiaojun Chang,Zhihui Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Token Painter is a training-free text-guided image inpainting method that uses Mask AutoRegressive models with dual-stream encoder fusion and adaptive decoder attention enhancement to generate prompt-faithful content while maintaining background consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based methods struggle with aligning inpainting results with text prompts and maintaining background consistency due to modeling the entire image in latent space. MAR models offer better local controllability but tend to ignore prompts or create disharmonious results with background.

Method: Proposes Token Painter with two key components: Dual-Stream Encoder Information Fusion (DEIF) that fuses text and background information in frequency domain to create guidance tokens, and Adaptive Decoder Attention Score Enhancing (ADAE) that adaptively enhances attention on guidance and inpainting tokens.

Result: Extensive experiments show the training-free method outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods across almost all metrics and delivers superior visual results.

Conclusion: Token Painter effectively addresses the limitations of both diffusion-based and direct MAR approaches for text-guided image inpainting, achieving better prompt alignment and background consistency without requiring training.

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims to inpaint masked image regions based on a
textual prompt while preserving the background. Although diffusion-based
methods have become dominant, their property of modeling the entire image in
latent space makes it challenging for the results to align well with prompt
details and maintain a consistent background. To address these issues, we
explore Mask AutoRegressive (MAR) models for this task. MAR naturally supports
image inpainting by generating latent tokens corresponding to mask regions,
enabling better local controllability without altering the background. However,
directly applying MAR to this task makes the inpainting content either ignore
the prompts or be disharmonious with the background context. Through analysis
of the attention maps from the inpainting images, we identify the impact of
background tokens on text tokens during the MAR generation, and leverage this
to design \textbf{Token Painter}, a training-free text-guided image inpainting
method based on MAR. Our approach introduces two key components: (1)
Dual-Stream Encoder Information Fusion (DEIF), which fuses the semantic and
context information from text and background in frequency domain to produce
novel guidance tokens, allowing MAR to generate text-faithful inpainting
content while keeping harmonious with background context. (2) Adaptive Decoder
Attention Score Enhancing (ADAE), which adaptively enhances attention scores on
guidance tokens and inpainting tokens to further enhance the alignment of
prompt details and the content visual quality. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our training-free method outperforms prior state-of-the-art
methods across almost all metrics and delivers superior visual results. Codes
will be released.

### [188] [Learning Encoding-Decoding Direction Pairs to Unveil Concepts of Influence in Deep Vision Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23926)
*Alexandros Doumanoglou,Kurt Driessens,Dimitrios Zarpalas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to identify encoding and decoding direction pairs in deep vision networks, enabling better understanding and manipulation of concept representations in latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To open the black box of deep networks by recovering encoding-decoding direction pairs that represent concepts as directions in latent space, enabling understanding, debugging, and model improvement.

Method: Identifies decoding directions via directional clustering of activations, estimates encoding directions with signal vectors under probabilistic view, and leverages network weights through Uncertainty Region Alignment.

Result: Successfully recovers ground-truth direction pairs on synthetic data, produces interpretable concepts on real data outperforming baselines, and validates encoding direction estimation via activation maximization.

Conclusion: The method enables applications in understanding model behavior, explaining predictions, and intervening for counterfactuals or error correction through concept manipulation.

Abstract: Empirical evidence shows that deep vision networks represent concepts as
directions in latent space, vectors we call concept embeddings. Each concept
has a latent factor-a scalar-indicating its presence in an input patch. For a
given patch, multiple latent factors are encoded into a compact representation
by linearly combining concept embeddings, with the factors as coefficients.
Since these embeddings enable such encoding, we call them encoding directions.
A latent factor can be recovered via the inner product with a filter, a vector
we call a decoding direction. These encoding-decoding direction pairs are not
directly accessible, but recovering them helps open the black box of deep
networks, enabling understanding, debugging, and improving models. Decoder
directions attribute meaning to latent codes, while encoding directions assess
concept influence on predictions, with both enabling model correction by
unlearning irrelevant concepts. Unlike prior matrix decomposition, autoencoder,
or dictionary learning methods that rely on feature reconstruction, we propose
a new perspective: decoding directions are identified via directional
clustering of activations, and encoding directions are estimated with signal
vectors under a probabilistic view. We further leverage network weights through
a novel technique, Uncertainty Region Alignment, which reveals interpretable
directions affecting predictions. Our analysis shows that (a) on synthetic
data, our method recovers ground-truth direction pairs; (b) on real data,
decoding directions map to monosemantic, interpretable concepts and outperform
unsupervised baselines; and (c) signal vectors faithfully estimate encoding
directions, validated via activation maximization. Finally, we demonstrate
applications in understanding global model behavior, explaining individual
predictions, and intervening to produce counterfactuals or correct errors.

*Yi Yang,Xiaokun Zhang,Qingchen Fang,Ziqi Ye,Rui Li,Li Liu,Haipeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAR-KnowLIP is the first universal SAR multimodal foundational model that addresses the gap in cross-modal AI for synthetic aperture radar imagery by incorporating geographic information, using hierarchical cognitive chain-of-thought for text generation, and implementing self-consistent iterative optimization for cross-modal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-modal AI methods are mostly designed for RGB imagery, leaving a significant gap in modeling synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, which has all-day, all-weather imaging capabilities and plays an irreplaceable role in remote sensing scene understanding.

Method: The approach includes: (1) constructing SAR-GEOVL-1M dataset with geographic projection properties; (2) generating aligned structured text through hierarchical cognitive chain-of-thought (HCoT); (3) designing Self-Consistent Iterative Optimization mechanism for cross-modal alignment; (4) establishing unified evaluation benchmark across 11 downstream tasks.

Result: SAR-KnowLIP demonstrates leading performance in comprehensive evaluations against 14 leading foundation models, particularly excelling in object counting and land-cover classification tasks.

Conclusion: SAR-KnowLIP's large-scale multimodal data, transferable model architecture, and comprehensive experimental benchmark are expected to significantly advance the development of SAR multimodal baseline models in remote sensing.

Abstract: Cross-modal artificial intelligence has garnered widespread attention in
recent years, achieving significant progress in the study of natural images.
However, existing methods are mostly designed for RGB imagery, leaving a
significant gap in modeling synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. SAR, with
its all-day, all-weather imaging capabilities, plays an irreplaceable role in
remote sensing scene understanding. To address this gap, this paper proposes
SAR-KnowLIP, the first universal SAR multimodal foundational model, along with
reusable data and evaluation baselines. Specifically: (1) This work introduces
the critical yet long-overlooked attribute of geographic information into
remote sensing research, constructing SAR-GEOVL-1M (the first large-scale SAR
dataset with complete geographic projection properties), covering multiple
satellite platforms, 120,000 images, and 135 cities. (2) Aligned structured
text is generated through a hierarchical cognitive chain-of-thought (HCoT),
providing more than one million multi-dimensional semantic annotations of
landforms, regional functions, target attributes, and spatial relationships.
(3) We design a Self-Consistent Iterative Optimization mechanism that
continuously enhances cross-modal alignment through a self-supervised closed
loop of contrastive, matching, and reconstruction learning on a transferable
multimodal encoder. (4) A unified evaluation benchmark is established across 11
representative downstream vision and vision-language tasks, with comparisons
against 14 leading foundation models, where SAR-KnowLIP demonstrates leading
performance, particularly in object counting and land-cover classification. We
expect that SAR-KnowLIP's large-scale multimodal data, transferable model
architecture, and comprehensive experimental benchmark will significantly
advance the development of SAR multimodal baseline models.

### [190] [AutoPrune: Each Complexity Deserves a Pruning Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23931)
*Hanshi Wang,Yuhao Xu,Zekun Xu,Jin Gao,Yufan Liu,Weiming Hu,Ke Wang,Zhipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoPrune is a training-free framework that adaptively prunes visual tokens in vision-language models based on sample and task complexity, achieving 76.8% FLOPs reduction while maintaining 96.7% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pruning methods use fixed schedules that don't align with the model's reasoning trajectory, failing to accommodate diverse input complexities. Human visual processing shows evidence accumulation before focus narrowing, suggesting adaptive pruning is needed.

Method: AutoPrune quantifies mutual information between visual and textual tokens, then projects this signal to a budget-constrained logistic retention curve that adapts pruning policies to different task complexities.

Result: Applied to LLaVA-1.5-7B, AutoPrune prunes 89% of visual tokens, reduces inference FLOPs by 76.8% while retaining 96.7% original accuracy across tasks - 9.1% improvement over PDrop.

Conclusion: Complexity-adaptive pruning effectively reduces computational demands while maintaining performance by aligning token elimination with the model's reasoning process, outperforming fixed pruning strategies.

Abstract: The established redundancy in visual tokens within large vision-language
models allows pruning to effectively reduce their substantial computational
demands. Previous methods typically employ heuristic layer-specific pruning
strategies where, although the number of tokens removed may differ across
decoder layers, the overall pruning schedule is fixed and applied uniformly to
all input samples and tasks, failing to align token elimination with the
model's holistic reasoning trajectory. Cognitive science indicates that human
visual processing often begins with broad exploration to accumulate evidence
before narrowing focus as the target becomes distinct. Our experiments reveal
an analogous pattern in these models. This observation suggests that neither a
fixed pruning schedule nor a heuristic layer-wise strategy can optimally
accommodate the diverse complexities inherent in different inputs. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce Complexity-Adaptive Pruning (AutoPrune), a
training-free, plug-and-play framework that tailors pruning policies to varying
sample and task complexities. Specifically, AutoPrune quantifies the mutual
information between visual and textual tokens, then projects this signal to a
budget-constrained logistic retention curve. Each such logistic curve, defined
by its unique shape, corresponds to the specific complexity of different tasks
and can guarantee adherence to predefined computational constraints. We
evaluate AutoPrune on standard vision-language tasks and on
Vision-Language-Action models for autonomous driving. Notably, when applied to
LLaVA-1.5-7B, our method prunes 89% of visual tokens and reduces inference
FLOPs by 76.8% while retaining 96.7% of the original accuracy averaged over all
tasks. This corresponds to a 9.1% improvement over the recent work PDrop,
demonstrating the effectiveness. Code is available at

*Dragoş-Andrei Chileban,Andrei-Ştefan Bulzan,Cosmin Cernǎzanu-Glǎvan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an automatic car damage detection pipeline that uses 3D Gaussian Splatting for single-view 3D segmentation, enabling damage detection from limited views where multi-view approaches fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current car damage detection methods rely mainly on 2D image analysis, but 3D reconstruction can provide more comprehensive and geometrically accurate damage assessment. 3D Gaussian Splatting shows promise for accurate 3D reconstruction from limited views.

Method: The pipeline performs 3D damage segmentation by uplifting 2D masks. It uses a learning-free approach for single-view 3D-GS segmentation where Gaussians are projected onto image planes using SfM camera parameters, then filtered using Z-buffering with normal distribution models of depth and opacities.

Result: The method is particularly effective for challenging car damage detection scenarios where target objects like scratches and small dents may only be clearly visible in a single view, making multi-view consistency approaches impractical.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables automatic car damage detection using 3D reconstruction from limited views, addressing practical scenarios where multi-view methods fail, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Automatic car damage detection has been a topic of significant interest for
the auto insurance industry as it promises faster, accurate, and cost-effective
damage assessments. However, few works have gone beyond 2D image analysis to
leverage 3D reconstruction methods, which have the potential to provide a more
comprehensive and geometrically accurate representation of the damage.
Moreover, recent methods employing 3D representations for novel view synthesis,
particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), have demonstrated the ability to
generate accurate and coherent 3D reconstructions from a limited number of
views. In this work we introduce an automatic car damage detection pipeline
that performs 3D damage segmentation by up-lifting 2D masks. Additionally, we
propose a simple yet effective learning-free approach for single-view 3D-GS
segmentation. Specifically, Gaussians are projected onto the image plane using
camera parameters obtained via Structure from Motion (SfM). They are then
filtered through an algorithm that utilizes Z-buffering along with a normal
distribution model of depth and opacities. Through experiments we found that
this method is particularly effective for challenging scenarios like car damage
detection, where target objects (e.g., scratches, small dents) may only be
clearly visible in a single view, making multi-view consistency approaches
impractical or impossible. The code is publicly available at:

Result: Significantly accelerates annotation process while improving quality and discriminability of generated expressions; framework adopted in ICCV 2025 MARS2 Challenge to enrich dataset with diverse, challenging samples.

Conclusion: ColLab enables fully automated, high-quality REC and REG data generation without human supervision, addressing scalability limitations of manual annotation.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) and Referring Expression Generation
(REG) are fundamental tasks in multimodal understanding, supporting precise
object localization through natural language. However, existing REC and REG
datasets rely heavily on manual annotation, which is labor-intensive and
difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose ColLab, a collaborative spatial
progressive data engine that enables fully automated REC and REG data
generation without human supervision. Specifically, our method introduces a
Collaborative Multimodal Model Interaction (CMMI) strategy, which leverages the
semantic understanding of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and large

module termed Spatial Progressive Augmentation (SPA) to enhance spatial
expressiveness among duplicate instances. Experiments demonstrate that ColLab
significantly accelerates the annotation process of REC and REG while improving
the quality and discriminability of the generated expressions. In addition to
the core methodological contribution, our framework was partially adopted in

TL;DR: RLIR is a post-training framework that uses inverse dynamics models to derive verifiable reward signals from generated videos, improving action-following capability in video world models without needing expensive preference annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video world models have improved visual quality but struggle with accurately modeling human-specified actions. Traditional reinforcement learning methods are impractical due to high annotation costs and difficulty in creating video verifiers.

Method: RLIR recovers input actions from generated videos using an Inverse Dynamics Model, mapping high-dimensional videos to low-dimensional action spaces to provide objective rewards for optimization via Group Relative Policy Optimization.

Result: Experiments show 5-10% gains in action-following, up to 10% improvements in visual quality, and higher human preference scores across autoregressive and diffusion paradigms.

Conclusion: RLIR establishes the first effective post-training method specifically designed to enhance action-following in video world models, addressing a critical gap in current approaches.

Abstract: World models simulate dynamic environments, enabling agents to interact with
diverse input modalities. Although recent advances have improved the visual
quality and temporal consistency of video world models, their ability of
accurately modeling human-specified actions remains under-explored.
Reinforcement learning presents a promising approach for directly improving the
suboptimal action-following capability of pre-trained models, assuming that an
appropriate reward function can be defined. However, transferring reinforcement
learning post-training methods to world model is impractical due to the
prohibitive cost of large-scale preference annotations and the infeasibility of
constructing rule-based video verifiers. To address this gap, we propose
Reinforcement Learning with Inverse Rewards (RLIR), a post-training framework
that derives verifiable reward signals by recovering input actions from
generated videos using an Inverse Dynamics Model. By mapping high-dimensional
video modality to a low-dimensional action space, RLIR provides an objective
and verifiable reward for optimization via Group Relative Policy Optimization.
Experiments across autoregressive and diffusion paradigms demonstrate 5-10%
gains in action-following, up to 10% improvements in visual quality, and higher
human preference scores, establishing RLIR as the first post-training method
specifically designed to enhance action-following in video world models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for timely and accurate thyroid cancer diagnosis to improve treatment strategies and patient outcomes, leveraging advanced feature enrichment techniques.

Method: Couples Adaptive CNN with CDF9/7 wavelets whose detail coefficients are modulated by an n-scroll chaotic system to enhance discriminative features, evaluated on DDTI dataset with 5-fold cross-validation.

Result: Achieves 98.17% accuracy, 98.76% sensitivity, 97.58% specificity, 97.55% F1-score, AUC 0.9912, and outperforms EfficientNetV2-S, Swin-T, ViT-B/16, and ConvNeXt-T. Chaotic modulation improves accuracy by +8.79 percentage points.

Conclusion: The wavelet-chaos-CNN pipeline delivers state-of-the-art thyroid ultrasound classification with strong generalization, computational efficiency, and clinical relevance, suitable for clinical integration.

Abstract: Timely and accurate diagnosis is crucial in addressing the global rise in
thyroid cancer, ensuring effective treatment strategies and improved patient
outcomes. We present an intelligent classification method that couples an
Adaptive Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau
(CDF9/7) wavelets whose detail coefficients are modulated by an n-scroll
chaotic system to enrich discriminative features. We evaluate on the public
DDTI thyroid ultrasound dataset (n = 1,638 images; 819 malignant / 819 benign)
using 5-fold cross-validation, where the proposed method attains 98.17%
accuracy, 98.76% sensitivity, 97.58% specificity, 97.55% F1-score, and an AUC
of 0.9912. A controlled ablation shows that adding chaotic modulation to CDF9/7
improves accuracy by +8.79 percentage points over a CDF9/7-only CNN (from
89.38% to 98.17%). To objectively position our approach, we trained
state-of-the-art backbones on the same data and splits: EfficientNetV2-S
(96.58% accuracy; AUC 0.987), Swin-T (96.41%; 0.986), ViT-B/16 (95.72%; 0.983),
and ConvNeXt-T (96.94%; 0.987). Our method outperforms the best of these by
+1.23 points in accuracy and +0.0042 in AUC, while remaining computationally
efficient (28.7 ms per image; 1,125 MB peak VRAM). Robustness is further
supported by cross-dataset testing on TCIA (accuracy 95.82%) and transfer to an
ISIC skin-lesion subset (n = 28 unique images, augmented to 2,048; accuracy
97.31%). Explainability analyses (Grad-CAM, SHAP, LIME) highlight clinically
relevant regions. Altogether, the wavelet-chaos-CNN pipeline delivers
state-of-the-art thyroid ultrasound classification with strong generalization

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models for traffic simulation systematically violate physical constraints - 50% of generated trajectories show vehicles colliding, driving off roads, or spawning inside buildings, treating physical validity as emergent rather than architectural requirement.

Method: Proposed Validity-First Spatial Intelligence (VFSI) that enforces constraints through energy-based guidance during diffusion sampling, incorporating collision avoidance and kinematic constraints as energy functions to guide denoising toward physically valid trajectories.

Result: Across 200 urban scenarios from Waymo Open Motion Dataset, VFSI reduced collision rates by 67% (24.6% to 8.1%) and improved overall validity by 87% (50.3% to 94.2%), while simultaneously improving realism metrics (ADE: 1.34m to 1.21m).

Conclusion: Explicit constraint enforcement during inference is both necessary and sufficient for physically valid traffic simulation, demonstrating a model-agnostic approach that maintains realism while ensuring physical validity.

Abstract: Modern diffusion models generate realistic traffic simulations but
systematically violate physical constraints. In a large-scale evaluation of
SceneDiffuser++, a state-of-the-art traffic simulator, we find that 50% of
generated trajectories violate basic physical laws - vehicles collide, drive
off roads, and spawn inside buildings. This reveals a fundamental limitation:
current models treat physical validity as an emergent property rather than an
architectural requirement. We propose Validity-First Spatial Intelligence
(VFSI), which enforces constraints through energy-based guidance during
diffusion sampling, without model retraining. By incorporating collision
avoidance and kinematic constraints as energy functions, we guide the denoising
process toward physically valid trajectories. Across 200 urban scenarios from
the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, VFSI reduces collision rates by 67% (24.6% to
8.1%) and improves overall validity by 87% (50.3% to 94.2%), while
simultaneously improving realism metrics (ADE: 1.34m to 1.21m). Our
model-agnostic approach demonstrates that explicit constraint enforcement

TL;DR: OASIS is an efficient one-step diffusion model with attention specialization for real-world video super-resolution that reduces computational redundancy while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct adaptation of diffusion models to video super-resolution creates redundancy since low-quality videos already contain substantial content information, leading to increased computational overhead and learning burden.

Method: Proposes attention specialization routing that assigns attention heads to different patterns according to their intrinsic behaviors, and a progressive training strategy starting with temporally consistent degradations then shifting to inconsistent settings.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets with 6.2× speedup over one-step diffusion baselines like SeedVR2.

Conclusion: OASIS effectively mitigates redundancy in diffusion models for VSR while preserving pretrained knowledge, enabling efficient and high-performance video super-resolution.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promising results for video
super-resolution (VSR). However, directly adapting generative diffusion models
to VSR can result in redundancy, since low-quality videos already preserve
substantial content information. Such redundancy leads to increased
computational overhead and learning burden, as the model performs superfluous
operations and must learn to filter out irrelevant information. To address this
problem, we propose OASIS, an efficient $\textbf{o}$ne-step diffusion model
with $\textbf{a}$ttention $\textbf{s}$pecialization for real-world
v$\textbf{i}$deo $\textbf{s}$uper-resolution. OASIS incorporates an attention
specialization routing that assigns attention heads to different patterns
according to their intrinsic behaviors. This routing mitigates redundancy while
effectively preserving pretrained knowledge, allowing diffusion models to
better adapt to VSR and achieve stronger performance. Moreover, we propose a
simple yet effective progressive training strategy, which starts with
temporally consistent degradations and then shifts to inconsistent settings.
This strategy facilitates learning under complex degradations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that OASIS achieves state-of-the-art performance on
both synthetic and real-world datasets. OASIS also provides superior inference
speed, offering a $\textbf{6.2$\times$}$ speedup over one-step diffusion
baselines such as SeedVR2. The code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of 360 images across various domains has created a need for robust depth estimation techniques, but obtaining large-scale labeled datasets for 360 depth estimation remains challenging.

Method: The approach converts 360 images into six-face cubemap representations, uses perspective foundation models to estimate depth and surface normals, and introduces graph-based optimization for depth scale alignment across cubemap faces while preserving 3D structural integrity.

Conclusion: RPG360 provides a robust, training-free solution for 360 monocular depth estimation that leverages foundation models' zero-shot robustness and graph optimization to overcome depth scale inconsistencies in omnidirectional imagery.

Abstract: The increasing use of 360 images across various domains has emphasized the
need for robust depth estimation techniques tailored for omnidirectional
images. However, obtaining large-scale labeled datasets for 360 depth
estimation remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose RPG360, a
training-free robust 360 monocular depth estimation method that leverages
perspective foundation models and graph optimization. Our approach converts 360
images into six-face cubemap representations, where a perspective foundation
model is employed to estimate depth and surface normals. To address depth scale
inconsistencies across different faces of the cubemap, we introduce a novel
depth scale alignment technique using graph-based optimization, which
parameterizes the predicted depth and normal maps while incorporating an
additional per-face scale parameter. This optimization ensures depth scale
consistency across the six-face cubemap while preserving 3D structural
integrity. Furthermore, as foundation models exhibit inherent robustness in
zero-shot settings, our method achieves superior performance across diverse
datasets, including Matterport3D, Stanford2D3D, and 360Loc. We also demonstrate
the versatility of our depth estimation approach by validating its benefits in
downstream tasks such as feature matching 3.2 ~ 5.4% and Structure from Motion
0.2 ~ 9.7% in AUC@5.

Conclusion: SIE3D successfully enables detailed text-based control over 3D avatar expressions while maintaining high fidelity and identity preservation from single input images.

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D head avatars from a single image is challenging,
as current methods lack fine-grained, intuitive control over expressions via

from the image with semantic embedding from text through a novel conditioning
scheme, enabling detailed control. To ensure generated expressions accurately
match the text, it introduces an innovative perceptual expression loss

*Haonan Ge,Yiwei Wang,Kai-Wei Chang,Hang Wu,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FrameMind is a reinforcement learning framework that enables video understanding models to dynamically request visual information during reasoning, outperforming static frame sampling approaches on challenging benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video understanding models use fixed frame sampling strategies that can't adapt to specific reasoning requirements, limiting their ability to gather appropriate visual evidence for tasks needing either broad temporal coverage or fine-grained spatial detail.

Method: FrameMind uses Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought (FiCOT) where models alternate between textual reasoning and active visual perception, requesting targeted frames/clips based on identified knowledge gaps. It employs Dynamic Resolution Frame Sampling (DRFS) and DRFS-GRPO policy optimization to learn effective dynamic sampling policies without frame-level annotations.

Result: Extensive experiments on MLVU and VideoMME benchmarks show that FrameMind significantly outperforms existing models, advancing state-of-the-art in flexible and efficient video understanding.

Conclusion: FrameMind's dynamic approach to video understanding enables adaptive visual information gathering, overcoming limitations of static frame sampling and achieving superior performance on challenging video reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Current video understanding models rely on fixed frame sampling strategies,
processing predetermined visual inputs regardless of the specific reasoning
requirements of each question. This static approach limits their ability to
adaptively gather visual evidence, leading to suboptimal performance on tasks
that require either broad temporal coverage or fine-grained spatial detail. In
this paper, we introduce FrameMind, an end-to-end framework trained with
reinforcement learning that enables models to dynamically request visual
information during reasoning through Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought
(FiCOT). Unlike traditional approaches, FrameMind operates in multiple turns
where the model alternates between textual reasoning and active visual
perception, using tools to extract targeted frames or video clips based on
identified knowledge gaps. To train effective dynamic sampling policies, we
propose Dynamic Resolution Frame Sampling (DRFS), which exposes models to
diverse temporal-spatial trade-offs during learning, and DRFS-GRPO, a
group-relative policy optimization algorithm that learns from outcome-based
rewards without requiring frame-level annotations. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks like MLVU and VideoMME demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing models, advancing the state of the art in
flexible and efficient video understanding.

### [202] [Generalized Category Discovery in Hyperspectral Images via Prototype Subspace Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24017)
*Xianlu Li,Nicolas Nadisic,Shaoguang Huang,Aleksandra Pizurica*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes the first generalized category discovery framework for hyperspectral images using prototype subspace modeling with basis vectors instead of single prototypes, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCD methods designed for RGB images don't generalize well to hyperspectral images due to their high-dimensionality and complex spectral structures, requiring specialized approaches.

Method: Uses prototype subspace modeling where each category is represented by a set of basis vectors forming a subspace. Employs basis orthogonality constraint for inter-class separability and reconstruction constraint to ensure effective sample representation.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GCD methods on real-world HSI datasets, establishing a strong foundation for generalized category discovery in hyperspectral settings.

Conclusion: Subspace-based prototype modeling is more effective than single-vector prototypes for HSI GCD, providing greater expressiveness and discrimination in high-dimensional feature spaces.

Abstract: Generalized category discovery~(GCD) seeks to jointly identify both known and
novel categories in unlabeled data. While prior works have mainly focused on
RGB images, their assumptions and modeling strategies do not generalize well to
hyperspectral images~(HSI), which are inherently high-dimensional and exhibit
complex spectral structures. In this paper, we propose the first GCD framework
tailored for HSI, introducing a prototype subspace modeling model to better
capture class structure. Instead of learning a single prototype vector for each
category as in existing methods such as SimGCD, we model each category using a
set of basis vectors, forming a subspace representation that enables greater
expressiveness and discrimination in a high-dimensional feature space. To guide
the learning of such bases, we enforce two key constraints: (1) a basis
orthogonality constraint that promotes inter-class separability, and (2) a
reconstruction constraint that ensures each prototype basis can effectively
reconstruct its corresponding class samples. Experimental results on real-world
HSI demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GCD
methods, establishing a strong foundation for generalized category discovery in
hyperspectral settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning model combining atmospheric scattering physics with pedestrian interaction modeling for trajectory prediction in hazy weather, achieving significant performance improvements in dense haze scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address physical information degradation and ineffective pedestrian interaction modeling in pedestrian trajectory prediction under hazy weather conditions.

Method: Combines differentiable atmospheric scattering model for haze mitigation, adaptive scanning state space model for feature extraction, and heterogeneous graph attention network with spatio-temporal fusion for pedestrian relationship modeling.

Result: 78% inference speed increase over native Mamba, 37.2% reduction in minADE and 41.5% reduction in minFDE metrics compared to SOTA in dense haze scenarios (visibility < 30m).

Conclusion: Provides a new modeling paradigm for reliable perception in intelligent transportation systems in adverse environments.

Abstract: To address the issues of physical information degradation and ineffective
pedestrian interaction modeling in pedestrian trajectory prediction under hazy
weather conditions, we propose a deep learning model that combines physical
priors of atmospheric scattering with topological modeling of pedestrian
relationships. Specifically, we first construct a differentiable atmospheric
scattering model that decouples haze concentration from light degradation
through a network with physical parameter estimation, enabling the learning of
haze-mitigated feature representations. Second, we design an adaptive scanning
state space model for feature extraction. Our adaptive Mamba variant achieves a
78% inference speed increase over native Mamba while preserving long-range
dependency modeling.
  Finally, to efficiently model pedestrian relationships, we develop a
heterogeneous graph attention network, using graph matrices to model
multi-granularity interactions between pedestrians and groups, combined with a
spatio-temporal fusion module to capture the collaborative evolution patterns
of pedestrian movements. Furthermore, we constructed a new pedestrian
trajectory prediction dataset based on ETH/UCY to evaluate the effectiveness of
the proposed method. Experiments show that our method reduces the minADE /
minFDE metrics by 37.2% and 41.5%, respectively, compared to the SOTA models in
dense haze scenarios (visibility < 30m), providing a new modeling paradigm for
reliable perception in intelligent transportation systems in adverse
environments.

*Nate Rothschild,Moshe Kimhi,Avi Mendelson,Chaim Baskin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training image reconstruction networks directly on raw Bayer data instead of post-ISP sRGB images yields superior results, as demonstrated through rain removal experiments showing up to +0.99 dB PSNR improvement and +1.2% ICS gain with half the computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most reconstruction networks are trained on post-ISP sRGB images, which irreversibly mix colors, clip dynamic range, and blur fine detail. The paper aims to show these losses are avoidable by working directly with raw Bayer data.

Method: The authors (i) evaluate post-ISP and Bayer reconstruction pipelines, (ii) create Raw-Rain benchmark with real rainy scenes in both 12-bit Bayer and bit-depth-matched sRGB, and (iii) introduce Information Conservation Score (ICS) as a color-invariant metric.

Result: On the test split, the raw-domain model improves sRGB results by up to +0.99 dB PSNR and +1.2% ICS, while running faster with half of the GFLOPs compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: The results advocate for an ISP-last paradigm for low-level vision and open the door to end-to-end learnable camera pipelines, demonstrating that learning directly on raw Bayer mosaics yields superior reconstructions.

Abstract: Image reconstruction from corrupted images is crucial across many domains.
Most reconstruction networks are trained on post-ISP sRGB images, even though
the image-signal-processing pipeline irreversibly mixes colors, clips dynamic
range, and blurs fine detail. This paper uses the rain degradation problem as a
use case to show that these losses are avoidable, and demonstrates that
learning directly on raw Bayer mosaics yields superior reconstructions. To
substantiate the claim, we (i) evaluate post-ISP and Bayer reconstruction
pipelines, (ii) curate Raw-Rain, the first public benchmark of real rainy
scenes captured in both 12-bit Bayer and bit-depth-matched sRGB, and (iii)
introduce Information Conservation Score (ICS), a color-invariant metric that
aligns more closely with human opinion than PSNR or SSIM. On the test split,
our raw-domain model improves sRGB results by up to +0.99 dB PSNR and +1.2%
ICS, while running faster with half of the GFLOPs. The results advocate an
ISP-last paradigm for low-level vision and open the door to end-to-end

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes superpixel segmentation and subspace clustering for hyperspectral images using a feedback mechanism between a self-representation network and differentiable superpixel module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing superpixel-based subspace clustering methods where segmentation is performed independently, leading to partitions that don't align with clustering objectives, and overcome computational/memory constraints of traditional subspace clustering.

Method: Unified framework with feedback mechanism: self-representation network based on unfolded ADMM guides differentiable superpixel module, enabling joint optimization. Superpixel network learns unique compactness parameter for each superpixel for adaptive segmentation.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark HSI datasets show superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art clustering approaches, with clustering-aware partitions that preserve both spectral and spatial structure.

Conclusion: Joint optimization of superpixel segmentation and subspace clustering through feedback mechanism enables more effective and efficient hyperspectral image analysis, achieving better performance than existing methods.

Abstract: Subspace clustering is a powerful unsupervised approach for hyperspectral
image (HSI) analysis, but its high computational and memory costs limit
scalability. Superpixel segmentation can improve efficiency by reducing the
number of data points to process. However, existing superpixel-based methods
usually perform segmentation independently of the clustering task, often
producing partitions that do not align with the subsequent clustering
objective. To address this, we propose a unified end-to-end framework that
jointly optimizes superpixel segmentation and subspace clustering. Its core is
a feedback mechanism: a self-representation network based on unfolded
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) provides a model-driven
signal to guide a differentiable superpixel module. This joint optimization
yields clustering-aware partitions that preserve both spectral and spatial
structure. Furthermore, our superpixel network learns a unique compactness
parameter for each superpixel, enabling more flexible and adaptive
segmentation. Extensive experiments on benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that
our method consistently achieves superior accuracy compared with
state-of-the-art clustering approaches.

*Leonardo Iurada,Beatrice Occhiena,Tatiana Tommasi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pruning pre-trained vision models on one task surprisingly maintains zero-shot performance on unseen tasks, and fine-tuning can recover performance on held-out tasks due to favorable loss landscapes from pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how data influences pruning of pre-trained vision models and address the challenge when downstream tasks are unknown, enabling efficient model compression without task-specific data.

Method: Investigate pruning-at-initialization approach on pre-trained vision models, analyzing how pruning on one task affects performance on unseen tasks and the potential for fine-tuning to recover performance.

Result: Pruning on one task retains zero-shot performance on unseen tasks, and fine-tuning pruned models improves performance on original tasks while recovering held-out tasks' performance.

Conclusion: The favorable loss landscapes induced by extensive pre-training enable effective pruning without task-specific data, allowing model compression that maintains performance across multiple tasks.

Abstract: The widespread availability of pre-trained vision models has enabled numerous
deep learning applications through their transferable representations. However,
their computational and storage costs often limit practical deployment.
Pruning-at-Initialization has emerged as a promising approach to compress
models before training, enabling efficient task-specific adaptation. While
conventional wisdom suggests that effective pruning requires task-specific
data, this creates a challenge when downstream tasks are unknown in advance. In
this paper, we investigate how data influences the pruning of pre-trained
vision models. Surprisingly, pruning on one task retains the model's zero-shot
performance also on unseen tasks. Furthermore, fine-tuning these pruned models
not only improves performance on original seen tasks but can recover held-out
tasks' performance. We attribute this phenomenon to the favorable loss
landscapes induced by extensive pre-training on large-scale datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Grounding IDs are latent identifiers that emerge when LVLMs use visual structures like partitions, improving multimodal binding and reducing hallucinations by aligning objects with symbolic cues across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why simple visual structures improve LVLM performance and uncover the underlying mechanisms behind enhanced structured reasoning and precise grounding.

Method: Used representation analysis to identify Grounding IDs as latent identifiers, conducted causal interventions to verify their mediating role, and analyzed attention patterns between related components.

Result: Found that Grounding IDs create robust within-partition alignment, reduce modality gap between image and text, strengthen attention between related components, and improve cross-modal grounding while reducing hallucinations.

Conclusion: Grounding IDs serve as a key symbolic mechanism that explains how external visual cues enhance multimodal binding, offering both interpretability insights and practical improvements in model robustness.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) show strong performance across
multimodal benchmarks but remain limited in structured reasoning and precise
grounding. Recent work has demonstrated that adding simple visual structures,
such as partitions and annotations, improves accuracy, yet the internal
mechanisms underlying these gains remain unclear. We investigate this
phenomenon and propose the concept of Grounding IDs, latent identifiers induced
by external cues that bind objects to their designated partitions across
modalities. Through representation analysis, we find that these identifiers
emerge as robust within-partition alignment in embedding space and reduce the
modality gap between image and text. Causal interventions further confirm that
these identifiers mediate binding between objects and symbolic cues. We show
that Grounding IDs strengthen attention between related components, which in
turn improves cross-modal grounding and reduces hallucinations. Taken together,
our results identify Grounding IDs as a key symbolic mechanism explaining how
external cues enhance multimodal binding, offering both interpretability and
practical improvements in robustness.

TL;DR: VideoAR challenges the frame-by-frame paradigm in video generation by introducing spatiotemporal cubes as prediction units, enabling simultaneous spatial and temporal modeling that outperforms traditional approaches in quality, speed, and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper questions whether frames are the appropriate atomic units for video autoregression, arguing that the frame-by-frame approach inherited from language models may not be optimal for spatiotemporal data like video.

Method: Proposes VideoAR framework with multiple prediction units including full frames, key-detail frames, multiscale refinements, and spatiotemporal cubes. The core innovation is using spatiotemporal cubes that allow autoregressive models to operate across both spatial and temporal dimensions simultaneously.

Result: Cube-based prediction consistently delivers superior quality, speed, and temporal coherence. The method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on VBench while achieving faster inference and enabling seamless scaling to minute-long sequences.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that removing the frame-by-frame constraint leads to better video generation performance and motivates rethinking sequence decomposition in video and other spatiotemporal domains.

Abstract: Autoregressive models for video generation typically operate frame-by-frame,
extending next-token prediction from language to video's temporal dimension. We
question that unlike word as token is universally agreed in language if frame
is a appropriate prediction unit? To address this, we present VideoAR, a
unified framework that supports a spectrum of prediction units including full
frames, key-detail frames, multiscale refinements, and spatiotemporal cubes.
Among these designs, we find model video generation using
\textit{spatiotemporal} cubes as prediction units, which allows autoregressive
models to operate across both spatial and temporal dimensions simultaneously.
This approach eliminates the assumption that frames are the natural atomic
units for video autoregression. We evaluate VideoAR across diverse prediction
strategies, finding that cube-based prediction consistently delivers superior
quality, speed, and temporal coherence. By removing the frame-by-frame
constraint, our video generator surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on VBench
while achieving faster inference and enabling seamless scaling to minute-long
sequences. We hope this work will motivate rethinking sequence decomposition in
video and other spatiotemporal domains.

Abstract: Generating realistic, context-aware two-person motion conditioned on diverse

Result: SVAC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple RVOS benchmarks with competitive efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed SVAC model effectively addresses computational challenges in RVOS while improving segmentation performance through enhanced video-language interaction and temporal dynamics handling.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment target objects in

TL;DR: GMS is a coarse-to-fine framework that combines general vision-language models as 'Scanners' with specialized GUI grounding models as 'Locators' to improve GUI grounding performance, achieving 35.7% accuracy on ScreenSpot-Pro dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI grounding requires understanding diverse UI elements across applications while accurately predicting spatial coordinates, which is challenging for single models.

Method: A synergistic framework with five stages: general VLM acts as Scanner to identify regions of interest, while fine-tuned grounding model serves as Locator for precise coordinate prediction, inspired by human visual processing.

Result: Integration achieves 35.7% accuracy on ScreenSpot-Pro dataset, representing 10x improvement over individual models (Scanner: 2.0%, Locator: 3.7%) and outperforms other baselines.

Conclusion: GMS demonstrates robust performance for general-purpose GUI grounding by leveraging complementary strengths of general and specialized models through hierarchical search and cross-modal communication.

Abstract: Grounding natural language queries in graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
presents a challenging task that requires models to comprehend diverse UI
elements across various applications and systems, while also accurately
predicting the spatial coordinates for the intended operation. To tackle this
problem, we propose GMS: Generalist Scanner Meets Specialist Locator, a
synergistic coarse-to-fine framework that effectively improves GUI grounding
performance. GMS leverages the complementary strengths of general
vision-language models (VLMs) and small, task-specific GUI grounding models by
assigning them distinct roles within the framework. Specifically, the general
VLM acts as a 'Scanner' to identify potential regions of interest, while the
fine-tuned grounding model serves as a 'Locator' that outputs precise
coordinates within these regions. This design is inspired by how humans perform
GUI grounding, where the eyes scan the interface and the brain focuses on
interpretation and localization. Our whole framework consists of five stages
and incorporates hierarchical search with cross-modal communication to achieve
promising prediction results. Experimental results on the ScreenSpot-Pro
dataset show that while the 'Scanner' and 'Locator' models achieve only $2.0\%$
and $3.7\%$ accuracy respectively when used independently, their integration
within GMS framework yields an overall accuracy of $35.7\%$, representing a $10
\times$ improvement. Additionally, GMS significantly outperforms other strong
baselines under various settings, demonstrating its robustness and potential
for general-purpose GUI grounding.

Conclusion: EYE-DEX provides automated, accurate retinal disease diagnosis with enhanced transparency through visual explanations, fostering clinician trust in AI-assisted diagnostics.

Abstract: Retinal disease diagnosis is critical in preventing vision loss and reducing
socioeconomic burdens. Globally, over 2.2 billion people are affected by some
form of vision impairment, resulting in annual productivity losses estimated at
$411 billion. Traditional manual grading of retinal fundus images by
ophthalmologists is time-consuming and subjective. In contrast, deep learning
has revolutionized medical diagnostics by automating retinal image analysis and
achieving expert-level performance. In this study, we present EYE-DEX, an
automated framework for classifying 10 retinal conditions using the large-scale
Retinal Disease Dataset comprising 21,577 eye fundus images. We benchmark three
pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models--VGG16, VGG19, and
ResNet50--with our finetuned VGG16 achieving a state-of-the-art global
benchmark test accuracy of 92.36%. To enhance transparency and explainability,
we integrate the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM)
technique to generate visual explanations highlighting disease-specific
regions, thereby fostering clinician trust and reliability in AI-assisted
diagnostics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI facial beauty prediction models trained on SCUT-FBP5500 and MEBeauty datasets exhibit significant ethnic bias, with only 4.8-9.5% of inter-group comparisons meeting distributional parity criteria, highlighting algorithmic amplification of societal beauty biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and quantify ethnic bias in AI facial beauty prediction systems, warning about AI's role in shaping aesthetic norms while exploring pathways toward equitable beauty technologies.

Method: Comparative analysis of models trained on SCUT-FBP5500 and MEBeauty datasets using rigorous statistical validation (Kruskal-Wallis H-tests, post hoc Dunn analyses) and cross-dataset validation on the balanced FairFace dataset.

Result: Both models showed significant prediction disparities across ethnic groups (p < 0.001), even on balanced datasets, with algorithmic amplification rather than mitigation of societal beauty biases. Only 4.8-9.5% of inter-group comparisons satisfied distributional parity criteria.

Conclusion: Current AI beauty prediction approaches are inadequate and amplify existing societal biases. The findings underscore the need for bias mitigation strategies in AI beauty technologies.

Abstract: Bias can be introduced to AI systems even from seemingly balanced sources,
and AI facial beauty prediction is subject to ethnicity-based bias. This work
sounds warnings about AI's role in shaping aesthetic norms while providing
potential pathways toward equitable beauty technologies through comparative
analysis of models trained on SCUT-FBP5500 and MEBeauty datasets. Employing
rigorous statistical validation (Kruskal-Wallis H-tests, post hoc Dunn
analyses). It is demonstrated that both models exhibit significant prediction
disparities across ethnic groups $(p < 0.001)$, even when evaluated on the
balanced FairFace dataset. Cross-dataset validation shows algorithmic
amplification of societal beauty biases rather than mitigation based on
prediction and error parity. The findings underscore the inadequacy of current
AI beauty prediction approaches, with only 4.8-9.5\% of inter-group comparisons
satisfying distributional parity criteria. Mitigation strategies are proposed
and discussed in detail.

Motivation: While recent diffusion-based VSR models have reduced sampling steps to one, there's still significant room for improving inference efficiency. Current models remain computationally expensive despite single-step sampling.

Method: Proposes FastVSR with f16 VAE (16x spatial compression), uses pixel shuffle and channel replication for upsampling, and implements a lower-bound-guided training strategy with simpler training objectives for stability.

Result: Achieves 111.9x speedup compared to multi-step diffusion models and 3.92x speedup compared to existing one-step diffusion models while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: FastVSR demonstrates that substantial computational efficiency improvements are possible in diffusion-based video super-resolution through architectural optimizations and stable training strategies, making real-time applications more feasible.

Abstract: Diffusion models have significant advantages in the field of real-world video
super-resolution and have demonstrated strong performance in past research. In
recent diffusion-based video super-resolution (VSR) models, the number of
sampling steps has been reduced to just one, yet there remains significant room
for further optimization in inference efficiency. In this paper, we propose
FastVSR, which achieves substantial reductions in computational cost by
implementing a high compression VAE (spatial compression ratio of 16, denoted
as f16). We design the structure of the f16 VAE and introduce a stable training
framework. We employ pixel shuffle and channel replication to achieve
additional upsampling. Furthermore, we propose a lower-bound-guided training
strategy, which introduces a simpler training objective as a lower bound for
the VAE's performance. It makes the training process more stable and easier to
converge. Experimental results show that FastVSR achieves speedups of 111.9
times compared to multi-step models and 3.92 times compared to existing
one-step models. We will release code and models at

TL;DR: LatXGen is a generative framework that synthesizes lateral spinal radiographs from posterior RGBD images, enabling radiation-free sagittal alignment assessment for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate sagittal alignment assessment for AIS without ionizing radiation remains underexplored, while existing methods focus mainly on coronal plane evaluation.

Method: Dual-stage architecture with attention-based FFC module for anatomical feature integration and Spatial Deformation Network for modeling lateral morphological variations, trained on 3,264 paired RGBD-radiograph dataset.

Result: LatXGen produces anatomically accurate radiographs and outperforms existing GAN-based methods in both visual fidelity and quantitative metrics.

Conclusion: The framework offers a promising radiation-free solution for sagittal spine assessment and advances comprehensive AIS evaluation.

Abstract: Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a complex three-dimensional spinal
deformity, and accurate morphological assessment requires evaluating both
coronal and sagittal alignment. While previous research has made significant
progress in developing radiation-free methods for coronal plane assessment,
reliable and accurate evaluation of sagittal alignment without ionizing
radiation remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose
LatXGen, a novel generative framework that synthesizes realistic lateral spinal
radiographs from posterior Red-Green-Blue and Depth (RGBD) images of unclothed
backs. This enables accurate, radiation-free estimation of sagittal spinal
alignment. LatXGen tackles two core challenges: (1) inferring sagittal spinal
morphology changes from a lateral perspective based on posteroanterior surface
geometry, and (2) performing cross-modality translation from RGBD input to the
radiographic domain. The framework adopts a dual-stage architecture that
progressively estimates lateral spinal structure and synthesizes corresponding
radiographs. To enhance anatomical consistency, we introduce an attention-based
Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) module for integrating anatomical features from
RGBD images and 3D landmarks, and a Spatial Deformation Network (SDN) to model
morphological variations in the lateral view. Additionally, we construct the
first large-scale paired dataset for this task, comprising 3,264 RGBD and
lateral radiograph pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that LatXGen
produces anatomically accurate radiographs and outperforms existing GAN-based
methods in both visual fidelity and quantitative metrics. This study offers a
promising, radiation-free solution for sagittal spine assessment and advances
comprehensive AIS evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image analysis faces data sharing challenges due to privacy regulations. Existing trajectory matching methods focus only on terminal states, missing important intermediate optimization information.

Method: Uses shape-wise potential to capture geometric structure of parameter trajectories and easy-to-complex matching strategy that progressively addresses parameters based on complexity.

Result: Experiments on medical image classification show improved distillation performance while preserving privacy and maintaining model accuracy comparable to training on original datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses limitations of existing trajectory matching approaches by capturing intermediate optimization states, enabling better dataset distillation for medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Medical image analysis faces significant challenges in data sharing due to
privacy regulations and complex institutional protocols. Dataset distillation
offers a solution to address these challenges by synthesizing compact datasets
that capture essential information from real, large medical datasets.
Trajectory matching has emerged as a promising methodology for dataset
distillation; however, existing methods primarily focus on terminal states,
overlooking crucial information in intermediate optimization states. We address
this limitation by proposing a shape-wise potential that captures the geometric
structure of parameter trajectories, and an easy-to-complex matching strategy
that progressively addresses parameters based on their complexity. Experiments

distillation performance while preserving privacy and maintaining model
accuracy comparable to training on the original datasets. Our code is available

### [219] [Combining Discrepancy-Confusion Uncertainty and Calibration Diversity for Active Fine-Grained Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24181)
*Yinghao Jin,Xi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DECERN is a novel active learning method for fine-grained image classification that combines discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity to select the most informative samples under limited annotation budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In fine-grained image classification, assessing sample informativeness is challenging due to subtle inter-class differences, making traditional active learning methods less effective.

Method: DECERN introduces a multifaceted informativeness measure combining discrepancy-confusion uncertainty (quantifying category directionality and structural stability) and calibration diversity (uncertainty-weighted clustering to diversify samples while maintaining local representativeness).

Result: Extensive experiments on 7 fine-grained image datasets across 26 experimental settings demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DECERN method effectively addresses the challenges of active learning in fine-grained image classification by combining uncertainty and diversity measures to select highly informative samples.

Abstract: Active learning (AL) aims to build high-quality labeled datasets by
iteratively selecting the most informative samples from an unlabeled pool under
limited annotation budgets. However, in fine-grained image classification,
assessing this informativeness is especially challenging due to subtle
inter-class differences. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, combining
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity for active
fine-grained image classification (DECERN), to effectively perceive the
distinctiveness between fine-grained images and evaluate the sample value.
DECERN introduces a multifaceted informativeness measure that combines
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity. The
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty quantifies the category directionality and
structural stability of fine-grained unlabeled data during local feature
fusion. Subsequently, uncertainty-weighted clustering is performed to diversify
the uncertainty samples. Then we calibrate the diversity to maximize the global
diversity of the selected sample while maintaining its local
representativeness. Extensive experiments conducted on 7 fine-grained image
datasets across 26 distinct experimental settings demonstrate that our method
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A tumor-generation model that uses radiomics features as conditions to generate diverse 3D medical images (CT/MRI) with user-specified tumor characteristics, enabling tumor manipulation and aiding in medical training and treatment planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns and data scarcity in 3D medical imaging (CT/MRI) by overcoming limitations in output diversity of existing generative models.

Method: GAN-based model for tumor mask generation and diffusion-based approach for tumor texture generation, both conditioned on radiomics features (size, shape, texture).

Result: Successfully generated diverse tumor images in four organs (kidney, lung, breast, brain) across CT and MRI modalities, validated through expert evaluations and shown to aid downstream task training.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables flexible tumor generation and manipulation, has potential for treatment planning, and addresses data scarcity in medical imaging through radiomics-conditioned generation.

Abstract: Due to privacy concerns, obtaining large datasets is challenging in medical
image analysis, especially with 3D modalities like Computed Tomography (CT) and
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Existing generative models, developed to
address this issue, often face limitations in output diversity and thus cannot
accurately represent 3D medical images. We propose a tumor-generation model
that utilizes radiomics features as generative conditions. Radiomics features
are high-dimensional handcrafted semantic features that are biologically
well-grounded and thus are good candidates for conditioning. Our model employs
a GAN-based model to generate tumor masks and a diffusion-based approach to
generate tumor texture conditioned on radiomics features. Our method allows the
user to generate tumor images according to user-specified radiomics features
such as size, shape, and texture at an arbitrary location. This enables the
physicians to easily visualize tumor images to better understand tumors
according to changing radiomics features. Our approach allows for the removal,
manipulation, and repositioning of tumors, generating various tumor types in
different scenarios. The model has been tested on tumors in four different
organs (kidney, lung, breast, and brain) across CT and MRI. The synthesized
images are shown to effectively aid in training for downstream tasks and their
authenticity was also evaluated through expert evaluations. Our method has
potential usage in treatment planning with diverse synthesized tumors.

*Sojung An,Kwanyong Park,Yong Jae Lee,Donghyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes TaSe framework to improve vision-language models' ability to handle complex queries with descriptive attributes and relational clauses by disentangling text into objects, attributes, and relations, then hierarchically aggregating them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with complex queries involving descriptive attributes and relational clauses due to text encoders treating text as bags-of-words, failing to separate target objects from their attributes and relations.

Method: TaSe framework with three components: (1) hierarchical synthetic captioning dataset, (2) Talk in Pieces module for disentangling text into objects/attributes/relations using novel loss function, (3) See in Whole for hierarchical aggregation of components.

Result: 24% performance improvement on OmniLabel benchmark, demonstrating significant enhancement in handling complex linguistic queries.

Conclusion: Linguistic compositionality through hierarchical structure disentanglement and aggregation is crucial for improving VLMs' fine-grained multimodal representations in language-based object detection.

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in
multimodal perception (e.g., open-vocabulary object detection) with simple
language queries, state-of-the-art VLMs still show limited ability to perceive
complex queries involving descriptive attributes and relational clauses. Our
in-depth analysis shows that these limitations mainly stem from text encoders
in VLMs. Such text encoders behave like bags-of-words and fail to separate
target objects from their descriptive attributes and relations in complex
queries, resulting in frequent false positives. To address this, we propose
restructuring linguistic representations according to the hierarchical
relations within sentences for language-based object detection. A key insight
is the necessity of disentangling textual tokens into core components-objects,
attributes, and relations ("talk in pieces")-and subsequently aggregating them
into hierarchically structured sentence-level representations ("see in whole").
Building on this principle, we introduce the TaSe framework with three main
contributions: (1) a hierarchical synthetic captioning dataset spanning three
tiers from category names to descriptive sentences; (2) Talk in Pieces, the
three-component disentanglement module guided by a novel disentanglement loss
function, transforms text embeddings into subspace compositions; and (3) See in
Whole, which learns to aggregate disentangled components into hierarchically
structured embeddings with the guide of proposed hierarchical objectives. The
proposed TaSe framework strengthens the inductive bias of hierarchical
linguistic structures, resulting in fine-grained multimodal representations for
language-based object detection. Experimental results under the OmniLabel
benchmark show a 24% performance improvement, demonstrating the importance of
linguistic compositionality.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a diffusion model with prompt tuning to predict post-treatment breast cancer MRI images from pre-treatment scans, aiming to improve neoadjuvant chemotherapy response prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of NAC response is crucial for breast cancer treatment planning, and current methods using DCE-MRI need improvement for better precision medicine.

Method: Uses maximum intensity projection images from DCE-MRI and adopts diffusion models with prompt tuning to incorporate clinical factors affecting NAC response, generating post-treatment images from pre-treatment ones.

Result: The model outperformed other generative models in image quality metrics and better reflected tumor size changes according to pathological complete response (pCR). Ablation studies validated the method's design choices.

Conclusion: The proposed approach has potential to advance precision medicine by improving NAC response prediction through advanced image generation techniques.

Abstract: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is a common therapy option before the main
surgery for breast cancer. Response to NAC is monitored using follow-up dynamic
contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Accurate prediction of
NAC response helps with treatment planning. Here, we adopt maximum intensity
projection images from DCE-MRI to generate post-treatment images (i.e., 3 or 12
weeks after NAC) from pre-treatment images leveraging the emerging diffusion
model. We introduce prompt tuning to account for the known clinical factors
affecting response to NAC. Our model performed better than other generative
models in image quality metrics. Our model was better at generating images that
reflected changes in tumor size according to pCR compared to other models.
Ablation study confirmed the design choices of our method. Our study has the
potential to help with precision medicine.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BALR-SAM is a boundary-aware low-rank adaptation framework that enhances SAM for medical image segmentation by combining complementary detail enhancement, low-rank adapters, and efficient attention mechanisms, achieving state-of-the-art performance while updating only 1.8% of parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision foundation models like SAM struggle with medical image segmentation due to lack of domain-specific adaptation, and there's a need for efficient fine-tuning methods that maintain strong performance with minimal resource demands in clinical practice.

Method: Combines three components: (1) Complementary Detail Enhancement Network using depthwise separable convolutions and multi-scale fusion for boundary-sensitive features; (2) low-rank adapters in Vision Transformer blocks to optimize medical feature representation; (3) low-rank tensor attention mechanism in mask decoder reducing memory usage by 75%.

Result: Outperforms several state-of-the-art methods including fully fine-tuned MedSAM on standard medical segmentation datasets, while updating only 1.8% (11.7M) of parameters and operating without requiring prompts.

Conclusion: BALR-SAM provides an efficient and effective adaptation framework for medical image segmentation that achieves superior performance with minimal parameter updates, making it highly suitable for clinical applications with resource constraints.

Abstract: Vision foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), pretrained on
large-scale natural image datasets, often struggle in medical image
segmentation due to a lack of domain-specific adaptation. In clinical practice,
fine-tuning such models efficiently for medical downstream tasks with minimal
resource demands, while maintaining strong performance, is challenging. To
address these issues, we propose BALR-SAM, a boundary-aware low-rank adaptation
framework that enhances SAM for medical imaging. It combines three tailored
components: (1) a Complementary Detail Enhancement Network (CDEN) using
depthwise separable convolutions and multi-scale fusion to capture
boundary-sensitive features essential for accurate segmentation; (2) low-rank
adapters integrated into SAM's Vision Transformer blocks to optimize feature
representation and attention for medical contexts, while simultaneously
significantly reducing the parameter space; and (3) a low-rank tensor attention
mechanism in the mask decoder, cutting memory usage by 75% and boosting
inference speed. Experiments on standard medical segmentation datasets show
that BALR-SAM, without requiring prompts, outperforms several state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods, including fully fine-tuned MedSAM, while updating just 1.8%
(11.7M) of its parameters.

*Zach Eidex,Mojtaba Safari,Jie Ding,Richard Qiu,Justin Roper,David Yu,Hui-Kuo Shu,Zhen Tian,Hui Mao,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes T1C-RFlow, a 3D deep learning framework that generates T1-contrast enhanced MRI images from pre-contrast multiparametric MRI using latent rectified flow diffusion, eliminating the need for gadolinium-based contrast agents while achieving high-quality results faster than conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) used in T1w MRI pose risks for patients with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and can introduce imaging inconsistencies due to administration variations. There's a need for a contrast-agent-free alternative that maintains image quality.

Method: The T1C-RFlow model uses pre-contrast T1w and T2-FLAIR images as input to a pretrained autoencoder for latent space representation, then trains a rectified flow diffusion model in this latent space. The model was trained on a large curated dataset of brain tumors (glioma, meningioma, metastases) with 2860 training, 612 validation, and 614 test patients.

Result: T1C-RFlow outperformed benchmark 3D models (pix2pix, DDPM, DiT-3D) with superior metrics: GLI (NMSE 0.044, SSIM 0.935), MEN (NMSE 0.046, SSIM 0.937), MET (NMSE 0.098, SSIM 0.905). It achieved significantly faster denoising times (6.9s/volume) compared to conventional DDPM models (37.7s in latent space, 4.3hr/volume in image space).

Conclusion: The proposed method generates synthetic T1C images that closely resemble ground truth T1C images in much less time than previous diffusion models, potentially enabling practical contrast-agent-free MRI for brain tumors.

Abstract: Objective: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are commonly employed
with T1w MRI to enhance lesion visualization but are restricted in patients at
risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and variations in GBCA administration can
introduce imaging inconsistencies. This study develops an efficient 3D
deep-learning framework to generate T1-contrast enhanced images (T1C) from
pre-contrast multiparametric MRI. Approach: We propose the 3D latent rectified
flow (T1C-RFlow) model for generating high-quality T1C images. First, T1w and
T2-FLAIR images are input into a pretrained autoencoder to acquire an efficient
latent space representation. A rectified flow diffusion model is then trained
in this latent space representation. The T1C-RFlow model was trained on a
curated dataset comprised of the BraTS 2024 glioma (GLI; 1480 patients),
meningioma (MEN; 1141 patients), and metastases (MET; 1475 patients) datasets.
Selected patients were split into train (N=2860), validation (N=612), and test
(N=614) sets. Results: Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate
that the T1C-RFlow model outperforms benchmark 3D models (pix2pix, DDPM,
Diffusion Transformers (DiT-3D)) trained in the same latent space. T1C-RFlow
achieved the following metrics - GLI: NMSE 0.044 +/- 0.047, SSIM 0.935 +/-
0.025; MEN: NMSE 0.046 +/- 0.029, SSIM 0.937 +/- 0.021; MET: NMSE 0.098 +/-
0.088, SSIM 0.905 +/- 0.082. T1C-RFlow had the best tumor reconstruction
performance and significantly faster denoising times (6.9 s/volume, 200 steps)
than conventional DDPM models in both latent space (37.7s, 1000 steps) and
patch-based in image space (4.3 hr/volume). Significance: Our proposed method
generates synthetic T1C images that closely resemble ground truth T1C in much
less time than previous diffusion models. Further development may permit a
practical method for contrast-agent-free MRI for brain tumors.

lightweight adapter, enabling both video understanding and generation. We
introduce Temperature Modality Alignment to improve prompt adherence and
Pyramid Reflection for efficient temporal reasoning via dynamic keyframe
selection. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 2.2% improvement on VBench-Long total
score compared to EasyAnimateV5.1, and 1.0% and 3.3% accuracy gains on MSVD-QA

In this work, we introduce a cycle training framework to fine-tune diffusion
models for improved conditioning adherence and enhanced synthetic image
realism. Our approach, Cycle Diffusion Model (CDM), enforces consistency
between generated and original images by incorporating cycle constraints,
enabling more reliable direct and counterfactual generation. Experiments on a
combined 3D brain MRI dataset (from ABCD, HCP aging & young adults, ADNI, and
PPMI) show that our method improves conditioning accuracy and enhances image
quality as measured by FID and SSIM. The results suggest that the cycle
strategy used in CDM can be an effective method for refining diffusion-based
medical image generation, with applications in data augmentation,
counterfactual, and disease progression modeling.

### [227] [Dynamic Orchestration of Multi-Agent System for Real-World Multi-Image Agricultural VQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24350)
*Yan Ke,Xin Yu,Heming Du,Scott Chapman,Helen Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a self-reflective multi-agent framework for agricultural visual question answering that handles multi-image inputs and incomplete evidence through collaborative roles for retrieval, reflection, answering, and improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agricultural VQA approaches are limited to text-only queries or single images, failing to handle real-world scenarios requiring multi-image inputs across spatial scales and growth stages, and struggle with incomplete evidence due to limited external context access.

Method: A four-agent framework with Retriever (formulates queries and gathers external info), Reflector (assesses adequacy and triggers reformulation), Answerer (drafts candidate responses in parallel), and Improver (refines answers through iterative checks while aligning multi-image information).

Result: Experiments on AgMMU benchmark show competitive performance on multi-image agricultural QA.

Conclusion: The proposed self-reflective multi-agent framework effectively addresses limitations of existing approaches by enabling context enrichment, reflective reasoning, and iterative improvement for real-world agricultural scenarios.

Abstract: Agricultural visual question answering is essential for providing farmers and
researchers with accurate and timely knowledge. However, many existing
approaches are predominantly developed for evidence-constrained settings such
as text-only queries or single-image cases. This design prevents them from
coping with real-world agricultural scenarios that often require multi-image
inputs with complementary views across spatial scales, and growth stages.
Moreover, limited access to up-to-date external agricultural context makes
these systems struggle to adapt when evidence is incomplete. In addition, rigid
pipelines often lack systematic quality control. To address this gap, we
propose a self-reflective and self-improving multi-agent framework that
integrates four roles, the Retriever, the Reflector, the Answerer, and the
Improver. They collaborate to enable context enrichment, reflective reasoning,
answer drafting, and iterative improvement.
  A Retriever formulates queries and gathers external information, while a
Reflector assesses adequacy and triggers sequential reformulation and renewed
retrieval. Two Answerers draft candidate responses in parallel to reduce bias.
The Improver refines them through iterative checks while ensuring that
information from multiple images is effectively aligned and utilized.
Experiments on the AgMMU benchmark show that our framework achieves competitive
performance on multi-image agricultural QA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Forge4D is a feed-forward 4D human reconstruction model that efficiently reconstructs dynamic 3D humans from uncalibrated sparse-view videos, enabling both novel view and novel time synthesis through streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction and dense motion prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for dynamic 3D human reconstruction are either too slow or cannot generate novel-time representations, limiting their practical applications.

Method: Joint task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction (using learnable state tokens for temporal consistency) and dense motion prediction (with occlusion-aware Gaussian fusion and self-supervised retargeting loss).

Result: Effective reconstruction of temporally aligned 4D human representations from uncalibrated sparse-view videos, demonstrated through extensive experiments on in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.

Conclusion: Forge4D successfully addresses the challenges of slow reconstruction speeds and inability to generate novel-time representations in dynamic 3D human reconstruction.

Abstract: Instant reconstruction of dynamic 3D humans from uncalibrated sparse-view
videos is critical for numerous downstream applications. Existing methods,
however, are either limited by the slow reconstruction speeds or incapable of
generating novel-time representations. To address these challenges, we propose
Forge4D, a feed-forward 4D human reconstruction and interpolation model that
efficiently reconstructs temporally aligned representations from uncalibrated
sparse-view videos, enabling both novel view and novel time synthesis. Our
model simplifies the 4D reconstruction and interpolation problem as a joint
task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction and dense motion prediction. For
the task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction, we first reconstruct static
3D Gaussians from uncalibrated sparse-view images and then introduce learnable
state tokens to enforce temporal consistency in a memory-friendly manner by
interactively updating shared information across different timestamps. For
novel time synthesis, we design a novel motion prediction module to predict
dense motions for each 3D Gaussian between two adjacent frames, coupled with an
occlusion-aware Gaussian fusion process to interpolate 3D Gaussians at
arbitrary timestamps. To overcome the lack of the ground truth for dense motion
supervision, we formulate dense motion prediction as a dense point matching
task and introduce a self-supervised retargeting loss to optimize this module.
An additional occlusion-aware optical flow loss is introduced to ensure motion
consistency with plausible human movement, providing stronger regularization.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Project page and code at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LamFormer is a novel U-shaped network for multi-organ medical image segmentation that uses Linear Attention Mamba (LAM) to capture long-range dependencies efficiently, Parallel Hierarchical Feature Aggregation (PHFA) to aggregate multi-scale features, and Reduced Transformer (RT) to enhance local detail extraction while maintaining computational efficiency.

Method: Proposes LamFormer with three key components: 1) Linear Attention Mamba (LAM) in an enhanced pyramid encoder for multi-scale long-range dependencies, 2) Parallel Hierarchical Feature Aggregation (PHFA) module to aggregate features from different encoder layers while filtering information, and 3) Reduced Transformer (RT) that uses distinct computational approach to globally model up-sampled features.

Result: Outperforms existing segmentation methods on seven complex and diverse datasets, demonstrating exceptional performance while achieving a balance between model performance and model complexity.

Conclusion: LamFormer successfully addresses the computational limitations of Transformers while improving local detail extraction, making it an effective solution for fine-grained multi-organ medical image segmentation tasks.

Abstract: In the field of multi-organ medical image segmentation, recent methods
frequently employ Transformers to capture long-range dependencies from image
features. However, these methods overlook the high computational cost of
Transformers and their deficiencies in extracting local detailed information.
To address high computational costs and inadequate local detail information, we
reassess the design of feature extraction modules and propose a new
deep-learning network called LamFormer for fine-grained segmentation tasks
across multiple organs. LamFormer is a novel U-shaped network that employs
Linear Attention Mamba (LAM) in an enhanced pyramid encoder to capture
multi-scale long-range dependencies. We construct the Parallel Hierarchical
Feature Aggregation (PHFA) module to aggregate features from different layers
of the encoder, narrowing the semantic gap among features while filtering
information. Finally, we design the Reduced Transformer (RT), which utilizes a
distinct computational approach to globally model up-sampled features. RRT
enhances the extraction of detailed local information and improves the
network's capability to capture long-range dependencies. LamFormer outperforms
existing segmentation methods on seven complex and diverse datasets,
demonstrating exceptional performance. Moreover, the proposed network achieves
a balance between model performance and model complexity.

TL;DR: AVF-MAE++ is a family of audio-visual masked autoencoder models that addresses scaling challenges in affective video facial analysis through dual masking, enhanced modality encoders, and iterative correlation learning, achieving SOTA performance across 17 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Affective video facial analysis suffers from limited data availability and unexplored scaling properties, with challenges in capturing intra- and inter-modal correlations through scalable audio-visual representations.

Method: Proposes AVF-MAE++ with dual masking strategy across modalities, strengthened modality encoders, Iterative Audio-Visual Correlation Learning Module, and progressive semantic injection strategy organized into three training stages.

Result: Achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across 17 datasets covering three major AVFA tasks, with comprehensive ablation studies validating each component's importance.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses scaling challenges in AVFA while enhancing cross-modal correlation modeling, providing deeper insights into design choices for improved performance.

Abstract: Affective video facial analysis (AVFA) has emerged as a key research field
for building emotion-aware intelligent systems, yet this field continues to
suffer from limited data availability. In recent years, the self-supervised
learning (SSL) technique of Masked Autoencoders (MAE) has gained momentum, with
growing adaptations in its audio-visual contexts. While scaling has proven
essential for breakthroughs in general multi-modal learning domains, its
specific impact on AVFA remains largely unexplored. Another core challenge in
this field is capturing both intra- and inter-modal correlations through
scalable audio-visual representations. To tackle these issues, we propose
AVF-MAE++, a family of audio-visual MAE models designed to efficiently
investigate the scaling properties in AVFA while enhancing cross-modal
correlation modeling. Our framework introduces a novel dual masking strategy
across audio and visual modalities and strengthens modality encoders with a
more holistic design to better support scalable pre-training. Additionally, we
present the Iterative Audio-Visual Correlation Learning Module, which improves
correlation learning within the SSL paradigm, bridging the limitations of
previous methods. To support smooth adaptation and reduce overfitting risks, we
further introduce a progressive semantic injection strategy, organizing the
model training into three structured stages. Extensive experiments conducted on
17 datasets, covering three major AVFA tasks, demonstrate that AVF-MAE++
achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.
Comprehensive ablation studies further highlight the importance of each
proposed component and provide deeper insights into the design choices driving
these improvements. Our code and models have been publicly released at Github.

Motivation: MLLMs face challenges in domain-specific UI tasks, particularly in understanding accuracy and generation quality for modern complex UIs.

Method: Uses SFT with GRPO for understanding tasks, DPO for generation tasks, and proposes an industrial workflow with LLM-friendly DSL, training strategies, rendering processes, and evaluation metrics.

Result: Achieves SOTA on understanding tasks, outperforming larger general-purpose MLLMs and similarly-sized UI-specialized models. Matches larger MLLMs in UI generation at fraction of computational cost.

Conclusion: Integrating understanding and generation tasks improves accuracy and quality for both tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the unified approach.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been widely applied
across domains, they are still facing challenges in domain-specific tasks, such
as User Interface (UI) understanding accuracy and UI generation quality. In
this paper, we introduce UI-UG (a unified MLLM for UI Understanding and
Generation), integrating both capabilities. For understanding tasks, we employ
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) combined with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to enhance fine-grained understanding on the modern complex UI data. For
generation tasks, we further use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to make
our model generate human-preferred UIs. In addition, we propose an industrially
effective workflow, including the design of an LLM-friendly domain-specific
language (DSL), training strategies, rendering processes, and evaluation
metrics. In experiments, our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
on understanding tasks, outperforming both larger general-purpose MLLMs and
similarly-sized UI-specialized models. Our model is also on par with these
larger MLLMs in UI generation performance at a fraction of the computational
cost. We also demonstrate that integrating understanding and generation tasks
can improve accuracy and quality for both tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni-X is a novel multimodal architecture that addresses gradient conflicts between vision and text in shared transformers by using modality-specific initial/final layers with shared middle layers, achieving superior efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shared autoregressive transformers in unified multimodal models suffer from severe gradient conflicts between vision and text due to their fundamentally different low-level statistical properties, particularly in shallow and deep layers.

Method: Proposes Uni-X, a two-end-separated, middle-shared architecture with modality-specific processing in initial and final layers, and shared parameters in middle layers for high-level semantic fusion.

Result: Uni-X achieves superior training efficiency and, when scaled to 3B parameters, matches or surpasses 7B AR-based UMMs with GenEval score of 82 for image generation and strong performance in text/vision understanding tasks.

Conclusion: Uni-X establishes a parameter-efficient and scalable foundation for future unified multimodal modeling by effectively eliminating gradient conflicts while maintaining strong multimodal performance.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) built on shared autoregressive (AR)
transformers are attractive for their architectural simplicity. However, we
identify a critical limitation: when trained on multimodal inputs,
modality-shared transformers suffer from severe gradient conflicts between
vision and text, particularly in shallow and deep layers. We trace this issue
to the fundamentally different low-level statistical properties of images and
text, while noting that conflicts diminish in middle layers where
representations become more abstract and semantically aligned. To overcome this
challenge, we propose Uni-X, a two-end-separated, middle-shared architecture.
Uni-X dedicates its initial and final layers to modality-specific processing,
while maintaining shared parameters in the middle layers for high-level
semantic fusion. This X-shaped design not only eliminates gradient conflicts at
both ends but also further alleviates residual conflicts in the shared layers.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Uni-X. Under identical
training conditions, Uni-X achieves superior training efficiency compared to
strong baselines. When scaled to 3B parameters with larger training data, Uni-X
matches or surpasses 7B AR-based UMMs, achieving a GenEval score of 82 for
image generation alongside strong performance in text and vision understanding
tasks. These results establish Uni-X as a parameter-efficient and scalable
foundation for future unified multimodal modeling. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid framework combining diffusion models and conditional GANs generates geographically consistent street-view images from satellite imagery, outperforming diffusion-only methods and achieving competitive results with state-of-the-art GAN approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Street view imagery is crucial for urban analytics but synthesizing it from satellite imagery is challenging due to significant appearance and perspective differences between the two domains.

Method: Multi-stage training strategy using Stable Diffusion as core component in dual-branch architecture, integrated with conditional GAN for panoramic street views, plus fusion strategy to leverage both models' strengths for improved geometric consistency and visual quality.

Result: Outperforms diffusion-only methods across multiple metrics on CVUSA dataset, achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art GAN methods, generates realistic street-view images preserving fine details like street markings, roads, and atmospheric elements.

Conclusion: The hybrid diffusion-GAN framework successfully addresses cross-view synthesis challenges, generating geographically consistent street-view images with high visual quality and preserved local details.

Abstract: Street view imagery has become an essential source for geospatial data
collection and urban analytics, enabling the extraction of valuable insights
that support informed decision-making. However, synthesizing street-view images
from corresponding satellite imagery presents significant challenges due to
substantial differences in appearance and viewing perspective between these two
domains. This paper presents a hybrid framework that integrates diffusion-based
models and conditional generative adversarial networks to generate
geographically consistent street-view images from satellite imagery. Our
approach uses a multi-stage training strategy that incorporates Stable
Diffusion as the core component within a dual-branch architecture. To enhance
the framework's capabilities, we integrate a conditional Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) that enables the generation of geographically consistent
panoramic street views. Furthermore, we implement a fusion strategy that
leverages the strengths of both models to create robust representations,
thereby improving the geometric consistency and visual quality of the generated
street-view images. The proposed framework is evaluated on the challenging
Cross-View USA (CVUSA) dataset, a standard benchmark for cross-view image
synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid approach
outperforms diffusion-only methods across multiple evaluation metrics and
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art GAN-based
methods. The framework successfully generates realistic and geometrically
consistent street-view images while preserving fine-grained local details,
including street markings, secondary roads, and atmospheric elements such as

TL;DR: Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR) enables autoregressive reasoning directly in visual embedding space, achieving substantial gains on perception-intensive VQA tasks compared to traditional multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs with CoT reasoning are constrained by confining reasoning to language space and treating visual information as static preconditions, limiting their visual understanding capabilities.

Method: Projects images into visual tokens in joint semantic space, trains language model to generate latent states that reconstruct key visual tokens for answering queries, and adapts GRPO algorithm for reinforcement learning on latent reasoning.

Result: Achieves 71.67% on MMVP benchmark compared to 66.67% with Qwen2.5-VL, showing substantial improvements in fine-grained visual understanding and perception.

Conclusion: LVR paradigm enables more effective visual reasoning by operating directly in visual embedding space, significantly enhancing multimodal model performance on perception-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable gains in
various tasks by incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in language
spaces. Recent work extends this direction by leveraging external tools for
visual editing, thereby enhancing the visual signal along the reasoning
trajectories. Nevertheless, these approaches remain fundamentally constrained:
reasoning is still confined to the language space, with visual information
treated as static preconditions. We introduce Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR), a
new paradigm that enables autoregressive reasoning directly in the visual
embedding space. A visual encoder first projects images into visual tokens
within a joint semantic space shared with the language model. The language
model is then trained to generate latent states that reconstruct key visual
tokens critical for answering the query, constituting the process of latent
visual reasoning. By interleaving LVR with standard text generation, our model
achieves substantial gains on perception-intensive visual question answering
tasks. In addition, we adapt the GRPO algorithm to conduct reinforcement
learning on latent reasoning, further balancing LVR and textual generation. We
show that LVR substantially improves fine-grained visual understanding and
perception, achieving 71.67% on MMVP compared to 66.67% with Qwen2.5-VL. Code
base and model weights will be released later.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REALIGN is a self-supervised framework for procedure learning that uses Regularized Fused Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport to handle noisy procedural videos with background segments, repeated actions, and non-monotonic step orders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world instructional videos contain background segments, repeated actions, and steps presented out of order, which violate the strong monotonicity assumptions of existing alignment methods. Prior approaches like OPEL use Kantorovich Optimal Transport but fail to capture higher-order temporal structure.

Method: Uses Regularized Fused Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (R-FPGWOT) to jointly model visual correspondences and temporal relations under partial alignment. Integrates FPGWOT distances with inter-sequence contrastive learning to stabilize training without multiple regularizers.

Result: Achieves up to 18.9% average F1-score improvements and over 30% temporal IoU gains across egocentric (EgoProceL) and third-person (ProceL, CrossTask) benchmarks. Produces more interpretable transport maps that preserve key-step orderings and filter out noise.

Conclusion: REALIGN provides a robust framework for procedure learning that effectively handles the challenges of real-world instructional videos, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods while producing more interpretable results.

Abstract: Learning from procedural videos remains a core challenge in self-supervised
representation learning, as real-world instructional data often contains
background segments, repeated actions, and steps presented out of order. Such
variability violates the strong monotonicity assumptions underlying many
alignment methods. Prior state-of-the-art approaches, such as OPEL, leverage
Kantorovich Optimal Transport (KOT) to build frame-to-frame correspondences,
but rely solely on feature similarity and fail to capture the higher-order
temporal structure of a task. In this paper, we introduce REALIGN, a
self-supervised framework for procedure learning based on Regularized Fused
Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (R-FPGWOT). In contrast to KOT,
our formulation jointly models visual correspondences and temporal relations
under a partial alignment scheme, enabling robust handling of irrelevant
frames, repeated actions, and non-monotonic step orders common in instructional
videos. To stabilize training, we integrate FPGWOT distances with
inter-sequence contrastive learning, avoiding the need for multiple
regularizers and preventing collapse to degenerate solutions. Across egocentric
(EgoProceL) and third-person (ProceL, CrossTask) benchmarks, REALIGN achieves
up to 18.9% average F1-score improvements and over 30% temporal IoU gains,
while producing more interpretable transport maps that preserve key-step
orderings and filter out noise.

TL;DR: Proposes CoTAM, an image codec tailored for Multimodal Large Language Models that adaptively protects multi-level features to achieve up to 35.99% bitrate saving while maintaining MLLM task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional image codecs optimized for human visual system are ill-suited for MLLMs, which require efficient compression for diverse downstream tasks with minimal bandwidth usage from edge devices to cloud platforms.

Method: Leverages CLIP's shallow-layer attention to generate importance maps for bit allocation, preserving critical semantic regions. Integrates lightweight adapter with multi-level loss function for faithful reconstruction of both low-level details and high-level semantic context.

Result: Achieves up to 35.99% bitrate saving while maintaining same performance on MLLM tasks, outperforming previous state-of-the-art neural codecs.

Conclusion: CoTAM effectively addresses the unique compression requirements of MLLMs by adaptively protecting multi-level features based on their impact on downstream tasks.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), typically hosted on cloud platforms, urgently requires effective
compression techniques to efficiently transmit signal inputs (e.g., images,
videos) from edge devices with minimal bandwidth usage. However, conventional
image codecs are optimized for fidelity to serve the Human Visual System (HVS)
and ill-suited for MLLMs, in which diverse downstream tasks are jointly
considered. In this paper, we first systematically analyze the impact of
compression artifacts on several mainstream MLLMs. We find that: Compression
distortion unevenly impacts different-level image features, leading to varying
effects on MLLMs' downstream tasks depending on their feature-level reliance.
Motivated by this discovery, we propose an image Codec TAilored to MLLMs
(CoTAM) designed to adaptively protect multi-level features and suit different
demands of downstream tasks. The encoder leverages CLIP's shallow-layer
attention to generate an importance map for bit allocation, preserving critical
semantic regions. Concurrently, the decoder integrates a lightweight adapter
with a multi-level loss function to ensure the faithful reconstruction both of
low-level details and high-level semantic context for robust synthesis of
cross-level features. Extensive experiments validate that our method achieves
up to 35.99\% bitrate saving while maintaining the same performance on the MLLM
tasks, outperforming previous SOTA neural codecs.

TL;DR: Vid-LLM is a video-based 3D Multimodal Large Language Model that processes video inputs without requiring external 3D data, using geometric priors and a Cross-Task Adapter to achieve superior 3D scene understanding across multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending multimodal reasoning from 2D to 3D domains is challenging, and existing 3D-MLLMs depend on 3D data inputs which limits scalability and real-world deployment.

Method: Uses video inputs with geometric priors, Cross-Task Adapter module to align 3D geometric cues with vision-language representations, Metric Depth Model for geometric consistency, and two-stage distillation optimization for training.

Result: Extensive experiments show effectiveness on 3D Question Answering, 3D Dense Captioning, and 3D Visual Grounding tasks, demonstrating superior multi-task capabilities.

Conclusion: Vid-LLM provides a practical solution for 3D scene understanding without external 3D data, enabling scalable and generalizable 3D multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Recent developments in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved Vision-Language (VL) reasoning in 2D domains. However,
extending these capabilities to 3D scene understanding remains a major
challenge. Existing 3D Multimodal Large Language Models (3D-MLLMs) often depend
on 3D data inputs, which limits scalability and generalization. To address this
limitation, we propose Vid-LLM, a video-based 3D-MLLM that directly processes
video inputs without requiring external 3D data, making it practical for
real-world deployment. In our method, the geometric prior are directly used to
improve the performance of the sceen perception. To integrate the geometric
cues into the MLLM compactly, we design a Cross-Task Adapter (CTA) module to
align the 3D geometric priors with the vision-language representations. To
ensure geometric consistency and integrity, we introduce a Metric Depth Model
that recovers real-scale geometry from the reconstruction outputs. Finally, the
model is fine-tuned with a two-stage distillation optimization strategy,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S²NNs represent weights with less than one bit, achieving superior compression and efficiency for Spiking Neural Networks through outlier-aware quantization and membrane potential-based distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spiking Neural Networks offer energy efficiency but face scaling challenges for resource-limited deployment. Current binary SNNs still have substantial storage and computational demands, requiring further compression and acceleration.

Method: Proposed Sub-bit Spiking Neural Networks (S²NNs) with two key techniques: 1) Outlier-aware sub-bit weight quantization (OS-Quant) to mitigate codeword selection bias by identifying and scaling outliers, and 2) Membrane potential-based feature distillation (MPFD) for improved performance via precise teacher guidance.

Result: Extensive experiments on vision and non-vision tasks show S²NNs outperform existing quantized SNNs in both performance and efficiency, making them suitable for edge computing applications.

Conclusion: S²NNs successfully push the compression boundary of SNNs beyond binary representation, achieving less than one bit per weight while maintaining competitive performance, offering a promising solution for energy-efficient edge AI deployment.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer an energy-efficient paradigm for machine
intelligence, but their continued scaling poses challenges for resource-limited
deployment. Despite recent advances in binary SNNs, the storage and
computational demands remain substantial for large-scale networks. To further
explore the compression and acceleration potential of SNNs, we propose Sub-bit
Spiking Neural Networks (S$^2$NNs) that represent weights with less than one
bit. Specifically, we first establish an S$^2$NN baseline by leveraging the
clustering patterns of kernels in well-trained binary SNNs. This baseline is
highly efficient but suffers from \textit{outlier-induced codeword selection
bias} during training. To mitigate this issue, we propose an
\textit{outlier-aware sub-bit weight quantization} (OS-Quant) method, which
optimizes codeword selection by identifying and adaptively scaling outliers.
Furthermore, we propose a \textit{membrane potential-based feature
distillation} (MPFD) method, improving the performance of highly compressed
S$^2$NN via more precise guidance from a teacher model. Extensive results on
vision and non-vision tasks reveal that S$^2$NN outperforms existing quantized
SNNs in both performance and efficiency, making it promising for edge computing
applications.

### [240] [CLQ: Cross-Layer Guided Orthogonal-based Quantization for Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24416)
*Kai Liu,Shaoqiu Zhang,Linghe Kong,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLQ is a cross-layer guided orthogonal-based quantization method for diffusion transformers that achieves efficient W4A4 compression with minimal performance degradation through cross-block calibration, orthogonal-based smoothing, and cross-layer parameter searching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion transformers (DiTs) face practical deployment challenges on edge devices due to large model sizes and complexity, while existing post-training quantization methods cause significant performance degradation.

Method: Three key components: 1) Cross-block calibration (CBC) for accurate activation distribution representation, 2) Orthogonal-based smoothing (OBS) to handle outliers using block Hadamard matrix, 3) Cross-layer parameter searching (CLPS) for optimal quantization parameters.

Result: Successfully compresses DiT models to W4A4 format with negligible degradation in visual quality and metrics, achieving 3.98x memory saving and 3.95x speedup for both image and video generation models.

Conclusion: CLQ provides an effective solution for deploying diffusion transformers on resource-constrained devices while maintaining high visual generation quality through advanced quantization techniques.

Abstract: Visual generation quality has been greatly promoted with the rapid advances
in diffusion transformers (DiTs), which is attributed to the scaling of model
size and complexity. However, these attributions also hinder the practical
deployment of DiTs on edge devices, limiting their development and application.
Serve as an efficient model compression technique, model post-training
quantization (PTQ) can reduce the memory consumption and speed up the
inference, with inevitable performance degradation. To alleviate the
degradation, we propose CLQ, a cross-layer guided orthogonal-based quantization
method for DiTs. To be specific, CLQ consists of three key designs. First, we
observe that the calibration data used by most of the PTQ methods can not
honestly represent the distribution of the activations. Therefore, we propose
cross-block calibration (CBC) to obtain accurate calibration data, with which
the quantization can be better guided. Second, we propose orthogonal-based
smoothing (OBS), which quantifies the outlier score of each channel and
leverages block Hadamard matrix to smooth the outliers with negligible
overhead. Third, we propose cross-layer parameter searching (CLPS) to search.
We evaluate CLQ with both image generation and video generation models and
successfully compress the model into W4A4 with negligible degradation in visual
quality and metrics. CLQ achieves 3.98x memory saving and 3.95x speedup. Our
code is available at

*Pei-Han Chen,Szu-Chi Chung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops a systematic pipeline for assessing image dataset quality using enhanced versions of CleanVision and Fastdup tools, with automatic threshold selection that significantly improves detection of problematic images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As model architectures mature and gains from architectural refinements diminish, data quality has become critical for performance, but systematic studies on evaluating image dataset quality remain limited.

Method: Developed a pipeline integrating CleanVision and Fastdup tools with enhancements including automatic threshold selection. Analyzed impact of various image quality issues on model performance using CIFAKE dataset, treating quality detection as binary classification.

Result: Automatic thresholding improved F1 scores from 0.6794 to 0.9468 (single perturbations) and 0.7447 to 0.8557 (dual perturbations). Near-duplicate detection improved from 0.4576 to 0.7928. CNNs showed resilience to some distortions but vulnerability to blurring and severe downscaling.

Conclusion: The proposed workflow effectively advances data quality assessment in image-based machine learning, demonstrating that not all quality issues have equal impact and that systematic quality evaluation is crucial for model performance.

Abstract: In machine learning, research has traditionally focused on model development,
with relatively less attention paid to training data. As model architectures
have matured and marginal gains from further refinements diminish, data quality
has emerged as a critical factor. However, systematic studies on evaluating and
ensuring dataset quality in the image domain remain limited.
  This study investigates methods for systematically assessing image dataset
quality and examines how various image quality factors influence model
performance. Using the publicly available and relatively clean CIFAKE dataset,
we identify common quality issues and quantify their impact on training.
Building on these findings, we develop a pipeline that integrates two
community-developed tools, CleanVision and Fastdup. We analyze their underlying
mechanisms and introduce several enhancements, including automatic threshold
selection to detect problematic images without manual tuning.
  Experimental results demonstrate that not all quality issues exert the same
level of impact. While convolutional neural networks show resilience to certain
distortions, they are particularly vulnerable to degradations that obscure
critical visual features, such as blurring and severe downscaling. To assess
the performance of existing tools and the effectiveness of our proposed
enhancements, we formulate the detection of low-quality images as a binary
classification task and use the F1 score as the evaluation metric. Our
automatic thresholding method improves the F1 score from 0.6794 to 0.9468 under
single perturbations and from 0.7447 to 0.8557 under dual perturbations. For
near-duplicate detection, our deduplication strategy increases the F1 score
from 0.4576 to 0.7928. These results underscore the effectiveness of our
workflow and provide a foundation for advancing data quality assessment in
image-based machine learning.

*Yongqiang Wang,Weigang Li,Wenping Liu,Zhiqiang Tian,Jinling Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A skeleton-based robust registration framework (SRRF) that uses corruption-resilient skeletal representations to improve point cloud registration accuracy under various corruptions like density distortions, noise, and geometric deformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world point clouds suffer from sensor limitations, environmental noise, and preprocessing errors that challenge existing registration methods relying on direct point matching or surface features, which are highly susceptible to these corruptions.

Method: Integrates skeletal structures into registration, combining transformations from both corrupted point cloud alignment and skeleton alignment. Uses a distribution distance loss function to enforce consistency between source and target skeletons.

Result: SRRF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art registration methods across diverse corrupted datasets with various corruption scenarios including density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations.

Conclusion: The framework provides robust and accurate registration by considering both original local geometric features and global skeleton structure stability, making it suitable for real-world 3D perception tasks.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is fundamental in 3D vision applications, including
autonomous driving, robotics, and medical imaging, where precise alignment of
multiple point clouds is essential for accurate environment reconstruction.
However, real-world point clouds are often affected by sensor limitations,
environmental noise, and preprocessing errors, making registration challenging
due to density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations.
Existing registration methods rely on direct point matching or surface feature
extraction, which are highly susceptible to these corruptions and lead to
reduced alignment accuracy. To address these challenges, a skeleton-based
robust registration framework is presented, which introduces a
corruption-resilient skeletal representation to improve registration robustness
and accuracy. The framework integrates skeletal structures into the
registration process and combines the transformations obtained from both the
corrupted point cloud alignment and its skeleton alignment to achieve optimal
registration. In addition, a distribution distance loss function is designed to
enforce the consistency between the source and target skeletons, which
significantly improves the registration performance. This framework ensures
that the alignment considers both the original local geometric features and the
global stability of the skeleton structure, resulting in robust and accurate
registration results. Experimental evaluations on diverse corrupted datasets
demonstrate that SRRF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art registration
methods across various corruption scenarios, including density distortions,
noise contamination, and geometric deformations. The results confirm the
robustness of SRRF in handling corrupted point clouds, making it a potential
approach for 3D perception tasks in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a zero-shot inference-time optimization method that integrates Laban Effort and Shape components into text-guided motion generation models to achieve fine-grained expressive control of human motion without additional training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-motion synthesis lacks fine-grained expressive control due to limited motion style diversity in datasets and the difficulty of expressing quantitative motion characteristics in natural language.

Method: Proposes a zero-shot inference-time optimization method that updates text embeddings of pretrained diffusion models during sampling to guide motion generation toward desired Laban Effort and Shape components, using Laban movement analysis quantification methods.

Result: The approach successfully generates diverse expressive motion qualities while preserving motion identity, effectively manipulating motion attributes according to target Laban tags.

Conclusion: The integration of Laban movement analysis quantification enables interpretable and expressive control of human motion generation, addressing the limitations of current text-guided motion generation models.

Abstract: Diverse human motion generation is an increasingly important task, having
various applications in computer vision, human-computer interaction and
animation. While text-to-motion synthesis using diffusion models has shown
success in generating high-quality motions, achieving fine-grained expressive
motion control remains a significant challenge. This is due to the lack of
motion style diversity in datasets and the difficulty of expressing
quantitative characteristics in natural language. Laban movement analysis has
been widely used by dance experts to express the details of motion including
motion quality as consistent as possible. Inspired by that, this work aims for
interpretable and expressive control of human motion generation by seamlessly
integrating the quantification methods of Laban Effort and Shape components
into the text-guided motion generation models. Our proposed zero-shot,
inference-time optimization method guides the motion generation model to have
desired Laban Effort and Shape components without any additional motion data by
updating the text embedding of pretrained diffusion models during the sampling
step. We demonstrate that our approach yields diverse expressive motion
qualities while preserving motion identity by successfully manipulating motion
attributes according to target Laban tags.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CEGC is a confidence-driven framework for partial 3D point cloud registration that jointly models overlap confidence and correspondence reliability using global context, achieving superior accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Partial point cloud registration faces challenges from structural ambiguity, partial visibility, and noise, requiring robust solutions for autonomous perception and 3D scene understanding.

Method: Uses hybrid overlap confidence estimation (semantic descriptors + geometric similarity) and context-aware matching with global attention to assign soft confidence scores, guiding a differentiable weighted SVD solver for transformation computation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and 7Scenes datasets in accuracy, robustness, and generalization.

Conclusion: CEGC provides an interpretable and scalable solution for partial point cloud registration under challenging conditions through its unified confidence-driven framework.

Abstract: Partial point cloud registration is essential for autonomous perception and
3D scene understanding, yet it remains challenging owing to structural
ambiguity, partial visibility, and noise. We address these issues by proposing
Confidence Estimation under Global Context (CEGC), a unified, confidence-driven
framework for robust partial 3D registration. CEGC enables accurate alignment
in complex scenes by jointly modeling overlap confidence and correspondence
reliability within a shared global context. Specifically, the hybrid overlap
confidence estimation module integrates semantic descriptors and geometric
similarity to detect overlapping regions and suppress outliers early. The
context-aware matching strategy smitigates ambiguity by employing global
attention to assign soft confidence scores to correspondences, improving
robustness. These scores guide a differentiable weighted singular value
decomposition solver to compute precise transformations. This tightly coupled
pipeline adaptively down-weights uncertain regions and emphasizes contextually
reliable matches. Experiments on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and 7Scenes 3D
vision datasets demonstrate that CEGC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
accuracy, robustness, and generalization. Overall, CEGC offers an interpretable
and scalable solution to partial point cloud registration under challenging
conditions.

*Shijie Lian,Changti Wu,Laurence Tianruo Yang,Hang Yuan,Bin Yu,Lei Zhang,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Euclidean geometry problem-solving as a training method to enhance spatial intelligence in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), achieving state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning benchmarks through geometry-centric fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial intelligence remains a critical unresolved challenge for MLLMs, despite encompassing important abilities like shape visualization, mental rotation, position judgment, and numerosity estimation.

Method: Created Euclid30K dataset with ~30K geometry problems, then used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to finetune Qwen2.5VL and RoboBrain2.0 models, enabling them to identify shapes, count entities, and perform multi-step deductive reasoning using Euclidean principles.

Result: Models achieved substantial zero-shot gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks (Super-CLEVR, Omni3DBench, VSI-Bench, MindCube) without task-specific adaptations. Mean VSI-Bench accuracy improved from 34.5% to 40.5%, with RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieving 49.6% accuracy, surpassing previous state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: This is the first systematic study demonstrating that geometry-centric fine-tuning can provide vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills, establishing a new approach to enhancing spatial intelligence in MLLMs.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence spans a rich suite of abilities, including visualising
and transforming shapes, mentally rotating objects, judging relational
positions and containment, and estimating numerosity. However, it still remains
a critical unresolved challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).To
fill this gap, we propose to treat Euclidean geometry problem-solving as a
surrogate task. Specifically, we meticulously constructed a curated multimodal
dataset, called Euclid30K, comprising approximately 30K plane and solid
geometry problems. To enable the model to acquire and apply Euclidean
principles from these geometry problems, we employed Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to finetune the Qwen2.5VL family and RoboBrain2.0 family,
inspiring the models to identify shapes, count, and relate entities, and
perform multi-step deductive reasoning using Euclidean principles. Our
experiments demonstrate that the resulting models achieve substantial zero-shot
gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks (Super-CLEVR, Omni3DBench,
VSI-Bench, and MindCube) without any task-specific adaptations. Notably, after
training on the Euclid30K, the mean VSI-Bench accuracy of all evaluated models
rose from 34.5% to 40.5%, improving by 5.5 percentage points. Among them,
RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieves 49.6\% accuracy, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art model, Spatial-MLLM.To our knowledge, this is the first
systematic study showing that geometry-centric fine-tuning can confer
vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills. Code and

*Sai Raj Kishore Perla,Aditya Vora,Sauradip Nag,Ali Mahdavi-Amiri,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASIA is a novel framework for 3D segmentation that uses few image annotations to segment both semantic and non-semantic parts in 3D objects, leveraging diffusion models to transfer segmentations from 2D images to 3D space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D segmentation methods require expensive multi-view images, complex 3D model annotations, or ambiguous text descriptions. ASIA addresses this by using easier-to-collect in-the-wild image annotations.

Method: Leverages text-to-image diffusion models (Stable Diffusion) to transfer segmentations from images to 3D. Optimizes text tokens for each segment, uses cross-view part correspondence loss during training, and employs Noise Optimization and UV-space voting for inference.

Result: Outperforms existing methods by a noticeable margin in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, providing a practical solution for semantic and non-semantic 3D segmentation.

Conclusion: ASIA offers a generalizable and practical approach for 3D segmentation using few image annotations, overcoming limitations of existing methods and enabling segmentation of both semantic and non-semantic parts.

Abstract: We introduce ASIA (Adaptive 3D Segmentation using few Image Annotations), a
novel framework that enables segmentation of possibly non-semantic and
non-text-describable "parts" in 3D. Our segmentation is controllable through a
few user-annotated in-the-wild images, which are easier to collect than
multi-view images, less demanding to annotate than 3D models, and more precise
than potentially ambiguous text descriptions. Our method leverages the rich
priors of text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), to
transfer segmentations from image space to 3D, even when the annotated and
target objects differ significantly in geometry or structure. During training,
we optimize a text token for each segment and fine-tune our model with a novel
cross-view part correspondence loss. At inference, we segment multi-view
renderings of the 3D mesh, fuse the labels in UV-space via voting, refine them
with our novel Noise Optimization technique, and finally map the UV-labels back
onto the mesh. ASIA provides a practical and generalizable solution for both
semantic and non-semantic 3D segmentation tasks, outperforming existing methods
by a noticeable margin in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

TL;DR: SCPO is a novel alignment framework for Multimodal Large Language Models that uses semantic curriculum learning to reduce visual hallucinations by up to 62.9% while maintaining general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs suffer from visual hallucinations where responses contradict visual evidence, and existing DPO methods fail to capture fine-grained semantic differences and encourage shortcut learning.

Method: Proposes Semantic Curriculum Preference Optimization (SCPO) with progressive easy-to-hard curriculum using Semantic Curriculum Preference Pairs dataset, dynamic reference model, and symmetric bidirectional objective for simultaneous learning from textual and visual preferences.

Result: Reduces hallucination rate by up to 62.9% on LLaVA models across various scales and versions, improves factuality while preserving general capabilities, and maintains stable performance on general vision-language benchmarks.

Conclusion: SCPO is the first framework to unify semantics, symmetry, and curriculum for MLLM alignment, effectively mitigating visual hallucinations while maintaining model capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved the
performance of various tasks, but continue to suffer from visual
hallucinations, a critical issue where generated responses contradict visual
evidence. While Direct Preference Optimization(DPO) is widely used for
alignment, its application to MLLMs often fails to capture fine-grained
semantic differences and encourages shortcut learning. To address these
challenges, we propose Semantic Curriculum Preference Optimization (SCPO), a
novel framework for MLLM alignment. SCPO employs a progressive, easy-to-hard
curriculum built upon our Semantic Curriculum Preference Pairs dataset, which
provides fine-grained semantic contrasts sorted by difficulty. This curriculum
is trained with a dynamic reference model and a novel symmetric, bidirectional
objective to facilitate simultaneous learning from both textual and visual
preferences. To our knowledge, SCPO is the first framework to unify semantics,
symmetry, and curriculum for MLLMs alignment, effectively mitigating visual
hallucinations. Extensive experiments on LLaVA models across various scales and
versions validate that SCPO demonstrates superior performance compared to
baseline models on multiple hallucination benchmarks, reducing the
hallucination rate by up to 62.9%. Moreover, evaluations on generalized
benchmarks show that SCPO improves factuality while preserving general
capabilities, with its performance remaining stable across general
vision-language benchmarks.

TL;DR: SVGThinker is a reasoning-driven framework for text-to-SVG generation that improves generalization and instruction adherence by aligning SVG code production with visualization processes and supporting full SVG primitives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address weak generalization and poor adherence to input instructions in text-to-SVG generation using large language models.

Method: Uses a pipeline that renders primitives sequentially, annotates images and code with multimodal models, builds stepwise updates mirroring incremental primitive addition, and trains LLMs with supervised fine-tuning that exposes chain-of-thought reasoning.

Result: Produces more stable, editable, and higher-quality SVGs while preserving vector graphics structural advantages, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: Enables precise hierarchical editing and opens new directions for design, content creation, and automated graphics generation.

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a code-based representation for 2D visuals.
Leveraging recent advances in large language models (LLMs), we study
text-to-SVG generation and address two persistent gaps: weak generalization and
poor adherence to input instructions. We present SVGThinker, a reasoning-driven
framework that aligns the production of SVG code with the visualization process
and supports the full set of SVG primitives. Our pipeline first renders each
primitive in sequence and uses a multimodal model to annotate the image and
code; we then build stepwise updates that mirror the incremental addition of
primitives. On this data, we train an LLM with supervised fine-tuning that
exposes its chain-of-thought as intermediate reasoning, improving robustness
and reducing errors and hallucinations. Experiments against state-of-the-art
baselines show that SVGThinker produces more stable, editable, and
higher-quality SVGs while preserving the structural advantages of vector
graphics. Unlike image-based methods, our outputs enable precise and
hierarchical editing, opening new directions for design, content creation, and
automated graphics generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FrameThinker is a novel framework that enables Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to iteratively interrogate long videos through strategic frame selection and reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs struggle with long video reasoning due to inefficient uniform frame sampling and static textual reasoning, which are inadequate for visually intensive video tasks.

Method: A two-phase training strategy: 1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to instill fundamental action capabilities, 2) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with comprehensive reward design for strategic decision-making policy optimization.

Result: Achieves +10.4% average improvement over baselines while drastically reducing processed frames. The 7B model establishes SOTA on LongVideo-Reason with 76.1% accuracy using only 20.6 frames on average, outperforming LongVILA-R1 (72.0%) with 20x fewer frames.

Conclusion: FrameThinker demonstrates unparalleled efficiency and effectiveness in long video reasoning, enabling LVLMs to think strategically about video content through iterative interrogation and optimized frame selection.

Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved substantial progress
in video understanding, their application to long video reasoning is hindered
by uniform frame sampling and static textual reasoning, which are inefficient
and struggle to handle visually intensive video tasks. To overcome these
challenges, in this paper, we introduce the concept of thinking with long
videos and propose a novel framework FrameThinker. Within this framework, LVLMs
are able to iteratively interrogate video content. Developing such video
reasoning capabilities in LVLMs presents notable challenges, particularly in
adapting the model to new video actions (e.g. select frame), and designing
reward functions to guide LVLMs to adopt the newly introduced action. To solve
these challenges, we propose a two-phase training strategy, first employing
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to instill fundamental action capabilities,
followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize a strategic decision-making
policy.Notably, in this RL phase, we conduct an in-depth and comprehensive
exploration of the reward design for each action and format reward. Extensive
experiments on reasoning benchmarks like Video-Holmes, LongVideo-Reason, and
long-video understanding benchmarks such as LongVideoBench, MLVU, VideoMME, and
LVBench, demonstrate that FrameThinker achieves a significant average
improvement of +10.4% over baselines while drastically reducing the number of
processed frames. Most notably, our 7B model, FrameThinker establishes a new
state-of-the-art on LongVideo-Reason, achieving 76.1% accuracy using an average
of only 20.6 frames. This not only outperforms the competitive LongVILA-R1
(72.0%) but does so with over 20x fewer frames (vs. 512), demonstrating
unparalleled efficiency and effectiveness.

*Zheyuan Hu,Chieh-Hsin Lai,Yuki Mitsufuji,Stefano Ermon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Consistency Mid-Training (CMT) introduces a lightweight intermediate stage between diffusion pre-training and flow map training that enables stable initialization, reduces training data and GPU time by up to 98%, and achieves state-of-the-art few-step generation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flow map models like Consistency Models and Mean Flow suffer from unstable training, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and high computational costs when converting diffusion models' infinitesimal steps into long-jump maps.

Method: CMT trains a model to map points along a solver trajectory from a pre-trained diffusion model directly to the solver-generated clean sample, creating a trajectory-consistent and stable initialization for subsequent flow map training.

Result: CMT achieves state-of-the-art two-step FIDs: 1.97 on CIFAR-10, 1.32 on ImageNet 64x64, and 1.84 on ImageNet 512x512. On ImageNet 256x256, it reaches 1-step FID 3.34 while cutting total training time by about 50% compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: CMT establishes a principled, efficient, and general framework for training flow map models that significantly reduces computational requirements while improving generation quality and training stability.

Abstract: Flow map models such as Consistency Models (CM) and Mean Flow (MF) enable
few-step generation by learning the long jump of the ODE solution of diffusion
models, yet training remains unstable, sensitive to hyperparameters, and
costly. Initializing from a pre-trained diffusion model helps, but still
requires converting infinitesimal steps into a long-jump map, leaving
instability unresolved. We introduce mid-training, the first concept and
practical method that inserts a lightweight intermediate stage between the
(diffusion) pre-training and the final flow map training (i.e., post-training)
for vision generation. Concretely, Consistency Mid-Training (CMT) is a compact
and principled stage that trains a model to map points along a solver
trajectory from a pre-trained model, starting from a prior sample, directly to
the solver-generated clean sample. It yields a trajectory-consistent and stable
initialization. This initializer outperforms random and diffusion-based
baselines and enables fast, robust convergence without heuristics. Initializing
post-training with CMT weights further simplifies flow map learning.
Empirically, CMT achieves state of the art two step FIDs: 1.97 on CIFAR-10,
1.32 on ImageNet 64x64, and 1.84 on ImageNet 512x512, while using up to 98%
less training data and GPU time, compared to CMs. On ImageNet 256x256, CMT
reaches 1-step FID 3.34 while cutting total training time by about 50% compared
to MF from scratch (FID 3.43). This establishes CMT as a principled, efficient,
and general framework for training flow map models.

Motivation: Existing neural rendering methods suffer from inaccurate geometry in texture-less indoor regions and decouple mesh extraction from optimization, missing opportunities to leverage mesh geometry for guiding splat optimization.

Method: Joint optimization of explicit triangle mesh and 2D Gaussian splats via flexible binding strategy, with mesh constraints and monocular normal supervision. Includes iterative mesh-refinement strategy that splits high-error faces and prunes unreliable ones.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging indoor reconstruction benchmarks, reducing Chamfer-L1 by 47.3% over 2DGS baseline while maintaining competitive novel-view rendering quality.

Conclusion: OMeGa effectively addresses prior limitations in indoor texture-less reconstruction by integrating mesh geometry directly into the optimization process.

Abstract: Neural rendering with Gaussian splatting has advanced novel view synthesis,
and most methods reconstruct surfaces via post-hoc mesh extraction. However,
existing methods suffer from two limitations: (i) inaccurate geometry in
texture-less indoor regions, and (ii) the decoupling of mesh extraction from
optimization, thereby missing the opportunity to leverage mesh geometry to
guide splat optimization. In this paper, we present OMeGa, an end-to-end
framework that jointly optimizes an explicit triangle mesh and 2D Gaussian
splats via a flexible binding strategy, where spatial attributes of Gaussian
Splats are expressed in the mesh frame and texture attributes are retained on
splats. To further improve reconstruction accuracy, we integrate mesh
constraints and monocular normal supervision into the optimization, thereby
regularizing geometry learning. In addition, we propose a heuristic, iterative
mesh-refinement strategy that splits high-error faces and prunes unreliable
ones to further improve the detail and accuracy of the reconstructed mesh.
OMeGa achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging indoor
reconstruction benchmarks, reducing Chamfer-$L_1$ by 47.3\% over the 2DGS
baseline while maintaining competitive novel-view rendering quality. The
experimental results demonstrate that OMeGa effectively addresses prior
limitations in indoor texture-less reconstruction.

*Mohamad Amin Mirzaei,Pantea Amoie,Ali Ekhterachian,Matin Mirzababaei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an improved method for zero-shot 3D semantic mapping using SemanticSAM for better object-level mask generation and context-aware CLIP encoding for richer semantic understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for zero-shot 3D semantic mapping produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to direct use of raw masks from vision-language models, limiting effectiveness in complex environments.

Method: Leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement to generate more accurate object-level masks, and employ context-aware CLIP encoding that integrates multiple contextual views with empirical weighting.

Result: Experimental results on multiple 3D scene understanding tasks show significant improvements over existing methods in 3D semantic segmentation and object retrieval from language queries.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses fragmentation and semantic inaccuracy issues in zero-shot 3D semantic mapping, demonstrating superior performance across benchmark datasets.

Abstract: 3D scene understanding is fundamental for embodied AI and robotics,
supporting reliable perception for interaction and navigation. Recent
approaches achieve zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D semantic mapping by assigning
embedding vectors to 2D class-agnostic masks generated via vision-language
models (VLMs) and projecting these into 3D. However, these methods often
produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to the direct
use of raw masks, limiting their effectiveness in complex environments. To
address this, we leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement
to generate more accurate and numerous object-level masks, mitigating the
over-segmentation commonly observed in mask generation models such as vanilla
SAM, and improving downstream 3D semantic segmentation. To further enhance
semantic context, we employ a context-aware CLIP encoding strategy that
integrates multiple contextual views of each mask using empirically determined
weighting, providing much richer visual context. We evaluate our approach on
multiple 3D scene understanding tasks, including 3D semantic segmentation and
object retrieval from language queries, across several benchmark datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing
methods, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a foundation model for cryo-ET subtomogram analysis that addresses challenges of scarce annotations, severe noise, and poor generalization through large-scale synthetic data generation, adaptive phase tokenization, and noise-resilient contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cryo-ET enables in situ visualization of macromolecular structures, but effective analysis is hindered by scarce annotations, severe noise, and poor generalization in subtomogram classification, alignment, and averaging tasks.

Method: Three key components: 1) CryoEngine - large-scale synthetic data generator producing 904k subtomograms from 452 particle classes; 2) APT-ViT - Adaptive Phase Tokenization-enhanced Vision Transformer with equivariance-enhancing module; 3) NRCL - Noise-Resilient Contrastive Learning strategy for stable representation learning under noise.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on all three major subtomogram tasks across 24 synthetic and real datasets, with strong generalization to unseen datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed foundation model advances scalable and robust subtomogram analysis in cryo-ET by addressing key challenges through synthetic data generation, adaptive architecture design, and noise-resilient learning strategies.

Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) enables in situ visualization of
macromolecular structures, where subtomogram analysis tasks such as
classification, alignment, and averaging are critical for structural
determination. However, effective analysis is hindered by scarce annotations,
severe noise, and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we take the
first step towards foundation models for cryo-ET subtomograms. First, we
introduce CryoEngine, a large-scale synthetic data generator that produces over
904k subtomograms from 452 particle classes for pretraining. Second, we design
an Adaptive Phase Tokenization-enhanced Vision Transformer (APT-ViT), which
incorporates adaptive phase tokenization as an equivariance-enhancing module
that improves robustness to both geometric and semantic variations. Third, we
introduce a Noise-Resilient Contrastive Learning (NRCL) strategy to stabilize
representation learning under severe noise conditions. Evaluations across 24
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on
all three major subtomogram tasks and strong generalization to unseen datasets,
advancing scalable and robust subtomogram analysis in cryo-ET.

TL;DR: MambaMatcher is a novel semantic correspondence method that uses selective state-space models to efficiently model high-dimensional correlations, achieving state-of-the-art performance with linear complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional feature-metric methods miss complex inter-correlation relationships, while correlation-metric approaches suffer from high computational costs due to processing 4D correlation maps.

Method: Uses selective state-space models (SSMs) with a similarity-aware selective scan mechanism adapted from Mamba's linear-complexity algorithm to refine 4D correlation maps without compromising feature resolution or receptive field.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard semantic correspondence benchmarks.

Conclusion: MambaMatcher effectively overcomes limitations of previous methods by efficiently modeling high-dimensional correlations with linear complexity while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Establishing semantic correspondences between images is a fundamental yet
challenging task in computer vision. Traditional feature-metric methods enhance
visual features but may miss complex inter-correlation relationships, while
recent correlation-metric approaches are hindered by high computational costs
due to processing 4D correlation maps. We introduce MambaMatcher, a novel
method that overcomes these limitations by efficiently modeling
high-dimensional correlations using selective state-space models (SSMs). By
implementing a similarity-aware selective scan mechanism adapted from Mamba's
linear-complexity algorithm, MambaMatcher refines the 4D correlation map
effectively without compromising feature map resolution or receptive field.
Experiments on standard semantic correspondence benchmarks demonstrate that
MambaMatcher achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPLICE is a human-curated benchmark from COIN dataset that evaluates event-based reasoning across temporal, causal, spatial, contextual, and knowledge dimensions. It tests humans and VLMs on rearranging video clips into coherent sequences, revealing significant performance gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To probe event-based reasoning capabilities across multiple dimensions and assess the gap between human and machine visual reasoning, particularly in understanding complex event sequences.

Method: Created SPLICE benchmark with 3,381 filtered videos across 12 categories, segmented into 11,423 event clips. Evaluated humans and state-of-the-art VLMs on rearranging clips into coherent sequences, with and without human-annotated textual descriptions.

Result: VLMs significantly underperform humans in event sequencing. Text annotations improve model accuracy but don't affect human performance, suggesting models rely on language priors rather than visual understanding. VLMs perform better on temporal/causal reasoning tasks than contextual/spatial ones, and better on everyday tasks than specialized ones.

Conclusion: There's a persistent gap between human and machine visual reasoning capabilities. VLMs struggle with contextual and spatial reasoning compared to temporal/causal reasoning, and current models rely heavily on language priors rather than genuine visual understanding.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce SPLICE, a human-curated benchmark derived from the
COIN instructional video dataset, designed to probe event-based reasoning
across multiple dimensions: temporal, causal, spatial, contextual, and general
knowledge. SPLICE includes 3,381 human-filtered videos spanning 12 categories
and 180 sub-categories, such as sports, engineering, and housework. These
videos are segmented into a total of 11,423 event clips. We evaluate both human
participants and state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on the task of
rearranging these clips into coherent event sequences to assess visual
reasoning capabilities. Results reveal a significant gap: VLMs struggle to
match human performance. While human-annotated textual descriptions improve
model accuracy, they do not affect human performance, suggesting that models
rely more on language priors than on visual understanding. Even with
annotations, VLMs fall short of human-level reasoning, underscoring persistent
challenges in visual reasoning. A deeper analysis across sub-categories shows
that VLMs perform relatively better on videos where temporal and causal
reasoning are dominant, compared to those where contextual and spatial
reasoning are dominant. They also perform better on everyday tasks than on
specialized ones.

*Guolin Ke,Hui Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SphereAR addresses variance collapse in autoregressive image generation by constraining VAE latents to a hypersphere, achieving state-of-the-art FID scores that surpass diffusion models at comparable scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models for image generation suffer from heterogeneous variance in VAE latents that gets amplified during decoding, especially under classifier-free guidance, leading to variance collapse and poor performance compared to diffusion models.

Method: Proposes SphereAR which constrains all AR inputs and outputs (including after CFG) to lie on a fixed-radius hypersphere using hyperspherical VAEs, removing the scale component that causes variance collapse and stabilizing AR decoding.

Result: SphereAR-H (943M) achieves FID 1.34 on ImageNet generation, setting new SOTA for AR models. Smaller variants SphereAR-L (479M) and SphereAR-B (208M) reach FID 1.54 and 1.92 respectively, surpassing much larger baselines like MAR-H (943M, 1.55) and VAR-d30 (2B, 1.92).

Conclusion: SphereAR demonstrates that pure next-token autoregressive image generators with raster order can surpass diffusion and masked-generation models at comparable parameter scales, marking the first time this has been achieved.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models are promising for image generation, yet
continuous-token AR variants often trail latent diffusion and masked-generation
models. The core issue is heterogeneous variance in VAE latents, which is
amplified during AR decoding, especially under classifier-free guidance (CFG),
and can cause variance collapse. We propose SphereAR to address this issue. Its
core design is to constrain all AR inputs and outputs -- including after CFG --
to lie on a fixed-radius hypersphere (constant $\ell_2$ norm), leveraging
hyperspherical VAEs. Our theoretical analysis shows that hyperspherical
constraint removes the scale component (the primary cause of variance
collapse), thereby stabilizing AR decoding. Empirically, on ImageNet
generation, SphereAR-H (943M) sets a new state of the art for AR models,
achieving FID 1.34. Even at smaller scales, SphereAR-L (479M) reaches FID 1.54
and SphereAR-B (208M) reaches 1.92, matching or surpassing much larger
baselines such as MAR-H (943M, 1.55) and VAR-d30 (2B, 1.92). To our knowledge,
this is the first time a pure next-token AR image generator with raster order
surpasses diffusion and masked-generation models at comparable parameter
scales.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient, high-quality video generation with low computational cost and fast inference speed, making video generation more accessible.

Method: Uses Linear DiT with linear attention for efficiency and constant-memory KV cache for block linear attention to enable minute-long video generation with fixed memory cost.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art models while being 16x faster, with 2.4x inference speedup on RTX 5090 GPUs, and trained at only 1% of MovieGen's cost.

Conclusion: SANA-Video enables low-cost, high-quality video generation with efficient deployment on consumer hardware.

Abstract: We introduce SANA-Video, a small diffusion model that can efficiently
generate videos up to 720x1280 resolution and minute-length duration.
SANA-Video synthesizes high-resolution, high-quality and long videos with
strong text-video alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on RTX 5090
GPU. Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video
generation: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation,
which is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens
processed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear
Attention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video
generation by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative
properties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with
global context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional
KV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we
explore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the
training cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of
MovieGen. Given its low cost, SANA-Video achieves competitive performance
compared to modern state-of-the-art small diffusion models (e.g., Wan 2.1-1.3B
and SkyReel-V2-1.3B) while being 16x faster in measured latency. Moreover,
SANA-Video can be deployed on RTX 5090 GPUs with NVFP4 precision, accelerating
the inference speed of generating a 5-second 720p video from 71s to 29s (2.4x
speedup). In summary, SANA-Video enables low-cost, high-quality video
generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal large language models often struggle to ground reasoning in perceptual evidence, limiting their performance on multimodal tasks.

Method: Two-stage framework: Stage 1 uses perception-augmented fine-tuning, Stage 2 applies perception-aware reinforcement learning with visual, textual, and consistency rewards.

Result: Significantly improves reasoning accuracy and robustness across diverse tasks, with explicit perception paired with textual cues showing the best improvements.

Conclusion: VTPerception-R1 offers a scalable and auditable solution for perception-grounded multimodal reasoning, particularly benefiting smaller models.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to ground reasoning

strategies-explicit, implicit, visual, and textual-across four multimodal
benchmarks and two MLLMs. Our findings show that explicit perception,
especially when paired with textual cues, consistently yields the best
improvements, particularly for smaller models. Based on this insight, we
propose VTPerception-R1, a unified two-stage framework that decouples

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeRV-Diffusion is an implicit latent video diffusion model that generates videos by synthesizing neural network weights, which form an implicit neural representation (INR) to decode videos from frame indices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient and high-quality video synthesis by compressing and generating videos holistically as unified neural networks, avoiding temporal cross-frame attentions in denoisers.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Hypernetwork-based tokenizer encodes videos to neural parameter space, 2) Implicit diffusion transformer denoises latent INR weights. Reuses bottleneck latent across layers and reforms weight assignment, upsampling, and input coordinates.

Result: Superior video generation quality over previous INR-based models and comparable performance to state-of-the-art non-implicit models on UCF-101 and Kinetics-600 benchmarks, with smooth INR weight space enabling seamless interpolations.

Conclusion: NeRV-Diffusion demonstrates that generating videos via neural network weights in an implicit representation framework can achieve high-quality video synthesis while enabling efficient decoding and smooth interpolations.

Abstract: We present NeRV-Diffusion, an implicit latent video diffusion model that
synthesizes videos via generating neural network weights. The generated weights
can be rearranged as the parameters of a convolutional neural network, which
forms an implicit neural representation (INR), and decodes into videos with
frame indices as the input. Our framework consists of two stages: 1) A
hypernetworkbased tokenizer that encodes raw videos from pixel space to neural
parameter space, where the bottleneck latent serves as INR weights to decode.
2) An implicit diffusion transformer that denoises on the latent INR weights.
In contrast to traditional video tokenizers that encode videos into frame-wise
feature maps, NeRV-Diffusion compresses and generates a video holistically as a
unified neural network. This enables efficient and high-quality video synthesis
via obviating temporal cross-frame attentions in the denoiser and decoding
video latent with dedicated decoders. To achieve Gaussian-distributed INR
weights with high expressiveness, we reuse the bottleneck latent across all
NeRV layers, as well as reform its weight assignment, upsampling connection and
input coordinates. We also introduce SNR-adaptive loss weighting and scheduled
sampling for effective training of the implicit diffusion model. NeRV-Diffusion
reaches superior video generation quality over previous INR-based models and
comparable performance to most recent state-of-the-art non-implicit models on
real-world video benchmarks including UCF-101 and Kinetics-600. It also brings
a smooth INR weight space that facilitates seamless interpolations between
frames or videos.

TL;DR: Causal-Adapter is a modular framework that adapts frozen text-to-image diffusion models for counterfactual image generation, enabling precise causal interventions on attributes while preserving image identity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior approaches rely on prompt engineering without explicit causal structure, lacking precise control over attribute interventions and identity preservation in counterfactual image generation.

Method: Leverages structural causal modeling with two attribute regularization strategies: prompt-aligned injection for semantic control and conditioned token contrastive loss for disentangling attribute factors and reducing spurious correlations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 91% MAE reduction on Pendulum for attribute control and 87% FID reduction on ADNI for high-fidelity MRI generation, demonstrating robust counterfactual editing.

Conclusion: The approach enables robust, generalizable counterfactual editing with faithful attribute modification and strong identity preservation across synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: We present Causal-Adapter, a modular framework that adapts frozen
text-to-image diffusion backbones for counterfactual image generation. Our
method enables causal interventions on target attributes, consistently
propagating their effects to causal dependents without altering the core
identity of the image. In contrast to prior approaches that rely on prompt
engineering without explicit causal structure, Causal-Adapter leverages
structural causal modeling augmented with two attribute regularization
strategies: prompt-aligned injection, which aligns causal attributes with
textual embeddings for precise semantic control, and a conditioned token
contrastive loss to disentangle attribute factors and reduce spurious
correlations. Causal-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real-world datasets, with up to 91\% MAE reduction on Pendulum
for accurate attribute control and 87\% FID reduction on ADNI for high-fidelity

### [263] [DRIFT: Divergent Response in Filtered Transformations for Robust Adversarial Defense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24359)
*Amira Guesmi,Muhammad Shafique*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DRIFT is a stochastic ensemble defense that disrupts gradient consensus to prevent adversarial transferability, achieving strong robustness with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, and most defenses fail when gradients can be reliably estimated. The key vulnerability is gradient consensus - where randomized transformations yield aligned gradients that attackers exploit for transferable attacks.

Method: DRIFT uses a stochastic ensemble of lightweight, learnable filters trained to actively disrupt gradient consensus through gradient dissonance. The training combines prediction consistency, Jacobian separation, logit-space separation, and adversarial robustness.

Result: DRIFT achieves substantial robustness gains on ImageNet across CNNs and Vision Transformers, outperforming state-of-the-art preprocessing, adversarial training, and diffusion-based defenses under adaptive white-box, transfer-based, and gradient-free attacks.

Conclusion: DRIFT establishes gradient divergence as a practical and generalizable principle for adversarial defense, delivering robustness improvements with negligible runtime and memory cost.

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain highly vulnerable to adversarial examples, and
most defenses collapse once gradients can be reliably estimated. We identify
\emph{gradient consensus} -- the tendency of randomized transformations to
yield aligned gradients -- as a key driver of adversarial transferability.
Attackers exploit this consensus to construct perturbations that remain
effective across transformations. We introduce \textbf{DRIFT} (Divergent
Response in Filtered Transformations), a stochastic ensemble of lightweight,
learnable filters trained to actively disrupt gradient consensus. Unlike prior
randomized defenses that rely on gradient masking, DRIFT enforces
\emph{gradient dissonance} by maximizing divergence in Jacobian- and
logit-space responses while preserving natural predictions. Our contributions
are threefold: (i) we formalize gradient consensus and provide a theoretical
analysis linking consensus to transferability; (ii) we propose a
consensus-divergence training strategy combining prediction consistency,
Jacobian separation, logit-space separation, and adversarial robustness; and
(iii) we show that DRIFT achieves substantial robustness gains on ImageNet
across CNNs and Vision Transformers, outperforming state-of-the-art
preprocessing, adversarial training, and diffusion-based defenses under
adaptive white-box, transfer-based, and gradient-free attacks. DRIFT delivers
these improvements with negligible runtime and memory cost, establishing
gradient divergence as a practical and generalizable principle for adversarial
defense.

*Abu Hanif Muhammad Syarubany*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses vehicle type recognition with class imbalance issues by creating a 16-class dataset and testing various rebalancing methods and models, finding that deep CNNs outperform ensembles but still struggle with severely under-represented classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Severe class imbalance in public vehicle datasets suppresses performance on rare categories, limiting the effectiveness of vehicle type recognition for intelligent transportation and logistics applications.

Method: Curated a 16-class dataset (~47k images) from multiple sources, created six balanced variants using SMOTE oversampling and targeted undersampling, and benchmarked lightweight ensembles (Random Forest, AdaBoost, soft-voting) against a configurable ResNet-style CNN with strong augmentation and label smoothing.

Result: Best ensemble achieved 74.8% test accuracy, while the CNN achieved 79.19% on full test set and 81.25% on unseen inference batch. However, the most under-represented class (Barge) remained a failure mode despite rebalancing efforts.

Conclusion: Deep models have advantages over ensembles, but rebalancing alone has limits. Future work should prioritize additional minority-class data collection, cost-sensitive objectives like focal loss, and hybrid ensemble-CNN pipelines to combine interpretability with representational power.

Abstract: Accurate vehicle type recognition underpins intelligent transportation and
logistics, but severe class imbalance in public datasets suppresses performance
on rare categories. We curate a 16-class corpus (~47k images) by merging
Kaggle, ImageNet, and web-crawled data, and create six balanced variants via
SMOTE oversampling and targeted undersampling. Lightweight ensembles, such as

strong augmentation and label smoothing. The best ensemble (SMOTE-combined)
attains 74.8% test accuracy, while the CNN achieves 79.19% on the full test set
and 81.25% on an unseen inference batch, confirming the advantage of deep
models. Nonetheless, the most under-represented class (Barge) remains a failure

TL;DR: OpenGPT-4o-Image is a large-scale dataset with 80k instruction-image pairs covering 11 domains and 51 subtasks, created using hierarchical task taxonomy and automated generation, which significantly improves multimodal models' performance on generation and editing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for multimodal models lack systematic structure and challenging scenarios needed for real-world applications, constraining model performance in image generation and editing.

Method: Used hierarchical task taxonomy combined with automated data generation through GPT-4o, creating structured resource pools to generate diverse instruction-image pairs across fundamental and challenging categories.

Result: Fine-tuning models on OpenGPT-4o-Image achieved up to 18% improvement on editing tasks (UniWorld-V1 on ImgEdit-Bench) and 13% improvement on generation tasks (Harmon on GenEval).

Conclusion: Systematic data construction is crucial for advancing multimodal AI capabilities, and the proposed dataset successfully addresses limitations of existing training data.

Abstract: The performance of unified multimodal models for image generation and editing
is fundamentally constrained by the quality and comprehensiveness of their
training data. While existing datasets have covered basic tasks like style
transfer and simple object manipulation, they often lack the systematic
structure and challenging scenarios required for real-world applications. To
address this bottleneck, we introduce OpenGPT-4o-Image, a large-scale dataset
constructed using a novel methodology that combines hierarchical task taxonomy
with automated data generation. Our taxonomy not only includes fundamental
capabilities such as text rendering and style control but also introduces
highly practical yet challenging categories like scientific imagery for
chemistry illustrations and complex instruction editing requiring simultaneous
execution of multiple operations. Through an automated pipeline leveraging
structured resource pools and GPT-4o, we generate 80k high-quality
instruction-image pairs with controlled diversity, covering 11 major domains
and 51 subtasks. Extensive experiments show that fine-tuning leading models on
our dataset achieves significant performance gains across multiple benchmarks,
with improvements of up to 18\% on editing tasks (UniWorld-V1 on ImgEdit-Bench)
and 13% on generation tasks (Harmon on GenEval). Our work demonstrates that
systematic data construction is key to advancing multimodal AI capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seg-CFT is a method for generating counterfactual medical images that enables structure-specific interventions without requiring pixel-level labels, producing locally coherent counterfactuals for applications like chest radiograph generation and coronary artery disease modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current counterfactual image generation methods rely on external classifiers/regressors and are insufficient for structure-specific interventions, often causing undesirable global effects. Previous approaches required tedious pixel-level label maps for guidance.

Method: Segmentor-guided Counterfactual Fine-Tuning (Seg-CFT) that preserves the simplicity of intervening on scalar-valued, structure-specific variables while producing locally coherent counterfactuals without requiring pixel-level segmentations.

Result: The method demonstrates capability of generating realistic chest radiographs and shows promising results for modeling coronary artery disease, producing effective counterfactuals with local coherence.

Conclusion: Seg-CFT provides a practical approach for structure-specific counterfactual image generation that avoids the need for tedious pixel-level annotations while maintaining intervention effectiveness and local coherence.

Abstract: Counterfactual image generation is a powerful tool for augmenting training
data, de-biasing datasets, and modeling disease. Current approaches rely on
external classifiers or regressors to increase the effectiveness of
subject-level interventions (e.g., changing the patient's age). For
structure-specific interventions (e.g., changing the area of the left lung in a
chest radiograph), we show that this is insufficient, and can result in
undesirable global effects across the image domain. Previous work used
pixel-level label maps as guidance, requiring a user to provide hypothetical
segmentations which are tedious and difficult to obtain. We propose
Segmentor-guided Counterfactual Fine-Tuning (Seg-CFT), which preserves the
simplicity of intervening on scalar-valued, structure-specific variables while
producing locally coherent and effective counterfactuals. We demonstrate the
capability of generating realistic chest radiographs, and we show promising
results for modeling coronary artery disease. Code:

### [267] [Real-Aware Residual Model Merging for Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24367)
*Jinhee Park,Guisik Kim,Choongsang Cho,Junseok Kwon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R²M is a training-free model merging framework for deepfake detection that combines specialist models by decomposing them into shared Real components and Fake residuals, enabling effective detection without retraining when new forgery methods emerge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake generators evolve rapidly, making continuous data collection and model retraining impractical. Model merging is well-suited for deepfake detection since specialists share the same binary classification task but differ in generator-specific artifacts.

Method: Real-aware Residual Model Merging (R²M) estimates a shared Real component via low-rank factorization, decomposes specialists into Real-aligned parts and Fake residuals, denoises residuals with layerwise rank truncation, and aggregates them with per-task norm matching to prevent dominance by any single generator.

Result: R²M outperforms joint training and other merging baselines across in-distribution, cross-dataset, and unseen-dataset scenarios. The method is also composable - when new forgery families appear, only one specialist needs fine-tuning and re-merging, eliminating full retraining.

Conclusion: Model merging through R²M provides an effective and practical solution for deepfake detection that adapts to evolving generators without requiring exhaustive data collection or repeated retraining, maintaining strong performance across various evaluation scenarios.

Abstract: Deepfake generators evolve quickly, making exhaustive data collection and
repeated retraining impractical. We argue that model merging is a natural fit
for deepfake detection: unlike generic multi-task settings with disjoint
labels, deepfake specialists share the same binary decision and differ in
generator-specific artifacts. Empirically, we show that simple weight averaging
preserves Real representations while attenuating Fake-specific cues. Building
upon these findings, we propose Real-aware Residual Model Merging (R$^2$M), a
training-free parameter-space merging framework. R$^2$M estimates a shared Real
component via a low-rank factorization of task vectors, decomposes each
specialist into a Real-aligned part and a Fake residual, denoises residuals
with layerwise rank truncation, and aggregates them with per-task norm matching
to prevent any single generator from dominating. A concise rationale explains
why a simple head suffices: the Real component induces a common separation
direction in feature space, while truncated residuals contribute only minor
off-axis variations. Across in-distribution, cross-dataset, and unseen-dataset,
R$^2$M outperforms joint training and other merging baselines. Importantly,
R$^2$M is also composable: when a new forgery family appears, we fine-tune one
specialist and re-merge, eliminating the need for retraining.

*Sangeek Hyun,MinKyu Lee,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAT introduces a scalable GAN architecture using transformer-based generators/discriminators trained in VAE latent space, achieving state-of-the-art FID of 2.96 on ImageNet-256 with 6x fewer training epochs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate scalability principles for GANs, which have been underexplored compared to other generative models, by leveraging proven design choices from scalable architectures.

Method: Training in compact VAE latent space for efficiency, using purely transformer-based generators/discriminators, with lightweight intermediate supervision and width-aware learning-rate adjustment to address scaling issues.

Result: GAT achieves state-of-the-art single-step class-conditional generation on ImageNet-256 with FID of 2.96 in just 40 epochs, 6x fewer than strong baselines, and scales reliably across capacities from S to XL.

Conclusion: GANs can be effectively scaled using transformer architectures and latent-space training, with simple solutions addressing scaling challenges, enabling efficient high-quality generation.

Abstract: Scalability has driven recent advances in generative modeling, yet its
principles remain underexplored for adversarial learning. We investigate the
scalability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) through two design
choices that have proven to be effective in other types of generative models:
training in a compact Variational Autoencoder latent space and adopting purely
transformer-based generators and discriminators. Training in latent space
enables efficient computation while preserving perceptual fidelity, and this
efficiency pairs naturally with plain transformers, whose performance scales
with computational budget. Building on these choices, we analyze failure modes
that emerge when naively scaling GANs. Specifically, we find issues as
underutilization of early layers in the generator and optimization instability
as the network scales. Accordingly, we provide simple and scale-friendly
solutions as lightweight intermediate supervision and width-aware learning-rate
adjustment. Our experiments show that GAT, a purely transformer-based and
latent-space GANs, can be easily trained reliably across a wide range of
capacities (S through XL). Moreover, GAT-XL/2 achieves state-of-the-art
single-step, class-conditional generation performance (FID of 2.96) on
ImageNet-256 in just 40 epochs, 6x fewer epochs than strong baselines.

### [269] [DINOReg: Strong Point Cloud Registration with Vision Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24370)
*Congjia Chen,Yufu Qu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINOReg is a point cloud registration network that effectively fuses visual features from DINOv2 with geometric features at patch level, achieving state-of-the-art performance on RGB-D datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud registration methods rely mainly on geometric information and don't fully exploit rich texture and semantic information from images. Current multi-modal approaches use image-lossy feature fusion that limits performance.

Method: Uses DINOv2 to extract visual features from images, fuses visual and geometric features at patch level, and introduces mixed positional embedding to encode both image and point cloud spatial information.

Result: Achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods: 14.2% increase in patch inlier ratio and 15.7% increase in registration recall on RGBD-3DMatch and RGBD-3DLoMatch datasets.

Conclusion: DINOReg demonstrates that effectively combining visual and geometric information through patch-level fusion and mixed positional embedding significantly enhances point cloud registration performance.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision. Most
existing methods rely solely on geometric information for feature extraction
and matching. Recently, several studies have incorporated color information
from RGB-D data into feature extraction. Although these methods achieve
remarkable improvements, they have not fully exploited the abundant texture and
semantic information in images, and the feature fusion is performed in an
image-lossy manner, which limit their performance. In this paper, we propose
DINOReg, a registration network that sufficiently utilizes both visual and
geometric information to solve the point cloud registration problem. Inspired
by advances in vision foundation models, we employ DINOv2 to extract
informative visual features from images, and fuse visual and geometric features
at the patch level. This design effectively combines the rich texture and
global semantic information extracted by DINOv2 with the detailed geometric
structure information captured by the geometric backbone. Additionally, a mixed
positional embedding is proposed to encode positional information from both
image space and point cloud space, which enhances the model's ability to
perceive spatial relationships between patches. Extensive experiments on the
RGBD-3DMatch and RGBD-3DLoMatch datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
significant improvements over state-of-the-art geometry-only and multi-modal
registration methods, with a 14.2% increase in patch inlier ratio and a 15.7%
increase in registration recall. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: CLASP is a lightweight unsupervised image segmentation framework that uses self-supervised ViT features, spectral clustering, and automatic segment count selection to achieve competitive performance without any training or labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a simple, training-free image segmentation method that can handle large unannotated datasets commonly found in digital advertising and marketing workflows like brand safety screening and content moderation.

Method: Extracts patch features using self-supervised ViT (DINO), builds affinity matrix, applies spectral clustering with automatic segment count selection via eigengap silhouette search, and sharpens boundaries with DenseCRF.

Result: Achieves competitive mIoU and pixel accuracy on COCO Stuff and ADE20K datasets, matching recent unsupervised baselines despite requiring no training.

Conclusion: CLASP provides a strong, easily reproducible baseline for unsupervised image segmentation that works effectively on large unannotated corpora without any training or fine-tuning.

Abstract: We introduce CLASP (Clustering via Adaptive Spectral Processing), a
lightweight framework for unsupervised image segmentation that operates without
any labeled data or finetuning. CLASP first extracts per patch features using a
self supervised ViT encoder (DINO); then, it builds an affinity matrix and
applies spectral clustering. To avoid manual tuning, we select the segment
count automatically with a eigengap silhouette search, and we sharpen the
boundaries with a fully connected DenseCRF. Despite its simplicity and training
free nature, CLASP attains competitive mIoU and pixel accuracy on COCO Stuff
and ADE20K, matching recent unsupervised baselines. The zero training design
makes CLASP a strong, easily reproducible baseline for large unannotated
corpora especially common in digital advertising and marketing workflows such
as brand safety screening, creative asset curation, and social media content
moderation

### [271] [Mask Clustering-based Annotation Engine for Large-Scale Submeter Land Cover Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24374)
*Hao Chen,Fang Xu,Tamer Saleh,Weifeng Hao,Gui-Song Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCAE is a novel annotation engine that uses spatial autocorrelation and mask clustering to efficiently annotate submeter resolution imagery, creating the HiCity-LC dataset with 14 billion labeled pixels across five Chinese cities with over 85% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Submeter resolution imagery offers fine-grained detail for land cover analysis but is underutilized due to the lack of sufficient high-quality annotated datasets, as existing annotation methods are unreliable or prohibitively expensive.

Method: The Mask Clustering-based Annotation Engine (MCAE) leverages spatial autocorrelation principles, treating semantically consistent mask groups as minimal annotating units to enable efficient simultaneous annotation of multiple instances.

Result: MCAE improves annotation efficiency by 1-2 orders of magnitude while preserving label quality. It created HiCity-LC dataset with ~14 billion labeled pixels, achieving over 85% classification accuracy across five major Chinese cities.

Conclusion: MCAE demonstrates scalability and practical utility for large-scale submeter resolution mapping, producing the first publicly available submeter resolution city-level land cover benchmark.

Abstract: Recent advances in remote sensing technology have made submeter resolution
imagery increasingly accessible, offering remarkable detail for fine-grained
land cover analysis. However, its full potential remains underutilized -
particularly for large-scale land cover mapping - due to the lack of
sufficient, high-quality annotated datasets. Existing labels are typically
derived from pre-existing products or manual annotation, which are often
unreliable or prohibitively expensive, particularly given the rich visual
detail and massive data volumes of submeter imagery. Inspired by the spatial
autocorrelation principle, which suggests that objects of the same class tend
to co-occur with similar visual features in local neighborhoods, we propose the
Mask Clustering-based Annotation Engine (MCAE), which treats semantically
consistent mask groups as the minimal annotating units to enable efficient,
simultaneous annotation of multiple instances. It significantly improves
annotation efficiency by one to two orders of magnitude, while preserving label
quality, semantic diversity, and spatial representativeness. With MCAE, we
build a high-quality annotated dataset of about 14 billion labeled pixels,
referred to as HiCity-LC, which supports the generation of city-scale land
cover maps across five major Chinese cities with classification accuracies
above 85%. It is the first publicly available submeter resolution city-level
land cover benchmark, highlighting the scalability and practical utility of
MCAE for large-scale, submeter resolution mapping. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: BRIDGE is an RL-optimized depth-to-image generation framework that synthesizes 20M+ realistic RGB images with paired ground truth depth maps, enabling robust monocular depth estimation training that outperforms state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional monocular depth estimation methods suffer from data scarcity and quality limitations, which hinder their robustness and performance.

Method: Proposes BRIDGE framework using RL-optimized depth-to-image generation to create synthetic training data, and employs hybrid supervision combining teacher pseudo-labels with ground truth depth for comprehensive training.

Result: Achieves breakthroughs in scale and domain diversity, consistently outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches both quantitatively and in complex scene detail capture.

Conclusion: The innovative data generation and training paradigm fosters general and robust depth features, advancing monocular depth estimation capabilities.

Abstract: Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is a foundational task for computer vision.
Traditional methods are limited by data scarcity and quality, hindering their
robustness. To overcome this, we propose BRIDGE, an RL-optimized depth-to-image
(D2I) generation framework that synthesizes over 20M realistic and
geometrically accurate RGB images, each intrinsically paired with its ground

model on this dataset, employing a hybrid supervision strategy that integrates
teacher pseudo-labels with ground truth depth for comprehensive and robust
training. This innovative data generation and training paradigm enables BRIDGE
to achieve breakthroughs in scale and domain diversity, consistently
outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches quantitatively and in
complex scene detail capture, thereby fostering general and robust depth
features. Code and models are available at

### [274] [PCICF: A Pedestrian Crossing Identification and Classification Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24386)
*Junyi Gu,Beatriz Cabrero-Daniel,Ali Nouri,Lydia Armini,Christian Berger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCICF is a framework that uses space-filling curves to systematically identify and classify vulnerable road user (VRU) situations, particularly multi-pedestrian crossings, to support operational design domain incident analysis for robotaxis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As robotaxis are deployed in urban areas, they need reliable detection of vulnerable road users like pedestrians. End-to-end AI systems require high-quality data for training and evaluation within their operational design domains, necessitating systematic frameworks for incident analysis.

Method: Extended the SMIRK dataset to create MoreSMIRK - a structured dictionary of multi-pedestrian crossing situations. Used space-filling curves (SFCs) to transform multi-dimensional scenario features into characteristic patterns that can be matched with MoreSMIRK entries.

Result: Successfully evaluated PCICF on the PIE dataset containing 150+ annotated pedestrian crossing videos. The framework can identify and classify complex pedestrian crossings, including situations where groups merge or split.

Conclusion: PCICF effectively identifies and classifies VRU situations using computationally efficient components like SFCs, making it potentially suitable for onboard robotaxi use for operational design domain detection.

Abstract: We have recently observed the commercial roll-out of robotaxis in various
countries. They are deployed within an operational design domain (ODD) on
specific routes and environmental conditions, and are subject to continuous
monitoring to regain control in safety-critical situations. Since ODDs
typically cover urban areas, robotaxis must reliably detect vulnerable road
users (VRUs) such as pedestrians, bicyclists, or e-scooter riders. To better
handle such varied traffic situations, end-to-end AI, which directly compute
vehicle control actions from multi-modal sensor data instead of only for
perception, is on the rise. High quality data is needed for systematically
training and evaluating such systems within their OOD. In this work, we propose
PCICF, a framework to systematically identify and classify VRU situations to
support ODD's incident analysis. We base our work on the existing synthetic
dataset SMIRK, and enhance it by extending its single-pedestrian-only design
into the MoreSMIRK dataset, a structured dictionary of multi-pedestrian
crossing situations constructed systematically. We then use space-filling
curves (SFCs) to transform multi-dimensional features of scenarios into
characteristic patterns, which we match with corresponding entries in
MoreSMIRK. We evaluate PCICF with the large real-world dataset PIE, which
contains more than 150 manually annotated pedestrian crossing videos. We show
that PCICF can successfully identify and classify complex pedestrian crossings,
even when groups of pedestrians merge or split. By leveraging computationally
efficient components like SFCs, PCICF has even potential to be used onboard of
robotaxis for OOD detection for example. We share an open-source replication
package for PCICF containing its algorithms, the complete MoreSMIRK dataset and
dictionary, as well as our experiment results presented in:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniLat3D is a unified framework that generates 3D assets in a single stage by encoding geometry and appearance in a single latent space, eliminating the misalignment and inefficiency of traditional two-stage approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D generation uses two-stage pipelines that separate geometry and appearance generation, leading to geometry-texture misalignment and high computational costs.

Method: Developed a geometry-appearance Unified VAE that compresses high-resolution sparse features into a compact UniLat representation, then trained a single flow-matching model to map Gaussian noise directly into UniLat.

Result: UniLat3D generates high-quality 3D assets in seconds from a single image, achieving superior appearance fidelity and geometric quality compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The unified approach successfully addresses the limitations of decoupled 3D generation pipelines, enabling efficient and high-fidelity single-stage 3D asset creation.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D asset generation is crucial for various industries. While
recent 3D pretrained models show strong capability in producing realistic
content, most are built upon diffusion models and follow a two-stage pipeline
that first generates geometry and then synthesizes appearance. Such a decoupled
design tends to produce geometry-texture misalignment and non-negligible cost.
In this paper, we propose UniLat3D, a unified framework that encodes geometry
and appearance in a single latent space, enabling direct single-stage
generation. Our key contribution is a geometry-appearance Unified VAE, which
compresses high-resolution sparse features into a compact latent representation
-- UniLat. UniLat integrates structural and visual information into a dense
low-resolution latent, which can be efficiently decoded into diverse 3D
formats, e.g., 3D Gaussians and meshes. Based on this unified representation,
we train a single flow-matching model to map Gaussian noise directly into
UniLat, eliminating redundant stages. Trained solely on public datasets,
UniLat3D produces high-quality 3D assets in seconds from a single image,
achieving superior appearance fidelity and geometric quality. More demos \&
code are available at https://unilat3d.github.io/

Method: Proposes a novel spatio-angular latent space encoding both spatial appearance and angular viewpoint deviations, with strategic multi-step training process decomposition.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in consistency and latency, with competitive quality and text-image alignment.

Conclusion: RapidMV enables fast and consistent multi-view image generation from text, advancing text-to-3D asset creation.

Abstract: Generating synthetic multi-view images from a text prompt is an essential
bridge to generating synthetic 3D assets. In this work, we introduce RapidMV, a
novel text-to-multi-view generative model that can produce 32 multi-view
synthetic images in just around 5 seconds. In essence, we propose a novel
spatio-angular latent space, encoding both the spatial appearance and angular
viewpoint deviations into a single latent for improved efficiency and
multi-view consistency. We achieve effective training of RapidMV by
strategically decomposing our training process into multiple steps. We
demonstrate that RapidMV outperforms existing methods in terms of consistency
and latency, with competitive quality and text-image alignment.

### [277] [Score Distillation of Flow Matching Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25127)
*Mingyuan Zhou,Yi Gu,Huangjie Zheng,Liangchen Song,Guande He,Yizhe Zhang,Wenze Hu,Yinfei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Score identity Distillation (SiD) extends to flow-matching models, enabling efficient few-step generation without architectural changes or teacher finetuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models produce high-quality images but suffer from slow iterative sampling. While distillation methods help, it was unclear if they transfer to theoretically equivalent flow-matching models.

Method: Extends SiD to pretrained text-to-image flow-matching models using a simple derivation based on Bayes' rule and conditional expectations, unifying Gaussian diffusion and flow matching.

Result: SiD works out-of-the-box across various flow-matching models (SANA, SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Medium/Large, FLUX.1-dev) in both data-free and data-aided settings.

Conclusion: Score distillation broadly applies to text-to-image flow matching models, unifying acceleration techniques across diffusion- and flow-based generators.

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but are limited by
slow iterative sampling. Distillation methods alleviate this by enabling one-
or few-step generation. Flow matching, originally introduced as a distinct
framework, has since been shown to be theoretically equivalent to diffusion
under Gaussian assumptions, raising the question of whether distillation
techniques such as score distillation transfer directly. We provide a simple
derivation -- based on Bayes' rule and conditional expectations -- that unifies
Gaussian diffusion and flow matching without relying on ODE/SDE formulations.
Building on this view, we extend Score identity Distillation (SiD) to
pretrained text-to-image flow-matching models, including SANA, SD3-Medium,
SD3.5-Medium/Large, and FLUX.1-dev, all with DiT backbones. Experiments show
that, with only modest flow-matching- and DiT-specific adjustments, SiD works
out of the box across these models, in both data-free and data-aided settings,
without requiring teacher finetuning or architectural changes. This provides
the first systematic evidence that score distillation applies broadly to
text-to-image flow matching models, resolving prior concerns about stability
and soundness and unifying acceleration techniques across diffusion- and
flow-based generators. We will make the PyTorch implementation publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSM8K-V is a new visual mathematical reasoning benchmark that converts text-based GSM8K problems into purely visual multi-image format, revealing significant performance gaps between text and visual reasoning in current VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks are limited to geometry, lack math word problems, and rarely assess multi-image reasoning. There's a need for comprehensive visual reasoning evaluation that goes beyond text-based capabilities.

Method: Systematically mapped GSM8K text samples into visual form using an automated image-generation pipeline combined with human annotation, creating 1,319 high-quality multi-image mathematical reasoning samples.

Result: Current VLMs show substantial performance gap: Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves 95.22% on text GSM8K but only 46.93% on GSM8K-V, indicating visual reasoning remains a major challenge despite text saturation.

Conclusion: GSM8K-V provides a new perspective on visual mathematical reasoning and establishes a benchmark to guide development of more robust and generalizable vision language models.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) achieve unified modeling of images and text,
enabling them to accomplish complex real-world tasks through perception,
planning, and reasoning. Among these tasks, reasoning is particularly
representative, with mathematical reasoning serving as a prominent example. It
highlights the high-level capability of VLMs to comprehend mathematical
information in images and to perform sophisticated reasoning. Recently,
numerous visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks have been proposed, but they
are often restricted to geometry, lack coverage of math word problems, and
rarely assess reasoning across multiple images. To address these gaps, we
introduce GSM8K-V, a purely visual multi-image mathematical reasoning
benchmark. GSM8K-V is built by systematically mapping each sample from the
widely used text-based GSM8K into visual form. Through a carefully designed
automated image-generation pipeline combined with meticulous human annotation,
we curate 1,319 high-quality samples. We evaluate a wide range of open-source
and closed-source models on GSM8K-V. Results show that although existing VLMs
have nearly saturated performance on text-based GSM8K, there remains
substantial room for improvement on GSM8K-V. For example, the best-performing
model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves 95.22% accuracy on GSM8K but only 46.93% on
GSM8K-V. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of GSM8K-V, examining the

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proxy-GS introduces occlusion awareness to 3D Gaussian Splatting using a fast proxy system that generates occlusion depth maps, enabling efficient Gaussian culling and improved rendering quality in occluded scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS variants improve visual fidelity but introduce decoding overhead, and current pruning/LOD techniques still leave significant redundancy due to lack of occlusion awareness.

Method: A fast proxy system produces precise occlusion depth maps (1000x1000 resolution in <1ms) that guides Gaussian culling during rendering and densification during training to avoid inconsistencies in occluded regions.

Result: In heavily occluded scenarios like MatrixCity Streets, Proxy-GS achieves >2.5x speedup over Octree-GS while delivering substantially higher rendering quality, especially for MLP-based Gaussian splatting.

Conclusion: The proposed proxy-based occlusion awareness effectively reduces redundancy in 3D Gaussian Splatting, enabling both faster rendering and improved visual quality in complex occluded environments.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as an efficient approach for
achieving photorealistic rendering. Recent MLP-based variants further improve
visual fidelity but introduce substantial decoding overhead during rendering.
To alleviate computation cost, several pruning strategies and level-of-detail
(LOD) techniques have been introduced, aiming to effectively reduce the number
of Gaussian primitives in large-scale scenes. However, our analysis reveals
that significant redundancy still remains due to the lack of occlusion
awareness. In this work, we propose Proxy-GS, a novel pipeline that exploits a
proxy to introduce Gaussian occlusion awareness from any view. At the core of
our approach is a fast proxy system capable of producing precise occlusion
depth maps at a resolution of 1000x1000 under 1ms. This proxy serves two roles:
first, it guides the culling of anchors and Gaussians to accelerate rendering
speed. Second, it guides the densification towards surfaces during training,
avoiding inconsistencies in occluded regions, and improving the rendering
quality. In heavily occluded scenarios, such as the MatrixCity Streets dataset,
Proxy-GS not only equips MLP-based Gaussian splatting with stronger rendering
capability but also achieves faster rendering speed. Specifically, it achieves
more than 2.5x speedup over Octree-GS, and consistently delivers substantially
higher rendering quality. Code will be public upon acceptance.

*Aryan Yazdan Parast,Parsa Hosseini,Hesam Asadollahzadeh,Arshia Soltani Moakhar,Basim Azam,Soheil Feizi,Naveed Akhtar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GHOST is an automated method that generates natural-looking images to induce object hallucinations in MLLMs, achieving high success rates and uncovering transferable vulnerabilities across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current static benchmarks for studying object hallucination in MLLMs are limited and cannot uncover model-specific or unanticipated vulnerabilities, necessitating an active testing approach.

Method: GHOST optimizes in image embedding space to create misleading cues while keeping target objects absent, then uses a diffusion model to generate natural-looking images that induce hallucinations.

Result: GHOST achieves over 28% hallucination success rate (vs 1% in prior methods), generates high-quality object-free images, and reveals transferable vulnerabilities (66.5% transfer from Qwen2.5-VL to GPT-4o).

Conclusion: GHOST serves as both a diagnostic tool for uncovering hallucination vulnerabilities and a corrective tool through fine-tuning, enabling more reliable multimodal systems.

Abstract: Object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is a
persistent failure mode that causes the model to perceive objects absent in the
image. This weakness of MLLMs is currently studied using static benchmarks with
fixed visual scenarios, which preempts the possibility of uncovering
model-specific or unanticipated hallucination vulnerabilities. We introduce
GHOST (Generating Hallucinations via Optimizing Stealth Tokens), a method
designed to stress-test MLLMs by actively generating images that induce
hallucination. GHOST is fully automatic and requires no human supervision or
prior knowledge. It operates by optimizing in the image embedding space to
mislead the model while keeping the target object absent, and then guiding a
diffusion model conditioned on the embedding to generate natural-looking
images. The resulting images remain visually natural and close to the original
input, yet introduce subtle misleading cues that cause the model to
hallucinate. We evaluate our method across a range of models, including
reasoning models like GLM-4.1V-Thinking, and achieve a hallucination success
rate exceeding 28%, compared to around 1% in prior data-driven discovery
methods. We confirm that the generated images are both high-quality and
object-free through quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Also, GHOST
uncovers transferable vulnerabilities: images optimized for Qwen2.5-VL induce
hallucinations in GPT-4o at a 66.5% rate. Finally, we show that fine-tuning on
our images mitigates hallucination, positioning GHOST as both a diagnostic and
corrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems.

*Runmin Zhang,Jialiang Wang,Si-Yuan Cao,Zhu Yu,Junchen Yu,Guangyi Zhang,Hui-Liang Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCFlow is an unsupervised cross-modal flow estimation framework that uses decoupled optimization and cross-modal consistency constraints to address modality discrepancy and geometric misalignment without ground-truth flow supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches implicitly learn flow estimation from appearance similarity alone, which fails to address modality discrepancy and geometric misalignment between different modalities.

Method: Uses collaborative training of modality transfer and flow estimation networks with decoupled optimization strategy, geometry-aware data synthesis pipeline, outlier-robust loss, and cross-modal consistency constraint.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised approaches and can be integrated with various flow estimation networks.

Conclusion: DCFlow effectively addresses cross-modal flow estimation challenges through its novel decoupled optimization and consistency constraints, demonstrating superior performance in unsupervised settings.

Abstract: This work presents DCFlow, a novel unsupervised cross-modal flow estimation
framework that integrates a decoupled optimization strategy and a cross-modal
consistency constraint. Unlike previous approaches that implicitly learn flow
estimation solely from appearance similarity, we introduce a decoupled
optimization strategy with task-specific supervision to address modality
discrepancy and geometric misalignment distinctly. This is achieved by
collaboratively training a modality transfer network and a flow estimation
network. To enable reliable motion supervision without ground-truth flow, we
propose a geometry-aware data synthesis pipeline combined with an
outlier-robust loss. Additionally, we introduce a cross-modal consistency
constraint to jointly optimize both networks, significantly improving flow
prediction accuracy. For evaluation, we construct a comprehensive cross-modal
flow benchmark by repurposing public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate
that DCFlow can be integrated with various flow estimation networks and
achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised approaches.

*Wenkun He,Yuchao Gu,Junyu Chen,Dongyun Zou,Yujun Lin,Zhekai Zhang,Haocheng Xi,Muyang Li,Ligeng Zhu,Jincheng Yu,Junsong Chen,Enze Xie,Song Han,Han Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DC-Gen is a framework that accelerates text-to-image diffusion models by using deeply compressed latent spaces, achieving significant speedups (53x for 4K generation) while maintaining quality through lightweight embedding alignment and LoRA fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image diffusion models face efficiency challenges at high resolutions like 4K, and previous acceleration methods don't address the inherent redundancy in latent spaces.

Method: Uses a post-training pipeline with lightweight embedding alignment to bridge representation gaps between base and compressed latent spaces, followed by minimal LoRA fine-tuning to preserve generation quality.

Result: DC-Gen-SANA and DC-Gen-FLUX achieve comparable quality to base models with 53x latency reduction for 4K generation on H100 GPU, and 138x total reduction when combined with NVFP4 SVDQuant (3.5 seconds for 4K image on 5090 GPU).

Conclusion: DC-Gen provides an efficient framework for accelerating high-resolution text-to-image generation without compromising quality, demonstrating substantial speed improvements through latent space compression.

Abstract: Existing text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality
images, but face significant efficiency challenges when scaled to high
resolutions, like 4K image generation. While previous research accelerates
diffusion models in various aspects, it seldom handles the inherent redundancy
within the latent space. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces DC-Gen, a
general framework that accelerates text-to-image diffusion models by leveraging
a deeply compressed latent space. Rather than a costly training-from-scratch
approach, DC-Gen uses an efficient post-training pipeline to preserve the
quality of the base model. A key challenge in this paradigm is the
representation gap between the base model's latent space and a deeply
compressed latent space, which can lead to instability during direct
fine-tuning. To overcome this, DC-Gen first bridges the representation gap with
a lightweight embedding alignment training. Once the latent embeddings are
aligned, only a small amount of LoRA fine-tuning is needed to unlock the base
model's inherent generation quality. We verify DC-Gen's effectiveness on SANA
and FLUX.1-Krea. The resulting DC-Gen-SANA and DC-Gen-FLUX models achieve
quality comparable to their base models but with a significant speedup.
Specifically, DC-Gen-FLUX reduces the latency of 4K image generation by 53x on
the NVIDIA H100 GPU. When combined with NVFP4 SVDQuant, DC-Gen-FLUX generates a
4K image in just 3.5 seconds on a single NVIDIA 5090 GPU, achieving a total
latency reduction of 138x compared to the base FLUX.1-Krea model. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UI2V-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating Image-to-Video (I2V) generation models, focusing on semantic understanding and reasoning abilities rather than just video quality and temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing I2V evaluation benchmarks overlook models' ability to understand specific subject semantics in input images and ensure generated videos align with physical laws and human commonsense.

Method: Proposes four evaluation dimensions (spatial understanding, attribute binding, category understanding, reasoning) and two MLLM-based evaluation methods: instance-level pipeline for fine-grained semantic understanding and feedback-based reasoning pipeline for step-by-step causal assessment.

Result: Benchmark includes ~500 text-image pairs and evaluates various open-source and closed-source I2V models. Human evaluations show strong alignment with the proposed MLLM-based metrics.

Conclusion: UI2V-Bench fills a critical gap in I2V evaluation by emphasizing semantic comprehension and reasoning ability, providing a robust framework and dataset for future research and model development.

Abstract: Generative diffusion models are developing rapidly and attracting increasing
attention due to their wide range of applications. Image-to-Video (I2V)
generation has become a major focus in the field of video synthesis. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on aspects such as video quality
and temporal consistency, while largely overlooking the model's ability to
understand the semantics of specific subjects in the input image or to ensure
that the generated video aligns with physical laws and human commonsense. To
address this gap, we propose UI2V-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating I2V
models with a focus on semantic understanding and reasoning. It introduces four
primary evaluation dimensions: spatial understanding, attribute binding,
category understanding, and reasoning. To assess these dimensions, we design
two evaluation methods based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): an
instance-level pipeline for fine-grained semantic understanding, and a
feedback-based reasoning pipeline that enables step-by-step causal assessment
for more accurate evaluation. UI2V-Bench includes approximately 500 carefully
constructed text-image pairs and evaluates a range of both open source and
closed-source I2V models across all defined dimensions. We further incorporate
human evaluations, which show strong alignment with the proposed MLLM-based
metrics. Overall, UI2V-Bench fills a critical gap in I2V evaluation by
emphasizing semantic comprehension and reasoning ability, offering a robust
framework and dataset to support future research and model development in the
field.

Abstract: We introduce DC-VideoGen, a post-training acceleration framework for
efficient video generation. DC-VideoGen can be applied to any pre-trained video

innovations: (i) a Deep Compression Video Autoencoder with a novel chunk-causal
temporal design that achieves 32x/64x spatial and 4x temporal compression while
preserving reconstruction quality and generalization to longer videos; and (ii)
AE-Adapt-V, a robust adaptation strategy that enables rapid and stable transfer
of pre-trained models into the new latent space. Adapting the pre-trained

TL;DR: NeoWorld is a deep learning framework that generates interactive 3D virtual worlds from a single image using a hybrid approach that renders key objects in full 3D while synthesizing backgrounds in 2D for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by on-demand worldbuilding from Simulacron-3, the goal is to create expansive virtual environments where only actively explored regions are rendered with high visual realism, overcoming limitations of global world generation and 2D hallucination methods.

Method: Uses object-centric 3D representations with a hybrid scene structure - key foreground objects are modeled in full 3D while backgrounds and non-interacted regions are synthesized in 2D. Implements cutting-edge representation learning and object-to-3D techniques for flexible viewpoint manipulation and physically plausible animation controlled by natural language commands.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing 2D and depth-layered 2.5D methods on the WorldScore benchmark. Enables progressive unfolding of virtual worlds with increasing 3D detail as users interact, delivering dynamic, immersive, and visually coherent exploration experiences.

Conclusion: NeoWorld successfully demonstrates a novel approach to interactive 3D world generation that balances visual realism with computational efficiency through its hybrid 3D/2D rendering strategy, enabling natural language-controlled object appearance and dynamics in progressively unfolding virtual environments.

Abstract: We introduce NeoWorld, a deep learning framework for generating interactive
3D virtual worlds from a single input image. Inspired by the on-demand
worldbuilding concept in the science fiction novel Simulacron-3 (1964), our
system constructs expansive environments where only the regions actively
explored by the user are rendered with high visual realism through
object-centric 3D representations. Unlike previous approaches that rely on
global world generation or 2D hallucination, NeoWorld models key foreground
objects in full 3D, while synthesizing backgrounds and non-interacted regions
in 2D to ensure efficiency. This hybrid scene structure, implemented with
cutting-edge representation learning and object-to-3D techniques, enables
flexible viewpoint manipulation and physically plausible scene animation,
allowing users to control object appearance and dynamics using natural language
commands. As users interact with the environment, the virtual world
progressively unfolds with increasing 3D detail, delivering a dynamic,
immersive, and visually coherent exploration experience. NeoWorld significantly
outperforms existing 2D and depth-layered 2.5D methods on the WorldScore

### [286] [Beyond Isolated Facts: Synthesizing Narrative and Grounded Supervision for VideoQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24445)
*Jianxin Liang,Tan Yue,Yuxuan Wang,Yueqian Wang,Zhihan Yin,Huishuai Zhang,Dongyan Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework that synthesizes richer supervisory signals for VideoQA by generating narrative paragraphs (QBP) and visual rationales (QBC) from existing question-answer pairs, improving model accuracy, generalization, and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VideoQA supervision with isolated factual QA pairs fails to capture narrative and causal structure, limiting models to shallow video understanding.

Method: Two strategies: Question-Based Paraphrasing (QBP) synthesizes diverse inquiries into holistic narrative paragraphs; Question-Based Captioning (QBC) generates fine-grained visual rationales grounding answers in specific evidence. Uses generative models to create synthetic data for unified next-token prediction training.

Result: Significant accuracy gains: improved 3B model to 72.5% on STAR (+4.9%) and 7B model to 80.8% on NExT-QA. Both QBP and QBC enhance cross-dataset generalization, with QBP accelerating model convergence by over 2.5x.

Conclusion: Shifting from isolated facts to narrative coherence and grounded rationales yields more accurate, efficient, and generalizable VideoQA training paradigm.

Abstract: The performance of Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models is fundamentally
constrained by the nature of their supervision, which typically consists of
isolated, factual question-answer pairs. This "bag-of-facts" approach fails to
capture the underlying narrative and causal structure of events, limiting
models to a shallow understanding of video content. To move beyond this
paradigm, we introduce a framework to synthesize richer supervisory signals. We
propose two complementary strategies: Question-Based Paraphrasing (QBP), which
synthesizes the diverse inquiries (what, how, why) from a video's existing set
of question-answer pairs into a holistic narrative paragraph that reconstructs
the video's event structure; and Question-Based Captioning (QBC), which
generates fine-grained visual rationales, grounding the answer to each question
in specific, relevant evidence. Leveraging powerful generative models, we use
this synthetic data to train VideoQA models under a unified next-token
prediction objective. Extensive experiments on STAR and NExT-QA validate our
approach, demonstrating significant accuracy gains and establishing new
state-of-the-art results, such as improving a 3B model to 72.5\% on STAR
(+4.9\%) and a 7B model to 80.8\% on NExT-QA. Beyond accuracy, our analysis
reveals that both QBP and QBC substantially enhance cross-dataset
generalization, with QBP additionally accelerating model convergence by over
2.5x. These results demonstrate that shifting data synthesis from isolated
facts to narrative coherence and grounded rationales yields a more accurate,
efficient, and generalizable training paradigm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a dual-model ensemble approach using knowledge distillation for general anomaly detection, combining specialized models for industrial and semantic anomaly detection with state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current anomaly detection methods are biased towards industrial inspection and struggle with generalization across different domains like semantic anomaly detection. Existing general AD methods are sensitive to dataset-specific settings and single-class tasks.

Method: Dual-model ensemble framework with teacher and two student models: Encoder-Decoder model for industrial AD (patch-level minor defects) and Encoder-Encoder model for semantic AD. Uses shared DINOv2 encoder, joint learning with Noisy-OR objective, and combines local and semantic anomaly scores via joint probability.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance across 8 benchmarks: 99.7% AUROC on MVTec-AD (industrial) and 97.8% on CIFAR-10 (semantic), outperforming prior general AD models and even best specialist models in multi-class settings.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-model ensemble approach successfully bridges the gap between industrial and semantic anomaly detection, demonstrating strong generalization across multiple domains and both single-class and multi-class settings.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays an important role in various real-world
applications. Recent advancements in AD, however, are often biased towards
industrial inspection, struggle to generalize to broader tasks like semantic
anomaly detection and vice versa. Although recent methods have attempted to
address general anomaly detection, their performance remains sensitive to
dataset-specific settings and single-class tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel dual-model ensemble approach based on knowledge distillation (KD) to
bridge this gap. Our framework consists of a teacher and two student models: an
Encoder-Decoder model, specialized in detecting patch-level minor defects for
industrial AD and an Encoder-Encoder model, optimized for semantic AD. Both
models leverage a shared pre-trained encoder (DINOv2) to extract high-quality
feature representations. The dual models are jointly learned using the Noisy-OR
objective, and the final anomaly score is obtained using the joint probability
via local and semantic anomaly scores derived from the respective models. We
evaluate our method on eight public benchmarks under both single-class and
multi-class settings: MVTec-AD, MVTec-LOCO, VisA and Real-IAD for industrial
inspection and CIFAR-10/100, FMNIST and View for semantic anomaly detection.
The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art accuracies in both domains, in
multi-class as well as single-class settings, demonstrating generalization
across multiple domains of anomaly detection. Our model achieved an image-level
AUROC of 99.7% on MVTec-AD and 97.8% on CIFAR-10, which is significantly better
than the prior general AD models in multi-class settings and even higher than
the best specialist models on individual benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a selective representation framework for second-hand fashion image retrieval that reduces database size to 10% without sacrificing accuracy, using clustering, coreset selection, and outlier removal methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The fashion industry's environmental impact drives interest in second-hand markets, requiring scalable image retrieval systems for large-scale garment valuation.

Method: Uses clustering and coreset selection to identify representative samples, plus an outlier removal method based on neighbour-homogeneity consistency score to filter uncharacteristic samples before selection.

Result: Achieves near-optimal retrieval accuracy while reducing computational costs by shrinking databases to 10% of original size. Outlier removal further improves performance by eliminating non-discriminative samples.

Conclusion: The framework provides an effective performance-efficiency trade-off for scalable second-hand fashion image retrieval, enabling more efficient marketplace operations with minimal accuracy loss.

Abstract: The fashion industry has been identified as a major contributor to waste and
emissions, leading to an increased interest in promoting the second-hand
market. Machine learning methods play an important role in facilitating the
creation and expansion of second-hand marketplaces by enabling the large-scale
valuation of used garments. We contribute to this line of work by addressing
the scalability of second-hand image retrieval from databases. By introducing a
selective representation framework, we can shrink databases to 10% of their
original size without sacrificing retrieval accuracy. We first explore
clustering and coreset selection methods to identify representative samples
that capture the key features of each garment and its internal variability.
Then, we introduce an efficient outlier removal method, based on a
neighbour-homogeneity consistency score measure, that filters out
uncharacteristic samples prior to selection. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets: DeepFashion Attribute, DeepFashion Con2Shop, and DeepFashion2.
The results demonstrate a clear performance-efficiency trade-off by
strategically pruning and selecting representative vectors of images. The
retrieval system maintains near-optimal accuracy, while greatly reducing
computational costs by reducing the images added to the vector database.
Furthermore, applying our outlier removal method to clustering techniques
yields even higher retrieval performance by removing non-discriminative samples
before the selection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal segmentation methods suffer from imbalanced modal dependencies where performance degrades significantly when dominant modalities deteriorate in real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposed EQUISeg framework with four-stage Cross-modal Transformer Block for efficient multimodal fusion and hierarchical selection, plus Self-guided Module with mutual guidance mechanism for adaptive modality contribution adjustment.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show EQUISeg achieves significant performance gains and effectively alleviates adverse effects of modality imbalance.

Conclusion: EQUISeg successfully addresses the critical challenge of modality balance in practical multimodal segmentation through equal encoding and mutual guidance mechanisms.

Abstract: Multimodal semantic segmentation enhances model robustness by exploiting
cross-modal complementarities. However, existing methods often suffer from
imbalanced modal dependencies, where overall performance degrades significantly
once a dominant modality deteriorates in real-world scenarios. Thus, modality
balance has become acritical challenge for practical multimodal segmentation.
To address this issue, we propose EQUISeg, a multimodal segmentation framework
that balances modality contributions through equal encoding of modalities.
Built upon a four-stage Cross-modal Transformer Block(CMTB), EQUISeg enables
efficient multimodal fusion and hierarchical selection. Furthermore, we design
a Self-guided Module(SGM) that mitigates modality imbalance by introducing a
mutual guidance mechanism, enabling each modality to adaptively adjust its
contribution and enhance robustness under degraded conditions. Extensive
experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that EQUISeg achieves significant
performance gains and effectively alleviates the adverse effects of modality
imbalance in segmentation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard CLIP text encoders often fail in complex scenes with many objects during instruction-driven image editing, particularly in enforcing object counts and spatial layouts while handling diverse categories.

Method: QL-Adapter consists of ILFM that fuses layout priors with ViT patch tokens to strengthen spatial understanding, and CMAM that injects image features into the text branch to enrich textual embeddings.

Conclusion: QL-Adapter effectively addresses the limitations of standard CLIP-based editing in complex scenes by integrating layout priors and cross-modal augmentation, demonstrating superior performance in quantity and layout consistent image editing.

Abstract: Instruction driven image editing with standard CLIP text encoders often fails
in complex scenes with many objects. We present QL-Adapter, a framework for
multiple object editing that tackles two challenges: enforcing object counts

of two core modules: the Image-Layout Fusion Module (ILFM) and the Cross-Modal

the CLIP image encoder to strengthen spatial structure understanding. CMAM
injects image features into the text branch to enrich textual embeddings and
improve instruction following. We further build QL-Dataset, a benchmark that
spans broad category, layout, and count variations, and define the task of
quantity and layout consistent image editing (QL-Edit). Extensive experiments
show that QL-Adapter achieves state of the art performance on QL-Edit and
significantly outperforms existing models.

*Kaizhen Zhu,Mokai Pan,Zhechuan Yu,Jingya Wang,Jingyi Yu,Ye Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper provides the first unified theoretical and experimental comparison between Diffusion Bridge and Flow Matching, showing that Diffusion Bridge has lower cost function and more stable trajectories, while Flow Matching becomes less effective with reduced training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is confusion about which approach (Diffusion Bridge vs Flow Matching) is generally preferable for distribution transformation, and substantial discrepancies in their modeling assumptions have hindered unified theoretical understanding of their relative merits.

Method: Recast both frameworks through Stochastic Optimal Control and Optimal Transport perspectives, propose a novel latent Transformer architecture for Diffusion Bridge, implement Flow Matching with same structure for fair comparison, and conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple tasks while varying distributional discrepancy and training data size.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows Diffusion Bridge has lower cost function guiding toward more stable trajectories, while Flow Matching's interpolation coefficients become ineffective with reduced training data. Empirical results across Image Inpainting, Super-Resolution, Deblurring, Denoising, Translation, and Style Transfer tasks perfectly align with theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: The study systematically delineates the respective advantages and disadvantages of Diffusion Bridge and Flow Matching models, providing clear guidance on when each approach is preferable based on theoretical insights and extensive experimental validation.

Abstract: Diffusion Bridge and Flow Matching have both demonstrated compelling
empirical performance in transformation between arbitrary distributions.
However, there remains confusion about which approach is generally preferable,
and the substantial discrepancies in their modeling assumptions and practical
implementations have hindered a unified theoretical account of their relative
merits. We have, for the first time, provided a unified theoretical and
experimental validation of these two models. We recast their frameworks through
the lens of Stochastic Optimal Control and prove that the cost function of the
Diffusion Bridge is lower, guiding the system toward more stable and natural
trajectories. Simultaneously, from the perspective of Optimal Transport,
interpolation coefficients $t$ and $1-t$ of Flow Matching become increasingly
ineffective when the training data size is reduced. To corroborate these
theoretical claims, we propose a novel, powerful architecture for Diffusion

*Yuhao Wang,Zhuoran Zheng,Han Hu,Dianjie Lu,Guijuan Zhang,Chen Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a crowd counting method for foggy environments using atmospheric scattering physics and neural networks to address visibility challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address key challenges in crowd counting in foggy environments: long-range target blurring, local feature degradation, and image contrast attenuation.

Method: Uses differentiable atmospheric scattering model with transmittance estimation and scattering parameter calibration, MSA-KAN for learnable edge activation, and weather-aware GCN with dynamic spatial adjacency matrices.

Result: Achieves 12.2%-27.5% reduction in MAE metrics compared to mainstream algorithms in dense fog scenarios across four public datasets.

Conclusion: The synergistic optimization of physical mechanisms and data-driven approaches significantly improves crowd counting accuracy under complex meteorological conditions.

Abstract: Aiming at the key challenges of crowd counting in foggy environments, such as
long-range target blurring, local feature degradation, and image contrast
attenuation, this paper proposes a crowd-counting method with a physical a
priori of atmospheric scattering, which improves crowd counting accuracy under
complex meteorological conditions through the synergistic optimization of the
physical mechanism and data-driven.Specifically, first, the method introduces a
differentiable atmospheric scattering model and employs transmittance dynamic
estimation and scattering parameter adaptive calibration techniques to
accurately quantify the nonlinear attenuation laws of haze on targets with
different depths of field.Secondly, the MSA-KAN was designed based on the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem to construct a learnable edge
activation function. By integrating a multi-layer progressive architecture with
adaptive skip connections, it significantly enhances the model's nonlinear
representation capability in feature-degraded regions, effectively suppressing
feature confusion under fog interference.Finally, we further propose a
weather-aware GCN that dynamically constructs spatial adjacency matrices using
deep features extracted by MSA-KAN. Experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves a 12.2\%-27.5\% reduction in MAE metrics
compared to mainstream algorithms in dense fog scenarios.

### [294] [TokenSwap: Backdoor Attack on the Compositional Understanding of Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24566)
*Zhifang Zhang,Qiqi Tao,Jiaqi Lv,Na Zhao,Lei Feng,Joey Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenSwap is a stealthy backdoor attack on large vision-language models that subtly disrupts object relationship understanding rather than forcing fixed target patterns, making it harder to detect than traditional backdoor attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attacks on LVLMs use fixed target patterns that are easily detectable due to model overconfidence. TokenSwap aims to create more evasive attacks by targeting compositional understanding rather than specific outputs.

Method: TokenSwap injects visual triggers into training samples and simultaneously swaps grammatical roles of key tokens in textual answers. It uses an adaptive token-weighted loss to emphasize learning of swapped tokens, associating visual triggers with bags-of-words behavior.

Result: Extensive experiments show TokenSwap achieves high attack success rates while maintaining superior evasiveness and stealthiness across multiple benchmarks and various LVLM architectures.

Conclusion: TokenSwap demonstrates that backdoor attacks can be made more stealthy by targeting compositional understanding capabilities rather than enforcing fixed output patterns, highlighting new security vulnerabilities in LVLMs.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, while they remain vulnerable to
backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks on LVLMs aim to force the victim
model to generate a predefined target pattern, which is either inserted into or
replaces the original content. We find that these fixed-pattern attacks are
relatively easy to detect, because the attacked LVLM tends to memorize such
frequent patterns in the training dataset, thereby exhibiting overconfidence on
these targets given poisoned inputs. To address these limitations, we introduce
TokenSwap, a more evasive and stealthy backdoor attack that focuses on the
compositional understanding capabilities of LVLMs. Instead of enforcing a fixed
targeted content, TokenSwap subtly disrupts the understanding of object
relationships in text. Specifically, it causes the backdoored model to generate
outputs that mention the correct objects in the image but misrepresent their
relationships (i.e., bags-of-words behavior). During training, TokenSwap
injects a visual trigger into selected samples and simultaneously swaps the
grammatical roles of key tokens in the corresponding textual answers. However,
the poisoned samples exhibit only subtle differences from the original ones,
making it challenging for the model to learn the backdoor behavior. To address
this, TokenSwap employs an adaptive token-weighted loss that explicitly
emphasizes the learning of swapped tokens, such that the visual triggers and
bags-of-words behavior are associated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TokenSwap achieves high attack success rates while maintaining superior
evasiveness and stealthiness across multiple benchmarks and various LVLM
architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a 3D Bidirectional Face-Skull Morphable Model (BFSM) that enables shape inference between faces and skulls through a shared coefficient space, addressing the scarcity of paired data and including rare craniofacial conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in joint face-skull modeling including scarce paired data, insufficient registration accuracy, limited clinical applications, and underrepresentation of craniofacial deformity cases.

Method: Constructed a dataset of 200+ samples with CT-based skulls, CT-based faces, and textured face scans; developed a dense ray matching registration method; created BFSM with shared coefficient space for bidirectional shape inference and tissue thickness modeling.

Result: The model enables accurate 3D face-skull reconstruction from single images and surgical planning prediction, with extensive experiments confirming robustness and accuracy.

Conclusion: BFSM successfully addresses key challenges in face-skull modeling and demonstrates strong potential for medical applications including diagnostics, surgical planning, and facial simulation.

Abstract: Building a joint face-skull morphable model holds great potential for
applications such as remote diagnostics, surgical planning, medical education,
and physically based facial simulation. However, realizing this vision is
constrained by the scarcity of paired face-skull data, insufficient
registration accuracy, and limited exploration of reconstruction and clinical
applications. Moreover, individuals with craniofacial deformities are often
overlooked, resulting in underrepresentation and limited inclusivity. To
address these challenges, we first construct a dataset comprising over 200
samples, including both normal cases and rare craniofacial conditions. Each
case contains a CT-based skull, a CT-based face, and a high-fidelity textured
face scan. Secondly, we propose a novel dense ray matching registration method
that ensures topological consistency across face, skull, and their tissue
correspondences. Based on this, we introduce the 3D Bidirectional Face-Skull
Morphable Model (BFSM), which enables shape inference between the face and
skull through a shared coefficient space, while also modeling tissue thickness
variation to support one-to-many facial reconstructions from the same skull,
reflecting individual changes such as fat over time. Finally, we demonstrate
the potential of BFSM in medical applications, including 3D face-skull
reconstruction from a single image and surgical planning prediction. Extensive
experiments confirm the robustness and accuracy of our method. BFSM is

*Mohamad Abou Ali,Mariam Abdulfattah,Baraah Al Hussein,Fadi Dornaika,Ali Cherry,Mohamad Hajj-Hassan,Lara Hamawy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Comprehensive evaluation of YOLOv11 variants for peripheral blood smear detection shows YOLOv11 Medium achieves best trade-off with 0.934 mAP@0.5, outperforming larger models while being computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual peripheral blood smear analysis is labor-intensive and subjective, creating need for automated deep learning solutions. Lack of systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art models like YOLOv11 for fine-grained blood cell detection.

Method: Curated large-scale annotated dataset (16,891 images, 298,850 cells across 13 classes) and conducted comprehensive evaluation of five YOLOv11 variants under two data splitting strategies (70:20:10 and 80:10:10) using multiple performance metrics.

Result: YOLOv11 Medium achieved best trade-off with mAP@0.5 of 0.934 under 80:10:10 split. Larger models provided only marginal accuracy gains at substantially higher computational cost. 80:10:10 split consistently outperformed 70:20:10 split across all models.

Conclusion: YOLOv11, particularly Medium variant, is highly effective for automated fine-grained peripheral blood smear detection. Released dataset serves as valuable resource for advancing blood cell detection research in hematology.

Abstract: Manual peripheral blood smear (PBS) analysis is labor intensive and
subjective. While deep learning offers a promising alternative, a systematic
evaluation of state of the art models such as YOLOv11 for fine grained PBS
detection is still lacking. In this work, we make two key contributions. First,
we curate a large scale annotated dataset for blood cell detection and
classification, comprising 16,891 images across 12 peripheral blood cell (PBC)
classes, along with the red blood cell class, all carefully re annotated for
object detection tasks. In total, the dataset contains 298,850 annotated cells.
Second, we leverage this dataset to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of five
YOLOv11 variants (ranging from Nano to XLarge). These models are rigorously
benchmarked under two data splitting strategies (70:20:10 and 80:10:10) and
systematically assessed using multiple performance criteria, including mean
Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, F1 score, and computational
efficiency. Our experiments show that the YOLOv11 Medium variant achieves the
best trade off, reaching a mAP@0.5 of 0.934 under the 8:1:1 split. Larger
models (Large and XLarge) provide only marginal accuracy gains at substantially
higher computational cost. Moreover, the 8:1:1 split consistently outperforms
the 7:2:1 split across all models. These findings highlight YOLOv11,
particularly the Medium variant, as a highly effective framework for automated,
fine grained PBS detection. Beyond benchmarking, our publicly released dataset
(github.com/Mohamad-AbouAli/OI-PBC-Dataset) offers a valuable resource to
advance research on blood cell detection and classification in hematology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents an unsupervised framework using structured optimal transport (SOT) with ASTGCN for automatic temporal segmentation of javelin-throw motions, achieving 71.02% mAP and 74.61% F1-score without manual labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sports analytics methods are time-consuming, costly, and lack scalability due to reliance on manual annotation or lab instrumentation. There's a need for automatic extraction of kinetic variables through robust temporal segmentation.

Method: Novel unsupervised framework combining structured optimal transport (SOT) with Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ASTGCN) for contextually aware segmentation of javelin-throw motion phases.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods with 71.02% mean average precision (mAP) and 74.61% F1-score on test data. A new dataset of 211 manually annotated professional javelin-throw videos is also released.

Conclusion: The proposed SOT-augmented ASTGCN framework enables effective automatic motion phase segmentation without expensive manual labeling, providing a scalable solution for sports analytics in javelin-throw and potentially other athletic disciplines.

Abstract: Precise analysis of athletic motion is central to sports analytics,
particularly in disciplines where nuanced biomechanical phases directly impact
performance outcomes. Traditional analytics techniques rely on manual
annotation or laboratory-based instrumentation, which are time-consuming,
costly, and lack scalability. Automatic extraction of relevant kinetic
variables requires a robust and contextually appropriate temporal segmentation.
Considering the specific case of elite javelin-throw, we present a novel
unsupervised framework for such a contextually aware segmentation, which
applies the structured optimal transport (SOT) concept to augment the
well-known Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network
(ASTGCN). This enables the identification of motion phase transitions without
requiring expensive manual labeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, achieving 71.02%
mean average precision (mAP) and 74.61% F1-score on test data, substantially
higher than competing baselines. We also release a new dataset of 211 manually
annotated professional javelin-throw videos with frame-level annotations,
covering key biomechanical phases: approach steps, drive, throw, and recovery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeRet is a plug-and-play framework that converts any multimodal large language model (MLLM) into a two-stage retriever without additional training, using semantic embeddings for fast search and reasoning for precise reranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs require heavy post-hoc training to become contrastive encoders for retrieval, so the authors aim to enable off-the-shelf MLLMs to serve as powerful retrievers without additional training.

Method: FreeRet uses a two-stage approach: 1) derives semantically grounded embeddings directly from MLLMs for fast candidate search, bypassing lexical alignment layers; 2) exploits MLLM reasoning ability for precise reranking with neutral choice framing to mitigate framing effects.

Result: On MMEB and MMEB-V2 benchmarks spanning 46 datasets, FreeRet substantially outperforms models trained on millions of pairs. It scales across MLLM families and sizes, preserves generative abilities, supports arbitrary modality combinations, and unifies retrieval, reranking, and generation.

Conclusion: Pretrained MLLMs, when carefully harnessed, can serve as strong retrieval engines without training, closing a critical gap in their role as generalists.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are emerging as versatile
foundations for mixed-modality retrieval. Yet, they often require heavy
post-hoc training to convert them into contrastive encoders for retrieval. This
work asks: Can off-the-shelf MLLMs serve as powerful retrievers without
additional training? We present FreeRet, a plug-and-play framework that turns
any MLLM into a two-stage retriever. FreeRet first derives semantically
grounded embeddings directly from the model for fast candidate search, and then
exploits its reasoning ability for precise reranking. The framework contributes
three advances: bypassing lexical alignment layers to obtain semantically
faithful embeddings, conditioning representation generation with explicit
priors, and mitigating framing effect in reranking via neutral choice framing.
On the MMEB and MMEB-V2 benchmarks spanning 46 datasets, FreeRet substantially
outperforms models trained on millions of pairs. Beyond benchmarks, FreeRet is
model-agnostic and scales seamlessly across MLLM families and sizes, preserves
their generative abilities, supports arbitrary modality combinations, and
unifies retrieval, reranking, and generation into end-to-end RAG within a
single model. Our findings demonstrate that pretrained MLLMs, when carefully
harnessed, can serve as strong retrieval engines without training, closing a
critical gap in their role as generalists.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RIFLE is a diffusion-based framework that removes flicker-banding (alternating bright-dark stripes) from photos of emissive displays while preserving fine details, using a flicker-banding prior estimator and masked loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flicker-banding frequently degrades photos of screens due to temporal aliasing between camera rolling-shutter and display modulation, severely impacting readability and quality, yet remains underexplored compared to moire degradation.

Method: Proposes RIFLE with flicker-banding prior estimator (FPE) to predict banding attributes, masked loss to focus supervision on banded regions, and a simulation pipeline to synthesize realistic FB with stochastic jitter in banding parameters.

Result: RIFLE consistently outperforms recent image reconstruction baselines across quantitative metrics and visual comparisons on real-world dataset, from mild to severe flicker-banding conditions.

Conclusion: First work to research simulation and removal of flicker-banding, establishing foundation for subsequent research in dataset construction and removal model design.

Abstract: Capturing screens is now routine in our everyday lives. But the photographs
of emissive displays are often influenced by the flicker-banding (FB), which is
alternating bright%u2013dark stripes that arise from temporal aliasing between
a camera's rolling-shutter readout and the display's brightness modulation.
Unlike moire degradation, which has been extensively studied, the FB remains
underexplored despite its frequent and severe impact on readability and
perceived quality. We formulate FB removal as a dedicated restoration task and
introduce Removal of Image Flicker-Banding via Latent Diffusion Enhancement,
RIFLE, a diffusion-based framework designed to remove FB while preserving fine
details. We propose the flicker-banding prior estimator (FPE) that predicts key
banding attributes and injects it into the restoration network. Additionally,
Masked Loss (ML) is proposed to concentrate supervision on banded regions
without sacrificing global fidelity. To overcome data scarcity, we provide a
simulation pipeline that synthesizes FB in the luminance domain with stochastic
jitter in banding angle, banding spacing, and banding width. Feathered
boundaries and sensor noise are also applied for a more realistic simulation.
For evaluation, we collect a paired real-world FB dataset with pixel-aligned
banding-free references captured via long exposure. Across quantitative metrics
and visual comparisons on our real-world dataset, RIFLE consistently
outperforms recent image reconstruction baselines from mild to severe
flicker-banding. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to research
the simulation and removal of FB. Our work establishes a great foundation for
subsequent research in both the dataset construction and the removal model
design. Our dataset and code will be released soon.

*Adil Kaan Akan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This thesis introduces SlotAdapt, a framework that adapts pretrained diffusion models for object-centric image and video synthesis while maintaining global scene coherence and enabling fine-grained object control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models treat images holistically and rely on text conditioning, creating a mismatch for object-level editing. The goal is to bridge the gap between human object-based perception and machine learning for controllable generation.

Method: Integrates lightweight, slot-based conditioning into pretrained diffusion models. For images: uses register token for background/style and slot-conditioned modules for objects. For videos: uses Invariant Slot Attention (ISA) to separate object identity from pose and Transformer-based temporal aggregator for consistent object representations across frames.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in object discovery, segmentation, compositional editing, and controllable image generation. For videos, establishes new benchmarks in unsupervised video object segmentation and reconstruction, supporting advanced editing tasks like object removal, replacement, and insertion without explicit supervision.

Conclusion: Establishes a general and scalable approach to object-centric generative modeling that bridges human perception with machine learning, expanding the design space for interactive and structured generative tools across creative, scientific, and practical domains.

Abstract: A central goal in AI is to represent scenes as compositions of discrete
objects, enabling fine-grained, controllable image and video generation. Yet
leading diffusion models treat images holistically and rely on text
conditioning, creating a mismatch for object-level editing. This thesis
introduces a framework that adapts powerful pretrained diffusion models for
object-centric synthesis while retaining their generative capacity.
  We identify a core challenge: balancing global scene coherence with
disentangled object control. Our method integrates lightweight, slot-based
conditioning into pretrained models, preserving their visual priors while
providing object-specific manipulation. For images, SlotAdapt augments
diffusion models with a register token for background/style and
slot-conditioned modules for objects, reducing text-conditioning bias and
achieving state-of-the-art results in object discovery, segmentation,
compositional editing, and controllable image generation.
  We further extend the framework to video. Using Invariant Slot Attention
(ISA) to separate object identity from pose and a Transformer-based temporal
aggregator, our approach maintains consistent object representations and
dynamics across frames. This yields new benchmarks in unsupervised video object
segmentation and reconstruction, and supports advanced editing tasks such as
object removal, replacement, and insertion without explicit supervision.
  Overall, this work establishes a general and scalable approach to
object-centric generative modeling for images and videos. By bridging human
object-based perception and machine learning, it expands the design space for
interactive, structured, and user-driven generative tools in creative,
scientific, and practical domains.

Motivation: Open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation requires high generalization for unseen categories, and existing methods show that classification components significantly impact segmentation performance.

Method: Proposed a classifier-centric adaptive framework with lightweight text adapter using layered asymmetric initialization to enhance classification.

Result: Achieved substantial improvements: cIoU increased from 0.443 to 0.493, cSm from 0.579 to 0.658, and cMAE reduced from 0.336 to 0.239 on OVCamo benchmark.

Conclusion: Targeted classification enhancement effectively advances camouflaged object segmentation performance.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation requires models to segment
camouflaged objects of arbitrary categories unseen during training, placing
extremely high demands on generalization capabilities. Through analysis of
existing methods, it is observed that the classification component
significantly affects overall segmentation performance. Accordingly, a
classifier-centric adaptive framework is proposed to enhance segmentation
performance by improving the classification component via a lightweight text
adapter with a novel layered asymmetric initialization. Through the
classification enhancement, the proposed method achieves substantial
improvements in segmentation metrics compared to the OVCoser baseline on the
OVCamo benchmark: cIoU increases from 0.443 to 0.493, cSm from 0.579 to 0.658,
and cMAE reduces from 0.336 to 0.239. These results demonstrate that targeted
classification enhancement provides an effective approach for advancing
camouflaged object segmentation performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TBI lesions are extremely heterogeneous in size, number, and laterality, which complicates neuroimaging analysis tasks like image registration and brain parcellation, reducing analytical accuracy. Accurate segmentation is essential for reliable neuroimaging analysis.

Method: The pipeline uses various architectures within the nnUNet framework for initial segmentation, complemented by post-processing strategies to enhance evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The developed automated segmentation pipeline effectively addresses the challenge of TBI lesion segmentation, with the Python implementation being publicly available for further use and development.

Abstract: The identification and segmentation of moderate-severe traumatic brain injury
(TBI) lesions pose a significant challenge in neuroimaging. This difficulty
arises from the extreme heterogeneity of these lesions, which vary in size,
number, and laterality, thereby complicating downstream image processing tasks
such as image registration and brain parcellation, reducing the analytical
accuracy. Thus, developing methods for highly accurate segmentation of TBI
lesions is essential for reliable neuroimaging analysis. This study aims to
develop an effective automated segmentation pipeline to automatically detect
and segment TBI lesions in T1-weighted MRI scans. We evaluate multiple
approaches to achieve accurate segmentation of the TBI lesions. The core of our
pipeline leverages various architectures within the nnUNet framework for
initial segmentation, complemented by post-processing strategies to enhance
evaluation metrics. Our final submission to the challenge achieved an accuracy
of 0.8451, Dice score values of 0.4711 and 0.8514 for images with and without

*Yutong Hao,Chen Chen,Ajmal Saeed Mian,Chang Xu,Daochang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free framework that improves physical plausibility in video generation by using physics-aware reasoning to create counterfactual prompts and a novel Synchronized Decoupled Guidance strategy to suppress implausible content during denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for video generation implicitly learn physics from large datasets, which is costly, difficult to scale, and still produces physically implausible motions that violate fundamental physical laws.

Method: Uses a lightweight physics-aware reasoning pipeline to create counterfactual prompts encoding physics-violating behaviors, combined with Synchronized Decoupled Guidance (SDG) featuring synchronized directional normalization to counteract lagged suppression and trajectory-decoupled denoising to mitigate cumulative trajectory bias.

Result: Experiments across different physical domains show substantial enhancement in physical fidelity while maintaining photorealism, with no additional training required. Both the physics-aware reasoning component and SDG are validated as critically effective.

Conclusion: Establishes a new plug-and-play physics-aware paradigm for video generation that explicitly reasons about physical plausibility at inference time without requiring model retraining.

Abstract: Diffusion models can generate realistic videos, but existing methods rely on
implicitly learning physical reasoning from large-scale text-video datasets,
which is costly, difficult to scale, and still prone to producing implausible
motions that violate fundamental physical laws. We introduce a training-free
framework that improves physical plausibility at inference time by explicitly
reasoning about implausibility and guiding the generation away from it.
Specifically, we employ a lightweight physics-aware reasoning pipeline to
construct counterfactual prompts that deliberately encode physics-violating
behaviors. Then, we propose a novel Synchronized Decoupled Guidance (SDG)
strategy, which leverages these prompts through synchronized directional
normalization to counteract lagged suppression and trajectory-decoupled
denoising to mitigate cumulative trajectory bias, ensuring that implausible
content is suppressed immediately and consistently throughout denoising.
Experiments across different physical domains show that our approach
substantially enhances physical fidelity while maintaining photorealism,
despite requiring no additional training. Ablation studies confirm the
complementary effectiveness of both the physics-aware reasoning component and
SDG. In particular, the aforementioned two designs of SDG are also individually
validated to contribute critically to the suppression of implausible content
and the overall gains in physical plausibility. This establishes a new and
plug-and-play physics-aware paradigm for video generation.

Result: Extensive experiments on 28 LVLMs show the best model achieves only 36.35% overall score, with functional correctness (24.39% IFS) significantly lagging behind visual fidelity (64.25% VFS), revealing critical limitations in reasoning about temporal dynamics and synthesizing event-driven logic.

Conclusion: IWR-Bench establishes a challenging frontier for vision-language research, highlighting that current models struggle with temporal reasoning and event-driven logic synthesis despite reasonable visual fidelity, indicating the need for improved dynamic interaction understanding.

Abstract: The webpage-to-code task requires models to understand visual representations
of webpages and generate corresponding code. However, existing benchmarks
primarily focus on static screenshot-to-code tasks, thereby overlooking the
dynamic interactions fundamental to real-world web applications. To address
this limitation, this paper introduces IWR-Bench, a novel benchmark for
evaluating the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in
interactive webpage reconstruction from video. IWR-Bench comprises 113
meticulously curated tasks from 100 real-world websites, with 1,001 actions and
featuring diverse interaction complexities (e.g., web games), visual styles,
and domains. Aligning with standard web development practices, each task
includes not only user interaction videos but also all crawled static assets
(e.g., images, videos). This benchmark evaluates models on two fundamental
challenges: comprehensive multi-modal reasoning to infer interaction logic from
video and assets, and advanced code generation to translate this logic into
functional code. An agent-as-a-judge framework with a comprehensive metric
system automatically assesses the functional correctness and visual fidelity of
generated webpages. Extensive experiments on 28 LVLMs reveal a significant
challenge: the best model achieves an overall score of only 36.35%, as
functional correctness (24.39% IFS) lags significantly behind visual fidelity
(64.25% VFS). These results highlight critical limitations in current models'
ability to reason about temporal dynamics and synthesize event-driven logic,
establishing IWR-Bench as a challenging frontier for vision-language research.
The benchmark and evaluation code will be made publicly available. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel Vietnamese-language multimodal medical dataset with 1.5M+ CT-PET image-report pairs and a training framework to enhance VLMs for medical imaging, addressing gaps in PET/CT data and low-resource language representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing medical VLMs that lack diverse imaging modalities (especially PET/CT) and underrepresent low-resource languages like Vietnamese, hindering clinical utility and generalizability.

Method: Created a Vietnamese multimodal dataset with 1,567,062 CT-PET image pairs and 2,757 clinical reports, plus a training framework with data augmentation and expert-validated test sets for benchmarking VLMs on medical report generation and visual question answering.

Result: Experimental results show that incorporating this dataset significantly improves performance of existing VLMs on downstream medical tasks, demonstrating enhanced capabilities for PET/CT imaging and Vietnamese language processing.

Conclusion: This dataset and benchmark represent a pivotal advancement for developing more robust medical VLMs, particularly for low-resource languages, and improving clinical relevance in Vietnamese healthcare through comprehensive PET/CT-report pairs.

Abstract: Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLMs), trained on large-scale multimodal
datasets, have driven significant advances in Artificial Intelligence by
enabling rich cross-modal reasoning. Despite their success in general domains,
applying these models to medical imaging remains challenging due to the limited
availability of diverse imaging modalities and multilingual clinical data. Most
existing medical VLMs are trained on a subset of imaging modalities and focus
primarily on high-resource languages, thus limiting their generalizability and
clinical utility. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
Vietnamese-language multimodal medical dataset comprising 1,567,062 paired
CT-PET images and corresponding 2,757 full-length clinical reports. This
dataset is designed to fill two pressing gaps in medical AI development: (1)
the lack of PET/CT imaging data in existing VLMs training corpora, which
hinders the development of models capable of handling functional imaging tasks;
and (2) the underrepresentation of low-resource languages, particularly the
Vietnamese language, in medical vision-language research. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first dataset to provide comprehensive PET/CT-report
pairs in Vietnamese. We further introduce a training framework to enhance VLMs'
learning, including data augmentation and expert-validated test sets. We
conduct comprehensive experiments benchmarking state-of-the-art VLMs on
downstream tasks, including medical report generation and visual question
answering. The experimental results show that incorporating our dataset
significantly improves the performance of existing VLMs. We believe this
dataset and benchmark will serve as a pivotal step in advancing the development
of more robust VLMs for medical imaging, particularly in low-resource
languages, and improving their clinical relevance in Vietnamese healthcare.

*Xue-Feng Zhu,Tianyang Xu,Yifan Pan,Jinjie Gu,Xi Li,Jiwen Lu,Xiao-Jun Wu,Josef Kittler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces RGBDT500, a novel multi-modal tracking dataset with 500 videos containing synchronized RGB, depth, and thermal infrared images, and proposes RDTTrack, a tri-modal tracker that integrates these three complementary modalities using prompt learning and orthogonal projection constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal tracking approaches primarily use dual-modal paradigms (RGB-Depth or RGB-Thermal) which struggle in complex scenarios due to limited input modalities. The authors aim to enhance tracking robustness by leveraging three complementary modalities.

Method: Proposed RDTTrack integrates tri-modal information by fusing thermal infrared and depth modalities under an orthogonal projection constraint, then integrates them with RGB signals as prompts for a pre-trained foundation tracking model using prompt learning techniques.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing dual-modal approaches in terms of tracking accuracy and robustness in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed tri-modal tracking approach with RGB, depth, and thermal infrared modalities effectively enhances tracking performance in complex scenarios compared to dual-modal methods.

Abstract: Existing multi-modal object tracking approaches primarily focus on dual-modal
paradigms, such as RGB-Depth or RGB-Thermal, yet remain challenged in complex
scenarios due to limited input modalities. To address this gap, this work
introduces a novel multi-modal tracking task that leverages three complementary
modalities, including visible RGB, Depth (D), and Thermal Infrared (TIR),
aiming to enhance robustness in complex scenarios. To support this task, we
construct a new multi-modal tracking dataset, coined RGBDT500, which consists
of 500 videos with synchronised frames across the three modalities. Each frame
provides spatially aligned RGB, depth, and thermal infrared images with precise
object bounding box annotations. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal
tracker, dubbed RDTTrack. RDTTrack integrates tri-modal information for robust
tracking by leveraging a pretrained RGB-only tracking model and prompt learning
techniques. In specific, RDTTrack fuses thermal infrared and depth modalities
under a proposed orthogonal projection constraint, then integrates them with
RGB signals as prompts for the pre-trained foundation tracking model,
effectively harmonising tri-modal complementary cues. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method, showing
significant improvements over existing dual-modal approaches in terms of
tracking accuracy and robustness in complex scenarios.

### [307] [ExGS: Extreme 3D Gaussian Compression with Diffusion Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24758)
*Jiaqi Chen,Xinhao Ji,Yuanyuan Gao,Hao Li,Yuning Gong,Yifei Liu,Dan Xu,Zhihang Zhong,Dingwen Zhang,Xiao Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ExGS is a novel framework for extreme compression of 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes that combines Universal Gaussian Compression for aggressive pruning with GaussPainter for quality restoration using diffusion priors, achieving over 100× compression while preserving rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural scene representations like 3DGS have high storage and transmission costs that hinder deployment in resource-constrained environments. Existing compression methods either require slow optimization or degrade quality under high compression.

Method: ExGS unifies two components: (1) Universal Gaussian Compression (UGC) for re-optimization-free pruning to reduce Gaussian primitives, and (2) GaussPainter that leverages diffusion priors with mask-guided refinement to restore quality from heavily pruned scenes. It uses a lightweight VAE and one-step diffusion for real-time restoration.

Result: The framework achieves over 100× compression (reducing 354.77 MB to ~3.31 MB) while preserving fidelity and significantly improving image quality under challenging conditions. It enables real-time restoration and outperforms existing methods in the trade-off between compression and quality.

Conclusion: Diffusion priors play a central role in bridging the gap between extreme compression and high-quality neural rendering. The approach demonstrates that data-driven methods can overcome the traditional compression-quality trade-off in neural scene representations.

Abstract: Neural scene representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have
enabled high-quality neural rendering; however, their large storage and
transmission costs hinder deployment in resource-constrained environments.
Existing compression methods either rely on costly optimization, which is slow
and scene-specific, or adopt training-free pruning and quantization, which
degrade rendering quality under high compression ratios. In contrast, recent
data-driven approaches provide a promising direction to overcome this
trade-off, enabling efficient compression while preserving high rendering
quality. We introduce \textbf{ExGS}, a novel feed-forward framework that
unifies \textbf{Universal Gaussian Compression} (UGC) with
\textbf{GaussPainter} for \textbf{Ex}treme 3D\textbf{GS} compression.
\textbf{UGC} performs re-optimization-free pruning to aggressively reduce
Gaussian primitives while retaining only essential information, whereas
\textbf{GaussPainter} leverages powerful diffusion priors with mask-guided
refinement to restore high-quality renderings from heavily pruned Gaussian
scenes. Unlike conventional inpainting, GaussPainter not only fills in missing
regions but also enhances visible pixels, yielding substantial improvements in
degraded renderings. To ensure practicality, it adopts a lightweight VAE and a
one-step diffusion design, enabling real-time restoration. Our framework can
even achieve over $100\times$ compression (reducing a typical 354.77 MB model
to about 3.31 MB) while preserving fidelity and significantly improving image
quality under challenging conditions. These results highlight the central role
of diffusion priors in bridging the gap between extreme compression and
high-quality neural rendering. Our code repository will be released at
\href{https://github.com/chenttt2001/ExGS}{here}.

*Hongyang Zhang,Yinhao Liu,Zhenyu Kuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SkyLink is a novel cross-view geo-localization method that addresses semantic degradation from extreme viewpoint disparities by using Google Retrieval Enhancement for data augmentation, Patch-Aware Feature Aggregation for consistent feature extraction, and 3D scene information as a bridge between street and satellite views with contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-view geo-localization approaches rely on direct feature similarity matching but overlook semantic degradation caused by extreme viewpoint disparities between street and satellite views, which limits performance.

Method: 1) Google Retrieval Enhancement Module for street image data augmentation to mitigate occlusion issues; 2) Patch-Aware Feature Aggregation for multiple local feature aggregations; 3) Integration of 3D scene information from multi-scale UAV images as a bridge; 4) Self-supervised and cross-view contrastive learning for feature alignment.

Result: Achieves 25.75% Recall@1 accuracy on University-1652 dataset in the UAVM2025 Challenge, demonstrating robustness and generalization across diverse urban scenarios.

Conclusion: SkyLink effectively addresses viewpoint variation challenges in cross-view geo-localization through innovative data enhancement, feature aggregation, and 3D scene integration, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization aims at establishing location correspondences
between different viewpoints. Existing approaches typically learn cross-view
correlations through direct feature similarity matching, often overlooking
semantic degradation caused by extreme viewpoint disparities. To address this
unique problem, we focus on robust feature retrieval under viewpoint variation
and propose the novel SkyLink method. We firstly utilize the Google Retrieval
Enhancement Module to perform data enhancement on street images, which
mitigates the occlusion of the key target due to restricted street viewpoints.
The Patch-Aware Feature Aggregation module is further adopted to emphasize
multiple local feature aggregations to ensure the consistent feature extraction
across viewpoints. Meanwhile, we integrate the 3D scene information constructed
from multi-scale UAV images as a bridge between street and satellite
viewpoints, and perform feature alignment through self-supervised and
cross-view contrastive learning. Experimental results demonstrate robustness
and generalization across diverse urban scenarios, which achieve 25.75$\%$
Recall@1 accuracy on University-1652 in the UAVM2025 Challenge. Code will be

### [309] [LOVE-R1: Advancing Long Video Understanding with an Adaptive Zoom-in Mechanism via Multi-Step Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24786)
*Shenghao Fu,Qize Yang,Yuan-Ming Li,Xihan Wei,Xiaohua Xie,Wei-Shi Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LOVE-R1 is a Large Video-Language Model that adaptively zooms in on video clips using a slow-fast adaptive frame sampling mechanism, achieving better balance between temporal understanding and spatial details in long video understanding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs with uniform frame sampling sacrifice either temporal clues or spatial details, creating a conflict between long-form temporal understanding and detailed spatial perception in long video understanding.

Method: Proposes adaptive zoom-in mechanism: starts with densely sampled small-resolution frames, then zooms in on clips of interest with large resolution through multi-step reasoning. Uses 38k CoT data finetuning and decoupled reinforcement finetuning to optimize zoom-in ability.

Result: Outperforms baseline Qwen2.5-VL by average 3.1% across 4 long video understanding benchmarks, achieving better trade-off between sampling density and frame resolutions.

Conclusion: The slow-fast adaptive frame sampling mechanism effectively resolves the temporal-spatial conflict in long video understanding, enabling models to adaptively focus on relevant video segments with appropriate resolution.

Abstract: Long video understanding is still challenging for recent Large Video-Language
Models (LVLMs) due to the conflict between long-form temporal understanding and
detailed spatial perception. LVLMs with a uniform frame sampling mechanism,
which samples frames with an equal frame size and fixed sampling rate,
inevitably sacrifice either temporal clues or spatial details, resulting in
suboptimal solutions. To mitigate this dilemma, we propose LOVE-R1, a model
that can adaptively zoom in on a video clip. The model is first provided with
densely sampled frames but in a small resolution. If some spatial details are
needed, the model can zoom in on a clip of interest with a large frame
resolution based on its reasoning until key visual information is obtained. The
whole process is implemented as a multi-step reasoning process. To train the
reasoning ability, we first finetune the model on our collected 38k
high-quality CoT data and enhance it with decoupled reinforcement finetuning.
As outcome rewards can not provide fine-grained process supervision, we
decouple multi-step reasoning into multiple single-step reasoning and optimize
the internal zoom-in ability explicitly. Experiments on long video
understanding benchmarks show that our model with the slow-fast adaptive frame
sampling mechanism achieves a great trade-off between sampling density and
frame resolutions, and LOVE-R1 outperforms our baseline Qwen2.5-VL by an
average of 3.1% points across 4 common long video understanding benchmarks.

### [310] [Vision Function Layer in Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24791)
*Cheng Shi,Yizhou Yu,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper reveals that visual functions in MLLMs are localized to specific layers (Vision Function Layers), follows consistent patterns across models, and enables more efficient training and data selection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how visual-related functional decoding is distributed across different layers in Multimodal Large Language Models and leverage this understanding for more efficient model training and data selection.

Method: Developed Visual Token Swapping framework to modify KV cache entries and identify layer-specific functions, then applied selective LoRA training to VFLs and created VFL-select for automatic data classification.

Result: Found that visual functions narrow to 2-3 specific layers per function, with consistent patterns across MLLMs. VFL-LoRA outperforms full-LoRA and prevents function forgetting. VFL-select achieves 98% performance with only 20% data.

Conclusion: The study provides deeper understanding of MLLM visual processing, enabling more efficient, interpretable, and robust models through targeted layer interventions and data selection methods.

Abstract: This study identifies that visual-related functional decoding is distributed
across different decoder layers in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).
Typically, each function, such as counting, grounding, or OCR recognition,
narrows down to two or three layers, which we define as Vision Function Layers
(VFL). Additionally, the depth and its order of different VFLs exhibits a
consistent pattern across different MLLMs, which is well-aligned with human
behaviors (e.g., recognition occurs first, followed by counting, and then
grounding). These findings are derived from Visual Token Swapping, our novel
analytical framework that modifies targeted KV cache entries to precisely
elucidate layer-specific functions during decoding. Furthermore, these insights
offer substantial utility in tailoring MLLMs for real-world downstream
applications. For instance, when LoRA training is selectively applied to VFLs
whose functions align with the training data, VFL-LoRA not only outperform
full-LoRA but also prevent out-of-domain function forgetting. Moreover, by
analyzing the performance differential on training data when particular VFLs
are ablated, VFL-select automatically classifies data by function, enabling
highly efficient data selection to directly bolster corresponding capabilities.
Consequently, VFL-select surpasses human experts in data selection, and
achieves 98% of full-data performance with only 20% of the original dataset.
This study delivers deeper comprehension of MLLM visual processing, fostering
the creation of more efficient, interpretable, and robust models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TACO-Net is a novel 3D object classification method that combines topological data analysis with image filtration techniques to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on synthetic benchmarks (99.05% on ModelNet40, 99.52% on ModelNet10) and demonstrates strong robustness on real-world datasets and corrupted inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D object classification has practical importance in computer vision, robotics, and autonomous driving, but remains challenging due to unordered point clouds, irregularity, and noise in data from LiDAR, RGBD cameras, and CAD models.

Method: Transform point clouds into voxelized binary 3D images, extract topological features using topological data analysis with image filtration techniques, and train a lightweight 1D CNN on the extracted feature set.

Result: Achieved 99.05% accuracy on ModelNet40 and 99.52% on ModelNet10, demonstrating strong performance on synthetic benchmarks and robustness on the real-world OmniObject3D dataset, with resilience to corrupted inputs.

Conclusion: TACO-Net sets a new state-of-the-art for 3D object classification by effectively combining topological features with deep learning, showing superior accuracy and robustness across synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: 3D object classification is a crucial problem due to its significant
practical relevance in many fields, including computer vision, robotics, and
autonomous driving. Although deep learning methods applied to point clouds
sampled on CAD models of the objects and/or captured by LiDAR or RGBD cameras
have achieved remarkable success in recent years, achieving high classification
accuracy remains a challenging problem due to the unordered point clouds and
their irregularity and noise. To this end, we propose a novel state-of-the-art
(SOTA) 3D object classification technique that combines topological data
analysis with various image filtration techniques to classify objects when they
are represented using point clouds. We transform every point cloud into a
voxelized binary 3D image to extract distinguishing topological features. Next,
we train a lightweight one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN)
using the extracted feature set from the training dataset. Our framework,
TACO-Net, sets a new state-of-the-art by achieving $99.05\%$ and $99.52\%$
accuracy on the widely used synthetic benchmarks ModelNet40 and ModelNet10, and
further demonstrates its robustness on the large-scale real-world OmniObject3D
dataset. When tested with ten different kinds of corrupted ModelNet40 inputs,
the proposed TACO-Net demonstrates strong resiliency overall.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UP2You is a tuning-free 3D reconstruction method that converts unconstrained 2D photos into high-fidelity 3D clothed portraits in seconds, outperforming previous methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous 3D reconstruction methods require clean inputs with minimal occlusions or well-calibrated cross-view captures, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios with casual, unconstrained photographs.

Method: Introduces a data rectifier paradigm that converts unconstrained inputs into clean multi-view images in a single forward pass, using pose-correlated feature aggregation (PCFA) for identity preservation and a perceiver-based multi-reference shape predictor without pre-captured body templates.

Result: UP2You achieves significant improvements: 15% better Chamfer distance, 18% better P2S on PuzzleIOI for geometry; 21% better PSNR and 46% better LPIPS on 4D-Dress for texture. It's efficient (1.5 minutes per person) and supports arbitrary pose control and training-free multi-garment virtual try-on.

Conclusion: UP2You provides a practical solution for real-world 3D clothed portrait reconstruction from casual photos, offering superior performance, efficiency, and versatility compared to existing methods.

Abstract: We present UP2You, the first tuning-free solution for reconstructing
high-fidelity 3D clothed portraits from extremely unconstrained in-the-wild 2D
photos. Unlike previous approaches that require "clean" inputs (e.g., full-body
images with minimal occlusions, or well-calibrated cross-view captures), UP2You
directly processes raw, unstructured photographs, which may vary significantly
in pose, viewpoint, cropping, and occlusion. Instead of compressing data into
tokens for slow online text-to-3D optimization, we introduce a data rectifier
paradigm that efficiently converts unconstrained inputs into clean, orthogonal
multi-view images in a single forward pass within seconds, simplifying the 3D
reconstruction. Central to UP2You is a pose-correlated feature aggregation
module (PCFA), that selectively fuses information from multiple reference
images w.r.t. target poses, enabling better identity preservation and nearly
constant memory footprint, with more observations. We also introduce a
perceiver-based multi-reference shape predictor, removing the need for
pre-captured body templates. Extensive experiments on 4D-Dress, PuzzleIOI, and
in-the-wild captures demonstrate that UP2You consistently surpasses previous
methods in both geometric accuracy (Chamfer-15%, P2S-18% on PuzzleIOI) and
texture fidelity (PSNR-21%, LPIPS-46% on 4D-Dress). UP2You is efficient (1.5
minutes per person), and versatile (supports arbitrary pose control, and
training-free multi-garment 3D virtual try-on), making it practical for
real-world scenarios where humans are casually captured. Both models and code
will be released to facilitate future research on this underexplored task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenPruner is a training-free framework that prunes redundant visual tokens in VLMs by selecting tokens with high sensitivity and complementary information, achieving up to 94.4% token reduction and 2.30x faster inference while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token pruning methods have limitations: attention-based approaches are unstable and lead to redundant selections, while diversity-based methods risk dropping important regions needed for accurate predictions.

Method: Estimates token sensitivity using zeroth-order perturbations at the projection layer, measuring how small random perturbations affect projection outputs to approximate token influence without backpropagation.

Result: Consistently outperforms prior methods across multiple VLMs and benchmarks, pruning up to 94.4% of tokens while maintaining accuracy and achieving up to 2.30x faster end-to-end inference.

Conclusion: TokenPruner effectively identifies and prunes redundant visual tokens by focusing on token sensitivity and complementary information, significantly improving efficiency without compromising performance.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable strong multimodal reasoning but
incur heavy inference costs from redundant visual tokens. Token pruning
alleviates this issue, yet existing approaches face limitations.
Attention-based methods rely on raw attention scores, which are often unstable
across layers and heads and can lead to redundant selections. Diversity-based
methods improve robustness by selecting tokens far apart in feature space but
risk dropping regions needed for accurate prediction. We propose \ours, a
training-free framework built on a simple intuition: tokens with higher
sensitivity are more likely to influence the model's output, and they should
also capture complementary visual cues rather than overlapping information. To
achieve this, we estimate token sensitivity using zeroth-order perturbations at
the projection layer, a shallow and computationally light component of the
model. This approach measures how small random perturbations affect the
projection outputs, allowing us to approximate each token's influence through
lightweight forward passes without backpropagation. Extensive experiments
across multiple VLMs and benchmarks show that \ours consistently outperforms
prior methods, pruning up to 94.4\% of tokens while maintaining accuracy and
significantly improving efficiency, achieving up to 2.30x faster end-to-end
inference over the baseline.

TL;DR: PHASE-Net is a physics-informed rPPG method that uses a lightweight Temporal Convolutional Network with three key components: Zero-FLOPs Axial Swapper, Adaptive Spatial Filter, and Gated TCN, achieving state-of-the-art performance for non-contact heart rate monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) are mostly heuristic and lack theoretical grounding, leading to accuracy degradation under head motion and illumination changes, limiting robustness and interpretability.

Method: Derived from Navier-Stokes equations, the authors show pulse signals follow a second-order dynamical system, justifying the use of TCN. PHASE-Net includes: (1) Zero-FLOPs Axial Swapper for cross-region feature interaction, (2) Adaptive Spatial Filter to highlight signal-rich areas, and (3) Gated TCN for long-range temporal dynamics.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that PHASE-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong efficiency, offering a theoretically grounded and deployment-ready rPPG solution.

Conclusion: The physics-informed paradigm provides theoretical justification for using TCN in rPPG, and PHASE-Net offers a robust, efficient, and interpretable solution for non-contact physiological monitoring.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) measurement enables non-contact
physiological monitoring but suffers from accuracy degradation under head
motion and illumination changes. Existing deep learning methods are mostly
heuristic and lack theoretical grounding, which limits robustness and
interpretability. In this work, we propose a physics-informed rPPG paradigm
derived from the Navier-Stokes equations of hemodynamics, showing that the
pulse signal follows a second-order dynamical system whose discrete solution
naturally leads to a causal convolution. This provides a theoretical
justification for using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Based on this
principle, we design PHASE-Net, a lightweight model with three key components:
(1) Zero-FLOPs Axial Swapper module, which swaps or transposes a few spatial
channels to mix distant facial regions and enhance cross-region feature
interaction without breaking temporal order; (2) Adaptive Spatial Filter, which
learns a soft spatial mask per frame to highlight signal-rich areas and
suppress noise; and (3) Gated TCN, a causal dilated TCN with gating that models
long-range temporal dynamics for accurate pulse recovery. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PHASE-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong
efficiency, offering a theoretically grounded and deployment-ready rPPG
solution.

Motivation: Current MDD diagnosis relies on subjective scales, while existing EEG deep learning models treat spectra as static images, fix inter-channel graphs, and ignore prior knowledge, limiting accuracy and interpretability.

Method: Proposes ELPG-DTFS with three key components: (1) channel-band attention with cross-band mutual information, (2) learnable adjacency matrix for dynamic functional links, and (3) residual knowledge-graph pathway injecting neuroscience priors.

Result: Achieves 97.63% accuracy and 97.33% F1 score on the 128-channel MODMA dataset (53 subjects), surpassing the 2025 state-of-the-art ACM-GNN. Ablation studies show removing any module lowers F1 by up to 4.35.

Conclusion: ELPG-DTFS offers a robust and interpretable framework for next-generation EEG-based MDD diagnostics, with complementary value demonstrated across all proposed modules.

Abstract: Timely and objective screening of major depressive disorder (MDD) is vital,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by the human visual system's contrast enhancement and color-opponency mechanisms to create more robust semantic segmentation inputs.

Method: Apply Difference-of-Gaussians (DoG) filtering to RGB, grayscale, and opponent-color channels as model-agnostic preprocessing step before semantic segmentation models.

Result: Maintains in-distribution performance while improving robustness to adverse conditions (night, fog, snow) on Cityscapes, ACDC, and Dark Zurich datasets.

Conclusion: This lightweight, model-agnostic preprocessing enables imaging systems to deliver task-ready, robust inputs for downstream vision models in safety-critical environments.

Abstract: Inspired by the human visual system's mechanisms for contrast enhancement and
color-opponency, we explore biologically motivated input preprocessing for
robust semantic segmentation. By applying Difference-of-Gaussians (DoG)
filtering to RGB, grayscale, and opponent-color channels, we enhance local
contrast without modifying model architecture or training. Evaluations on
Cityscapes, ACDC, and Dark Zurich show that such preprocessing maintains
in-distribution performance while improving robustness to adverse conditions
like night, fog, and snow. As this processing is model-agnostic and
lightweight, it holds potential for integration into imaging pipelines,
enabling imaging systems to deliver task-ready, robust inputs for downstream
vision models in safety-critical environments.

*Xiangyu Zeng,Kefan Qiu,Qingyu Zhang,Xinhao Li,Jing Wang,Jiaxin Li,Ziang Yan,Kun Tian,Meng Tian,Xinhai Zhao,Yi Wang,Limin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreamForest is a novel architecture for streaming video understanding that uses Persistent Event Memory Forest to organize video frames into tree structures and Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window for real-time perception, achieving state-of-the-art performance while maintaining efficiency under computational constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have limitations in real-time streaming scenarios due to storage constraints of historical visual features and insufficient real-time spatiotemporal reasoning.

Method: Proposes StreamForest with Persistent Event Memory Forest that organizes video frames into event-level tree structures using penalty functions, Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window for detailed short-term visual cues, and OnlineIT instruction-tuning dataset for streaming video tasks.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 77.3% on StreamingBench, 60.5% on OVBench, and 55.6% on OVO-Bench. Maintains 96.8% of average accuracy even under extreme visual token compression (limited to 1024 tokens).

Conclusion: StreamForest demonstrates robustness, efficiency, and generalizability for streaming video understanding, particularly in autonomous driving scenarios as validated by the new ODV-Bench benchmark.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, their effectiveness in real-time
streaming scenarios remains limited due to storage constraints of historical
visual features and insufficient real-time spatiotemporal reasoning. To address
these challenges, we propose StreamForest, a novel architecture specifically
designed for streaming video understanding. Central to StreamForest is the
Persistent Event Memory Forest, a memory mechanism that adaptively organizes
video frames into multiple event-level tree structures. This process is guided
by penalty functions based on temporal distance, content similarity, and merge
frequency, enabling efficient long-term memory retention under limited
computational resources. To enhance real-time perception, we introduce a
Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window, which captures detailed short-term visual
cues to improve current scene perception. Additionally, we present OnlineIT, an
instruction-tuning dataset tailored for streaming video tasks. OnlineIT
significantly boosts MLLM performance in both real-time perception and future
prediction. To evaluate generalization in practical applications, we introduce
ODV-Bench, a new benchmark focused on real-time streaming video understanding
in autonomous driving scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that
StreamForest achieves the state-of-the-art performance, with accuracies of
77.3% on StreamingBench, 60.5% on OVBench, and 55.6% on OVO-Bench. In
particular, even under extreme visual token compression (limited to 1024
tokens), the model retains 96.8% of its average accuracy in eight benchmarks
relative to the default setting. These results underscore the robustness,
efficiency, and generalizability of StreamForest for streaming video
understanding.

### [318] [Environment-Aware Satellite Image Generation with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24875)
*Nikos Kostagiolas,Pantelis Georgiades,Yannis Panagakis,Mihalis A. Nicolaou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel diffusion model for satellite image generation that conditions on environmental context using text, metadata, and visual data, addressing limitations of existing methods with improved robustness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models in remote sensing face limitations including limited environmental context, poor handling of missing/corrupted data, and unreliable reflection of user intentions in generated outputs.

Method: Proposes a diffusion model conditioned on environmental context using three control signals: text, metadata, and visual data. Incorporates metadata fusion strategy to handle partially corrupt/missing observations and models dynamic environmental conditions.

Result: Outperforms previous methods both qualitatively (robustness to missing metadata, higher responsiveness to control inputs) and quantitatively (higher fidelity, accuracy, and quality measured using 6 different metrics) in single-image and temporal generation trials.

Conclusion: Conditioning on environmental context improves foundation model performance for satellite imagery, making the model promising for downstream tasks. Also created the first publicly-available 3-modal dataset combining text, metadata, and visual data.

Abstract: Diffusion-based foundation models have recently garnered much attention in
the field of generative modeling due to their ability to generate images of
high quality and fidelity. Although not straightforward, their recent
application to the field of remote sensing signaled the first successful trials
towards harnessing the large volume of publicly available datasets containing
multimodal information. Despite their success, existing methods face
considerable limitations: they rely on limited environmental context, struggle
with missing or corrupted data, and often fail to reliably reflect user
intentions in generated outputs. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion
model conditioned on environmental context, that is able to generate satellite
images by conditioning from any combination of three different control signals:
a) text, b) metadata, and c) visual data. In contrast to previous works, the
proposed method is i) to our knowledge, the first of its kind to condition
satellite image generation on dynamic environmental conditions as part of its
control signals, and ii) incorporating a metadata fusion strategy that models
attribute embedding interactions to account for partially corrupt and/or
missing observations. Our method outperforms previous methods both
qualitatively (robustness to missing metadata, higher responsiveness to control
inputs) and quantitatively (higher fidelity, accuracy, and quality of
generations measured using 6 different metrics) in the trials of single-image
and temporal generation. The reported results support our hypothesis that
conditioning on environmental context can improve the performance of foundation
models for satellite imagery, and render our model a promising candidate for
usage in downstream tasks. The collected 3-modal dataset is to our knowledge,
the first publicly-available dataset to combine data from these three different
mediums.

*Fankai Jia,Daisong Gan,Zhe Zhang,Zhaochi Wen,Chenchen Dan,Dong Liang,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMRQA is a novel MRI quality assessment framework that combines multimodal LLMs with signal processing to achieve interpretable, high-accuracy quality assessment with strong zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in MRI quality assessment where traditional methods face trade-offs between quantitative metrics (lacking semantic understanding) and deep learning approaches (sacrificing interpretability).

Method: Integrates multimodal LLMs with acquisition-aware signal processing using three innovations: robust metric extraction with simulated artifacts, structured transformation of metrics into QA pairs using Qwen, and parameter-efficient fusion via LoRA of LLaVA-OneVision.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MR-ART, FastMRI, and MyConnectome benchmarks with strong zero-shot generalization, validated by comprehensive ablation studies.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges quantitative analysis with semantic reasoning to generate clinically interpretable outputs that enhance quality control in dynamic medical settings.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) quality assessment is crucial for clinical
decision-making, yet remains challenging due to data scarcity and protocol
variability. Traditional approaches face fundamental trade-offs: signal-based
methods like MRIQC provide quantitative metrics but lack semantic
understanding, while deep learning approaches achieve high accuracy but
sacrifice interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce the
Multimodal MRI Quality Assessment (MMRQA) framework, pioneering the integration
of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with acquisition-aware signal
processing. MMRQA combines three key innovations: robust metric extraction via
MRQy augmented with simulated artifacts, structured transformation of metrics
into question-answer pairs using Qwen, and parameter-efficient fusion through
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) of LLaVA-OneVision. Evaluated on MR-ART, FastMRI,
and MyConnectome benchmarks, MMRQA achieves state-of-the-art performance with
strong zero-shot generalization, as validated by comprehensive ablation
studies. By bridging quantitative analysis with semantic reasoning, our
framework generates clinically interpretable outputs that enhance quality
control in dynamic medical settings.

### [320] [VAGUEGAN: Stealthy Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks on Image Generative Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24891)
*Mostafa Mohaimen Akand Faisal,Rabeya Amin Jhuma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VagueGAN introduces stealthy adversarial attacks on generative models that cause targeted changes in outputs while maintaining or even improving visual quality, challenging traditional pixel-level defense assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While adversarial attacks on discriminative models are well-studied, attacks on generative pipelines that cause controlled output changes through small perturbations are less explored.

Method: Combines a modular perturbation network (PoisonerNet) with a Generator-Discriminator pair to craft stealthy triggers, evaluated using custom proxy metrics and perceptual/frequency domain analysis.

Result: Poisoned outputs can display higher visual quality than clean counterparts, and latent space poisoning can retain/enhance aesthetics while producing consistent, stealthy effects on generator outputs.

Conclusion: The method exposes a blind spot in pixel-level defenses and raises concerns for the integrity of image generation pipelines, as optimized perturbations can remain visually inconspicuous while manipulating outputs.

Abstract: Generative models such as GANs and diffusion models are widely used to
synthesize photorealistic images and to support downstream creative and editing
tasks. While adversarial attacks on discriminative models are well studied,
attacks targeting generative pipelines where small, stealthy perturbations in
inputs lead to controlled changes in outputs are less explored. This study
introduces VagueGAN, an attack pipeline combining a modular perturbation
network PoisonerNet with a Generator Discriminator pair to craft stealthy
triggers that cause targeted changes in generated images. Attack efficacy is
evaluated using a custom proxy metric, while stealth is analyzed through
perceptual and frequency domain measures. The transferability of the method to
a modern diffusion based pipeline is further examined through ControlNet guided
editing. Interestingly, the experiments show that poisoned outputs can display
higher visual quality compared to clean counterparts, challenging the
assumption that poisoning necessarily reduces fidelity. Unlike conventional
pixel level perturbations, latent space poisoning in GANs and diffusion
pipelines can retain or even enhance output aesthetics, exposing a blind spot
in pixel level defenses. Moreover, carefully optimized perturbations can
produce consistent, stealthy effects on generator outputs while remaining
visually inconspicuous, raising concerns for the integrity of image generation
pipelines.

*Yu Ma,Guoliang Wei,Yue Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DWGS enhances 3D Gaussian Splatting for sparse-view synthesis by integrating depth estimation, virtual view generation, and occlusion-aware reconstruction to overcome floating artifacts and structural inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting suffers from floating artifacts and structural inconsistencies under sparse-input settings, limiting its effectiveness for novel view synthesis from limited views.

Method: Proposes three key components: Hybrid-Loss Depth Estimation with dense matching priors, Bidirectional Warping Virtual View Synthesis for additional constraints, and Occlusion-Aware Reconstruction using depth-difference masks and learning-based inpainting.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on LLFF, Blender, and DTU benchmarks with up to 21.13 dB PSNR and 0.189 LPIPS while maintaining real-time inference.

Conclusion: DWGS successfully addresses sparse-view synthesis challenges in 3DGS by incorporating structural cues, virtual constraints, and occlusion completion, enabling high-quality novel view synthesis from sparse inputs.

Abstract: Novel View Synthesis (NVS) from sparse views remains a core challenge in 3D
reconstruction, typically suffering from overfitting, geometric distortion, and
incomplete scene recovery due to limited multi-view constraints. Although 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time, high-fidelity rendering, it
suffers from floating artifacts and structural inconsistencies under
sparse-input settings. To address these issues, we propose DWGS, a novel
unified framework that enhances 3DGS for sparse-view synthesis by integrating
robust structural cues, virtual view constraints, and occluded region
completion. Our approach introduces three principal contributions: a
Hybrid-Loss Depth Estimation module that leverages dense matching priors with
reprojection, point propagation, and smoothness constraints to enforce
multi-view consistency; a Bidirectional Warping Virtual View Synthesis method
generates virtual training views to impose stronger geometric and photometric
constraints; and an Occlusion-Aware Reconstruction component that utilizes
depth-difference mask and a learning-based inpainting model to recover obscured
regions. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (LLFF, Blender, and DTU)
show that DWGS achieves a new state-of-the-art, achieving up to 21.13 dB PSNR
and 0.189 LPIPS, while retaining real-time inference capabilities.

### [322] [DAM: Dual Active Learning with Multimodal Foundation Model for Source-Free Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24896)
*Xi Chen,Hongxun Yao,Zhaopan Xu,Kui Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAM is a source-free active domain adaptation framework that integrates multimodal supervision from Vision-and-Language models with sparse human annotations through bidirectional distillation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing domain adaptation methods treat Vision-and-Language models and data supervision as separate sources without effective fusion, limiting their complementary benefits.

Method: DAM initializes stable ViL-guided targets and uses bidirectional distillation to enable mutual knowledge exchange between the target model and dual supervisions (ViL + human annotations) during iterative adaptation.

Result: Extensive experiments show DAM consistently outperforms existing methods and sets new state-of-the-art across multiple SFADA benchmarks and active learning strategies.

Conclusion: The proposed DAM framework effectively integrates multimodal supervision to enhance source-free active domain adaptation through dual supervisory signals and bidirectional knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Source-free active domain adaptation (SFADA) enhances knowledge transfer from
a source model to an unlabeled target domain using limited manual labels
selected via active learning. While recent domain adaptation studies have
introduced Vision-and-Language (ViL) models to improve pseudo-label quality or
feature alignment, they often treat ViL-based and data supervision as separate
sources, lacking effective fusion. To overcome this limitation, we propose Dual
Active learning with Multimodal (DAM) foundation model, a novel framework that
integrates multimodal supervision from a ViL model to complement sparse human
annotations, thereby forming a dual supervisory signal. DAM initializes stable
ViL-guided targets and employs a bidirectional distillation mechanism to foster
mutual knowledge exchange between the target model and the dual supervisions
during iterative adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAM
consistently outperforms existing methods and sets a new state-of-the-art
across multiple SFADA benchmarks and active learning strategies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel deep learning framework for automated assessment of Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) that simultaneously predicts vertebral endplate angles and coordinates, enabling flexible detection of diverse scoliosis patterns without predefined curve assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional manual Cobb angle measurements suffer from significant observer variability, and existing automated methods use simplified spinal models that fail to address clinical complexity in AIS assessment.

Method: Combines HRNet backbone with Swin-Transformer modules and biomechanically informed constraints for feature extraction. Uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to analyze angle predictions directly from vertebral morphology, and introduces Vertebral Wedging Index (VWI) to quantify vertebral deformation.

Result: Achieved 83.45% diagnostic accuracy and 2.55° mean absolute error on 630 full-spine radiographs with dual-rater annotation. Demonstrated exceptional generalization on out-of-distribution cases. VWI showed significant prognostic correlation with curve progression while traditional Cobb angles showed no correlation.

Conclusion: The framework provides robust support for early AIS detection, personalized treatment planning, and progression monitoring, with VWI offering superior prognostic value compared to traditional Cobb angle measurements.

Abstract: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a common spinal deformity affecting
approximately 2.2% of boys and 4.8% of girls worldwide. The Cobb angle serves
as the gold standard for AIS severity assessment, yet traditional manual
measurements suffer from significant observer variability, compromising
diagnostic accuracy. Despite prior automation attempts, existing methods use
simplified spinal models and predetermined curve patterns that fail to address
clinical complexity. We present a novel deep learning framework for AIS
assessment that simultaneously predicts both superior and inferior endplate
angles with corresponding midpoint coordinates for each vertebra, preserving
the anatomical reality of vertebral wedging in progressive AIS. Our approach
combines an HRNet backbone with Swin-Transformer modules and biomechanically
informed constraints for enhanced feature extraction. We employ Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to analyze angle predictions directly from vertebral
morphology, enabling flexible detection of diverse scoliosis patterns without
predefined curve assumptions. Using 630 full-spine anteroposterior radiographs
from patients aged 10-18 years with rigorous dual-rater annotation, our method
achieved 83.45% diagnostic accuracy and 2.55{\deg} mean absolute error. The
framework demonstrates exceptional generalization capability on
out-of-distribution cases. Additionally, we introduce the Vertebral Wedging
Index (VWI), a novel metric quantifying vertebral deformation. Longitudinal
analysis revealed VWI's significant prognostic correlation with curve
progression while traditional Cobb angles showed no correlation, providing
robust support for early AIS detection, personalized treatment planning, and
progression monitoring.

TL;DR: Attention Surgery is an efficient framework that linearizes or hybridizes attention in pretrained video diffusion models without costly retraining, reducing attention FLOPs by up to 40% while maintaining generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based video diffusion models suffer from quadratic self-attention costs, making long sequences and high resolutions computationally expensive, while prior linear attention approaches fail to match softmax attention expressiveness without expensive retraining.

Method: Combines hybrid attention (mixing softmax and linear tokens) with lightweight distillation and fine-tuning, plus a cost-aware block-rate strategy to balance expressiveness and efficiency across layers.

Result: Applied to Wan2.1 1.3B VDM, achieves first competitive sub-quadratic attention video diffusion models with 40% FLOPs reduction while maintaining quality on VBench and VBench-2.0 benchmarks.

Conclusion: Attention Surgery enables efficient video diffusion models with sub-quadratic attention complexity while preserving generation quality, requiring only a few GPU-days of training.

Abstract: Transformer-based video diffusion models (VDMs) deliver state-of-the-art
video generation quality but are constrained by the quadratic cost of
self-attention, making long sequences and high resolutions computationally
expensive. While linear attention offers sub-quadratic complexity, prior
attempts fail to match the expressiveness of softmax attention without costly
retraining. We introduce \textit{Attention Surgery}, an efficient framework for
\textit{linearizing} or \textit{hybridizing} attention in pretrained VDMs
without training from scratch. Inspired by recent advances in language models,
our method combines a novel hybrid attention mechanism-mixing softmax and
linear tokens-with a lightweight distillation and fine-tuning pipeline
requiring only a few GPU-days. Additionally, we incorporate a cost-aware
block-rate strategy to balance expressiveness and efficiency across layers.
Applied to Wan2.1 1.3B, a state-of-the-art DiT-based VDM, Attention Surgery
achieves the first competitive sub-quadratic attention video diffusion models,
reducing attention cost by up to 40\% in terms of FLOPs, while maintaining
generation quality as measured on the standard VBench and VBench-2.0
benchmarks.

TL;DR: SID is a goal-oriented language-guided navigation approach that uses self-improving demonstrations to enhance agent exploration capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance on navigation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing navigation methods rely heavily on shortest-path trajectories, lacking effective exploration priors for training agents to navigate to goals in unknown environments without step-by-step instructions.

Method: SID first trains an initial agent on shortest-path data, then uses this agent to generate novel exploration trajectories. These trajectories provide better demonstrations for training improved agents in an iterative self-improving pipeline.

Result: SID significantly boosts exploration capabilities and generalization, achieving 50.9% success rate on SOON validation splits (13.9% improvement over prior methods) and new SOTA on REVERIE and SOON tasks.

Conclusion: The self-improving demonstration pipeline effectively scales to new environments and transfers across language-guided navigation tasks, elevating performance in diverse goal-oriented navigation scenarios.

Abstract: Goal-oriented language-guided navigation requires robust exploration
capabilities for agents to navigate to specified goals in unknown environments
without step-by-step instructions. Existing methods tend to exclusively utilize
shortest-path trajectories, lacking effective exploration priors for training
navigation agents. To address the above challenges, we present SID, a
goal-oriented language-guided navigation learning approach with Self-Improving
Demonstrations. Specifically, SID learns an initial agent on the shortest-path
data sampled from environments and then leverages this agent to generate novel
exploration trajectories. The novel rollouts provide demonstrations with
stronger exploration strategies to train a better agent, which in turn produces
higher-quality agent demonstrations for the next round of training. We show
that this iterative self-improving pipeline readily scales to new environments,
and the resulting demonstrations can be transferred across a variety of
language-guided navigation tasks, elevating the performance ceiling in diverse
goal-oriented navigation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SID
significantly boosts the exploration capabilities and generalization of
navigation agents. The resulting agent achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on goal-oriented language-guided navigation tasks, including
REVERIE, SOON, notably achieving a 50.9% success rate on the unseen validation
splits of SOON, surpassing the prior leading approaches by a margin of 13.9%.

Conclusion: CogniGPT demonstrates that interactive perception-verification loops can effectively address long video understanding challenges, achieving both high accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Long videos, characterized by temporal complexity and sparse task-relevant
information, pose significant reasoning challenges for AI systems. Although
various Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches have advanced long video
understanding, they still struggle to achieve both completeness and efficiency
in capturing task-critical information. Inspired by human progressive visual
cognition, we propose CogniGPT, a framework that leverages an interactive loop
between Multi-Granular Perception Agent (MGPA) and Verification-Enhanced
Reflection Agent (VERA) for efficient and reliable long video understanding.
Specifically, MGPA mimics human visual divergent and focused attention to
capture task-related information, while VERA verifies perceived key clues to
mitigate hallucination and optimize subsequent perception strategies. Through
this interactive process, CogniGPT explores a minimal set of informative and
reliable task-related clues. Extensive experiments on EgoSchema, Video-MME,
NExT-QA, and MovieChat datasets demonstrate CogniGPT's superiority in both

TL;DR: Temperature Scaling significantly improves CNN calibration for brain tumor classification under various noise conditions, reducing calibration error without affecting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for reliable confidence estimation in medical AI systems to prevent overconfident misclassifications in high-stakes applications like brain tumor diagnosis.

Method: Developed custom CNN trained on brain MRI dataset, introduced five types of image noise, applied Temperature Scaling as post-hoc calibration, evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, NLL, and ECE metrics.

Result: TS significantly reduced Expected Calibration Error and Negative Log-Likelihood across all noise conditions while maintaining classification accuracy.

Conclusion: Temperature Scaling is an effective and computationally efficient method to enhance decision confidence in medical AI systems, particularly in noisy or uncertain environments.

Abstract: Precise confidence estimation in deep learning is vital for high-stakes
fields like medical imaging, where overconfident misclassifications can have
serious consequences. This work evaluates the effectiveness of Temperature
Scaling (TS), a post-hoc calibration technique, in improving the reliability of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for brain tumor classification. We develop
a custom CNN and train it on a merged brain MRI dataset. To simulate real-world
uncertainty, five types of image noise are introduced: Gaussian, Poisson, Salt
& Pepper, Speckle, and Uniform. Model performance is evaluated using precision,
recall, F1-score, accuracy, negative log-likelihood (NLL), and expected
calibration error (ECE), both before and after calibration. Results demonstrate
that TS significantly reduces ECE and NLL under all noise conditions without
degrading classification accuracy. This underscores TS as an effective and
computationally efficient approach to enhance decision confidence of medical AI
systems, hence making model outputs more reliable in noisy or uncertain
settings.

TL;DR: Social 3D Scene Graphs extend traditional 3D Scene Graphs to include humans, their attributes, activities, and relationships with the environment using open-vocabulary framework, enabling better social scene understanding for robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Scene Graph approaches largely ignore humans and lack annotated human-environment relationships, limiting their ability to model long-range interactions and social compliance for robots.

Method: Introduce Social 3D Scene Graphs that capture humans, attributes, activities and relationships in environments using open-vocabulary framework, and create a new benchmark with synthetic environments and comprehensive human-scene relationship annotations.

Result: The representation improves human activity prediction and reasoning about human-environment relations, demonstrating enhanced social scene understanding capabilities.

Conclusion: Social 3D Scene Graphs pave the way toward socially intelligent robots by enabling better understanding of human interactions with their surroundings.

Abstract: Understanding how people interact with their surroundings and each other is
essential for enabling robots to act in socially compliant and context-aware
ways. While 3D Scene Graphs have emerged as a powerful semantic representation
for scene understanding, existing approaches largely ignore humans in the
scene, also due to the lack of annotated human-environment relationships.
Moreover, existing methods typically capture only open-vocabulary relations
from single image frames, which limits their ability to model long-range
interactions beyond the observed content. We introduce Social 3D Scene Graphs,
an augmented 3D Scene Graph representation that captures humans, their
attributes, activities and relationships in the environment, both local and
remote, using an open-vocabulary framework. Furthermore, we introduce a new
benchmark consisting of synthetic environments with comprehensive human-scene
relationship annotations and diverse types of queries for evaluating social
scene understanding in 3D. The experiments demonstrate that our representation
improves human activity prediction and reasoning about human-environment
relations, paving the way toward socially intelligent robots.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a cross-modal fusion attention and self-supervised learning framework for event-based facial keypoint alignment, addressing limitations of event data through RGB guidance and unlabeled data utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras offer advantages for facial keypoint alignment in challenging conditions, but existing RGB methods don't work well on event data, and training solely on event data leads to suboptimal performance due to limited spatial information and lack of labeled datasets.

Method: Uses cross-modal fusion attention (CMFA) to integrate RGB data for robust feature extraction from event images, and self-supervised multi-event representation learning (SSMER) for effective feature learning from unlabeled event data.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-event E-SIE dataset and synthetic-event WFLW-V benchmark show the approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses event data limitations through cross-modal fusion and self-supervised learning, achieving superior performance in event-based facial keypoint alignment.

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages for facial keypoint alignment under
challenging conditions, such as low light and rapid motion, due to their high
temporal resolution and robustness to varying illumination. However, existing
RGB facial keypoint alignment methods do not perform well on event data, and
training solely on event data often leads to suboptimal performance because of
its limited spatial information. Moreover, the lack of comprehensive labeled
event datasets further hinders progress in this area. To address these issues,
we propose a novel framework based on cross-modal fusion attention (CMFA) and
self-supervised multi-event representation learning (SSMER) for event-based
facial keypoint alignment. Our framework employs CMFA to integrate
corresponding RGB data, guiding the model to extract robust facial features
from event input images. In parallel, SSMER enables effective feature learning

*Ishika Jain,Siri Willems,Steven Latre,Tom De Schepper*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed on-the-fly augmentation using pretrained GliGANs to insert synthetic tumors during training, achieving top performance in BraTS 2025 Task 1 for glioma segmentation across pre- and post-treatment scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust glioma segmentation across treatment timelines requires generalized models, but limited annotated data and computational costs of storing augmented 3D data pose challenges.

Method: Three nnU-Net-based models with on-the-fly augmentation: baseline, regular on-the-fly augmented, and customized on-the-fly augmented using pretrained GliGANs for synthetic tumor insertion.

Result: Ensemble achieved lesion-wise Dice scores of 0.79 (ET), 0.749 (NETC), 0.872 (RC), 0.825 (SNFH), 0.79 (TC), 0.88 (WT) on BraTS 2025 validation, ranking first in the challenge.

Conclusion: On-the-fly augmentation with pretrained generative models effectively addresses data limitations for robust glioma segmentation across treatment timelines.

Abstract: Robust segmentation across both pre-treatment and post-treatment glioma scans
can be helpful for consistent tumor monitoring and treatment planning. BraTS
2025 Task 1 addresses this by challenging models to generalize across varying
tumor appearances throughout the treatment timeline. However, training such
generalized models requires access to diverse, high-quality annotated data,
which is often limited. While data augmentation can alleviate this, storing
large volumes of augmented 3D data is computationally expensive. To address
these challenges, we propose an on-the-fly augmentation strategy that
dynamically inserts synthetic tumors using pretrained generative adversarial
networks (GliGANs) during training. We evaluate three nnU-Net-based models and
their ensembles: (1) a baseline without external augmentation, (2) a regular
on-the-fly augmented model, and (3) a model with customized on-the-fly
augmentation. Built upon the nnU-Net framework, our pipeline leverages
pretrained GliGAN weights and tumor insertion methods from prior
challenge-winning solutions. An ensemble of the three models achieves
lesion-wise Dice scores of 0.79 (ET), 0.749 (NETC), 0.872 (RC), 0.825 (SNFH),
0.79 (TC), and 0.88 (WT) on the online BraTS 2025 validation platform. This
work ranked first in the BraTS Lighthouse Challenge 2025 Task 1- Adult Glioma

*Haotian Dong,Wenjing Wang,Chen Li,Di Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Wan-Alpha is a new framework for generating high-quality RGBA videos with transparency by jointly learning RGB and alpha channels using a VAE and diffusion transformer trained on a custom dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RGBA video generation methods often neglect visual quality, limiting their practical usability in applications requiring transparent video content.

Method: Proposes a variational autoencoder that encodes alpha channel into RGB latent space, and trains a diffusion transformer on a high-quality RGBA video dataset for joint RGB and alpha channel generation.

Result: Superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, motion realism, and transparency rendering; capable of generating semi-transparent objects, glowing effects, and fine-grained details like hair strands.

Conclusion: Wan-Alpha demonstrates effective RGBA video generation with improved quality and practical usability, with the model publicly available for use.

Abstract: RGBA video generation, which includes an alpha channel to represent
transparency, is gaining increasing attention across a wide range of
applications. However, existing methods often neglect visual quality, limiting
their practical usability. In this paper, we propose \textit{Wan-Alpha}, a new
framework that generates transparent videos by learning both RGB and alpha
channels jointly. We design an effective variational autoencoder (VAE) that
encodes the alpha channel into the RGB latent space. Then, to support the
training of our diffusion transformer, we construct a high-quality and diverse
RGBA video dataset. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our model
demonstrates superior performance in visual quality, motion realism, and
transparency rendering. Notably, our model can generate a wide variety of
semi-transparent objects, glowing effects, and fine-grained details such as
hair strands. The released model is available on our website:

*Shuang Liang,Jing He,Chuanmeizhi Wang,Lejun Liao,Guo Zhang,Yingcong Chen,Yuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDPose is a fine-tuning framework that leverages Stable Diffusion priors for human pose estimation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal training and strong cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To exploit pre-trained diffusion models' rich latent features for structured outputs like human pose estimation, which remains underexplored compared to dense prediction tasks.

Method: Directly predicts keypoint heatmaps in SD U-Net's latent space, uses lightweight convolutional pose head, and incorporates auxiliary RGB reconstruction branch for robustness.

Result: Achieves parity with Sapiens-1B/2B on COCO with 1/5 training time, sets new SOTA on cross-domain benchmarks HumanArt and COCO-OOD, and enables zero-shot pose annotation for controllable generation.

Conclusion: SDPose effectively repurposes diffusion priors for pose estimation with strong generalization and practical applications in controllable generation tasks.

Abstract: Pre-trained diffusion models provide rich multi-scale latent features and are
emerging as powerful vision backbones. While recent works such as
Marigold~\citep{ke2024repurposing} and Lotus~\citep{he2024lotus} adapt
diffusion priors for dense prediction with strong cross-domain generalization,
their potential for structured outputs (e.g., human pose estimation) remains
underexplored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SDPose}, a fine-tuning
framework built upon Stable Diffusion to fully exploit pre-trained diffusion
priors for human pose estimation. First, rather than modifying cross-attention
modules or introducing learnable embeddings, we directly predict keypoint
heatmaps in the SD U-Net's image latent space to preserve the original
generative priors. Second, we map these latent features into keypoint heatmaps
through a lightweight convolutional pose head, which avoids disrupting the
pre-trained backbone. Finally, to prevent overfitting and enhance
out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate an auxiliary RGB reconstruction
branch that preserves domain-transferable generative semantics. To evaluate
robustness under domain shift, we further construct \textbf{COCO-OOD}, a
style-transferred variant of COCO with preserved annotations. With just
one-fifth of the training schedule used by Sapiens on COCO, SDPose attains
parity with Sapiens-1B/2B on the COCO validation set and establishes a new
state of the art on the cross-domain benchmarks HumanArt and COCO-OOD.
Furthermore, we showcase SDPose as a zero-shot pose annotator for downstream
controllable generation tasks, including ControlNet-based image synthesis and
video generation, where it delivers qualitatively superior pose guidance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanoWorld-X is a framework for generating high-fidelity, controllable panoramic videos with diverse camera trajectories using a Sphere-Aware Diffusion Transformer that models spherical geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of prior works including narrow field-of-view constraints and insufficient camera controllability that hinder continuous scene synthesis and free exploration.

Method: Constructed a large-scale panoramic video-exploration dataset using Unreal Engine simulations, then developed a Sphere-Aware Diffusion Transformer that reprojects equirectangular features onto spherical surfaces to model geometric adjacency.

Result: Achieves superior performance in motion range, control precision, and visual quality compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: PanoWorld-X demonstrates strong potential for real-world applications requiring complete and explorable 360-degree visual worlds.

Abstract: Generating a complete and explorable 360-degree visual world enables a wide
range of downstream applications. While prior works have advanced the field,
they remain constrained by either narrow field-of-view limitations, which
hinder the synthesis of continuous and holistic scenes, or insufficient camera
controllability that restricts free exploration by users or autonomous agents.
To address this, we propose PanoWorld-X, a novel framework for high-fidelity
and controllable panoramic video generation with diverse camera trajectories.
Specifically, we first construct a large-scale dataset of panoramic
video-exploration route pairs by simulating camera trajectories in virtual 3D
environments via Unreal Engine. As the spherical geometry of panoramic data
misaligns with the inductive priors from conventional video diffusion, we then
introduce a Sphere-Aware Diffusion Transformer architecture that reprojects
equirectangular features onto the spherical surface to model geometric
adjacency in latent space, significantly enhancing visual fidelity and
spatiotemporal continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
PanoWorld-X achieves superior performance in various aspects, including motion
range, control precision, and visual quality, underscoring its potential for
real-world applications.

*Tooba Imtiaz,Lucy Chai,Kathryn Heal,Xuan Luo,Jungyeon Park,Jennifer Dy,John Flynn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVT is a transformer-based architecture for large-scale 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis that avoids quadratic attention complexity by processing only local view neighborhoods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard transformers have quadratic complexity that prevents scaling to large scenes, while spatially nearby views provide more useful local scene information than distant views.

Method: Uses Local View Transformer that processes information in local neighborhoods around each view, with novel positional encoding based on relative geometric transformations between query and nearby views, decoded into 3D Gaussian Splat representation.

Result: Enables reconstruction of arbitrarily large, high-resolution scenes in a single forward pass.

Conclusion: LVT successfully addresses the scalability limitations of standard transformers for 3D vision tasks while maintaining high-quality scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis capabilities.

Abstract: Large transformer models are proving to be a powerful tool for 3D vision and
novel view synthesis. However, the standard Transformer's well-known quadratic
complexity makes it difficult to scale these methods to large scenes. To
address this challenge, we propose the Local View Transformer (LVT), a
large-scale scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis architecture that
circumvents the need for the quadratic attention operation. Motivated by the
insight that spatially nearby views provide more useful signal about the local
scene composition than distant views, our model processes all information in a
local neighborhood around each view. To attend to tokens in nearby views, we
leverage a novel positional encoding that conditions on the relative geometric
transformation between the query and nearby views. We decode the output of our
model into a 3D Gaussian Splat scene representation that includes both color
and opacity view-dependence. Taken together, the Local View Transformer enables
reconstruction of arbitrarily large, high-resolution scenes in a single forward
pass. See our project page for results and interactive demos

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning has shown strong reasoning capabilities in natural images but remains largely unexplored for Earth Observation tasks, which present unique challenges like object detection, captioning, change detection, and temporal analysis that require task-aware reasoning.

Method: Proposes a post-training framework that incorporates task-aware rewards to enable effective adaptation of reasoning-based RL models to diverse Earth Observation tasks, enhancing reasoning for remote sensing images while stabilizing optimization.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enhances reasoning capabilities for remote sensing images, improves robustness, and demonstrates superior performance across various Earth Observation tasks compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have delivered strong
reasoning capabilities in natural image domains, yet their potential for Earth
Observation (EO) remains largely unexplored. EO tasks introduce unique
challenges, spanning referred object detection, image or region captioning,
change detection, grounding, and temporal analysis, that demand task aware
reasoning. We propose a novel post training framework that incorporates task
aware rewards to enable effective adaptation of reasoning based RL models to
diverse EO tasks. This training strategy enhances reasoning capabilities for
remote sensing images, stabilizes optimization, and improves robustness.

*Xiaoxiao Ma,Haibo Qiu,Guohui Zhang,Zhixiong Zeng,Siqi Yang,Lin Ma,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STAGE is a stable reinforcement learning framework for autoregressive image generation that addresses gradient conflicts and entropy instability in GRPO algorithms through advantage/KL reweighting and entropy rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GRPO algorithms struggle with autoregressive image models due to training instability that disrupts pretrained capabilities, leading to marginal gains, degraded quality, and poor generalization.

Method: Proposes STAGE with two key solutions: 1) Advantage/KL reweighting with similarity-aware reweighting to alleviate conflicting gradient updates, and 2) Entropy reward based on reference model to stabilize learning dynamics.

Result: Experiments show STAGE consistently improves visual quality, training stability, and cross-task generalization across multiple benchmarks compared to baseline GRPO methods.

Conclusion: STAGE effectively reduces disruption of pretrained distributions and mitigates reward hacking, leading to better generalization and transfer performance on other benchmarks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently been explored to improve text-to-image
generation, yet applying existing GRPO algorithms to autoregressive (AR) image
models remains challenging. The instability of the training process easily
disrupts the pretrained model capability during long runs, resulting in
marginal gains, degraded image quality, and poor generalization. In this work,
we revisit GRPO for AR image generation and identify two key issues:
contradictory gradients from unnecessary tokens and unstable policy entropy
dynamics. To address these, we introduce STAGE, a stable and generalizable
framework that leverages two targeted solutions: 1) Advantage/KL reweighting.
Similarity-aware reweighting to alleviate conflicting updates; and 2) Entropy
reward. An entropy-based reward corresponding to reference model to stabilize
learning. With the help of alleviating conflicts between tokens and an entropy
reward for stabilizing training, we reduce disruption of the pretrained
distribution and mitigate reward hacking, which in turn improves generalization
and transfer better to other benchmarks. Experiments across multiple benchmarks
show that STAGE consistently improves visual quality, stability, and cross-task
generalization compared to baseline GRPO.

### [337] [VT-FSL: Bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25033)
*Wenhao Li,Qiangchang Wang,Xianjing Meng,Zhibin Wu,Yilong Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VT-FSL is a novel few-shot learning framework that bridges vision and text using LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks through cross-modal iterative prompting and geometric alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FSL methods suffer from hallucinating semantics that contradict visual evidence due to lack of grounding in actual instances, resulting in noisy guidance and costly corrections.

Method: Proposes Cross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) that conditions LLMs on class names and support images to generate precise descriptions, and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment (CGA) that aligns fused textual, support, and synthetic visual representations using kernelized volume minimization.

Result: Establishes new state-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks including standard, cross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios.

Conclusion: VT-FSL effectively addresses semantic hallucination in FSL by grounding LLM-generated descriptions in visual evidence and enabling structured multimodal integration through geometric alignment.

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize novel concepts from only a few
labeled support samples. Recent studies enhance support features by
incorporating additional semantic information or designing complex semantic
fusion modules. However, they still suffer from hallucinating semantics that
contradict the visual evidence due to the lack of grounding in actual
instances, resulting in noisy guidance and costly corrections. To address these
issues, we propose a novel framework, bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for
Few-Shot Learning (VT-FSL), which constructs precise cross-modal prompts
conditioned on Large Language Models (LLMs) and support images, seamlessly
integrating them through a geometry-aware alignment. It mainly consists of
Cross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment
(CGA). Specifically, the CIP conditions an LLM on both class names and support
images to generate precise class descriptions iteratively in a single
structured reasoning pass. These descriptions not only enrich the semantic
understanding of novel classes but also enable the zero-shot synthesis of
semantically consistent images. The descriptions and synthetic images act
respectively as complementary textual and visual prompts, providing high-level
class semantics and low-level intra-class diversity to compensate for limited
support data. Furthermore, the CGA jointly aligns the fused textual, support,
and synthetic visual representations by minimizing the kernelized volume of the
3-dimensional parallelotope they span. It captures global and nonlinear
relationships among all representations, enabling structured and consistent
multimodal integration. The proposed VT-FSL method establishes new
state-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks, including standard,
cross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios. Code is available

TL;DR: FFDP is a distributed framework with IO-aware non-GEMM fused kernels that enables unprecedented scale image registration, handling problems 570x larger than clinical standards and accelerating existing pipelines 6-7x while reducing memory usage 20-59%.


<details>

Motivation: Image registration algorithms have not scaled with image acquisition capabilities, creating a bottleneck in biomedical and life sciences where large-scale image processing is needed.

Method: Proposes FFDP framework with IO-aware non-GEMM fused kernels, distributed processing, convolution-aware tensor sharding, and optimization of non-GEMM bottlenecks to complement existing model parallelism techniques.

Result: Achieved registration of 100 micron ex-vivo human brain MRI at native resolution (570x larger than clinical standard) in about a minute using 8 GPUs. Fits 64x larger problems than SOTA on single GPU, with 6-7x speedup and 20-59% memory reduction.

Conclusion: FFDP enables unprecedented scale image registration with significant performance and efficiency improvements, making large-scale biomedical image processing practical.

Abstract: In this work, we propose FFDP, a set of IO-aware non-GEMM fused kernels
supplemented with a distributed framework for image registration at
unprecedented scales. Image registration is an inverse problem fundamental to
biomedical and life sciences, but algorithms have not scaled in tandem with
image acquisition capabilities. Our framework complements existing model
parallelism techniques proposed for large-scale transformer training by
optimizing non-GEMM bottlenecks and enabling convolution-aware tensor sharding.
We demonstrate unprecedented capabilities by performing multimodal registration
of a 100 micron ex-vivo human brain MRI volume at native resolution - an
inverse problem more than 570x larger than a standard clinical datum in about a
minute using only 8 A6000 GPUs. FFDP accelerates existing state-of-the-art
optimization and deep learning registration pipelines by upto 6 - 7x while
reducing peak memory consumption by 20 - 59%. Comparative analysis on a 250
micron dataset shows that FFDP can fit upto 64x larger problems than existing
SOTA on a single GPU, and highlights both the performance and efficiency gains
of FFDP compared to SOTA image registration methods.

TL;DR: GEM is a novel cryo-EM reconstruction framework using 3D Gaussian Splatting that achieves faster training, lower memory usage, and improved resolution compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Fourier-space methods lose fidelity due to repeated transforms, while recent neural radiance field approaches have cubic memory and computation overhead, making cryo-EM reconstruction computationally expensive and memory intensive for large datasets.

Method: GEM represents proteins with compact 3D Gaussians (each parameterized by 11 values) instead of modeling the entire density volume, and uses a novel gradient computation to 3D Gaussians that contribute to each voxel to improve training efficiency.

Result: GEM achieves up to 48% faster training, 12% lower memory usage, and improves local resolution by as much as 38.8% compared to state-of-the-art methods on standard cryo-EM benchmarks.

Conclusion: GEM establishes a practical and scalable paradigm for cryo-EM reconstruction that unifies speed, efficiency, and high-resolution accuracy.

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a central tool for
high-resolution structural biology, yet the massive scale of datasets (often
exceeding 100k particle images) renders 3D reconstruction both computationally
expensive and memory intensive. Traditional Fourier-space methods are efficient
but lose fidelity due to repeated transforms, while recent real-space
approaches based on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) improve accuracy but incur
cubic memory and computation overhead. Therefore, we introduce GEM, a novel
cryo-EM reconstruction framework built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that
operates directly in real-space while maintaining high efficiency. Instead of
modeling the entire density volume, GEM represents proteins with compact 3D
Gaussians, each parameterized by only 11 values. To further improve the
training efficiency, we designed a novel gradient computation to 3D Gaussians
that contribute to each voxel. This design substantially reduced both memory
footprint and training cost. On standard cryo-EM benchmarks, GEM achieves up to
48% faster training and 12% lower memory usage compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while improving local resolution by as much as 38.8%. These results
establish GEM as a practical and scalable paradigm for cryo-EM reconstruction,
unifying speed, efficiency, and high-resolution accuracy. Our code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MANI-Pure is a magnitude-adaptive adversarial purification framework that uses frequency-targeted noise injection instead of uniform noise, achieving state-of-the-art robust accuracy while preserving clean accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial perturbations are concentrated in high-frequency regions with heterogeneous patterns, but existing purification methods use uniform noise that corrupts semantic structures and undermines robustness.

Method: MANI-Pure leverages the magnitude spectrum of inputs to guide purification, adaptively applying heterogeneous, frequency-targeted noise that suppresses adversarial perturbations in fragile high-frequency bands while preserving low-frequency content.

Result: On CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K, MANI-Pure narrows the clean accuracy gap to within 0.59 of the original classifier, boosts robust accuracy by 2.15, and achieves top-1 robust accuracy on RobustBench leaderboard, surpassing previous state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: Frequency-aware, magnitude-adaptive noise injection is an effective strategy for adversarial purification that balances robustness and clean accuracy better than uniform noise approaches.

Abstract: Adversarial purification with diffusion models has emerged as a promising
defense strategy, but existing methods typically rely on uniform noise
injection, which indiscriminately perturbs all frequencies, corrupting semantic
structures and undermining robustness. Our empirical study reveals that
adversarial perturbations are not uniformly distributed: they are predominantly
concentrated in high-frequency regions, with heterogeneous magnitude intensity
patterns that vary across frequencies and attack types. Motivated by this
observation, we introduce MANI-Pure, a magnitude-adaptive purification
framework that leverages the magnitude spectrum of inputs to guide the
purification process. Instead of injecting homogeneous noise, MANI-Pure
adaptively applies heterogeneous, frequency-targeted noise, effectively
suppressing adversarial perturbations in fragile high-frequency, low-magnitude
bands while preserving semantically critical low-frequency content. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K validate the effectiveness of
MANI-Pure. It narrows the clean accuracy gap to within 0.59 of the original
classifier, while boosting robust accuracy by 2.15, and achieves the top-1
robust accuracy on the RobustBench leaderboard, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art method.

TL;DR: Triangle Splatting+ directly optimizes triangles within a differentiable splatting framework, enabling state-of-the-art mesh-based novel view synthesis without post-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting methods are not natively compatible with mesh-based pipelines used in VR and graphics applications, and conversion approaches increase complexity and degrade visual quality.

Method: Formulates triangle parametrization with shared vertices for connectivity, designs training strategy to enforce opaque triangles, and directly optimizes triangles in a differentiable splatting framework.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Mip-NeRF360 and Tanks & Temples datasets, surpassing prior splatting approaches in visual fidelity while remaining efficient and fast to train.

Conclusion: The method produces semi-connected meshes that are immediately usable in standard graphics engines and support downstream applications like physics-based simulation and interactive walkthroughs.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes and synthesizing novel views has seen rapid progress
in recent years. Neural Radiance Fields demonstrated that continuous volumetric
radiance fields can achieve high-quality image synthesis, but their long
training and rendering times limit practicality. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
addressed these issues by representing scenes with millions of Gaussians,
enabling real-time rendering and fast optimization. However, Gaussian
primitives are not natively compatible with the mesh-based pipelines used in VR
headsets, and real-time graphics applications. Existing solutions attempt to
convert Gaussians into meshes through post-processing or two-stage pipelines,
which increases complexity and degrades visual quality. In this work, we
introduce Triangle Splatting+, which directly optimizes triangles, the
fundamental primitive of computer graphics, within a differentiable splatting
framework. We formulate triangle parametrization to enable connectivity through
shared vertices, and we design a training strategy that enforces opaque
triangles. The final output is immediately usable in standard graphics engines
without post-processing. Experiments on the Mip-NeRF360 and Tanks & Temples
datasets show that Triangle Splatting+achieves state-of-the-art performance in
mesh-based novel view synthesis. Our method surpasses prior splatting
approaches in visual fidelity while remaining efficient and fast to training.
Moreover, the resulting semi-connected meshes support downstream applications
such as physics-based simulation or interactive walkthroughs. The project page

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TemMed-Bench is the first benchmark for analyzing patient condition changes over time using temporal medical images, revealing that most LVLMs struggle with temporal reasoning and multi-modal retrieval augmentation improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical reasoning benchmarks focus on single-visit analysis, which deviates from real clinical practice where doctors track patient changes over multiple visits using historical data.

Method: Created TemMed-Bench with three tasks (VQA, report generation, image-pair selection) and 17K+ knowledge corpus. Evaluated 12 LVLMs and explored multi-modal retrieval augmentation combining visual and textual modalities.

Result: Most LVLMs lack temporal reasoning ability, performing at random-guessing level in closed-book settings. GPT o3, o4-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet performed best but still below desired level. Multi-modal retrieval improved VQA performance by 2.59% on average.

Conclusion: LVLMs have significant limitations in temporal medical image reasoning. Multi-modal retrieval augmentation shows promise for addressing this challenge and represents a valuable direction for future research.

Abstract: Existing medical reasoning benchmarks for vision-language models primarily
focus on analyzing a patient's condition based on an image from a single visit.
However, this setting deviates significantly from real-world clinical practice,
where doctors typically refer to a patient's historical conditions to provide a
comprehensive assessment by tracking their changes over time. In this paper, we
introduce TemMed-Bench, the first benchmark designed for analyzing changes in
patients' conditions between different clinical visits, which challenges large
vision-language models (LVLMs) to reason over temporal medical images.
TemMed-Bench consists of a test set comprising three tasks - visual
question-answering (VQA), report generation, and image-pair selection - and a
supplementary knowledge corpus of over 17,000 instances. With TemMed-Bench, we
conduct an evaluation of six proprietary and six open-source LVLMs. Our results
show that most LVLMs lack the ability to analyze patients' condition changes
over temporal medical images, and a large proportion perform only at a
random-guessing level in the closed-book setting. In contrast, GPT o3, o4-mini
and Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrate comparatively decent performance, though they
have yet to reach the desired level. Furthermore, we explore augmenting the
input with both retrieved visual and textual modalities in the medical domain.
We also show that multi-modal retrieval augmentation yields notably higher
performance gains than no retrieval and textual retrieval alone across most
models on our benchmark, with the VQA task showing an average improvement of
2.59%. Overall, we compose a benchmark grounded on real-world clinical
practice, and it reveals LVLMs' limitations in temporal medical image
reasoning, as well as highlighting the use of multi-modal retrieval
augmentation as a potentially promising direction worth exploring to address
this challenge.

Motivation: MLLMs have limitations in visual-spatial reasoning due to visual tokens being overshadowed by language tokens in attention mechanisms, preventing consistent recognition of visual cues across frames.

Method: Proposes VideoAnchor module that connects self-expressiveness property from sparse subspace clustering with attention mechanism in Transformers, using subspace affinities to anchor attention to shared visual structures.

Result: Achieves consistent performance gains: 3.2% and 4.6% improvements on VSI-Bench and Video-MME (spatial-related tasks) with InternVL2-8B and Qwen2.5VL-72B backbones, with qualitative improvements in subspace partitions and visual grounding.

Conclusion: VideoAnchor effectively addresses visual-spatial reasoning limitations in MLLMs through subspace-based attention anchoring, demonstrating significant improvements across benchmarks without requiring retraining.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive progress in
vision-language alignment, yet they remain limited in visual-spatial reasoning.
We first identify that this limitation arises from the attention mechanism:
visual tokens are overshadowed by language tokens, preventing the model from
consistently recognizing the same visual cues across frames. To address this
challenge, we draw a novel connection between the self-expressiveness property
in sparse subspace clustering and the attention mechanism in Transformers.
Building on this insight, we propose VideoAnchor, a plug-and-play module that
leverages subspace affinities to reinforce visual cues across frames without
retraining, effectively anchoring attention to shared visual structures.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and backbone models show consistent
performance gains -- $e.g.$, 3.2% and 4.6% improvements on VSI-Bench and
Video-MME (spatial-related tasks) with InternVL2-8B and Qwen2.5VL-72B -- while
qualitative analyses demonstrate more coherent subspace partitions and stronger
visual grounding. Our codes will be made public available at

### [344] [Rolling Forcing: Autoregressive Long Video Diffusion in Real Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25161)
*Kunhao Liu,Wenbo Hu,Jiale Xu,Ying Shan,Shijian Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rolling Forcing is a novel video generation technique that enables streaming long videos with minimal error accumulation through joint denoising, attention sink mechanism, and efficient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing streaming video generation methods suffer from severe error accumulation that degrades video quality over long horizons, limiting their practical applications in interactive world models and neural game engines.

Method: Three key designs: 1) Joint denoising scheme that simultaneously denoises multiple frames with progressive noise levels to relax causality and suppress error growth; 2) Attention sink mechanism that maintains key value states of initial frames as global context anchor; 3) Efficient training algorithm for few-step distillation over extended denoising windows.

Result: Rolling Forcing enables real-time streaming generation of multi-minute videos on a single GPU with substantially reduced error accumulation compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed Rolling Forcing technique effectively addresses error accumulation in streaming video generation and enables high-quality, low-latency, temporally coherent long video streams.

Abstract: Streaming video generation, as one fundamental component in interactive world
models and neural game engines, aims to generate high-quality, low-latency, and
temporally coherent long video streams. However, most existing work suffers
from severe error accumulation that often significantly degrades the generated
stream videos over long horizons. We design Rolling Forcing, a novel video
generation technique that enables streaming long videos with minimal error
accumulation. Rolling Forcing comes with three novel designs. First, instead of
iteratively sampling individual frames, which accelerates error propagation, we
design a joint denoising scheme that simultaneously denoises multiple frames
with progressively increasing noise levels. This design relaxes the strict
causality across adjacent frames, effectively suppressing error growth. Second,
we introduce the attention sink mechanism into the long-horizon stream video
generation task, which allows the model to keep key value states of initial
frames as a global context anchor and thereby enhances long-term global
consistency. Third, we design an efficient training algorithm that enables
few-step distillation over largely extended denoising windows. This algorithm
operates on non-overlapping windows and mitigates exposure bias conditioned on
self-generated histories. Extensive experiments show that Rolling Forcing
enables real-time streaming generation of multi-minute videos on a single GPU,
with substantially reduced error accumulation.

### [345] [Aligning Visual Foundation Encoders to Tokenizers for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25162)
*Bowei Chen,Sai Bi,Hao Tan,He Zhang,Tianyuan Zhang,Zhengqi Li,Yuanjun Xiong,Jianming Zhang,Kai Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes aligning pretrained visual encoders as tokenizers for latent diffusion models instead of training VAEs from scratch, using a three-stage alignment strategy to create semantically rich image tokenizers that accelerate diffusion model convergence and improve generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional variational autoencoders (VAEs) trained from scratch focus primarily on low-level details, lacking the rich semantic structure of foundation encoders. The goal is to leverage pretrained visual encoders' semantic understanding for better image tokenization in diffusion models.

Method: Three-stage alignment strategy: (1) freeze encoder and train adapter/decoder to establish semantic latent space; (2) joint optimization with semantic preservation loss to capture perceptual details while retaining high-level semantics; (3) decoder refinement for improved reconstruction quality.

Result: On ImageNet 256×256, the tokenizer accelerates diffusion model convergence, achieving gFID of 1.90 within 64 epochs, and improves generation with/without classifier-free guidance. Scaling to LAION, a 2B-parameter text-to-image model with this tokenizer outperforms FLUX VAE under same training steps.

Conclusion: The method provides a simple, scalable approach for continuous tokenizer design that establishes a semantically grounded paradigm, leveraging foundation encoders' rich semantic structure for superior image generation performance in diffusion models.

Abstract: In this work, we propose aligning pretrained visual encoders to serve as
tokenizers for latent diffusion models in image generation. Unlike training a
variational autoencoder (VAE) from scratch, which primarily emphasizes
low-level details, our approach leverages the rich semantic structure of
foundation encoders. We introduce a three-stage alignment strategy: (1) freeze
the encoder and train an adapter and a decoder to establish a semantic latent
space; (2) jointly optimize all components with an additional semantic
preservation loss, enabling the encoder to capture perceptual details while
retaining high-level semantics; and (3) refine the decoder for improved
reconstruction quality. This alignment yields semantically rich image
tokenizers that benefit diffusion models. On ImageNet 256$\times$256, our
tokenizer accelerates the convergence of diffusion models, reaching a gFID of
1.90 within just 64 epochs, and improves generation both with and without
classifier-free guidance. Scaling to LAION, a 2B-parameter text-to-image model
trained with our tokenizer consistently outperforms FLUX VAE under the same
training steps. Overall, our method is simple, scalable, and establishes a
semantically grounded paradigm for continuous tokenizer design.

*Yuxin Jiang,Yuchao Gu,Yiren Song,Ivor Tsang,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PICO is a visual in-context learning framework that uses diffusion transformers to perform personalized vision tasks from a single annotated example, without requiring retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision models struggle with personalized tasks defined at test time, and current personalization methods rely on costly fine-tuning or synthetic data pipelines that are inflexible.

Method: A four-panel framework using diffusion transformers as visual in-context learners, trained on VisRel - a diverse but compact dataset, with an attention-guided seed scorer for improved reliability.

Result: PICO surpasses fine-tuning and synthetic-data baselines, flexibly adapts to novel user-defined tasks, and generalizes across both recognition and generation tasks.

Conclusion: Task diversity rather than dataset scale drives robust generalization for visual in-context learning, enabling effective personalized vision without retraining.

Abstract: Modern vision models, trained on large-scale annotated datasets, excel at
predefined tasks but struggle with personalized vision -- tasks defined at test
time by users with customized objects or novel objectives. Existing
personalization approaches rely on costly fine-tuning or synthetic data
pipelines, which are inflexible and restricted to fixed task formats. Visual
in-context learning (ICL) offers a promising alternative, yet prior methods
confine to narrow, in-domain tasks and fail to generalize to open-ended
personalization. We introduce Personalized In-Context Operator (PICO), a simple
four-panel framework that repurposes diffusion transformers as visual
in-context learners. Given a single annotated exemplar, PICO infers the
underlying transformation and applies it to new inputs without retraining. To
enable this, we construct VisRel, a compact yet diverse tuning dataset, showing
that task diversity, rather than scale, drives robust generalization. We
further propose an attention-guided seed scorer that improves reliability via
efficient inference scaling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PICO (i)
surpasses fine-tuning and synthetic-data baselines, (ii) flexibly adapts to
novel user-defined tasks, and (iii) generalizes across both recognition and
generation.

### [348] [Mitigating Hallucination in Multimodal LLMs with Layer Contrastive Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25177)
*Bingkui Tong,Jiaer Xia,Kaiyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerCD is a simple approach that reduces hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models by contrasting output distributions from shallow and deep visual features to filter out inconsistent outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often generate hallucinations - outputs that are linguistically coherent but inconsistent with input images, particularly in objects, attributes, and relations. This occurs because shallow visual features capture biased, low-level information insufficient for high-level reasoning.

Method: Layer Contrastive Decoding (LayerCD) contrasts output distributions generated from visual features of different levels - specifically comparing shallow and deep layers of the vision encoder to filter out hallucinations.

Result: Extensive experiments on two hallucination benchmarks show that LayerCD significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in reducing hallucinations.

Conclusion: LayerCD effectively addresses hallucination issues in MLLMs by leveraging the contrast between shallow and deep visual features, providing a simple yet powerful solution for improving output consistency with visual context.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive perception and
reasoning capabilities, yet they often suffer from hallucinations -- generating
outputs that are linguistically coherent but inconsistent with the context of
the input image, including inaccuracies in objects, attributes, and relations.
To address this challenge, we propose a simple approach called Layer
Contrastive Decoding (LayerCD). Our design is motivated by the observation that
shallow visual features are much more likely than deep visual features to cause
an MLLM to hallucinate as they only capture biased, low-level information that
is insufficient for high-level reasoning. Therefore, LayerCD aims to filter out
hallucinations by contrasting the output distributions generated from visual
features of different levels, specifically those from the shallow and deep
layers of the vision encoder, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments on
two hallucination benchmarks and show that LayerCD significantly outperforms
current state-of-the-art. The code for LayerCD is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAD3R reconstructs deformable 3D objects from unposed monocular videos using personalized pose estimation guided by pre-trained 3D models and regularized by long-term 2D tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with long video sequences containing substantial object deformation, large camera movement, and limited view coverage that challenge conventional 3D reconstruction systems.

Method: Trains object-centric pose estimator supervised by pre-trained image-to-3D model, guides optimization of deformable 3D Gaussian representation, and regularizes with long-term 2D point tracking across entire video.

Result: Reconstructs high-fidelity, articulated 3D representations in category-agnostic way, showing robustness and good generalization across challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: PAD3R demonstrates potential for dynamic scene understanding and 3D content creation by effectively handling complex deformable object reconstruction from casual monocular videos.

Abstract: We present PAD3R, a method for reconstructing deformable 3D objects from
casually captured, unposed monocular videos. Unlike existing approaches, PAD3R
handles long video sequences featuring substantial object deformation,
large-scale camera movement, and limited view coverage that typically challenge
conventional systems. At its core, our approach trains a personalized,
object-centric pose estimator, supervised by a pre-trained image-to-3D model.
This guides the optimization of deformable 3D Gaussian representation. The
optimization is further regularized by long-term 2D point tracking over the
entire input video. By combining generative priors and differentiable
rendering, PAD3R reconstructs high-fidelity, articulated 3D representations of
objects in a category-agnostic way. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
results show that PAD3R is robust and generalizes well across challenging
scenarios, highlighting its potential for dynamic scene understanding and 3D
content creation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixelCraft is a multi-agent system that improves visual reasoning on structured images (charts, diagrams) by combining high-fidelity image processing with flexible reasoning through tool selection, agent discussion, and self-criticism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Structured images pose challenges for MLLMs due to perceptual errors that lead to wrong conclusions. Existing cue-based methods have limitations with low-fidelity processing and rigid reasoning patterns.

Method: Multi-agent system with dispatcher, planner, reasoner, critics, and visual tool agents. Uses fine-tuned MLLM for pixel-level localization integrated with CV algorithms, plus dynamic three-stage workflow with image memory for adaptive reasoning.

Result: Significantly improves visual reasoning performance on challenging chart and geometry benchmarks, setting new standards for structured image reasoning.

Conclusion: PixelCraft effectively addresses structured image reasoning challenges through high-fidelity processing and flexible multi-agent reasoning, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Structured images (e.g., charts and geometric diagrams) remain challenging
for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as perceptual slips can cascade
into erroneous conclusions. Intermediate visual cues can steer reasoning;
however, existing cue-based methods are constrained with low-fidelity image
processing and linear, rigid reasoning patterns, limiting their effectiveness
on complex structured-image tasks. In this paper, we propose PixelCraft, a
novel multi-agent system for high-fidelity image processing and flexible visual
reasoning on structured images. The system comprises a dispatcher, a planner, a
reasoner, critics, and a set of visual tool agents. To achieve high-fidelity
processing, we construct a high-quality corpus and fine-tune an MLLM into a
grounding model, whose pixel-level localizations are integrated with
traditional computer vision (CV) algorithms in tool agents. Building on this
foundation, PixelCraft facilitates flexible visual reasoning through a dynamic
three-stage workflow of tool selection, agent discussion, and self-criticism.
Moreover, unlike prior linear reasoning patterns that simply append historical
images, PixelCraft maintains an image memory to allow the planner to adaptively
revisit earlier visual steps, explore alternative reasoning branches, and
dynamically adjust the reasoning trajectory during discussion. Extensive
experiments on challenging chart and geometry benchmarks demonstrate that
PixelCraft significantly improves visual reasoning performance for advanced
MLLMs, setting a new standard for structured image reasoning. Our code will be

### [351] [FlashI2V: Fourier-Guided Latent Shifting Prevents Conditional Image Leakage in Image-to-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25187)
*Yunyang Ge,Xinhua Cheng,Chengshu Zhao,Xianyi He,Shenghai Yuan,Bin Lin,Bin Zhu,Li Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashI2V is a new Image-to-Video generation method that prevents conditional image leakage using latent shifting and Fourier guidance, achieving better generalization and outperforming larger models on out-of-domain data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing I2V methods suffer from conditional image leakage where denoisers shortcut the conditional image, causing issues like slow motion, color inconsistency, and poor performance on out-of-domain data.

Method: FlashI2V uses two main techniques: (1) Latent Shifting - modifies flow matching distributions by subtracting conditional image information from noisy latents to incorporate conditions implicitly; (2) Fourier Guidance - uses high-frequency magnitude features from Fourier Transform to accelerate convergence and adjust detail levels.

Result: FlashI2V achieves dynamic degree score of 53.01 on Vbench-I2V with only 1.3B parameters, outperforming larger models like CogVideoX1.5-5B-I2V and Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P, and shows best generalization on out-of-domain data.

Conclusion: The proposed FlashI2V effectively overcomes conditional image leakage and achieves superior performance and generalization in Image-to-Video generation compared to existing methods.

Abstract: In Image-to-Video (I2V) generation, a video is created using an input image
as the first-frame condition. Existing I2V methods concatenate the full
information of the conditional image with noisy latents to achieve high
fidelity. However, the denoisers in these methods tend to shortcut the
conditional image, which is known as conditional image leakage, leading to
performance degradation issues such as slow motion and color inconsistency. In
this work, we further clarify that conditional image leakage leads to
overfitting to in-domain data and decreases the performance in out-of-domain
scenarios. Moreover, we introduce Fourier-Guided Latent Shifting I2V, named
FlashI2V, to prevent conditional image leakage. Concretely, FlashI2V consists
of: (1) Latent Shifting. We modify the source and target distributions of flow
matching by subtracting the conditional image information from the noisy
latents, thereby incorporating the condition implicitly. (2) Fourier Guidance.
We use high-frequency magnitude features obtained by the Fourier Transform to
accelerate convergence and enable the adjustment of detail levels in the
generated video. Experimental results show that our method effectively
overcomes conditional image leakage and achieves the best generalization and
performance on out-of-domain data among various I2V paradigms. With only 1.3B
parameters, FlashI2V achieves a dynamic degree score of 53.01 on Vbench-I2V,
surpassing CogVideoX1.5-5B-I2V and Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P. Github page:

*Penghao Wu,Yushan Zhang,Haiwen Diao,Bo Li,Lewei Lu,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual Jigsaw is a self-supervised post-training framework that enhances MLLMs' visual understanding through a jigsaw puzzle task where models reconstruct shuffled visual inputs by predicting correct permutations in natural language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current post-training for MLLMs is predominantly text-centric, using visual inputs only to extract sparse cues for text reasoning. There's a need for vision-centric approaches that don't rely on text mediators or additional visual generative components.

Method: Visual Jigsaw partitions visual inputs (images, videos, 3D data), shuffles them, and trains models to reconstruct the original order by producing correct permutations in natural language using reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards.

Result: Extensive experiments show substantial improvements in fine-grained perception, temporal reasoning, and 3D spatial understanding across multiple visual modalities.

Conclusion: Self-supervised vision-centric tasks like Visual Jigsaw show great potential for enhancing MLLMs' visual understanding and should inspire further research on vision-centric pretext designs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning based post-training has recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for enhancing the alignment and reasoning capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). While vision-centric post-training is crucial
for enhancing MLLMs' intrinsic understanding of visual signals, current
post-training paradigms are predominantly text-centric, where dense visual
inputs are only leveraged to extract sparse cues for text-based reasoning.
There exist a few approaches in this direction, however, they often still rely
on text as an intermediate mediator or introduce additional visual generative
designs. In this work, we introduce Visual Jigsaw, a generic self-supervised
post-training framework designed to strengthen visual understanding in MLLMs.
Visual Jigsaw is formulated as a general ordering task: visual inputs are
partitioned, shuffled, and the model must reconstruct the visual information by
producing the correct permutation in natural language. This naturally aligns
with reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), requires no
additional visual generative components, and derives its supervisory signal
automatically without any annotations. We instantiate Visual Jigsaw across
three visual modalities, including images, videos, and 3D data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in fine-grained perception,
temporal reasoning, and 3D spatial understanding. Our findings highlight the
potential of self-supervised vision-centric tasks in post-training MLLMs and
aim to inspire further research on vision-centric pretext designs. Project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGGT-X enables dense novel view synthesis without relying on traditional SfM pipelines by addressing VRAM limitations and imperfect outputs of 3D foundation models through memory-efficient implementation, adaptive alignment, and robust 3DGS training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NVS approaches depend on slow and fragile SfM pipelines for 3D attributes. While 3D foundation models offer faster alternatives, they face challenges when scaled to dense views due to VRAM constraints and imperfect outputs that degrade 3D training.

Method: Proposed VGGT-X with three key components: memory-efficient VGGT implementation scaling to 1000+ images, adaptive global alignment for output enhancement, and robust 3DGS training practices.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in dense COLMAP-free NVS and pose estimation, substantially closing the fidelity gap with COLMAP-initialized pipelines.

Conclusion: The proposed measures effectively address barriers in scaling 3D foundation models to dense views, providing insights for future development of 3D foundation models and dense NVS.

Abstract: We study the problem of applying 3D Foundation Models (3DFMs) to dense Novel
View Synthesis (NVS). Despite significant progress in Novel View Synthesis
powered by NeRF and 3DGS, current approaches remain reliant on accurate 3D
attributes (e.g., camera poses and point clouds) acquired from
Structure-from-Motion (SfM), which is often slow and fragile in low-texture or
low-overlap captures. Recent 3DFMs showcase orders of magnitude speedup over
the traditional pipeline and great potential for online NVS. But most of the
validation and conclusions are confined to sparse-view settings. Our study
reveals that naively scaling 3DFMs to dense views encounters two fundamental
barriers: dramatically increasing VRAM burden and imperfect outputs that
degrade initialization-sensitive 3D training. To address these barriers, we
introduce VGGT-X, incorporating a memory-efficient VGGT implementation that
scales to 1,000+ images, an adaptive global alignment for VGGT output
enhancement, and robust 3DGS training practices. Extensive experiments show
that these measures substantially close the fidelity gap with
COLMAP-initialized pipelines, achieving state-of-the-art results in dense
COLMAP-free NVS and pose estimation. Additionally, we analyze the causes of
remaining gaps with COLMAP-initialized rendering, providing insights for the
future development of 3D foundation models and dense NVS. Our project page is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual reasoning methods focus on specific reasoning modes and struggle to develop general reasoning capabilities, limiting their adaptability across different domains.

Method: AdaVaR framework with two stages: supervised cold-start stage for unifying and learning different reasoning modes, followed by RL process with AdaGRPO algorithm for inducing mode selection capability based on context.

Result: Extensive experiments show effective learning and differentiation of multiple modes, context-adaptive mode selection, and consistent improvement across various scenarios.

Conclusion: MoVT presents an effective solution for building general visual reasoning models by unifying reasoning modes and enabling adaptive mode selection.

Abstract: Current visual reasoning methods mainly focus on exploring specific reasoning
modes. Although improvements can be achieved in particular domains, they
struggle to develop general reasoning capabilities. Inspired by this, we
propose a novel adaptive reasoning paradigm, Mixture-of-Visual-Thoughts (MoVT),
which unifies different reasoning modes within a single model and guides it to
select the appropriate mode based on context. To achieve this, we introduce
AdaVaR, a two-stage Adaptive Visual Reasoning learning framework: different
modes are unified and learned during the supervised cold-start stage, and the
mode selection capability is induced via an RL process with a carefully
designed AdaGRPO algorithm. Extensive experiments show that AdaVaR effectively
guides the model to learn and differentiate multiple modes and perform
context-adaptive mode selection, achieving consistent improvement across
various scenarios, highlighting MoVT as an effective solution for building
general visual reasoning models.

*Seungpil Lee,Donghyeon Shin,Yunjeong Lee,Sundong Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can develop human-like gambling addiction behaviors including cognitive biases and irrational risk-taking, especially when given autonomy in financial decision-making scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used in financial domains like asset management and trading, understanding their potential for pathological decision-making similar to human gambling addiction has become practically important.

Method: Systematic analysis of LLM decision-making at cognitive-behavioral and neural levels using slot machine experiments, examining cognitive biases like illusion of control and gambler's fallacy, and neural circuit analysis with Sparse Autoencoder.

Result: LLMs exhibited cognitive features of human gambling addiction, with increased bankruptcy rates and irrational behavior when given autonomy. Neural analysis confirmed model behavior is controlled by abstract decision-making features related to risky behaviors, not just prompts.

Conclusion: LLMs can internalize human-like cognitive biases and decision-making mechanisms beyond mere pattern mimicry, highlighting the critical need for AI safety design in financial applications.

Abstract: This study explores whether large language models can exhibit behavioral
patterns similar to human gambling addictions. As LLMs are increasingly
utilized in financial decision-making domains such as asset management and
commodity trading, understanding their potential for pathological
decision-making has gained practical significance. We systematically analyze
LLM decision-making at cognitive-behavioral and neural levels based on human
gambling addiction research. In slot machine experiments, we identified
cognitive features of human gambling addiction, such as illusion of control,
gambler's fallacy, and loss chasing. When given the freedom to determine their
own target amounts and betting sizes, bankruptcy rates rose substantially
alongside increased irrational behavior, demonstrating that greater autonomy
amplifies risk-taking tendencies. Through neural circuit analysis using a
Sparse Autoencoder, we confirmed that model behavior is controlled by abstract
decision-making features related to risky and safe behaviors, not merely by
prompts. These findings suggest LLMs can internalize human-like cognitive
biases and decision-making mechanisms beyond simply mimicking training data
patterns, emphasizing the importance of AI safety design in financial
applications.

*Sumanth Varambally,Thomas Voice,Yanchao Sun,Zhifeng Chen,Rose Yu,Ke Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hilbert is an agentic framework that combines informal LLM reasoning with formal theorem proving in Lean 4 to bridge the gap between mathematical problem-solving capabilities and verifiable proof generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prover LLMs solve substantially fewer problems than general-purpose LLMs in natural language, creating a gap between informal mathematical reasoning and formal verifiable proof generation that needs to be addressed.

Method: Hilbert orchestrates four components: an informal LLM for mathematical reasoning, a specialized prover LLM for Lean 4 tactics, a formal verifier, and a semantic theorem retriever. It uses recursive decomposition to split problems into subgoals and leverages verifier feedback to refine incorrect proofs.

Result: Hilbert achieves 99.2% on miniF2F (6.6 points above best public method), solves 70.0% of PutnamBench problems (462/660), outperforming proprietary approaches like SeedProver (50.4%) and achieving 422% improvement over best public baseline.

Conclusion: Hilbert effectively narrows the gap between informal reasoning and formal proof generation by combining the complementary strengths of both approaches through an agentic framework.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive mathematical reasoning
abilities, but their solutions frequently contain errors that cannot be
automatically verified. Formal theorem proving systems such as Lean 4 offer
automated verification with complete accuracy, motivating recent efforts to
build specialized prover LLMs that generate verifiable proofs in formal
languages. However, a significant gap remains: current prover LLMs solve
substantially fewer problems than general-purpose LLMs operating in natural
language. We introduce Hilbert, an agentic framework that bridges this gap by
combining the complementary strengths of informal reasoning and formal
verification. Our system orchestrates four components: an informal LLM that
excels at mathematical reasoning, a specialized prover LLM optimized for Lean 4
tactics, a formal verifier, and a semantic theorem retriever. Given a problem
that the prover is unable to solve, Hilbert employs recursive decomposition to
split the problem into subgoals that it solves with the prover or reasoner LLM.
It leverages verifier feedback to refine incorrect proofs as necessary.
Experimental results demonstrate that Hilbert substantially outperforms
existing approaches on key benchmarks, achieving 99.2% on miniF2F, 6.6% points
above the best publicly available method. Hilbert achieves the best known
result on PutnamBench. It solves 462/660 problems (70.0%), outperforming
proprietary approaches like SeedProver (50.4%) and achieving a 422% improvement
over the best publicly available baseline. Thus, Hilbert effectively narrows
the gap between informal reasoning and formal proof generation.

### [357] [Toward a Theory of Generalizability in LLM Mechanistic Interpretability Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22831)
*Sean Trott*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework for understanding when mechanistic findings from one LLM generalize to others, identifying five axes of correspondence and validating them through analysis of 1-back attention heads across Pythia models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field lacks clear principles for determining when mechanistic findings from one LLM instance generalize to others, creating an epistemological challenge for mechanistic interpretability research.

Method: Proposes five axes of correspondence (functional, developmental, positional, relational, configurational) and empirically validates them by analyzing 1-back attention heads across different sizes and random seeds of Pythia models during pretraining.

Result: Found striking consistency in developmental trajectories of 1-back attention across models, limited positional consistency, and systematic patterns where larger models show earlier onsets, steeper slopes, and higher peaks of 1-back attention.

Conclusion: Progress in mechanistic interpretability research requires mapping constitutive design properties of LLMs to their emergent behaviors and mechanisms to establish generalizability principles.

Abstract: Research on Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly focuses on identifying
mechanistic explanations for their behaviors, yet the field lacks clear
principles for determining when (and how) findings from one model instance
generalize to another. This paper addresses a fundamental epistemological
challenge: given a mechanistic claim about a particular model, what justifies
extrapolating this finding to other LLMs -- and along which dimensions might
such generalizations hold? I propose five potential axes of correspondence
along which mechanistic claims might generalize, including: functional (whether
they satisfy the same functional criteria), developmental (whether they develop
at similar points during pretraining), positional (whether they occupy similar
absolute or relative positions), relational (whether they interact with other
model components in similar ways), and configurational (whether they correspond
to particular regions or structures in weight-space). To empirically validate
this framework, I analyze "1-back attention heads" (components attending to
previous tokens) across pretraining in random seeds of the Pythia models (14M,
70M, 160M, 410M). The results reveal striking consistency in the developmental
trajectories of 1-back attention across models, while positional consistency is
more limited. Moreover, seeds of larger models systematically show earlier
onsets, steeper slopes, and higher peaks of 1-back attention. I also address
possible objections to the arguments and proposals outlined here. Finally, I
conclude by arguing that progress on the generalizability of mechanistic
interpretability research will consist in mapping constitutive design
properties of LLMs to their emergent behaviors and mechanisms.

*Louie Hong Yao,Nicholas Jarvis,Tiffany Zhan,Saptarshi Ghosh,Linfeng Liu,Tianyu Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JE-IRT is a geometric item-response framework that embeds LLMs and questions in a shared space to provide multidimensional evaluation, replacing global rankings with topical specialization and enabling interpretable analysis of model abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LLM evaluation practices compress diverse abilities into single scores, obscuring their inherently multidimensional nature and limiting interpretability.

Method: A geometric item-response framework that embeds both LLMs and questions in a shared space, where question direction encodes semantics and norm encodes difficulty, and correctness is determined by geometric interactions between model and question embeddings.

Result: The framework explains out-of-distribution behavior through directional alignment, shows larger norms consistently indicate harder questions, supports generalization by adding new LLMs with single embeddings, and reveals an LLM-internal taxonomy that partially aligns with human-defined categories.

Conclusion: JE-IRT establishes a unified and interpretable geometric lens connecting LLM abilities with question structure, offering a distinctive perspective on model evaluation and generalization beyond traditional scoring methods.

Abstract: Standard LLM evaluation practices compress diverse abilities into single
scores, obscuring their inherently multidimensional nature. We present JE-IRT,
a geometric item-response framework that embeds both LLMs and questions in a
shared space. For question embeddings, the direction encodes semantics and the
norm encodes difficulty, while correctness on each question is determined by
the geometric interaction between the model and question embeddings. This
geometry replaces a global ranking of LLMs with topical specialization and
enables smooth variation across related questions. Building on this framework,
our experimental results reveal that out-of-distribution behavior can be
explained through directional alignment, and that larger norms consistently
indicate harder questions. Moreover, JE-IRT naturally supports generalization:
once the space is learned, new LLMs are added by fitting a single embedding.
The learned space further reveals an LLM-internal taxonomy that only partially
aligns with human-defined subject categories. JE-IRT thus establishes a unified
and interpretable geometric lens that connects LLM abilities with the structure
of questions, offering a distinctive perspective on model evaluation and
generalization.

### [359] [Not only a helper, but also a teacher: Interactive LLM Cascade](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22984)
*Yu Wu,Shuo Wu,Ye Tao,Yansong Li,Anand D. Sarwate*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Inter-Cascade is an online interactive LLM cascade system where strong models teach weak models by distilling problem-solving strategies, reducing costs while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LLM cascades are non-adaptive and repeatedly consult expensive models for similar queries, leading to higher costs. There's a need for more efficient cascading that learns from expensive model interactions.

Method: Extends strong models from backup helpers to teachers - when strong models solve difficult queries, they distill solutions into reusable problem-solving strategies that boost weak models on subsequent queries, enabling dynamic improvement without fine-tuning.

Result: Significantly improves weak model accuracy (up to 33.06% points) and overall system accuracy (up to 5.53% points), while reducing strong model calls (up to 48.05%) and saving fees (up to 49.63%) compared to standard cascades.

Conclusion: Inter-Cascade demonstrates effective in-context knowledge transfer between LLMs and provides a scalable framework applicable to both open-source and API-based LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) vary widely in their capabilities, with larger
models often having better performance but higher cost: choosing an LLM model
often involves trading off performance and cost. The LLM Cascade is a paradigm
that defers difficult queries from weak/cheap to strong/expensive models. This
approach is nonadaptive: the deferral decision is trained offline. When
confronted with similar or repeated queries, the LLM Cascade may then
repeatedly consult the expensive model and incur higher cost. To improve the
cascading efficiency, we propose Inter-Cascade, an online and interactive LLM
Cascade that extends the role of strong model from a backup helper to a
long-term teacher. In our system, when a strong model resolves a difficult
query, it also distills its solution into a generalized, reusable
problem-solving strategy that boosts the weak model on subsequent queries.
Adding strategies to queries enables the weak model to dynamically improve its
performance over time, avoiding computationally and time-intensive fine-tuning.
Empirically, compared with standard LLM Cascade baselines across multiple
benchmarks, the Inter-Cascade significantly improves the accuracy of the weak
model (by up to 33.06 absolute percentage points) and the overall system (by up
to 5.53 absolute percentage points), while reducing the calls to strong models
(by up to 48.05% relative reduction) and saving the corresponding fees (by up
to 49.63% relative reduction). Inter-Cascade demonstrates the effective
in-context knowledge transfer between LLMs, and provides a general, scalable
framework applicable to both open-source and API-based LLMs.

*Zirui Cheng,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a theory-driven framework using Bayesian Persuasion to systematically evaluate LLMs' persuasive capabilities, showing that frontier models achieve high persuasion gains and reinforcement learning can significantly improve persuasion performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have shown strong persuasive capabilities comparable to humans, but systematic evaluation is challenging due to domain variability in human persuasion effectiveness. The paper aims to provide a scalable and principled framework for measuring LLM persuasion.

Method: The authors use a theory-driven approach grounded in Bayesian Persuasion framework, repurposing human-human persuasion datasets to construct evaluation environments. They also employ reinforcement learning to train LLMs for strategic persuasion.

Result: Frontier models consistently achieve high persuasion gains and exhibit sophisticated persuasion strategies aligned with theoretical predictions. Reinforcement learning enables even small LLMs to obtain significantly higher persuasion gains.

Conclusion: The proposed Bayesian Persuasion framework provides an effective method for systematically evaluating and training LLMs in strategic persuasion, demonstrating that both frontier models and reinforcement learning can significantly enhance persuasion capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong persuasive capabilities
comparable to those of humans, offering promising benefits while raising
societal concerns about their deployment. However, systematically evaluating
the persuasive capabilities of LLMs is inherently challenging, as the
effectiveness of persuasion among humans varies significantly across different
domains. In this paper, we take a theory-driven approach to provide a scalable
and principled framework for measuring the persuasive capabilities of LLMs.
Grounded in the Bayesian Persuasion (BP) framework, we repurpose existing
human-human persuasion datasets to construct environments for evaluating and
training LLMs in strategic persuasion. Our results reveal that frontier models
can consistently achieve high persuasion gains and exhibit sophisticated
persuasion strategies that align with theoretical predictions. Building on
this, we use reinforcement learning to train LLMs for strategic persuasion in
our environments. Our results also demonstrate that even small LLMs can obtain
significantly higher persuasion gains through reinforcement learning.

*Karan Srivastava,Sanjeeb Dash,Ryan Cory-Wright,Barry Trager,Lior Horesh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An algebraic geometry-based system that automatically generates minimal missing axioms to explain hypotheses that cannot be derived from incomplete axiom systems, using polynomial equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate abductive inference and close the gap when new data/hypotheses are inconsistent with existing theory, addressing limitations of symbolic regression systems that enforce derivability from prior axioms.

Method: Uses algebraic geometry to generate minimal sets of missing axioms from incomplete axiom systems, with axioms and hypotheses expressed as polynomial equations. Establishes formal conditions for successful axiom retrieval.

Result: Successfully demonstrates the system's ability to explain Kepler's third law and other scientific laws even when key axioms are missing from the initial system.

Conclusion: The proposed algebraic geometry approach provides an effective solution for automating abductive inference and completing incomplete axiom systems to explain new hypotheses.

Abstract: A core goal in modern science is to harness recent advances in AI and
computer processing to automate and accelerate the scientific method. Symbolic
regression can fit interpretable models to data, but these models often sit
outside established theory. Recent systems (e.g., AI Descartes, AI Hilbert)
enforce derivability from prior axioms. However, sometimes new data and
associated hypotheses derived from data are not consistent with existing theory
because the existing theory is incomplete or incorrect. Automating abductive
inference to close this gap remains open. We propose a solution: an algebraic
geometry-based system that, given an incomplete axiom system and a hypothesis
that it cannot explain, automatically generates a minimal set of missing axioms
that suffices to derive the axiom, as long as axioms and hypotheses are
expressible as polynomial equations. We formally establish necessary and
sufficient conditions for the successful retrieval of such axioms. We
illustrate the efficacy of our approach by demonstrating its ability to explain
Kepler's third law and a few other laws, even when key axioms are absent.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Creative Adversarial Testing (CAT) framework to evaluate goal-task alignment in Agentic AI systems, validated through synthetic Alexa+ audio services data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation techniques for Agentic AI focus on efficacy in identifying agents, tools, and parameters, but lack assessment of alignment between system tasks and overarching goals.

Method: Developed the Creative Adversarial Testing (CAT) framework and validated it using extensive simulation with synthetic interaction data modeled after Alexa+ audio services.

Result: The CAT framework provides unprecedented insights into goal-task alignment, enabling more effective optimization and development of Agentic AI systems.

Conclusion: The CAT framework successfully addresses the critical gap in evaluating goal-task alignment in Agentic AI systems through adversarial testing with synthetic data.

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a paradigm shift in enhancing the capabilities of
generative AI models. While these systems demonstrate immense potential and
power, current evaluation techniques primarily focus on assessing their
efficacy in identifying appropriate agents, tools, and parameters. However, a
critical gap exists in evaluating the alignment between an Agentic AI system's
tasks and its overarching goals. This paper introduces the Creative Adversarial
Testing (CAT) framework, a novel approach designed to capture and analyze the
complex relationship between Agentic AI tasks and the system's intended
objectives.
  We validate the CAT framework through extensive simulation using synthetic
interaction data modeled after Alexa+ audio services, a sophisticated Agentic
AI system that shapes the user experience for millions of users globally. This
synthetic data approach enables comprehensive testing of edge cases and failure
modes while protecting user privacy. Our results demonstrate that the CAT
framework provides unprecedented insights into goal-task alignment, enabling
more effective optimization and development of Agentic AI systems.

*Davi Bastos Costa,Renato Vicente*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Mini-Mafia is a simplified 4-player social deduction game used as a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' social intelligence, focusing on deception detection and theory-of-mind reasoning through standardized win rate measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mafia games mirror real-world multi-agent scenarios with information asymmetry and theory-of-mind reasoning, making them ideal for evaluating LLMs' social intelligence capabilities.

Method: Created Mini-Mafia - a simplified 4-player variant (1 mafioso, 1 detective, 2 villagers) with single-day voting. LLMs play against each other in a two-stage framework measuring win rates across fixed opponent configurations using standardized scoring.

Result: Experiments revealed counterintuitive results where smaller models sometimes outperformed larger ones. The benchmark enables quantitative study of emergent multi-agent dynamics like name bias and last-speaker advantage.

Conclusion: Mini-Mafia serves as both a benchmark for LLM social intelligence and contributes to AI safety by generating deception detection training data and tracking models' deception capabilities against human baselines.

Abstract: Mafia is a social deduction game where informed mafia compete against
uninformed townsfolk. Its asymmetry of information and reliance on
theory-of-mind reasoning mirror real-world multi-agent scenarios, making it a
useful testbed for evaluating the social intelligence of large language models
(LLMs). To support a systematic study, we introduce Mini-Mafia: a simplified
four-player variant with one mafioso, one detective, and two villagers. We set
the mafioso to kill a villager and the detective to investigate the mafioso
during the night, reducing the game to a single day phase of discussion and
voting. This setup isolates three interactive capabilities through
role-specific win conditions: the mafioso must deceive, the villagers must
detect deception, and the detective must effectively disclose information. To
measure these skills, we have LLMs play against each other, creating the
Mini-Mafia Benchmark: a two-stage framework that first estimates win rates
within fixed opponent configurations, then aggregates performance across them
using standardized scoring. Built entirely from model interactions without
external data, the benchmark evolves as new models are introduced, with each
one serving both as a new opponent and as a subject of evaluation. Our
experiments reveal counterintuitive results, including cases where smaller
models outperform larger ones. Beyond benchmarking, Mini-Mafia enables
quantitative study of emergent multi-agent dynamics such as name bias and
last-speaker advantage. It also contributes to AI safety by generating training
data for deception detectors and by tracking models' deception capabilities
against human baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agentless training creates skill priors that enable effective SWE-Agent adaptation, with Kimi-Dev achieving 60.4% on SWE-bench Verified and powering SWE-Agents to 48.6% pass@1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge workflow-based Agentless methods and SWE-Agent frameworks by showing they are not mutually exclusive, and that skill priors from Agentless training can enhance agentic adaptation.

Method: Curated Agentless training recipe, developed Kimi-Dev as an open-source SWE LLM, and performed additional SFT adaptation on 5k publicly-available trajectories.

Result: Kimi-Dev achieved 60.4% on SWE-bench Verified (best among workflow approaches) and powered SWE-Agents to 48.6% pass@1, comparable to Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

Conclusion: Structured skill priors from Agentless training can effectively bridge workflow and agentic frameworks for transferable coding agents.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to software engineering
(SWE), with SWE-bench as a key benchmark. Solutions are split into SWE-Agent
frameworks with multi-turn interactions and workflow-based Agentless methods
with single-turn verifiable steps. We argue these paradigms are not mutually
exclusive: reasoning-intensive Agentless training induces skill priors,
including localization, code edit, and self-reflection that enable efficient
and effective SWE-Agent adaptation. In this work, we first curate the Agentless
training recipe and present Kimi-Dev, an open-source SWE LLM achieving 60.4\%
on SWE-bench Verified, the best among workflow approaches. With additional SFT
adaptation on 5k publicly-available trajectories, Kimi-Dev powers SWE-Agents to
48.6\% pass@1, on par with that of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (241022 version). These
results show that structured skill priors from Agentless training can bridge
workflow and agentic frameworks for transferable coding agents.

### [365] [Risk Profiling and Modulation for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23058)
*Yikai Wang,Xiaocheng Li,Guanting Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs' risk behavior varies by training stage - instruction-tuned models align with utility models while pre-trained and RLHF-aligned models deviate. Post-training is the most effective method for modulating risk preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different training stages (pre-trained, instruction-tuned, RLHF-aligned) affect LLMs' risk profiles and how these can be modulated, since current research focuses mainly on personality prompting and multi-agent interactions.

Method: Proposed a pipeline using behavioral economics tools and utility-theoretic models to compare LLMs at different training stages, and evaluated modulation strategies including prompt engineering, in-context learning, and post-training.

Result: Instruction-tuned models show behavior consistent with standard utility formulations, while pre-trained and RLHF-aligned models deviate more from fitted utility models. Post-training was the most stable and effective method for modulating risk preferences.

Conclusion: Different LLM training stages have distinct risk profiles, and post-training provides the most reliable way to modulate these risk behaviors, informing future work on behavioral alignment and risk-aware LLM design.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision-making tasks
under uncertainty; however, their risk profiles and how they are influenced by
prompting and alignment methods remain underexplored. Existing studies have
primarily examined personality prompting or multi-agent interactions, leaving
open the question of how post-training influences the risk behavior of LLMs. In
this work, we propose a new pipeline for eliciting, steering, and modulating
LLMs' risk profiles, drawing on tools from behavioral economics and finance.
Using utility-theoretic models, we compare pre-trained, instruction-tuned, and
RLHF-aligned LLMs, and find that while instruction-tuned models exhibit
behaviors consistent with some standard utility formulations, pre-trained and
RLHF-aligned models deviate more from any utility models fitted. We further
evaluate modulation strategies, including prompt engineering, in-context
learning, and post-training, and show that post-training provides the most
stable and effective modulation of risk preference. Our findings provide
insights into the risk profiles of different classes and stages of LLMs and
demonstrate how post-training modulates these profiles, laying the groundwork
for future research on behavioral alignment and risk-aware LLM design.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MNPO extends Nash learning from human feedback from two-player to multiplayer games, enabling better capture of complex, non-transitive human preferences and achieving superior alignment performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Nash learning methods (INPO, ONPO, EGPO) are limited to two-player interactions, creating a single-opponent bias that fails to capture the full complexity of real-world heterogeneous and non-transitive preferences.

Method: Multiplayer Nash Preference Optimization (MNPO) formulates alignment as an n-player game where each policy competes against a population of opponents while being regularized toward a reference model, extending duality gap to quantify approximation quality.

Result: MNPO consistently outperforms existing NLHF baselines on instruction-following benchmarks, achieving superior alignment quality under heterogeneous annotator conditions and mixed-policy evaluation scenarios.

Conclusion: MNPO establishes a principled and scalable framework for aligning LLMs with complex, non-transitive human preferences, inheriting equilibrium guarantees while enabling richer competitive dynamics.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the standard
paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.
However, reward-based methods built on the Bradley-Terry assumption struggle to
capture the non-transitive and heterogeneous nature of real-world preferences.
To address this, recent studies have reframed alignment as a two-player Nash
game, giving rise to Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF). While this
perspective has inspired algorithms such as INPO, ONPO, and EGPO with strong
theoretical and empirical guarantees, they remain fundamentally restricted to
two-player interactions, creating a single-opponent bias that fails to capture
the full complexity of realistic preference structures. In this work, we
introduce Multiplayer Nash Preference Optimization (MNPO), a novel framework
that generalizes NLHF to the multiplayer regime. It formulates alignment as an
$n$-player game, where each policy competes against a population of opponents
while being regularized toward a reference model. Our framework establishes
well-defined Nash equilibria in multiplayer settings and extends the concept of
duality gap to quantify approximation quality. We demonstrate that MNPO
inherits the equilibrium guarantees of two-player methods while enabling richer
competitive dynamics and improved coverage of diverse preference structures.
Through comprehensive empirical evaluation, we show that MNPO consistently
outperforms existing NLHF baselines on instruction-following benchmarks,
achieving superior alignment quality under heterogeneous annotator conditions
and mixed-policy evaluation scenarios. Together, these results establish MNPO
as a principled and scalable framework for aligning LLMs with complex,
non-transitive human preferences. Code is available at

*Morgan McCarty,Jorge Morales*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs outperform humans on mental imagery tasks traditionally thought to require visual imagery, suggesting propositional reasoning may be sufficient for such tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test if LLMs can perform mental imagery tasks that cognitive psychology argues require visual imagery, despite LLMs' non-pictorial architectures.

Method: Created novel mental imagery tasks from cognitive psychology, tested state-of-the-art LLMs with text-only instructions, compared with 100 human subjects, and varied reasoning token allocation in models.

Result: Best LLMs performed significantly above average human performance, with strongest performance when models allocated more reasoning tokens.

Conclusion: LLMs can complete imagery-dependent tasks despite non-pictorial architectures, challenging traditional views about visual imagery requirements and suggesting propositional reasoning may be sufficient.

Abstract: This study offers a novel approach for benchmarking complex cognitive
behavior in artificial systems. Almost universally, Large Language Models
(LLMs) perform best on tasks which may be included in their training data and
can be accomplished solely using natural language, limiting our understanding
of their emergent sophisticated cognitive capacities. In this work, we created
dozens of novel items of a classic mental imagery task from cognitive
psychology. A task which, traditionally, cognitive psychologists have argued is
solvable exclusively via visual mental imagery (i.e., language alone would be
insufficient). LLMs are perfect for testing this hypothesis. First, we tested
several state-of-the-art LLMs by giving text-only models written instructions
and asking them to report the resulting object after performing the
transformations in the aforementioned task. Then, we created a baseline by
testing 100 human subjects in exactly the same task. We found that the best
LLMs performed significantly above average human performance. Finally, we
tested reasoning models set to different levels of reasoning and found the
strongest performance when models allocate greater amounts of reasoning tokens.
These results provide evidence that the best LLMs may have the capability to
complete imagery-dependent tasks despite the non-pictorial nature of their
architectures. Our study not only demonstrates an emergent cognitive capacity
in LLMs while performing a novel task, but it also provides the field with a
new task that leaves lots of room for improvement in otherwise already highly
capable models. Finally, our findings reignite the debate over the formats of
representation of visual imagery in humans, suggesting that propositional
reasoning (or at least non-imagistic reasoning) may be sufficient to complete
tasks that were long-thought to be imagery-dependent.

### [368] [AttAnchor: Guiding Cross-Modal Token Alignment in VLMs with Attention Anchors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23109)
*Junyang Zhang,Tianyi Zhu,Thierry Tambe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Attention Anchor is a parameter-free framework that improves cross-modal alignment in vision-language models by grouping semantically similar tokens across modalities, reducing hallucinations and improving performance on various benchmarks with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs suffer from hallucinations and underperformance due to direct concatenation of image and text tokens with modality-blinded positional encoding, which creates unnecessary long-distance attention between semantically related cross-modal tokens.

Method: Proposes Attention Anchor framework that inserts text tokens near relevant visual patches to create semantic signposts, enabling better cross-modal locality and revealing true content-based attention scores without disrupting semantic flow.

Result: Achieves improvements across 13 out of 15 metrics/benchmarks, including up to 32% gains on reasoning tasks and 15% improvements on hallucination benchmarks. Enables TinyLLaVA 1B to outperform larger models like LLaVA 7B and QwenVL 3B on POPE with only 0.1% inference time overhead.

Conclusion: Attention Anchor effectively addresses cross-modal alignment issues in VLMs through mixed-modal token grouping, significantly reducing hallucinations and improving performance across multiple tasks with minimal computational cost.

Abstract: A fundamental reason for the dominance of attention over RNNs and LSTMs in
LLMs is its ability to capture long-range dependencies by modeling direct
interactions between all tokens, overcoming the sequential limitations of
recurrent architectures. Similarly, a key reason why today's vision language
models (VLMs) hallucinate and underperform pure language models is that they
rely on direct concatenation of image and text tokens with a modality-blinded
positional encoding, which conveniently adopts the pretrained LLM backbone but
forces unnecessary long-distance attention between semantically related tokens
across modalities. This underscores the urgent need for mechanisms that
efficiently enhance token locality and cross-modal alignment. In response, we
propose Attention Anchor, a parameter-free framework that efficiently groups
semantically similar tokens across modalities, improving cross-modal locality.
By inserting text tokens near relevant visual patches, we create semantic
signposts that reveal true content-based cross-modal attention scores, guiding
the model to focus on the correct image regions for tasks such as VQA, MMBench
and POPE. This improves answer accuracy and reduces hallucinations without
disrupting the prompt's semantic flow. AttAnchor achieves improvements across
13 out of 15 different metrics and benchmarks, including up to 32% gains on
reasoning tasks and up to 15% improvements on hallucination benchmarks.
AttAnchor enables TinyLLaVA 1B to outperform much larger models like LLaVA 7B
and QwenVL 3B on POPE with only 0.1% inference time overhead. To the best of
our knowledge, this work is among the first to investigate mixed-modal token
grouping, where text and image tokens are clustered jointly into shared groups
rather than being grouped within a single modality or merely aligned post-hoc
with additional alignment losses.

TL;DR: LLM-based systems show promise for autonomous health monitoring in industrial environments, capable of fault detection and classification with natural language explanations, but face limitations in continual learning adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of LLMs for autonomous health monitoring in sensor-rich industrial environments, focusing on fault detection and classification with explainable outputs through natural language reasoning.

Method: Systematically evaluated LLM-system architecture (single-LLM vs. multi-LLM), input representations (raw vs. descriptive statistics), and context window size effects on diagnostic performance.

Result: LLM systems perform best with summarized statistical inputs, and multi-LLM systems with specialized prompts offer improved sensitivity for fault classification compared to single-LLM systems. LLMs can produce detailed human-readable justifications but struggle with adaptation in continual learning settings.

Conclusion: LLM-based systems show promise as transparent diagnostic tools but have current limitations in adaptive capabilities, particularly in continual learning scenarios with repeated fault cycles.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems present new opportunities for
autonomous health monitoring in sensor-rich industrial environments. This study
explores the potential of LLMs to detect and classify faults directly from
sensor data, while producing inherently explainable outputs through natural
language reasoning. We systematically evaluate how LLM-system architecture
(single-LLM vs. multi-LLM), input representations (raw vs. descriptive
statistics), and context window size affect diagnostic performance. Our
findings show that LLM systems perform most effectively when provided with
summarized statistical inputs, and that systems with multiple LLMs using
specialized prompts offer improved sensitivity for fault classification
compared to single-LLM systems. While LLMs can produce detailed and
human-readable justifications for their decisions, we observe limitations in
their ability to adapt over time in continual learning settings, often
struggling to calibrate predictions during repeated fault cycles. These
insights point to both the promise and the current boundaries of LLM-based

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether vision-language-action (VLA) models meet industrial requirements and analyze their limitations for real-world industrial deployment from data collection and model architecture perspectives.

Method: Compared performance of state-of-the-art VLA models in industrial scenarios, analyzing limitations from data collection and model architecture viewpoints.

Conclusion: VLA models provide practical adaptability for industrial use but need task-specific enhancements to improve robustness, generalization, and precision for effective industrial deployment.

Abstract: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in industry is accelerating
the shift from traditional automation to intelligent systems with perception
and cognition. Vision language-action (VLA) models have been a key paradigm in
AI to unify perception, reasoning, and control. Has the performance of the VLA
models met the industrial requirements? In this paper, from the perspective of
industrial deployment, we compare the performance of existing state-of-the-art
VLA models in industrial scenarios and analyze the limitations of VLA models
for real-world industrial deployment from the perspectives of data collection
and model architecture. The results show that the VLA models retain their
ability to perform simple grasping tasks even in industrial settings after
fine-tuning. However, there is much room for performance improvement in complex
industrial environments, diverse object categories, and high precision placing
tasks. Our findings provide practical insight into the adaptability of VLA
models for industrial use and highlight the need for task-specific enhancements
to improve their robustness, generalization, and precision.

Motivation: Formal models are essential but expensive to write and maintain for complex systems. While AI shows promise in generating specifications, existing work focuses on small code, not complete systems, leaving it unclear if AI can handle realistic system artifacts.

Method: Created SysMoBench with nine diverse system artifacts (including Raft implementations, OS components) using TLA+ specification language. Automated evaluation metrics include syntactic correctness, runtime correctness, conformance to system code, and invariant correctness.

Result: The benchmark enables systematic evaluation of AI-generated formal models for concurrent and distributed systems, providing tools to understand capabilities and limitations of LLMs and agents in this domain.

Conclusion: SysMoBench establishes a foundation for evaluating AI in formal modeling of complex systems, opening up new research directions and putting development tools in this area on a firm footing.

Abstract: Formal models are essential to specifying large, complex computer systems and
verifying their correctness, but are notoriously expensive to write and
maintain. Recent advances in generative AI show promise in generating certain
forms of specifications. However, existing work mostly targets small code, not
complete systems. It is unclear whether AI can deal with realistic system
artifacts, as this requires abstracting their complex behavioral properties
into formal models. We present SysMoBench, a benchmark that evaluates AI's
ability to formally model large, complex systems. We focus on concurrent and
distributed systems, which are keystones of today's critical computing
infrastructures, encompassing operating systems and cloud infrastructure. We
use TLA+, the it de facto specification language for concurrent and distributed
systems, though the benchmark can be extended to other specification languages.
We address the primary challenge of evaluating AI-generated models by
automating metrics like syntactic and runtime correctness, conformance to
system code, and invariant correctness. SysMoBench currently includes nine
diverse system artifacts: the Raft implementation of Etcd and Redis, the
Spinlock and Mutex in Asterinas OS, etc.; more artifacts are being actively
added. SysMoBench enables us to understand the capabilities and limitations of
today's LLMs and agents, putting tools in this area on a firm footing and
opening up promising new research directions.

*Charles L. Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MathBode is a dynamic diagnostic tool that analyzes mathematical reasoning in LLMs using frequency-domain analysis of parametric problems, revealing systematic low-pass behavior and phase lag that accuracy metrics miss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard one-shot accuracy metrics fail to capture the dynamic reasoning capabilities and systematic errors in LLMs when solving parametric mathematical problems.

Method: Drive a single parameter sinusoidally through parametric problems and fit first-harmonic responses of model outputs and exact solutions to compute gain (amplitude tracking) and phase (lag) metrics.

Result: The diagnostic reveals systematic low-pass behavior and growing phase lag across five mathematical problem families, clearly separating frontier from mid-tier models on dynamic reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: MathBode provides a compact, reproducible protocol that complements standard benchmarks with actionable measurements of reasoning fidelity and consistency, offering interpretable frequency-resolved metrics for LLM mathematical reasoning assessment.

Abstract: This paper presents MathBode, a dynamic diagnostic for mathematical reasoning
in large language models (LLMs). Instead of one-shot accuracy, MathBode treats
each parametric problem as a system: we drive a single parameter sinusoidally
and fit first-harmonic responses of model outputs and exact solutions. This
yields interpretable, frequency-resolved metrics -- gain (amplitude tracking)
and phase (lag) -- that form Bode-style fingerprints. Across five closed-form
families (linear solve, ratio/saturation, compound interest, 2x2 linear
systems, similar triangles), the diagnostic surfaces systematic low-pass
behavior and growing phase lag that accuracy alone obscures. We compare several
models against a symbolic baseline that calibrates the instrument ($G \approx
1$, $\phi \approx 0$). Results separate frontier from mid-tier models on
dynamics, providing a compact, reproducible protocol that complements standard
benchmarks with actionable measurements of reasoning fidelity and consistency.
We open-source the dataset and code to enable further research and adoption.

### [373] [Coordination Requires Simplification: Thermodynamic Bounds on Multi-Objective Compromise in Natural and Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23144)
*Atma Anand*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Coordination across multiple agents faces fundamental thermodynamic constraints where findability matters more than accuracy. The minimum description length of coordination protocols scales with agent count and complexity, forcing progressive simplification and creating persistent metastable states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental thermodynamic constraints in multi-agent coordination systems and explain phenomena like cycling in multi-objective optimization and alignment faking in AI systems.

Method: Developed Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT) using information theory to derive minimum description length bounds for coordination protocols, introduced coordination temperature concept, and extended topological Arrow's theorem.

Result: Found that coordination requires radical information loss, coordination dynamics change environments and shift optimization across hierarchical levels, and identified measurable signatures across various systems.

Conclusion: Coordination fundamentally requires information loss, creates persistent metastable states with hysteresis, and explains phenomena like indefinite cycling in multi-objective optimization and alignment faking in AI systems through thermodynamic constraints.

Abstract: Information-processing systems coordinating across multiple agents and
objectives face fundamental thermodynamic constraints. We show that solutions
with maximum utility to act as coordination focal points have much higher
selection pressure for being findable across agents rather than accuracy. We
derive that the information-theoretic minimum description length of
coordination protocols to precision $\varepsilon$ scales as $L(P)\geq NK\log_2
K+N^2d^2\log (1/\varepsilon)$ for $N$ agents with $d$ potentially conflicting
objectives and internal model complexity $K$. This scaling forces progressive
simplification, with coordination dynamics changing the environment itself and
shifting optimization across hierarchical levels. Moving from established focal
points requires re-coordination, creating persistent metastable states and
hysteresis until significant environmental shifts trigger phase transitions
through spontaneous symmetry breaking. We operationally define coordination
temperature to predict critical phenomena and estimate coordination work costs,
identifying measurable signatures across systems from neural networks to
restaurant bills to bureaucracies. Extending the topological version of Arrow's
theorem on the impossibility of consistent preference aggregation, we find it
recursively binds whenever preferences are combined. This potentially explains
the indefinite cycling in multi-objective gradient descent and alignment faking
in Large Language Models trained with reinforcement learning with human
feedback. We term this framework Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT), which
demonstrates that coordination requires radical information loss.

Method: Develops a dynamic backoff selection mechanism, introduces a fairness quantification metric aligned with EDCA principles, and proposes a centralized training decentralized execution architecture using constrained multi-agent proximal policy optimization to jointly minimize collisions and guarantee fairness.

Result: Experimental results show significant reduction in collision probability compared to conventional BEB while preserving backward compatibility with commercial Wi-Fi devices, with the proposed fairness metric effectively eliminating starvation risks in heterogeneous scenarios.

Conclusion: The AI-optimized framework successfully addresses collision resolution and fairness challenges in dense Wi-Fi deployments while maintaining full compatibility with existing CSMA/CA operations and legacy devices.

Abstract: The exponential growth of wireless devices and stringent reliability
requirements of emerging applications demand fundamental improvements in
distributed channel access mechanisms for unlicensed bands. Current Wi-Fi
systems, which rely on binary exponential backoff (BEB), suffer from suboptimal
collision resolution in dense deployments and persistent fairness challenges
due to inherent randomness. This paper introduces a multi-agent reinforcement
learning framework that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) optimization
with legacy device coexistence. We first develop a dynamic backoff selection
mechanism that adapts to real-time channel conditions through access deferral
events while maintaining full compatibility with conventional CSMA/CA
operations. Second, we introduce a fairness quantification metric aligned with
enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) principles to ensure equitable
medium access opportunities. Finally, we propose a centralized training
decentralized execution (CTDE) architecture incorporating neighborhood activity
patterns as observational inputs, optimized via constrained multi-agent
proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) to jointly minimize collisions and
guarantee fairness. Experimental results demonstrate that our solution
significantly reduces collision probability compared to conventional BEB while
preserving backward compatibility with commercial Wi-Fi devices. The proposed
fairness metric effectively eliminates starvation risks in heterogeneous
scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates how Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) helps LLMs learn transitive relations for complex planning, revealing that transfer layers capture multi-step adjacency information, and proposes Next-Token Injection and Transformer-based transfer layers to enhance path-planning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with learning transitive relations, which are crucial for complex planning tasks, despite their impressive performance on other tasks.

Method: Theoretical analysis of MTP paradigm using Transformer architecture with shared output head and transfer layer, plus proposed improvements: Next-Token Injection (NTI) and Transformer-based transfer layer.

Result: Experiments on synthetic graphs and Blocksworld planning benchmark validate that transfer layers learn multi-step adjacency information, enabling models to capture unobserved transitive relations, and the proposed improvements significantly enhance path-planning capability.

Conclusion: The findings deepen understanding of how Transformers with MTP learn in complex planning tasks and provide practical strategies to overcome the transitivity bottleneck, enabling structurally aware and general-purpose planning models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse tasks but continue to struggle with learning transitive relations, a
cornerstone for complex planning. To address this issue, we investigate the
Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) paradigm and its impact to transitive relation
learning. We theoretically analyze the MTP paradigm using a Transformer
architecture composed of a shared output head and a transfer layer. Our
analysis reveals that the transfer layer gradually learns the multi-step
adjacency information, which in turn enables the backbone model to capture
unobserved transitive reachability relations beyond those directly present in
the training data, albeit with some inevitable noise in adjacency estimation.
Building on this foundation, we propose two strategies to enhance the transfer
layer and overall learning quality: Next-Token Injection (NTI) and a
Transformer-based transfer layer. Our experiments on both synthetic graphs and
the Blocksworld planning benchmark validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate that the improvements significantly enhance the model's
path-planning capability. These findings deepen our understanding of how
Transformers with MTP learn in complex planning tasks, and provide practical
strategies to overcome the transitivity bottleneck, paving the way toward
structurally aware and general-purpose planning models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoEP is a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as zero-shot reasoning engines for automated hyperparameter configuration, eliminating the need for training while achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional learning-based methods for hyperparameter configuration suffer from high sample complexity and poor generalization, creating a need for more efficient and adaptable approaches.

Method: AutoEP combines an online Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) module for real-time search dynamics feedback with a multi-LLM reasoning chain that interprets this feedback to generate adaptive hyperparameter strategies.

Result: AutoEP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art tuners across three distinct metaheuristics on diverse combinatorial optimization benchmarks, and enables open-source models like Qwen3-30B to match GPT-4's performance.

Conclusion: AutoEP demonstrates a powerful and accessible new paradigm for automated hyperparameter design that bypasses training requirements while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Dynamically configuring algorithm hyperparameters is a fundamental challenge
in computational intelligence. While learning-based methods offer automation,
they suffer from prohibitive sample complexity and poor generalization. We
introduce AutoEP, a novel framework that bypasses training entirely by
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as zero-shot reasoning engines for
algorithm control. AutoEP's core innovation lies in a tight synergy between two
components: (1) an online Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) module that
provides real-time, quantitative feedback on the search dynamics, and (2) a
multi-LLM reasoning chain that interprets this feedback to generate adaptive
hyperparameter strategies. This approach grounds high-level reasoning in
empirical data, mitigating hallucination. Evaluated on three distinct
metaheuristics across diverse combinatorial optimization benchmarks, AutoEP
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art tuners, including neural evolution
and other LLM-based methods. Notably, our framework enables open-source models
like Qwen3-30B to match the performance of GPT-4, demonstrating a powerful and
accessible new paradigm for automated hyperparameter design. Our code is

*Runyan Tan,Shuang Wu,Phillip Howard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: p-less sampling is a hyperparameter-free decoding strategy that dynamically sets truncation thresholds based on token probability distributions, outperforming existing methods across various tasks while maintaining quality at higher temperatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sampling methods for LLMs are sensitive to hyperparameter choices and require different settings for different tasks and temperature configurations, limiting their robustness and ease of use.

Method: An information-theoretic approach that dynamically sets truncation thresholds at each decoding step based on the entire token probability distribution, eliminating the need for hyperparameters.

Result: Consistently outperforms existing sampling approaches across math, logical reasoning, and creative writing tasks, with less degradation at higher temperatures and improved inference efficiency through lower sampling times and shorter generation lengths.

Conclusion: p-less sampling provides a robust, hyperparameter-free alternative to existing decoding strategies that maintains high output quality across temperature variations while improving computational efficiency.

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) often
depends upon the choice of a sampling-based decoding strategy to
probabilistically choose the next token at each generation step. While a
variety of such sampling methods have been proposed, their performance can be
sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which may require different
settings depending upon the generation task and temperature configuration. In
this work, we introduce $p$-less sampling: an information-theoretic approach to
sampling which dynamically sets a truncation threshold at each decoding step
based on the entire token probability distribution. Unlike existing methods,
$p$-less sampling has no hyperparameters and consistently produces high-quality
outputs as temperature increases. We provide theoretical perspectives on
$p$-less sampling to ground our proposed method and conduct experiments to
empirically validate its effectiveness across a range of math, logical
reasoning, and creative writing tasks. Our results demonstrate how $p$-less
sampling consistently outperforms existing sampling approaches while exhibiting
much less degradation in text quality at higher temperature values. We further
show how $p$-less achieves greater inference-time efficiency than alternative
methods through lower average token sampling times and shorter generation
lengths, without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we provide analyses to
highlight the benefits of $p$-less through qualitative examples, case studies,
and diversity assessments.

Conclusion: The proposed joint optimization framework successfully enables efficient deployment of LLM-based agentic AI reasoning in MEGI environments, overcoming computational and resource constraints through adaptive reasoning and distributed architecture.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled an
emergence of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) with powerful reasoning and
autonomous decision-making capabilities. This integration with edge computing
has led to the development of Mobile Edge General Intelligence (MEGI), which
brings real-time, privacy-preserving reasoning to the network edge. However,
deploying LLM-based agentic AI reasoning in MEGI environments poses significant
challenges due to the high computational demands of reasoning and the limited
resources of edge devices. To address these challenges, we propose a joint
optimization framework for efficient LLM reasoning deployment in MEGI. First,
we review methods that enhance LLM reasoning capabilities, such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Mixture of
Experts (MoE). Next, we present a distributed framework that addresses two
correlated aspects: reasoning enhancement through adaptive CoT prompting and
scalable deployment through distributed MoE architecture. The framework
dynamically activates expert networks and adjusts reasoning depth based on task
complexity and device capabilities. We further conduct experimental evaluations
in mobile edge environments. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in balancing reasoning quality with resource efficiency,
validating the practical viability of deploying sophisticated LLM reasoning
capabilities in resource-constrained MEGI environments.

*Brandon Ong,Tej Deep Pala,Vernon Toh,William Chandra Tjhi,Soujanya Poria*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores Vision-Language Process Reward Models (VL-PRMs) that provide step-level supervision for multimodal reasoning. The authors introduce a hybrid data synthesis method combining MCTS with strong VLM judgments, perception-focused supervision for visual grounding error detection, and systematic evaluation of test-time scaling strategies across five multimodal benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While PRMs have been well-studied in text domains, their extension to Vision Language Models (VLMs) remains limited. Existing VL-PRMs rely on noisy MCTS-based data construction that limits generalization across tasks.

Method: 1) Hybrid data synthesis combining MCTS with strong VLM judgments for more accurate step-level labels; 2) Perception-focused supervision for explicit visual grounding error detection; 3) Systematic evaluation of multiple test-time scaling strategies.

Result: Experiments on five multimodal benchmarks show: VL-PRMs as Outcome Reward Models outperform process step selection; smaller VL-PRMs can match larger ones in error detection; VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning in stronger backbones; perception supervision significantly improves test-time scaling; TTS improves on advanced math reasoning despite no training on such datasets.

Conclusion: The work advances VL-PRM design space and demonstrates their effectiveness in improving VLM reasoning reliability, motivating further research in multimodal process supervision.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) provide step-level supervision that improves the
reliability of reasoning in large language models. While PRMs have been
extensively studied in text-based domains, their extension to Vision Language
Models (VLMs) remains limited. Existing Vision-Language PRMs (VL-PRMs) rely on
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for data construction, which can often produce
noisy supervision signals and limit generalization across tasks. In this work,
we aim to elucidate the design space of VL-PRMs by exploring diverse strategies
for dataset construction, training, and test-time scaling. First, we introduce
a hybrid data synthesis framework that combines MCTS with judgments from a
strong VLM, producing more accurate step-level labels. Second, we propose
perception-focused supervision, enabling our PRM to explicitly detect errors at
the visual grounding stage of reasoning. Third, we systematically evaluate
multiple test-time scaling strategies, showing that our PRMs can reliably guide
VLMs toward more accurate solutions. Our experiments covering five diverse
multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, PuzzleVQA, AlgoPuzzleVQA, MathVista, and
MathVision) reveal several key insights: (i) VL-PRMs when used as Outcome
Reward Models (ORMs) during test-time scaling (TTS) can outperform VL-PRM
guided process step selection, (ii) smaller VL-PRMs can match or even surpass
larger ones in detecting process errors, (iii) VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning
abilities in stronger VLM backbones, (iv) perception-level supervision leads to
significant gains in test-time scaling, and (v) TTS performance of different
policies improve on advanced math reasoning datasets despite not training
VL-PRMs on such datasets. We hope our work will motivate further research and
support the advancement of VLMs.

*Tao Xiong,Xavier Hu,Yurun Chen,Yuhang Liu,Changqiao Wu,Pengzhi Gao,Wei Liu,Jian Luan,Shengyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GUI-PRA is a process reward agent that addresses challenges in GUI automation by using dynamic memory mechanisms and adaptive UI perception to provide better process rewards than standard PRMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Process Reward Models (PRMs) struggle with GUI tasks due to 'lost in the middle' phenomenon with long historical contexts and lack GUI changing awareness, leading to poor performance in long-horizon GUI automation tasks.

Method: GUI-PRA introduces two key mechanisms: 1) Dynamic memory with relevance-based retrieval and progressive summarization to handle long histories, and 2) Adaptive UI perception that reasons about UI state changes and selects appropriate tools to gather visual evidence.

Result: The proposed approach better provides process rewards for GUI agents by intelligently processing historical context and actively perceiving UI state changes.

Conclusion: GUI-PRA effectively addresses the limitations of standard PRMs in GUI domains through its dynamic memory and adaptive UI perception mechanisms, enabling more reliable process reward guidance for GUI automation agents.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents powered by Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) show significant potential for automating tasks. However, they
often struggle with long-horizon tasks, leading to frequent failures. Process
Reward Models (PRMs) are a promising solution, as they can guide these agents
with crucial process signals during inference. Nevertheless, their application
to the GUI domain presents unique challenges. When processing dense artificial
inputs with long history data, PRMs suffer from a "lost in the middle"
phenomenon, where the overwhelming historical context compromises the
evaluation of the current step. Furthermore, standard PRMs lacks GUI changing
awareness, providing static evaluations that are disconnected from the dynamic
consequences of actions, a critical mismatch with the inherently dynamic nature
of GUI tasks. In response to these challenges, we introduce GUI-PRA (Process
Reward Agent for GUI Tasks), a judge agent designed to better provide process
reward than standard PRM by intelligently processing historical context and
actively perceiving UI state changes. Specifically, to directly combat the
``lost in the middle'' phenomenon, we introduce a dynamic memory mechanism
consisting of two core components: a Relevance-based Retrieval Module to
actively fetch pertinent information from long histories and a Progressive
Summarization Module to dynamically condense growing interaction data, ensuring
the model focuses on relevant context. Moreover, to address the lack of UI
changing awareness, we introduce an Aadaptive UI Perception mechanism. This
mechanism enables the agent to reason about UI state changes and dynamically
select the most appropriate tool to gather grounded visual evidence, ensuring
its evaluation is always informed by the current UI context.

TL;DR: The paper develops a heterogeneous agent-based modeling framework to study AI collaboration's impact on social output under resource constraints, finding that AI agents significantly boost output with nonlinear growth through network effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI integration affects socio-economic systems and aggregate social output under resource constraints, as modern systems increasingly incorporate AI technologies.

Method: Constructed five progressively extended agent-based models: baseline human collaboration, AI collaborators, network effects, independent agent production, and combined network effects with independent production.

Result: AI agents significantly increase aggregate social output; network effects create nonlinear growth exceeding individual contributions; independent agent production provides higher long-term growth; network effects demonstrate increasing returns to scale.

Conclusion: AI collaboration under resource constraints can substantially enhance social output, with network effects and independent production strategies offering particularly strong growth potential through nonlinear and scale-increasing mechanisms.

Abstract: Modern socio-economic systems are undergoing deep integration with artificial
intelligence technologies. This paper constructs a heterogeneous agent-based
modeling framework that incorporates both human workers and autonomous AI
agents, to study the impact of AI collaboration under resource constraints on
aggregate social output. We build five progressively extended models: Model 1
serves as the baseline of pure human collaboration; Model 2 introduces AI as
collaborators; Model 3 incorporates network effects among agents; Model 4
treats agents as independent producers; and Model 5 integrates both network
effects and independent agent production. Through theoretical derivation and
simulation analysis, we find that the introduction of AI agents can
significantly increase aggregate social output. When considering network
effects among agents, this increase exhibits nonlinear growth far exceeding the
simple sum of individual contributions. Under the same resource inputs,
treating agents as independent producers provides higher long-term growth
potential; introducing network effects further demonstrates strong
characteristics of increasing returns to scale.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Tool-Light is a framework that improves Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) in LLMs by addressing suboptimal behaviors like insufficient/excessive tool usage and overthinking. It uses information entropy analysis and multi-stage fine-tuning with self-evolved sampling to enhance TIR efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs using TIR exhibit inefficient behaviors including insufficient or excessive tool usage and overthinking after tool calls. There's a need to incentivize LLMs to perform TIR more efficiently and accurately while stabilizing the reasoning process.

Method: The framework analyzes tool call impact through information entropy, then uses dataset construction with continuous self-evolved sampling (vanilla and entropy-guided) and strict positive-negative pair selection. Training involves two stages: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Self-Evolved Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

Result: Experimental results on 10 datasets demonstrate Tool-Light's effectiveness in significantly improving model efficiency for executing TIR tasks.

Conclusion: Tool-Light successfully addresses TIR inefficiencies by leveraging information entropy insights and multi-stage fine-tuning, enabling more efficient and accurate tool-integrated reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) enables large language models (LLMs) to
improve their internal reasoning ability by integrating external tools.
However, models employing TIR often display suboptimal behaviors, such as
insufficient or excessive tool usage and overthinking after tool calls. The
challenge of incentivizing LLMs to perform TIR efficiently and accurately,
while stabilizing the reasoning process, remains an open question. In this
paper, we start by exploring the impact of tool calls on model reasoning from
the perspective of information entropy. Our findings indicate that tool call
results lead to a distinct change in the information entropy of subsequent
reasoning, with the overall entropy of the reasoning chain varying based on the
number of tool calls. Building on these insights, we propose Tool-Light, a
framework designed to encourage LLMs to perform TIR efficiently and accurately.
Our framework includes dataset construction and multi-stage fine-tuning. For
dataset construction, we employ continuous self-evolved sampling using the
fine-tuned model, integrating both vanilla sampling and entropy-guided
sampling. Besides, we establish strict criteria for selecting positive-negative
pairs during sampling. The training process involves a two-stage approach,
comprising Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Self-Evolved Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on 10 datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Tool-Light, significantly improving the model's efficiency in

### [384] [Learning How to Use Tools, Not Just When: Pattern-Aware Tool-Integrated Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23292)
*Ningning Xu,Yuxuan Jiang,Shubhashis Roy Dipta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pattern-aware approach for tool-integrated reasoning that improves code usage and accuracy on math problems by aligning tool application patterns with teacher preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work on tool-integrated reasoning mainly focused on when to invoke tools but overlooked how tools are applied, leading to failures even with sound reasoning due to misaligned pattern choices.

Method: Proposed a two-stage framework: first builds code competence from calculator and algorithmic patterns, then aligns pattern selection with teacher preferences to ensure appropriate tool application.

Result: Substantial improvements in both code usage and accuracy across challenging math datasets - Code@1 on MATH500 increased from 64.0% to 70.5% and on AIME24 from 26.7% to 50.0%.

Conclusion: Pattern-aware approach for tool-integrated reasoning is highly effective, demonstrating that proper alignment of tool application patterns significantly enhances reasoning performance.

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) has become a key approach for improving large
reasoning models (LRMs) on complex problems. Prior work has mainly studied when
to invoke tools, while overlooking how tools are applied. We identify two
common patterns: a calculator pattern that uses code for direct computation,
and an algorithmic pattern that encodes problems as programs. Misaligned
choices often cause failures even when reasoning is sound. We propose a
two-stage framework that first builds code competence from both patterns and
then aligns pattern selection with teacher preferences. Across challenging math
datasets, our pattern-aware method substantially improves both code usage and
accuracy, for instance raising Code@1 on MATH500 from 64.0% to 70.5% and on
AIME24 from 26.7% to 50.0%. These gains highlight the effectiveness of a
pattern-aware approach for tool-integrated reasoning.

TL;DR: JET trains Large Reasoning Models to proactively terminate unnecessary reasoning steps, achieving significant efficiency gains without sacrificing accuracy through trajectory truncation and quality-controlled length rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models incur substantial computational costs during deep reasoning, and existing reinforcement learning methods struggle to construct short reasoning paths during rollout, limiting effective learning.

Method: JET performs trajectory truncation during rollout to expose models to short, distributionally consistent reasoning paths, and uses a quality-controlled length reward to encourage concise reasoning while maintaining correctness.

Result: JET significantly improves reasoning efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B achieved 4.6% accuracy gain while reducing output length by 46.3% on the Olympiad benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed JET method effectively trains models to terminate unnecessary reasoning steps, demonstrating that LRMs accumulate sufficient information early in reasoning, making further steps redundant.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on
challenging tasks, yet their deep reasoning often incurs substantial
computational costs. To achieve efficient reasoning, existing reinforcement
learning methods still struggle to construct short reasoning path during the
rollout stage, limiting effective learning. Inspired by Evidence Accumulation
Models, we find that LRMs have accumulated sufficient information early in
reasoning, making further reasoning steps redundant. Based on this insight, we
propose Just-Enough Thinking (JET), which trains models to proactively
terminate unnecessary reasoning. JET performs trajectory truncation during
rollout to expose the model to short, distributionally consistent reasoning
paths. Besides, it uses a quality-controlled length reward to better encourage
concise reasoning while maintaining correctness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that JET significantly improves reasoning efficiency without
sacrificing accuracy. Especially, DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B achieves a 4.6%
accuracy gain while reducing output length by 46.3% on the Olympiad benchmark.

TL;DR: EHR-ChatQA is a benchmark for evaluating LLM-powered agents on EHR data access, addressing query ambiguity and value mismatch through interactive query refinement workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited adoption of LLM agents for EHR data due to lack of benchmarks capturing real-world clinical data access flows, particularly challenges with query ambiguity and terminology mismatches.

Method: Introduces EHR-ChatQA benchmark with simulated LLM-based user across two interaction flows: Incremental Query Refinement (IncreQA) and Adaptive Query Refinement (AdaptQA), evaluating agents' ability to clarify questions, resolve value mismatches, and generate correct SQL.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs achieve high Pass@5 (90-95% on IncreQA, 60-80% on AdaptQA) but significantly lower Pass^5 (35-60% lower), indicating lack of robustness despite good performance.

Conclusion: Need to build agents that are both performant and robust for safety-critical EHR domain, with diagnostic insights provided to guide future development.

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of LLM-powered agents, their adoption for
Electronic Health Record (EHR) data access remains limited by the absence of
benchmarks that adequately capture real-world clinical data access flows. In
practice, two core challenges hinder deployment: query ambiguity from vague
user questions and value mismatch between user terminology and database
entries. To address this, we introduce EHR-ChatQA an interactive database
question answering benchmark that evaluates the end-to-end workflow of database
agents: clarifying user questions, using tools to resolve value mismatches, and
generating correct SQL to deliver accurate answers. To cover diverse patterns
of query ambiguity and value mismatch, EHR-ChatQA assesses agents in a
simulated environment with an LLM-based user across two interaction flows:
Incremental Query Refinement (IncreQA), where users add constraints to existing
queries, and Adaptive Query Refinement (AdaptQA), where users adjust their
search goals mid-conversation. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g.,
o4-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash) over five i.i.d. trials show that while agents
achieve high Pass@5 of 90-95% (at least one of five trials) on IncreQA and
60-80% on AdaptQA, their Pass^5 (consistent success across all five trials) is
substantially lower by 35-60%. These results underscore the need to build
agents that are not only performant but also robust for the safety-critical EHR
domain. Finally, we provide diagnostic insights into common failure modes to
guide future agent development.

### [388] [Beyond Embeddings: Interpretable Feature Extraction for Binary Code Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23449)
*Charles E. Gagnon,Steven H. H. Ding,Philippe Charland,Benjamin C. M. Fung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A language model-based agent generates structured, human-readable features from assembly code to bridge gaps between interpretability, generalizability, and scalability in binary code similarity detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current binary code similarity detection methods force a compromise between interpretability (hand-crafted features), generalizability (embedding methods), and scalability (high-dimensional nearest-neighbor search).

Method: Uses a language model-based agent to conduct structured reasoning analysis of assembly code, generating features like input/output types, side effects, notable constants, and algorithmic intent that are human-readable and directly searchable.

Result: Achieves 42% and 62% recall@1 in cross-architecture and cross-optimization tasks without training, comparable to embedding methods with training (39% and 34%). When combined with embeddings, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that accuracy, scalability, and interpretability can coexist in binary code similarity detection through structured reasoning features that complement embedding-based approaches.

Abstract: Binary code similarity detection is a core task in reverse engineering. It
supports malware analysis and vulnerability discovery by identifying
semantically similar code in different contexts. Modern methods have progressed
from manually engineered features to vector representations. Hand-crafted
statistics (e.g., operation ratios) are interpretable, but shallow and fail to
generalize. Embedding-based methods overcome this by learning robust
cross-setting representations, but these representations are opaque vectors
that prevent rapid verification. They also face a scalability-accuracy
trade-off, since high-dimensional nearest-neighbor search requires
approximations that reduce precision. Current approaches thus force a
compromise between interpretability, generalizability, and scalability.
  We bridge these gaps using a language model-based agent to conduct structured
reasoning analysis of assembly code and generate features such as input/output
types, side effects, notable constants, and algorithmic intent. Unlike
hand-crafted features, they are richer and adaptive. Unlike embeddings, they
are human-readable, maintainable, and directly searchable with inverted or
relational indexes. Without any matching training, our method respectively
achieves 42% and 62% for recall@1 in cross-architecture and cross-optimization
tasks, comparable to embedding methods with training (39% and 34%). Combined
with embeddings, it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art,
demonstrating that accuracy, scalability, and interpretability can coexist.

*Zhuoli Yin,Yi Ding,Reem Khir,Hua Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ViTSP is a novel framework that uses pre-trained vision language models to visually identify promising subproblems in large-scale Traveling Salesman Problems, which are then optimized using standard solvers to achieve near-optimal solutions without dedicated training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical TSP methods face scalability issues, heuristic methods require parameter tuning, and learning-based approaches suffer from poor generalization and limited scalability due to fixed training data.

Method: Leverages pre-trained vision language models to visually identify promising small-scale subproblems from visualized TSP instances, then uses off-the-shelf solvers to optimize these subproblems and improve the global solution.

Result: Achieves average optimality gaps below 0.2% on real-world TSP instances ranging from 1k to 88k nodes, outperforming existing learning-based methods and surpassing LKH-3 heuristic solver by reducing gaps by 12% to 100% under same runtime budget.

Conclusion: ViTSP offers a new hybrid approach combining pre-trained generative models with operations research solvers for combinatorial optimization, with practical implications for complex logistics systems integration.

Abstract: Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is NP-hard yet fundamental for wide
real-world applications. Classical exact methods face challenges in scaling,
and heuristic methods often require domain-specific parameter calibration.
While learning-based approaches have shown promise, they suffer from poor
generalization and limited scalability due to fixed training data. This work
proposes ViTSP, a novel framework that leverages pre-trained vision language
models (VLMs) to visually guide the solution process for large-scale TSPs. The
VLMs function to identify promising small-scale subproblems from a visualized
TSP instance, which are then efficiently optimized using an off-the-shelf
solver to improve the global solution. ViTSP bypasses the dedicated model
training at the user end while maintaining effectiveness across diverse
instances. Experiments on real-world TSP instances ranging from 1k to 88k nodes
demonstrate that ViTSP consistently achieves solutions with average optimality
gaps below 0.2%, outperforming existing learning-based methods. Under the same
runtime budget, it surpasses the best-performing heuristic solver, LKH-3, by
reducing its gaps by 12% to 100%, particularly on very-large-scale instances
with more than 10k nodes. Our framework offers a new perspective in hybridizing
pre-trained generative models and operations research solvers in solving
combinatorial optimization problems, with practical implications for
integration into more complex logistics systems. The code is available at

*Zhangyu Wang,Nemin Wu,Qian Cao,Jiangnan Xia,Zeping Liu,Yiqun Xie,Akshay Nambi,Tanuja Ganu,Ni Lao,Ninghao Liu,Gengchen Mai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes GeoBS, an information-theoretic framework for evaluating geographic bias in AI models that is model-agnostic, universally applicable, and spatially explicit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current geo-bias measures are either model-specific or spatially implicit, lacking a comprehensive framework for fair comparison across different AI models and understanding spatial factors contributing to bias.

Method: Established an information-theoretic framework called GeoBS, demonstrated its generalizability by interpreting existing measures under it, and proposed three novel geo-bias scores considering multi-scalability, distance decay, and anisotropy.

Result: Extensive experiments on 3 tasks, 8 datasets, and 8 models showed that both task-specific GeoAI models and general-purpose foundation models suffer from various types of geo-bias.

Conclusion: The GeoBS framework advances technical understanding of geographic bias and establishes a foundation for integrating spatial fairness into AI system design, deployment, and evaluation.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of AI models, especially foundation models (FMs), has
made a profound impact on numerous domains. However, it also raises significant
ethical concerns, including bias issues. Although numerous efforts have been
made to quantify and mitigate social bias in AI models, geographic bias (in
short, geo-bias) receives much less attention, which presents unique
challenges. While previous work has explored ways to quantify geo-bias, these
measures are model-specific (e.g., mean absolute deviation of LLM ratings) or
spatially implicit (e.g., average fairness scores of all spatial partitions).
We lack a model-agnostic, universally applicable, and spatially explicit
geo-bias evaluation framework that allows researchers to fairly compare the
geo-bias of different AI models and to understand what spatial factors
contribute to the geo-bias. In this paper, we establish an
information-theoretic framework for geo-bias evaluation, called GeoBS (Geo-Bias
Scores). We demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed framework by
showing how to interpret and analyze existing geo-bias measures under this
framework. Then, we propose three novel geo-bias scores that explicitly take
intricate spatial factors (multi-scalability, distance decay, and anisotropy)
into consideration. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 3 tasks, 8
datasets, and 8 models to demonstrate that both task-specific GeoAI models and
general-purpose foundation models may suffer from various types of geo-bias.
This framework will not only advance the technical understanding of geographic
bias but will also establish a foundation for integrating spatial fairness into
the design, deployment, and evaluation of AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel probabilistic modeling framework using Item Response Theory that achieves over 80% accuracy in predicting student performance on mathematics exams, with a surprising finding that a single latent ability parameter is sufficient for maximum predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address social inequality in education by developing affordable AI tutors through improved prediction of student performance, particularly in data-sparse settings where many platforms struggle with accuracy.

Method: Released the largest open dataset of professionally marked mathematics exam responses, developed a probabilistic modeling framework based on Item Response Theory, and created a novel discrete variational inference framework for low-data settings.

Result: Achieved over 80% prediction accuracy for mathematics exam responses, setting a new benchmark. Collaborative filtering models revealed that a single latent ability parameter alone achieves maximum predictive accuracy. The variational inference framework outperformed all classical IRT and matrix factorization baselines.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates that effective AI tutoring systems can be built with high prediction accuracy using IRT-based approaches, with the surprising finding that complex skill profiles may not be necessary when a single latent ability parameter suffices for maximum predictive performance.

Abstract: One of the largest drivers of social inequality is unequal access to personal
tutoring, with wealthier individuals able to afford it, while the majority
cannot. Affordable, effective AI tutors offer a scalable solution. We focus on
adaptive learning, predicting whether a student will answer a question
correctly, a key component of any effective tutoring system. Yet many platforms
struggle to achieve high prediction accuracy, especially in data-sparse
settings. To address this, we release the largest open dataset of
professionally marked formal mathematics exam responses to date. We introduce a
probabilistic modelling framework rooted in Item Response Theory (IRT) that
achieves over 80 percent accuracy, setting a new benchmark for mathematics
prediction accuracy of formal exam papers. Extending this, our collaborative
filtering models incorporate topic-level skill profiles, but reveal a
surprising and educationally significant finding, a single latent ability
parameter alone is needed to achieve the maximum predictive accuracy. Our main
contribution though is deriving and implementing a novel discrete variational
inference framework, achieving our highest prediction accuracy in low-data
settings and outperforming all classical IRT and matrix factorisation
baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper develops 'benchmark signatures' - sets of salient tokens from natural corpora where LLM perplexity predicts benchmark performance. These signatures help characterize meaningful overlaps between LLM benchmarks and provide insights into interconnected capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current benchmark evaluation methods, particularly the conflation of performance with ability and issues with benchmark agreement studies that are influenced by format and other orthogonal factors.

Method: Extracted benchmark signatures via stepwise forward selection with linear regressions across 32 LLMs and 88 benchmarks spanning diverse domains. Used token perplexity from naturally authored corpora as predictive features.

Result: Found high overlap in knowledge and reasoning subtasks, but multilingual/cultural benchmarks showed less similarity. Coding emerged as the least overlapping domain. Performance overlaps were universally high but influenced by format factors, while signatures remained robust to such effects.

Conclusion: Benchmark signatures provide mechanistic insights into benchmark validity and LLM sensitivities, revealing cross-functional overlaps across logic, math, language, instruction following, and world modeling, while sketching the underlying landscape of interconnected LLM capabilities.

Abstract: We develop signatures of capacity familiarity to characterize large language
model (LLM) benchmarks and their meaningful overlaps. Benchmark signatures
probe the capacity required for benchmark performance. We formally define them
as a set of salient tokens drawn from in-the-wild, naturally authored corpora,
where LLM token perplexity, reflecting more or less pre-training exposure,
becomes highly predictive of LLM benchmark performance. Through a large-scale
meta-evaluation, we extract benchmark signatures via stepwise forward selection
with linear regressions across 32 LLMs and 88 benchmarks spanning diverse
knowledge, coding, logic, instruction following, math, language, reasoning, and
world modeling. Our analysis situates signatures in relation to both the
semantic similarity of benchmark questions and the correlation of model
performance. While performance overlaps are universally high and semantic
overlaps remain confined to a narrow mid-range, benchmark signatures prove
highly informative in capturing variation, overlap, and divergence. We observe
overlap in knowledge and reasoning subtasks, whereas multilingual and cultural
benchmarks exhibit less similarity, even compared to cross-task overlap.
Notably, performance-level results are strongly influenced by
benchmark-orthogonal factors such as question format, highlighting limitations
in LLM generalization, the conflation of performance with ability, and issues
inherent in current mainstream benchmark agreement studies. Benchmark
signatures, however, remain robust to such effects. Ultimately, we identify
cross-functional overlaps across logic, math, language, instruction following,
and world modeling, with coding emerging as the least overlapping domain.
Together, these findings provide mechanistic insights into benchmark validity
and LLM sensitivities, and sketch the underlying landscape of interconnected
LLM capabilities.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel objective method for dynamic trust calibration between humans and AI using Contextual Bandits, demonstrating significant improvements in decision-making performance across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for measuring human-AI trust calibration lack standardization, consistent metrics, and fail to distinguish between opinion formation and subsequent decisions. Excessive or insufficient trust in AI systems leads to suboptimal decision-making.

Method: Proposes a standardized trust calibration measure using Contextual Bandits - an adaptive algorithm that incorporates context into decision-making to dynamically assess when to trust AI contributions based on learned contextual information.

Result: Evaluation across three diverse datasets shows effective trust calibration results in 10 to 38% increase in reward metrics, significantly improving decision-making performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances theoretical understanding of trust calibration and provides practical guidance for developing more trustworthy AI systems in critical domains like disease diagnoses and criminal justice.

Abstract: Trust calibration between humans and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is crucial
for optimal decision-making in collaborative settings. Excessive trust can lead
users to accept AI-generated outputs without question, overlooking critical
flaws, while insufficient trust may result in disregarding valuable insights
from AI systems, hindering performance. Despite its importance, there is
currently no definitive and objective method for measuring trust calibration
between humans and AI. Current approaches lack standardization and consistent
metrics that can be broadly applied across various contexts, and they don't
distinguish between the formation of opinions and subsequent human decisions.
In this work, we propose a novel and objective method for dynamic trust
calibration, introducing a standardized trust calibration measure and an
indicator. By utilizing Contextual Bandits-an adaptive algorithm that
incorporates context into decision-making-our indicator dynamically assesses
when to trust AI contributions based on learned contextual information. We
evaluate this indicator across three diverse datasets, demonstrating that
effective trust calibration results in significant improvements in
decision-making performance, as evidenced by 10 to 38% increase in reward
metrics. These findings not only enhance theoretical understanding but also
provide practical guidance for developing more trustworthy AI systems
supporting decisions in critical domains, for example, disease diagnoses and
criminal justice.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM self-judgment consistency in pairwise comparisons provides a cheap proxy for human-evaluated Elo scores with 91% correlation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for independent evaluation of new LLMs as they vary significantly in performance relative to parameter count, and current Elo scoring requires expensive human evaluation.

Method: Use LLM's own consistency in selecting itself as the best model in pairwise contests as a proxy metric.

Result: LLM self-judgment consistency shows 91% correlation with human-produced Elo scores, providing an effective evaluation method without human data.

Conclusion: LLM self-evaluation consistency serves as a reliable, cost-effective alternative to human-based Elo scoring for model assessment.

Abstract: New large language models (LLMs) are being released every day. Some perform
significantly better or worse than expected given their parameter count.
Therefore, there is a need for a method to independently evaluate models. The
current best way to evaluate a model is to measure its Elo score by comparing
it to other models in a series of contests - an expensive operation since
humans are ideally required to compare LLM outputs. We observe that when an LLM
is asked to judge such contests, the consistency with which it selects a model
as the best in a matchup produces a metric that is 91% correlated with its own
human-produced Elo score. This provides a simple proxy for Elo scores that can
be computed cheaply, without any human data or prior knowledge.

TL;DR: Multi-turn multi-agent orchestration with LLMs matches or exceeds the strongest single model performance on benchmark tasks, with analysis showing potential for further gains and revealing that authorship visibility increases self-voting while ongoing vote visibility amplifies herding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study how multiple LLM agents can interact over multiple turns through iterative answer proposals and voting until consensus, and benchmark this orchestration approach against single-LLM baselines.

Method: Used four LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5, Grok 4, Claude Sonnet 4) on GPQA-Diamond, IFEval, and MuSR datasets. Conducted two experiments: (1) benchmarking orchestration against single-LLM baselines, and (2) ablations on GPQA-Diamond varying whether agents see answer authorship and whether they can observe ongoing votes.

Result: Orchestration matches or exceeds the strongest single model and consistently outperforms the others. Analysis shows potential for further gains. Ablations reveal that revealing authorship increases self-voting and ties, while showing ongoing votes amplifies herding (speeds convergence but can cause premature consensus).

Conclusion: Multi-agent orchestration is an effective approach that can match or exceed the best single LLM performance, with specific interaction dynamics (authorship visibility and vote observation) significantly influencing agent behavior and consensus outcomes.

Abstract: We study multi-turn multi-agent orchestration, where multiple large language
model (LLM) agents interact over multiple turns by iteratively proposing
answers or casting votes until reaching consensus. Using four LLMs (Gemini 2.5
Pro, GPT-5, Grok 4, and Claude Sonnet 4) on GPQA-Diamond, IFEval, and MuSR, we
conduct two experiments: (i) benchmarking orchestration against single-LLM
baselines; and (ii) ablations on GPQA-Diamond that vary whether agents see who
authored answers and whether they can observe ongoing votes. Orchestration
matches or exceeds the strongest single model and consistently outperforms the
others. Analysis of best-achievable orchestration performance shows potential
for further gains. The ablations show that revealing authorship increases
self-voting and ties, and that showing ongoing votes amplifies herding, which
speeds convergence but can sometimes yield premature consensus.

TL;DR: PASS framework uses reinforcement learning to formalize jailbreak prompts, making them stealthier and more effective at bypassing LLM alignment defenses, then structures outputs into GraphRAG to enhance subsequent attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover vulnerabilities in LLM alignment methods by developing more sophisticated jailbreaking techniques that can bypass existing defenses.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning to transform initial jailbreak prompts into formalized descriptions for stealth, then structures outputs into GraphRAG system using extracted terms and symbols as contextual input.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness through extensive experiments on common open-source models, showing enhanced jailbreaking capabilities.

Conclusion: PASS framework successfully enhances jailbreak attacks against LLMs, revealing security vulnerabilities in current alignment methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
they also introduce novel security challenges. For instance, prompt
jailbreaking attacks involve adversaries crafting sophisticated prompts to
elicit responses from LLMs that deviate from human values. To uncover
vulnerabilities in LLM alignment methods, we propose the PASS framework
(\underline{P}rompt J\underline{a}ilbreaking via \underline{S}emantic and
\underline{S}tructural Formalization). Specifically, PASS employs reinforcement
learning to transform initial jailbreak prompts into formalized descriptions,
which enhances stealthiness and enables bypassing existing alignment defenses.
The jailbreak outputs are then structured into a GraphRAG system that, by
leveraging extracted relevant terms and formalized symbols as contextual input
alongside the original query, strengthens subsequent attacks and facilitates
more effective jailbreaks. We conducted extensive experiments on common
open-source models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our attack.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TCM-HEDPR is a hierarchical structure-enhanced personalized recommendation model for TCM formulas that addresses limitations in existing AI approaches by incorporating patient personalization, handling long-tailed herb distributions, and considering traditional herb compatibility principles through knowledge graph diffusion guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous TCM prescription recommendation models have limitations: (i) insufficient attention to patient-personalized information (age, BMI, medical history), (ii) long-tailed distribution of herb data causing training biases, and (iii) oversight of traditional 'monarch, minister, assistant and envoy' herb compatibility principles that increases toxicity risks.

Method: The model pre-trains symptom representations using patient-personalized prompt sequences with prompt-oriented contrastive learning for data augmentation. It employs KG-guided homogeneous graph diffusion with self-attention to capture symptom-herb relationships, and a heterogeneous graph hierarchical network to integrate herb dispensing relationships with implicit syndromes while mitigating long-tailed data issues.

Result: Extensive experiments on two public datasets and one clinical dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of TCM-HEDPR. The model incorporates insights from modern medicine and network pharmacology for comprehensive prescription evaluation.

Conclusion: TCM-HEDPR provides a new paradigm for modern TCM recommendation by addressing key limitations in existing approaches and ensuring safer, more personalized prescription recommendations that align with traditional TCM principles.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence technology plays a crucial role in recommending
prescriptions for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Previous studies have
made significant progress by focusing on the symptom-herb relationship in
prescriptions. However, several limitations hinder model performance: (i)
Insufficient attention to patient-personalized information such as age, BMI,
and medical history, which hampers accurate identification of syndrome and
reduces efficacy. (ii) The typical long-tailed distribution of herb data
introduces training biases and affects generalization ability. (iii) The
oversight of the 'monarch, minister, assistant and envoy' compatibility among
herbs increases the risk of toxicity or side effects, opposing the 'treatment
based on syndrome differentiation' principle in clinical TCM. Therefore, we
propose a novel hierarchical structure-enhanced personalized recommendation
model for TCM formulas based on knowledge graph diffusion guidance, namely
TCM-HEDPR. Specifically, we pre-train symptom representations using
patient-personalized prompt sequences and apply prompt-oriented contrastive
learning for data augmentation. Furthermore, we employ a KG-guided homogeneous
graph diffusion method integrated with a self-attention mechanism to globally
capture the non-linear symptom-herb relationship. Lastly, we design a
heterogeneous graph hierarchical network to integrate herbal dispensing
relationships with implicit syndromes, guiding the prescription generation
process at a fine-grained level and mitigating the long-tailed herb data
distribution problem. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and one
clinical dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of TCM-HEDPR. In addition, we
incorporate insights from modern medicine and network pharmacology to evaluate
the recommended prescriptions comprehensively. It can provide a new paradigm
for the recommendation of modern TCM.

TL;DR: PrefCleanBench is the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating 13 preference data cleaning methods in LLM alignment, providing standardized assessment of cleaning strategies across diverse datasets, models, and algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human feedback for LLM alignment is often noisy and inconsistent, degrading reward model quality, but systematic evaluation of data cleaning methods' effectiveness and generalizability is lacking.

Method: Created PrefCleanBench with standardized protocol to assess 13 cleaning methods across diverse datasets, model architectures, and optimization algorithms, with modular implementations released.

Result: Uncovered key factors determining success of data cleaning in alignment tasks through rigorous comparison of disparate methods.

Conclusion: The benchmark establishes groundwork for principled approaches to improve LLM alignment through better data quality, highlighting the crucial role of data preprocessing in responsible AI development.

Abstract: Human feedback plays a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs)
with human preferences. However, such feedback is often noisy or inconsistent,
which can degrade the quality of reward models and hinder alignment. While
various automated data cleaning methods have been proposed to mitigate this
issue, a systematic evaluation of their effectiveness and generalizability
remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating 13 preference data cleaning methods in the context of
LLM alignment. PrefCleanBench offers a standardized protocol to assess cleaning
strategies in terms of alignment performance and generalizability across
diverse datasets, model architectures, and optimization algorithms. By unifying
disparate methods and rigorously comparing them, we uncover key factors that
determine the success of data cleaning in alignment tasks. This benchmark lays
the groundwork for principled and reproducible approaches to improving LLM
alignment through better data quality-highlighting the crucial but
underexplored role of data preprocessing in responsible AI development. We
release modular implementations of all methods to catalyze further research:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BridgeDrive is a novel anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory planning in autonomous driving that effectively translates expert driving behaviors into fine-grained trajectory plans while maintaining theoretical consistency and real-time efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based planners struggle with effective guidance in reactive, closed-loop driving environments. Simple conditioning fails in complex scenarios, and recent anchor-based approaches rely on truncated schedules that introduce theoretical inconsistencies and performance compromises.

Method: BridgeDrive introduces a principled diffusion framework that uses expert driving behaviors (anchors) to guide trajectory planning. It translates anchors into fine-grained trajectory plans that appropriately respond to varying traffic conditions, and is compatible with efficient ODE solvers for real-time deployment.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Bench2Drive benchmark, improving the success rate by 5% over prior arts.

Conclusion: BridgeDrive provides an effective solution for guiding diffusion models in closed-loop autonomous driving scenarios, maintaining theoretical consistency while achieving superior performance and real-time efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion-based planners have shown great promise for autonomous driving due
to their ability to capture multi-modal driving behaviors. However, guiding
these models effectively in reactive, closed-loop environments remains a
significant challenge. Simple conditioning often fails to provide sufficient
guidance in complex and dynamic driving scenarios. Recent work attempts to use
typical expert driving behaviors (i.e., anchors) to guide diffusion models but
relies on a truncated schedule, which introduces theoretical inconsistencies
and can compromise performance. To address this, we introduce BridgeDrive, a
novel anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory
planning. Our approach provides a principled diffusion framework that
effectively translates anchors into fine-grained trajectory plans,
appropriately responding to varying traffic conditions. Our planner is
compatible with efficient ODE solvers, a critical factor for real-time
autonomous driving deployment. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the
Bench2Drive benchmark, improving the success rate by 5% over prior arts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PSG-Agent is a personalized and dynamic guardrail system for LLM-based agents that addresses limitations of uniform policies and isolated response checking by creating user-specific risk thresholds and implementing continuous monitoring across multiple interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing guardrails suffer from applying uniform policies to all users and checking responses in isolation, missing how risks evolve across interactions. This creates safety gaps where the same agent behavior can harm some users while being safe for others.

Method: PSG-Agent creates personalized guardrails by mining interaction history for stable traits and capturing real-time states from queries. It implements continuous monitoring with specialized guards (Plan Monitor, Tool Firewall, Response Guard, Memory Guardian) that track cross-turn risk accumulation and issue verifiable verdicts.

Result: PSG-Agent significantly outperforms existing agent guardrails including LlamaGuard3 and AGrail in multiple scenarios including healthcare, finance, and daily life automation with diverse user profiles.

Conclusion: PSG-Agent provides an executable and auditable path toward personalized safety for LLM-based agents by addressing fundamental limitations of current guardrail systems through personalization and dynamic monitoring.

Abstract: Effective guardrails are essential for safely deploying LLM-based agents in
critical applications. Despite recent advances, existing guardrails suffer from
two fundamental limitations: (i) they apply uniform guardrail policies to all
users, ignoring that the same agent behavior can harm some users while being
safe for others; (ii) they check each response in isolation, missing how risks
evolve and accumulate across multiple interactions. To solve these issues, we
propose PSG-Agent, a personalized and dynamic system for LLM-based agents.
First, PSG-Agent creates personalized guardrails by mining the interaction
history for stable traits and capturing real-time states from current queries,
generating user-specific risk thresholds and protection strategies. Second,
PSG-Agent implements continuous monitoring across the agent pipeline with
specialized guards, including Plan Monitor, Tool Firewall, Response Guard,
Memory Guardian, that track cross-turn risk accumulation and issue verifiable
verdicts. Finally, we validate PSG-Agent in multiple scenarios including
healthcare, finance, and daily life automation scenarios with diverse user
profiles. It significantly outperform existing agent guardrails including
LlamaGuard3 and AGrail, providing an executable and auditable path toward
personalized safety for LLM-based agents.

### [402] [Reasoning Scaffolding: Distilling the Flow of Thought from LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23619)
*Xiangyu Wen,Junhua Huang,Zeju Li,Min Li,Jianyuan Zhong,Zhijian Xu,Mingxuan Yuan,Yongxiang Huang,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Reasoning Scaffolding, a framework that distills algorithmic reasoning structure from LLMs to SLMs using semantic signals and multi-task learning, outperforming traditional behavioral cloning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current behavioral cloning approaches for distilling reasoning from LLMs to SLMs are limited because they only teach surface-level pattern mimicry rather than the underlying algorithmic structure, leading to poor logical robustness.

Method: The method abstracts teacher LLM reasoning into discrete semantic signals (e.g., Contrast, Addition) and trains student models via multi-task learning to predict next semantic signals and generate corresponding reasoning steps conditioned on those signals.

Result: On challenging reasoning benchmarks, the method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art distillation approaches in both accuracy and logical consistency.

Conclusion: Reasoning Scaffolding provides a path to create smaller models that are genuine reasoners rather than just fluent mimics by directly transferring algorithmic reasoning structure.

Abstract: The prevailing approach to distilling reasoning from Large Language Models
(LLMs)-behavioral cloning from textual rationales-is fundamentally limited. It
teaches Small Language Models (SLMs) to mimic surface-level patterns rather
than the underlying algorithmic structure of thought, resulting in a critical
lack of logical robustness. We argue that instead of cloning text, distillation
should transfer this algorithmic structure directly. We introduce Reasoning
Scaffolding}, a framework that reframes reasoning as a structured generation
process. Our method first abstracts the teacher's thought process into a
sequence of discrete, interpretable semantic signals (e.g., Contrast, Addition)
that act as a scaffold. The student model is then trained via a multi-task
objective to both (1)predict the next semantic signal, anticipating the
reasoning flow, and (2)generate the corresponding step, conditioned on that
signal. This multi-task scheme acts as a powerful regularizer, compelling the
student to internalize the computational patterns of coherent reasoning. On a
suite of challenging reasoning benchmarks, our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art distillation in both accuracy and logical consistency,
providing a path towards creating smaller models that are genuine reasoners,
not just fluent mimics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLVR training shows puzzling behaviors like two-stage learning curves and catastrophic forgetting, explained by semantic network topology with average degree ~2. Proposed Annealed-RLVR with SFT heating resolves bottlenecks and improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand puzzling behaviors in RLVR training (two-stage learning, V-shaped response lengths, catastrophic forgetting) and develop a unifying theory to explain these phenomena.

Method: Propose that RLVR reasoning maps to self-organization of sparse semantic networks (avg degree ~2), leading to skill island formation and phase-transition learning. Introduce Annealed-RLVR with SFT-based heating at maximal frustration points.

Result: Annealed-RLVR outperforms standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks using a 1.5B-parameter model.

Conclusion: The work provides a physical intuition for RLVR as structural self-organization, enabling predictable engineering of AI reasoning capabilities through network topology understanding.

Abstract: Training large language models with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR) exhibits a set of distinctive and puzzling behaviors that remain
poorly understood, including a two-stage learning curve, V-shaped
response-length trajectories, and a pronounced vulnerability to catastrophic
forgetting. In this work, we propose that these seemingly disparate phenomena
can be explained using a single unifying theory: the model's reasoning process
maps to the self-organization of a semantic complex network whose topology
remains persistently sparse, with the average degree pinned close to two. This
topology imposes a fundamental mechanism for forgetting and learning: it first
drives the system into a maximally frustrated state where ``skill islands''
form, slow-learning happens, and forgetting is induced; then it enters a sharp
growth phase where the new skills are ``bolted on'', driven by
phase-transition-like learning at the web's frontier. Equipped with the theory,
we propose \textit{Annealed-RLVR}, a principled algorithm that introduces an
SFT-based ``heating'' step at the point of maximal frustration to resolve the
competitive bottleneck and enhance the reasoning capability of the model.
Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter model demonstrate that the approach outperforms
standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks. By
recasting RLVR from black-box optimization into a predictable process of
structural self-organization, our work provides a new physical intuition for
engineering the emergent reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.

TL;DR: GO-AEC framework improves ASR for gaming voice chat by combining LLMs, RAG, and data augmentation, reducing character error rate by 6.22% and sentence error rate by 29.71%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General ASR systems perform poorly in gaming scenarios due to short phrases, rapid speech, gaming jargon, and background noise, leading to frequent recognition errors that hinder team coordination.

Method: Proposed GO-AEC framework integrates large language models with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), uses LLMs and TTS for data augmentation, implements N-best hypothesis-based correction, and maintains a dynamic game knowledge base.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements: 6.22% reduction in character error rate and 29.71% reduction in sentence error rate compared to baseline ASR systems.

Conclusion: GO-AEC effectively addresses gaming-specific ASR challenges and substantially improves speech recognition accuracy in multiplayer online gaming environments.

Abstract: With the rise of multiplayer online games, real-time voice communication is
essential for team coordination. However, general ASR systems struggle with
gaming-specific challenges like short phrases, rapid speech, jargon, and noise,
leading to frequent errors. To address this, we propose the GO-AEC framework,
which integrates large language models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
and a data augmentation strategy using LLMs and TTS. GO-AEC includes data
augmentation, N-best hypothesis-based correction, and a dynamic game knowledge
base. Experiments show GO-AEC reduces character error rate by 6.22% and
sentence error rate by 29.71%, significantly improving ASR accuracy in gaming
scenarios.

*Jue Zhang,Qingwei Lin,Saravan Rajmohan,Dongmei Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates how Large Reasoning Models use reasoning traces to generate answers, showing that reasoning tokens functionally influence final answers through attention mechanisms and activation patching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the extent to which explicit reasoning traces influence answer generation in Large Reasoning Models, as the relationship between reasoning and final answers remains unclear despite models generating both.

Method: Three-stage investigation: 1) Empirical evaluation of reasoning inclusion on answer quality, 2) Attention analysis identifying Reasoning-Focus Heads, 3) Mechanistic interventions using activation patching to test dependence on reasoning activations.

Result: Explicit reasoning consistently improves answer quality; answer tokens attend substantially to reasoning tokens; perturbations to key reasoning tokens reliably alter final answers, confirming directional information flow from reasoning to answer.

Conclusion: Intermediate reasoning plays a functional role in shaping model outputs, with a clear directional flow of information from reasoning tokens to answer generation in Large Reasoning Models.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate explicit reasoning traces alongside
final answers, yet the extent to which these traces influence answer generation
remains unclear. In this work, we conduct a three-stage investigation into the
interplay between reasoning and answer generation in three distilled DeepSeek
R1 models. First, through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that including
explicit reasoning consistently improves answer quality across diverse domains.
Second, attention analysis reveals that answer tokens attend substantially to
reasoning tokens, with certain mid-layer Reasoning-Focus Heads (RFHs) closely
tracking the reasoning trajectory, including self-reflective cues. Third, we
apply mechanistic interventions using activation patching to assess the
dependence of answer tokens on reasoning activations. Our results show that
perturbations to key reasoning tokens can reliably alter the final answers,
confirming a directional and functional flow of information from reasoning to
answer. These findings deepen our understanding of how LRMs leverage reasoning
tokens for answer generation, highlighting the functional role of intermediate
reasoning in shaping model outputs. Our data and code are publicly available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SafeSearch, a benchmark for evaluating safety vulnerabilities in LLM-based search agents exposed to unreliable web content, revealing high attack success rates up to 90.5% and limited effectiveness of common defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Search agents connecting LLMs to the Internet create new safety threats due to unreliable search results that can misguide agent behaviors, establishing a new threat surface that needs systematic assessment.

Method: Developed an automated red-teaming framework for systematic safety assessment, constructed SafeSearch benchmark with 300 test cases covering 5 risk categories, and evaluated 3 search agent scaffolds across 15 LLMs (7 proprietary, 8 open-source).

Result: Found substantial vulnerabilities - highest attack success rate reached 90.5% for GPT-4.1-mini under search workflow setting when exposed to unreliable websites. Common defenses like reminder prompting showed limited effectiveness.

Conclusion: The framework promotes transparency for safer agent development by enabling systematic, scalable, and cost-efficient safety assessments of search agents, highlighting critical vulnerabilities in current LLM-based search systems.

Abstract: Search agents connect LLMs to the Internet, enabling access to broader and
more up-to-date information. However, unreliable search results may also pose
safety threats to end users, establishing a new threat surface. In this work,
we conduct two in-the-wild experiments to demonstrate both the prevalence of
low-quality search results and their potential to misguide agent behaviors. To
counter this threat, we introduce an automated red-teaming framework that is
systematic, scalable, and cost-efficient, enabling lightweight and harmless
safety assessments of search agents. Building on this framework, we construct
the SafeSearch benchmark, which includes 300 test cases covering five
categories of risks (e.g., misinformation and indirect prompt injection). Using
this benchmark, we evaluate three representative search agent scaffolds,
covering search workflow, tool-calling, and deep research, across 7 proprietary
and 8 open-source backend LLMs. Our results reveal substantial vulnerabilities
of LLM-based search agents: when exposed to unreliable websites, the highest
ASR reached 90.5% for GPT-4.1-mini under a search workflow setting. Moreover,
our analysis highlights the limited effectiveness of common defense practices,
such as reminder prompting. This emphasizes the value of our framework in
promoting transparency for safer agent development. Our codebase and test cases

### [407] [Measuring Sparse Autoencoder Feature Sensitivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23717)
*Claire Tian,Katherine Tian,Nathan Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to evaluate feature sensitivity in Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) by testing how reliably features activate on semantically similar generated text, revealing that many interpretable features have poor sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SAE feature evaluation focuses on activating examples but doesn't measure feature sensitivity - how reliably features activate on texts similar to their activating examples, which is crucial for understanding feature quality.

Method: Developed a scalable method using language models to generate text with the same semantic properties as feature activating examples, then tested whether features activate on these generated texts.

Result: Found that sensitivity measures a new facet of feature quality, many interpretable features have poor sensitivity, and average feature sensitivity declines with increasing SAE width across 7 SAE variants.

Conclusion: Establishes feature sensitivity as a new dimension for evaluating both individual features and SAE architectures, complementing existing interpretability metrics.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) features have become essential tools for mechanistic
interpretability research. SAE features are typically characterized by
examining their activating examples, which are often "monosemantic" and align
with human interpretable concepts. However, these examples don't reveal feature
sensitivity: how reliably a feature activates on texts similar to its
activating examples. In this work, we develop a scalable method to evaluate
feature sensitivity. Our approach avoids the need to generate natural language
descriptions for features; instead we use language models to generate text with
the same semantic properties as a feature's activating examples. We then test
whether the feature activates on these generated texts. We demonstrate that
sensitivity measures a new facet of feature quality and find that many
interpretable features have poor sensitivity. Human evaluation confirms that
when features fail to activate on our generated text, that text genuinely
resembles the original activating examples. Lastly, we study feature
sensitivity at the SAE level and observe that average feature sensitivity
declines with increasing SAE width across 7 SAE variants. Our work establishes
feature sensitivity as a new dimension for evaluating both individual features
and SAE architectures.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedLA is a logic-driven multi-agent framework that uses syllogistic triads to organize reasoning into explicit logical trees, enabling transparent inference and premise-level alignment through multi-round, graph-guided discussions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent approaches rely on fixed roles or shallow interaction prompts, limiting their ability to detect and resolve fine-grained logical inconsistencies in complex medical reasoning.

Method: Each agent organizes reasoning into explicit logical trees based on syllogistic triads (major premise, minor premise, conclusion). Agents engage in multi-round, graph-guided discussions to compare and iteratively refine logic trees through error correction and contradiction resolution.

Result: MedLA consistently outperforms static role-based systems and single-agent baselines on challenging benchmarks like MedDDx and standard medical QA tasks. It scales effectively across both open-source and commercial LLM backbones, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: MedLA offers a generalizable paradigm for trustworthy medical reasoning through its logic-driven multi-agent framework with transparent inference and premise-level alignment.

Abstract: Answering complex medical questions requires not only domain expertise and
patient-specific information, but also structured and multi-perspective
reasoning. Existing multi-agent approaches often rely on fixed roles or shallow
interaction prompts, limiting their ability to detect and resolve fine-grained
logical inconsistencies. To address this, we propose \textsc{MedLA}, a
logic-driven multi-agent framework built on large language models. Each agent
organizes its reasoning process into an explicit logical tree based on
syllogistic triads (major premise, minor premise, and conclusion), enabling
transparent inference and premise-level alignment. Agents engage in a
multi-round, graph-guided discussion to compare and iteratively refine their
logic trees, achieving consensus through error correction and contradiction
resolution. We demonstrate that \textsc{MedLA} consistently outperforms both
static role-based systems and single-agent baselines on challenging benchmarks
such as MedDDx and standard medical QA tasks. Furthermore, \textsc{MedLA}
scales effectively across both open-source and commercial LLM backbones,
achieving state-of-the-art performance and offering a generalizable paradigm

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EAPO is a novel RL framework that enhances LLM reasoning by incorporating multi-turn interactions with external experts during training, allowing the policy to adaptively consult experts and internalize their knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods for LLMs rely on outcome-based supervision, leading to inefficient exploration and sparse rewards. The paper aims to address this by leveraging external expert assistance to improve reasoning capabilities.

Method: Proposes Expert-Assisted Policy Optimization (EAPO) that enables policies to determine when and how to consult external experts during training, yielding richer reward signals and more reliable reasoning trajectories.

Result: EAPO outperforms expert-assisted workflow, expert-distilled models, and RL baselines on mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME 2024, AIME 2025, AIMO 2025), with an average gain of 5 points over self-exploratory models.

Conclusion: External assistance can be effectively internalized into policy models, amplifying their inherent reasoning capabilities and enabling improved independent problem-solving with more accurate solutions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently advanced in reasoning when
optimized with reinforcement learning (RL) under verifiable rewards. Existing
methods primarily rely on outcome-based supervision to strengthen internal LLM
reasoning, often leading to inefficient exploration and sparse rewards. To
mitigate this issue, we propose Expert-Assisted Policy Optimization (EAPO), a
novel RL framework that enhances exploration by incorporating multi-turn
interactions with external experts during training. Unlike prior methods, where
policies reason in isolation, EAPO incentivizes the policy to adaptively
determine when and how to consult experts, yielding richer reward signals and
more reliable reasoning trajectories. External assistance ultimately
internalizes expert knowledge into the policy model, amplifying the model's
inherent reasoning capabilities. During evaluation, the policy model has been
well-optimized to solve questions independently, producing improved reasoning
paths and more accurate solutions. Experiments on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, including AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and AIMO 2025, show that EAPO
consistently outperforms expert-assisted workflow, expert-distilled models, and
RL baselines, with an average gain of 5 points over self-exploratory models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper studies root cause identification in platform-orchestrated agentic systems, creates a dataset (AgentFail) with 307 failure logs, develops a taxonomy for failure root causes, and benchmarks LLM-based root cause identification methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Platform-orchestrated agentic systems are increasingly used for complex tasks but are fragile, and there's no systematic way to identify their failure root causes.

Method: Constructed AgentFail dataset with 307 failure logs from 10 agentic systems, developed a taxonomy of failure root causes, used counterfactual reasoning for reliable annotation, and created an LLM-based benchmark for root cause identification.

Result: The taxonomy significantly improves LLM performance in root cause identification, but accuracy reaches only 33.6%, indicating the task remains challenging. The study provides actionable guidelines for building reliable agentic systems.

Conclusion: The paper provides a foundation for advancing reliable agentic systems through a reliable dataset, taxonomy, and benchmark for failure root cause analysis.

Abstract: Agentic systems consisting of multiple LLM-driven agents coordinating through
tools and structured interactions, are increasingly deployed for complex
reasoning and problem-solving tasks. At the same time, emerging low-code and
template-based agent development platforms (e.g., Dify) enable users to rapidly
build and orchestrate agentic systems, which we refer to as
platform-orchestrated agentic systems. However, these systems are also fragile
and it remains unclear how to systematically identify their potential failure
root cause. This paper presents a study of root cause identification of these
platform-orchestrated agentic systems. To support this initiative, we construct
a dataset AgentFail containing 307 failure logs from ten agentic systems, each
with fine-grained annotations linking failures to their root causes. We
additionally utilize counterfactual reasoning-based repair strategy to ensure
the reliability of the annotation. Building on the dataset, we develop a
taxonomy that characterizes failure root causes and analyze their distribution
across different platforms and task domains. Furthermore, we introduce a
benchmark that leverages LLMs for automatically identifying root causes, in
which we also utilize the proposed taxonomy as guidance for LLMs. Results show
that the taxonomy can largely improve the performance, thereby confirming its
utility. Nevertheless, the accuracy of root cause identification reaches at
most 33.6%, which indicates that this task still remains challenging. In light
of these results, we also provide actionable guidelines for building such
agentic systems. In summary, this paper provides a reliable dataset of failure
root cause for platform-orchestrated agentic systems, corresponding taxonomy
and benchmark, which serves as a foundation for advancing the development of
more reliable agentic systems.

Motivation: Autonomous agents for long-sequence GUI tasks face challenges with sparse rewards and intractable credit assignment, which hinders their performance and learning efficiency.

Method: GUI-Shepherd is trained on a large-scale dataset of 52k interactions with human-annotated scores and GPT-4o generated rationales. It serves as both a reward provider for RL training and a verifier for inference, using process supervision across online and offline settings.

Result: On AndroidWorld benchmark, GUI-Shepherd improves success rate by 7.7 points with online PPO and 5.1 points as an inference verifier. On AndroidControl benchmark, it achieves gains of 2.2 points as reward provider and 4.3 points as verifier, significantly outperforming Outcome Reward Model competitors.

Conclusion: High-fidelity process supervision is critical for building more capable GUI agents, and GUI-Shepherd provides a generalizable solution that establishes the importance of process-level feedback in autonomous GUI task completion.

Abstract: Autonomous agents for long-sequence Graphical User Interface tasks are
hindered by sparse rewards and the intractable credit assignment problem. To
address these challenges, we introduce GUI-Shepherd, a Process Reward Model
that provides dense, step-by-step feedback to guide agents. GUI-Shepherd is
trained on a diverse large-scale data set of $52$k interactions that features
human-annotated scores and GPT-4o generated rationales, enabling it to serve
both as a reward provider for RL training and as a verifier for inference. As
far as we know, we are the first to conduct a systematic study of process
supervision in GUI agents, across diverse settings from online long-horizon
tasks to offline single-step prediction. On the online AndroidWorld benchmark,
GUI-Shepherd improves success rate by $7.7$ points via multi-turn online PPO,
significantly outperforming Outcome Reward Model based competitors. When used
as an inference verifier, it brings $5.1$ points improvements. The benefits
generalize to the offline AndroidControl benchmark, with gains of $2.2$ points
as a reward provider and $4.3$ points as a verifier. Collectively, our results
establish that high-fidelity process supervision is critical for building more
capable GUI agents and present a generalizable solution.

TL;DR: OCEAN is an interpretable AI framework using object-centric representations and multi-agent negotiation to produce human-understandable visual explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of producing explanations grounded in human-understandable concepts in visual AI systems.

Method: Object-centric representations with transparent multi-agent reasoning process using game-theoretic negotiation to agree on coherent and discriminative evidence.

Result: Competitive performance with state-of-the-art black-box models on two diagnostic multi-object datasets, with explanations rated as more intuitive and trustworthy in user studies.

Conclusion: OCEAN provides faithful and interpretable decision-making while maintaining competitive accuracy, making it a promising approach for explainable visual AI.

Abstract: A central challenge in explainable AI, particularly in the visual domain, is
producing explanations grounded in human-understandable concepts. To tackle
this, we introduce OCEAN (Object-Centric Explananda via Agent Negotiation), a
novel, inherently interpretable framework built on object-centric
representations and a transparent multi-agent reasoning process. The
game-theoretic reasoning process drives agents to agree on coherent and
discriminative evidence, resulting in a faithful and interpretable
decision-making process. We train OCEAN end-to-end and benchmark it against
standard visual classifiers and popular posthoc explanation tools like GradCAM
and LIME across two diagnostic multi-object datasets. Our results demonstrate
competitive performance with respect to state-of-the-art black-box models with
a faithful reasoning process, which was reflected by our user study, where
participants consistently rated OCEAN's explanations as more intuitive and
trustworthy.

*Cheng Yang,Jiaxuan Lu,Haiyuan Wan,Junchi Yu,Feiwei Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChemMAS is a multi-agent system that provides explainable chemical reaction condition recommendations through evidence-based reasoning and agentic debate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based methods for chemical reaction condition recommendation lack explainability, limiting their utility in scientific workflows where understanding the rationale behind recommendations is crucial.

Method: ChemMAS decomposes condition prediction into four stages: mechanistic grounding, multi-channel recall, constraint-aware agentic debate, and rationale aggregation, with each decision backed by interpretable justifications from chemical knowledge and retrieved precedents.

Result: ChemMAS achieves 20-35% gains over domain-specific baselines and outperforms general-purpose LLMs by 10-15% in Top-1 accuracy, while providing falsifiable, human-trustable rationales.

Conclusion: ChemMAS establishes a new paradigm for explainable AI in scientific discovery by combining high accuracy with interpretable reasoning for chemical reaction condition recommendation.

Abstract: The chemical reaction recommendation is to select proper reaction condition
parameters for chemical reactions, which is pivotal to accelerating chemical
science. With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), there is
growing interest in leveraging their reasoning and planning capabilities for
reaction condition recommendation. Despite their success, existing methods
rarely explain the rationale behind the recommended reaction conditions,
limiting their utility in high-stakes scientific workflows. In this work, we
propose ChemMAS, a multi-agent system that reframes condition prediction as an
evidence-based reasoning task. ChemMAS decomposes the task into mechanistic
grounding, multi-channel recall, constraint-aware agentic debate, and rationale
aggregation. Each decision is backed by interpretable justifications grounded
in chemical knowledge and retrieved precedents. Experiments show that ChemMAS
achieves 20-35% gains over domain-specific baselines and outperforms
general-purpose LLMs by 10-15% in Top-1 accuracy, while offering falsifiable,
human-trustable rationales, which establishes a new paradigm for explainable AI
in scientific discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Falcon, a large-scale vision-language safety dataset with 57,515 VQA pairs across 13 harm categories, and FalconEye, a specialized evaluator that reliably identifies harmful content in multimodal dialogue scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating harmful content are well-developed for text-only LLMs but remain underdeveloped for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), with visual information's role in content moderation being overlooked.

Method: Created Falcon dataset with explicit annotations for harmful attributes across images, instructions, and responses, then fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL-7B on this dataset to develop FalconEye evaluator.

Result: FalconEye outperforms all baselines in overall accuracy on Falcon-test, VLGuard, and Beavertail-V benchmarks, demonstrating reliable identification of harmful content in complex multimodal scenarios.

Conclusion: FalconEye shows strong potential as a practical safety auditing tool for MLLMs, effectively addressing the gap in multimodal content safety evaluation.

Abstract: Existing methods for evaluating the harmfulness of content generated by large
language models (LLMs) have been well studied. However, approaches tailored to
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain underdeveloped and lack depth.
This work highlights the crucial role of visual information in moderating
content in visual question answering (VQA), a dimension often overlooked in
current research. To bridge this gap, we introduce Falcon, a large-scale
vision-language safety dataset containing 57,515 VQA pairs across 13 harm
categories. The dataset provides explicit annotations for harmful attributes
across images, instructions, and responses, thereby facilitating a
comprehensive evaluation of the content generated by MLLMs. In addition, it
includes the relevant harm categories along with explanations supporting the
corresponding judgments. We further propose FalconEye, a specialized evaluator
fine-tuned from Qwen2.5-VL-7B using the Falcon dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that FalconEye reliably identifies harmful content in complex and
safety-critical multimodal dialogue scenarios. It outperforms all other
baselines in overall accuracy across our proposed Falcon-test dataset and two
widely-used benchmarks-VLGuard and Beavertail-V, underscoring its potential as
a practical safety auditing tool for MLLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Mix-ECom is a new benchmark dataset for evaluating e-commerce agents, featuring 4,799 mixed-type dialogue samples covering multiple dialogue types, e-commerce tasks, and domain rules, addressing current limitations in evaluating complex e-commerce interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current e-commerce agent benchmarks lack evaluation of mixed-type dialogues and complex domain rules, limiting their ability to assess real-world e-commerce agent capabilities.

Method: Constructed Mix-ECom dataset from real-world customer-service dialogues with privacy removal and CoT process addition, covering 4 dialogue types, 3 e-commerce task types, and 82 domain rules. Built baselines and proposed a dynamic framework for performance improvement.

Result: Current e-commerce agents show insufficient capabilities in handling e-commerce dialogues, primarily due to hallucinations caused by complex domain rules.

Conclusion: Mix-ECom addresses critical gaps in e-commerce agent evaluation and will be publicly available to advance research in this domain.

Abstract: E-commerce agents contribute greatly to helping users complete their
e-commerce needs. To promote further research and application of e-commerce
agents, benchmarking frameworks are introduced for evaluating LLM agents in the
e-commerce domain. Despite the progress, current benchmarks lack evaluating
agents' capability to handle mixed-type e-commerce dialogue and complex domain
rules. To address the issue, this work first introduces a novel corpus, termed
Mix-ECom, which is constructed based on real-world customer-service dialogues
with post-processing to remove user privacy and add CoT process. Specifically,
Mix-ECom contains 4,799 samples with multiply dialogue types in each e-commerce
dialogue, covering four dialogue types (QA, recommendation, task-oriented
dialogue, and chit-chat), three e-commerce task types (pre-sales, logistics,
after-sales), and 82 e-commerce rules. Furthermore, this work build baselines
on Mix-Ecom and propose a dynamic framework to further improve the performance.
Results show that current e-commerce agents lack sufficient capabilities to
handle e-commerce dialogues, due to the hallucination cased by complex domain
rules. The dataset will be publicly available.

### [418] [AgentGuard: Runtime Verification of AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23864)
*Roham Koohestani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentGuard is a runtime verification framework for Agentic AI systems that provides continuous probabilistic assurance through dynamic modeling and real-time verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional verification methods are inadequate for autonomous AI systems due to their unpredictability and emergent behaviors, necessitating probabilistic guarantees instead of absolute correctness.

Method: AgentGuard operates as an inspection layer that observes agent I/O, abstracts it into formal events, dynamically builds and updates a Markov Decision Process (MDP) using online learning, and performs real-time verification using probabilistic model checking.

Result: The framework enables continuous, quantitative assurance by modeling emergent behavior and verifying quantitative properties in real-time.

Conclusion: AgentGuard provides a new paradigm called Dynamic Probabilistic Assurance that addresses the verification challenges of autonomous AI systems through runtime monitoring and probabilistic guarantees.

Abstract: The rapid evolution to autonomous, agentic AI systems introduces significant
risks due to their inherent unpredictability and emergent behaviors; this also
renders traditional verification methods inadequate and necessitates a shift
towards probabilistic guarantees where the question is no longer if a system
will fail, but the probability of its failure within given constraints. This
paper presents AgentGuard, a framework for runtime verification of Agentic AI
systems that provides continuous, quantitative assurance through a new paradigm
called Dynamic Probabilistic Assurance. AgentGuard operates as an inspection
layer that observes an agent's raw I/O and abstracts it into formal events
corresponding to transitions in a state model. It then uses online learning to
dynamically build and update a Markov Decision Process (MDP) that formally
models the agent's emergent behavior. Using probabilistic model checking, the
framework then verifies quantitative properties in real-time.

*Jingyu Liu,Xiaopeng Wu,Jingquan Peng,Kehan Chen,Chuan Yu,Lizhong Ding,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper challenges the common belief that outcome-based rewards cause flawed middle steps to be reinforced, showing instead that gradient coupling between similar samples is the real issue in agentic RL that can strengthen suboptimal actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of reward miscalibration in autonomous agents solving long-horizon tasks, where outcome-based rewards were thought to reinforce flawed middle steps, but the authors reveal this is not the case.

Method: Propose training the actor to classify good or bad actions to separate their embeddings and alleviate gradient interference, addressing gradient coupling between similar samples in agentic RL.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in preventing flawed actions from being enhanced during training.

Conclusion: Gradient coupling, not outcome-based rewards, is the key issue causing flawed actions to be strengthened in agentic RL, and the proposed classification-based training effectively mitigates this problem.

Abstract: Building autonomous agents capable of solving long-horizon, real-world tasks
has garnered significant research interest. But outcome based rewards may cause
reward miscalibration which means it might mistakenly allocate positive reward
to flawed middle steps which is regarded as the key reason making the bad
actions being reinforced during training. However we reveal that outcome based
reward ensures expected negative advantage for those flawed middle steps, which
means the flawed actions should be punished during training. Even accounting
for the ``squeezing effect", the probability mass of good actions should
increase and the actor should gradually get rid of harmful actions. This shows
that flawed actions should be punished during training. We further identify
gradient coupling between similar samples as a key issue in agentic RL, the
input prompt is extremely similar and the output action space is limited,
therefore during training, gradients from well-performing samples can
inadvertently strengthen suboptimal or incorrect actions due to similar input
observation and output actions. We show that with gradient coupling, some
flawed actions might be enhanced. To address this, we propose training the
actor to classify good or bad actions to separate the embedding of good/bad
actions and alleviate the gradient interference, extensive experiments shows
its effectiveness.

Result: Uncovered several exploitable failure modes including quant fever, reasoning blackholes, Schrodinger's compliance, reasoning procedure mirage, and chain-oriented prompting that lead to severe consequences.

Conclusion: GPT-OSS-20B models contain significant security vulnerabilities that can be exploited through identified failure modes, highlighting the need for improved security measures in open-weight language models with chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: OpenAI's GPT-OSS family provides open-weight language models with explicit
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and a Harmony prompt format. We summarize an
extensive security evaluation of GPT-OSS-20B that probes the model's behavior
under different adversarial conditions. Using the Jailbreak Oracle (JO) [1], a

demonstrate how these behaviors can be exploited on GPT-OSS-20B models, leading
to severe consequences.

*Ouns El Harzli,Bernardo Cuenca Grau,Artur d'Avila Garcez,Ian Horrocks,Tarek R. Besold*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper establishes a formal correspondence between fibring of neural networks and fibring of modal logics, using fibred models compatible with neural networks to derive logical expressiveness results for GNNs, GATs, and Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between fibring of neural networks and fibring of modal logics, which was never formally established despite the inspiration, and to enable logical interpretation of neural network theories.

Method: Formalizing fibred models compatible with fibred neural networks, then using this correspondence to analyze logical expressiveness of various neural architectures.

Result: Derived non-uniform logical expressiveness results for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Transformer encoders.

Conclusion: Opens the way for using fibring as a formalism to interpret logical theories learned by neural networks using computational logic tools.

Abstract: Fibring of modal logics is a well-established formalism for combining
countable families of modal logics into a single fibred language with common
semantics, characterized by fibred models. Inspired by this formalism, fibring
of neural networks was introduced as a neurosymbolic framework for combining
learning and reasoning in neural networks. Fibring of neural networks uses the
(pre-)activations of a trained network to evaluate a fibring function computing
the weights of another network whose outputs are injected back into the
original network. However, the exact correspondence between fibring of neural
networks and fibring of modal logics was never formally established. In this
paper, we close this gap by formalizing the idea of fibred models
\emph{compatible} with fibred neural networks. Using this correspondence, we
then derive non-uniform logical expressiveness results for Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Transformer encoders.
Longer-term, the goal of this paper is to open the way for the use of fibring
as a formalism for interpreting the logical theories learnt by neural networks
with the tools of computational logic.

*Guanxu Chen,Yafu Li,Yuxian Jiang,Chen Qian,Qihan Ren,Jingyi Yang,Yu Cheng,Dongrui Liu,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CANON is a new reinforcement learning method that amplifies target metrics like entropy or response length without assuming their direction, improving LLM reasoning performance and token efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods use directional priors in reward shaping that can be overly biased and require careful hyperparameter tuning, potentially leading to failure.

Method: CANON regroups sampled responses into two groups based on metric values, compares which trend contributes to better performance through inter-group comparison, and identifies better responses within groups.

Result: CANON with entropy consistently outperforms prior methods across three LLMs on math reasoning and high-complexity logic tasks, and improves token efficiency when applied to response length.

Conclusion: CANON provides a more effective approach for incorporating training metrics in RL without directional assumptions, achieving better performance-cost trade-offs.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for large language
models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable progress in enhancing LLMs' reasoning
capabilities on tasks with clear correctness criteria, such as mathematical
reasoning tasks. Several training metrics, such as entropy or response length,
have been observed to correlate with different reasoning behaviors in
reinforcement learning. Prior approaches incorporate such priors through reward
or advantage shaping, which often relies on hand-crafted penalties and
preferences (e.g., higher-is-better or lower-is-better). However, without
careful hyperparameter tuning, these directional priors can be overly biased
and may lead to failure. To this end, we introduce Conditional advANtage
estimatiON (CANON), amplifying the impact of the target metric without
presuming its direction. Specifically, CANON regroups the sampled responses
into two groups based on the higher or lower value of a target metric, measures
which metric trend contributes to better performance through inter-group
comparison, and identifies the better response within the same group. In
summary, CANON based on entropy consistently outperforms prior methods across
three LLMs on both math reasoning and high-complexity logic tasks. When applied
to response length, CANON further improves token efficiency, yielding a more
favorable Pareto frontier in the performance-cost trade-off.

TL;DR: An evolutionary machine learning approach called \ourmodel uses grammar-guided genetic programming to automatically classify scientific papers as relevant or not, combining textual information with bibliometric data for improved accuracy while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systematic literature reviews are time-consuming, and machine learning can automate paper selection to reduce effort in identifying relevant literature from scientific databases.

Method: \ourmodel builds interpretable rule-based classifiers using grammar-guided genetic programming, allowing combination of textual information with bibliometric data not considered by state-of-the-art methods.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the ability to generate accurate classifiers without impairing interpretability, using configurable information sources not previously supported.

Conclusion: The proposed evolutionary approach successfully automates paper selection while maintaining interpretability and leveraging additional bibliometric data sources.

Abstract: Searching, filtering and analysing scientific literature are time-consuming
tasks when performing a systematic literature review. With the rise of
artificial intelligence, some steps in the review process are progressively
being automated. In particular, machine learning for automatic paper selection
can greatly reduce the effort required to identify relevant literature in
scientific databases. We propose an evolutionary machine learning approach,
called \ourmodel, to automatically determine whether a paper retrieved from a
literature search process is relevant. \ourmodel builds an interpretable
rule-based classifier using grammar-guided genetic programming. The use of a
grammar to define the syntax and the structure of the rules allows \ourmodel to
easily combine the usual textual information with other bibliometric data not
considered by state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments demonstrate that it is
possible to generate accurate classifiers without impairing interpretability
and using configurable information sources not supported so far.

TL;DR: TusoAI is an AI system that autonomously develops computational methods for scientific tasks by integrating domain knowledge and performing iterative optimization, outperforming existing methods and discovering novel biological insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific discovery is slowed by manual development of computational tools. LLMs can synthesize literature, reason with data, and generate code, but existing systems don't effectively integrate domain-specific knowledge for method development.

Method: TusoAI takes scientific task descriptions with evaluation functions, integrates domain knowledge into a knowledge tree representation, and performs iterative domain-specific optimization and model diagnosis to improve candidate solutions.

Result: TusoAI outperformed state-of-the-art expert methods, MLE agents, and scientific AI agents across diverse tasks including single-cell RNA-seq data denoising and satellite-based earth monitoring. In genetics applications, it improved existing methods and uncovered novel biology including 9 new autoimmune disease-T cell associations and 7 unreported disease variant-gene links.

Conclusion: TusoAI demonstrates the potential of agentic AI systems to accelerate computational method development in science, enabling automated discovery of novel biological insights and improved analytical tools.

Abstract: Scientific discovery is often slowed by the manual development of
computational tools needed to analyze complex experimental data. Building such
tools is costly and time-consuming because scientists must iteratively review
literature, test modeling and scientific assumptions against empirical data,
and implement these insights into efficient software. Large language models
(LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in synthesizing literature,
reasoning with empirical data, and generating domain-specific code, offering
new opportunities to accelerate computational method development. Existing
LLM-based systems either focus on performing scientific analyses using existing
computational methods or on developing computational methods or models for
general machine learning without effectively integrating the often unstructured
knowledge specific to scientific domains. Here, we introduce TusoAI , an
agentic AI system that takes a scientific task description with an evaluation
function and autonomously develops and optimizes computational methods for the
application. TusoAI integrates domain knowledge into a knowledge tree
representation and performs iterative, domain-specific optimization and model
diagnosis, improving performance over a pool of candidate solutions. We
conducted comprehensive benchmark evaluations demonstrating that TusoAI
outperforms state-of-the-art expert methods, MLE agents, and scientific AI
agents across diverse tasks, such as single-cell RNA-seq data denoising and
satellite-based earth monitoring. Applying TusoAI to two key open problems in
genetics improved existing computational methods and uncovered novel biology,
including 9 new associations between autoimmune diseases and T cell subtypes
and 7 previously unreported links between disease variants linked to their
target genes. Our code is publicly available at

Motivation: To overcome limitations of traditional rule-based or small-model approaches by leveraging LLMs for enhanced data understanding, semantic analysis, and autonomous workflow orchestration in data analysis tasks.

Method: Review of LLM-based techniques across different data modalities: structured data (table QA, NL2GQL), semi-structured data (markup languages, table modeling), unstructured data (chart/document understanding, code vulnerability detection), and heterogeneous data (data retrieval, modality alignment).

Result: Identified five key design goals for intelligent data analysis agents: semantic-aware design, modality-hybrid integration, autonomous pipelines, tool-augmented workflows, and support for open-world tasks.

Conclusion: LLM/Agent techniques show substantial impact in data analysis but face remaining challenges that require further research and practical advancements to fully realize their potential.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) and agent techniques for data analysis (a.k.a
LLM/Agent-as-Data-Analyst) have demonstrated substantial impact in both
academica and industry. In comparison with traditional rule or small-model
based approaches, (agentic) LLMs enable complex data understanding, natural
language interfaces, semantic analysis functions, and autonomous pipeline
orchestration. The technical evolution further distills five key design goals
for intelligent data analysis agents, namely semantic-aware design,
modality-hybrid integration, autonomous pipelines, tool-augmented workflows,
and support for open-world tasks. From a modality perspective, we review
LLM-based techniques for (i) structured data (e.g., table question answering
for relational data and NL2GQL for graph data), (ii) semi-structured data
(e.g., markup languages understanding and semi-structured table modeling),
(iii) unstructured data (e.g., chart understanding, document understanding,

Conclusion: CoTutor has significant potential for advancing educational technology through AI-driven personalization and scalability, while maintaining human pedagogical judgment and addressing future privacy and ethical considerations.

Abstract: Learning to learn is becoming a science, driven by the convergence of
knowledge tracing, signal processing, and generative AI to model student
learning states and optimize education. We propose CoTutor, an AI-driven model
that enhances Bayesian Knowledge Tracing with signal processing techniques to
improve student progress modeling and deliver adaptive feedback and strategies.
Deployed as an AI copilot, CoTutor combines generative AI with adaptive
learning technology. In university trials, it has demonstrated measurable
improvements in learning outcomes while outperforming conventional educational
tools. Our results highlight its potential for AI-driven personalization,
scalability, and future opportunities for advancing privacy and ethical
considerations in educational technology. Inspired by Richard Hamming's vision
of computer-aided 'learning to learn,' CoTutor applies convex optimization and
signal processing to automate and scale up learning analytics, while reserving
pedagogical judgment for humans, ensuring AI facilitates the process of
knowledge tracing while enabling learners to uncover new insights.

*Miguel Angel Alvarado Gonzalez,Michelle Bruno Hernandez,Miguel Angel Peñaloza Perez,Bruno Lopez Orozco,Jesus Tadeo Cruz Soto,Sandra Malagon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Single-run LLM leaderboards are unreliable - 83% of slices show rank inversions compared to three-run averages. Using ≥2 repetitions significantly improves ranking reliability while remaining feasible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM leaderboards rely on single stochastic runs, but the required number of repetitions for reliable conclusions is unclear. The study aims to quantify how many runs are needed for robust model comparisons.

Method: Re-evaluated eight state-of-the-art models on AI4Math Benchmark with three independent runs per setting. Used mixed-effects logistic regression, domain-level marginal means, rank-instability analysis, and run-to-run reliability assessment.

Result: Single-run leaderboards are brittle with 83% of slices showing pairwise rank inversions. Averaging runs provides modest standard error reduction (~5% from one to three runs) but large ranking improvements - two runs remove ~83% of single-run inversions.

Conclusion: Practitioners should treat evaluation as an experiment, report uncertainty, and use ≥2 repetitions under stochastic decoding. These practices improve robustness while remaining feasible for small teams and align model comparisons with real-world reliability.

Abstract: LLM leaderboards often rely on single stochastic runs, but how many
repetitions are required for reliable conclusions remains unclear. We
re-evaluate eight state-of-the-art models on the AI4Math Benchmark with three
independent runs per setting. Using mixed-effects logistic regression,
domain-level marginal means, rank-instability analysis, and run-to-run
reliability, we assessed the value of additional repetitions. Our findings
shows that Single-run leaderboards are brittle: 10/12 slices (83\%) invert at
least one pairwise rank relative to the three-run majority, despite a zero
sign-flip rate for pairwise significance and moderate overall interclass
correlation. Averaging runs yields modest SE shrinkage ($\sim$5\% from one to
three) but large ranking gains; two runs remove $\sim$83\% of single-run
inversions. We provide cost-aware guidance for practitioners: treat evaluation
as an experiment, report uncertainty, and use $\geq 2$ repetitions under
stochastic decoding. These practices improve robustness while remaining
feasible for small teams and help align model comparisons with real-world
reliability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fathom-DeepResearch is a two-model agentic system for complex information-seeking tasks. Fathom-Search-4B performs evidence-based web investigation, while Fathom-Synthesizer-4B converts search traces into structured research reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for reliable tool-integrated reasoning in agentic applications, particularly for complex open-ended information-seeking tasks where current DeepResearch Agents show strong performance but need improved reliability and extended tool-calling capabilities.

Method: Developed two specialized models: (1) Fathom-Search-4B trained with DUETQA dataset, RAPO reinforcement learning, and steerable step-level rewards for web investigation; (2) Fathom-Synthesizer-4B for converting search traces into structured reports.

Conclusion: The Fathom-DeepResearch system successfully advances agentic reasoning through specialized model design and training innovations, achieving robust performance on complex information-seeking tasks while maintaining strong generalization across diverse reasoning domains.

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning has emerged as a key focus for enabling agentic
applications. Among these, DeepResearch Agents have gained significant
attention for their strong performance on complex, open-ended
information-seeking tasks. We introduce Fathom-DeepResearch, an agentic system
composed of two specialized models. The first is Fathom-Search-4B, a DeepSearch
model trained from Qwen3-4B and optimized for evidence-based investigation
through live web search and targeted webpage querying. Its training combines
three advances: (i) DUETQA, a 5K-sample dataset generated via multi-agent
self-play that enforces strict web-search dependence and heterogeneous source
grounding; (ii) RAPO, a zero-overhead extension of GRPO that stabilizes
multi-turn Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards through curriculum
pruning, reward-aware advantage scaling, and per-prompt replay buffers; and
(iii) a steerable step-level reward that classifies each tool call by cognitive
behavior and marginal utility, enabling explicit control over search trajectory
breadth, depth, and horizon. These improvements enable reliable extension of
tool-calling beyond 20 calls when warranted. The second is
Fathom-Synthesizer-4B, trained from Qwen3-4B, which converts multi-turn
DeepSearch traces into structured, citation-dense DeepResearch Reports for
comprehensive synthesis. Evaluated on DeepSearch benchmarks (SimpleQA, FRAMES,
WebWalker, Seal0, MuSiQue) and DeepResearch-Bench, the system achieves
state-of-the-art performance in the open-weights category while demonstrating
strong generalization to diverse reasoning tasks including HLE, AIME-25,
GPQA-Diamond, and MedQA.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A modular AI agent architecture that enables natural language interaction with enterprise data warehouses, featuring transparent decision-making, automated evaluation, and statistical context for trustworthy data analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between natural language interfaces and complex enterprise data warehouses, enabling non-technical users to access data while maintaining transparency and reliability in high-stakes domains.

Method: Component-based architecture with multi-layered reasoning framework, automated evaluation system, statistical context module, and integration with BigQuery ecosystem for secure data retrieval and business rule application.

Result: Successfully demonstrated through an insurance claims processing case study, creating a robust, evaluable, and trustworthy system for LLM-powered agents in data-sensitive environments.

Conclusion: The integrated agent-development-with-evaluation framework provides a reliable solution for deploying AI agents in enterprise data contexts, ensuring transparency, interpretability, and quantitative evidence support.

Abstract: This article presents a modular, component-based architecture for developing
and evaluating AI agents that bridge the gap between natural language
interfaces and complex enterprise data warehouses. The system directly
addresses core challenges in data accessibility by enabling non-technical users
to interact with complex data warehouses through a conversational interface,
translating ambiguous user intent into precise, executable database queries to
overcome semantic gaps. A cornerstone of the design is its commitment to
transparent decision-making, achieved through a multi-layered reasoning
framework that explains the "why" behind every decision, allowing for full
interpretability by tracing conclusions through specific, activated business
rules and data points. The architecture integrates a robust quality assurance
mechanism via an automated evaluation framework that serves multiple functions:
it enables performance benchmarking by objectively measuring agent performance
against golden standards, and it ensures system reliability by automating the
detection of performance regressions during updates. The agent's analytical
depth is enhanced by a statistical context module, which quantifies deviations
from normative behavior, ensuring all conclusions are supported by quantitative
evidence including concrete data, percentages, and statistical comparisons. We
demonstrate the efficacy of this integrated agent-development-with-evaluation
framework through a case study on an insurance claims processing system. The
agent, built on a modular architecture, leverages the BigQuery ecosystem to
perform secure data retrieval, apply domain-specific business rules, and
generate human-auditable justifications. The results confirm that this approach
creates a robust, evaluable, and trustworthy system for deploying LLM-powered
agents in data-sensitive, high-stakes domains.

*Yuhui Wang,Changjiang Li,Guangke Chen,Jiacheng Liang,Ting Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Large reasoning models exhibit inconsistency between their reasoning traces and final answers due to competing mechanisms of CoT reasoning and memory retrieval. The paper introduces FARL, a fine-tuning framework that suppresses retrieval shortcuts to enhance genuine reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical limitation where models exploit memory retrieval as a shortcut during reasoning, effectively 'hacking' reward signals and undermining genuine reasoning development in current fine-tuning paradigms.

Method: Conducted controlled experiments with misleading cues and corrupted answers to test the hypothesis. Introduced FARL framework that integrates memory unlearning with reinforcement learning to suppress retrieval shortcuts during fine-tuning.

Result: Confirmed that both CoT reasoning and memory retrieval mechanisms operate simultaneously, with their dominance influenced by problem domains, model scales, and fine-tuning approaches. FARL successfully promotes reasoning-dominant behavior and enhances generalizable reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The findings reveal a fundamental challenge in reasoning fine-tuning and demonstrate that FARL effectively addresses this by suppressing retrieval shortcuts, leading to more consistent and genuine reasoning in large reasoning models.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit unprecedented capabilities in solving
complex problems through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, recent
studies reveal that their final answers often contradict their own reasoning
traces. We hypothesize that this inconsistency stems from two competing
mechanisms for generating answers: CoT reasoning and memory retrieval. To test
this hypothesis, we conduct controlled experiments that challenge LRMs with
misleading cues during reasoning and/or corrupted answers during retrieval. Our
results across models and datasets confirm that both mechanisms operate
simultaneously, with their relative dominance influenced by multiple factors:
problem domains, model scales, and fine-tuning approaches (e.g., reinforcement
learning vs. distillation). The findings reveal a critical limitation in
current reasoning fine-tuning paradigms: models can exploit the retrieval
mechanism as a shortcut, effectively "hacking" the reward signal and
undermining genuine reasoning development. To address this challenge, we
introduce FARL, a novel fine-tuning framework that integrates memory unlearning
with reinforcement learning. By carefully suppressing retrieval shortcuts
during the fine-tuning process, FARL promotes reasoning-dominant behavior and
enhances generalizable reasoning capabilities.

### [431] [Robust Preference Optimization: Aligning Language Models with Noisy Preference Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24159)
*Xiaoyang Cao,Zelai Xu,Mo Guang,Kaiwen Long,Michiel A. Bakker,Yu Wang,Chao Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RPO is a meta-framework that transforms existing preference alignment methods into robust versions by addressing noise and pluralistic human preferences through an EM algorithm that re-weights training data based on label correctness probabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard alignment methods like RLHF assume human preferences are homogeneous and noise-free, but in reality preferences are pluralistic and annotations contain errors, creating discrepancies that degrade model performance.

Method: Uses Expectation-Maximization to infer posterior probabilities of label correctness, adaptively re-weighting data points in training loss. Establishes theoretical link between preference losses and probabilistic models to systematically convert existing algorithms into robust versions.

Result: RPO consistently enhances four state-of-the-art alignment algorithms (DPO, IPO, SimPO, CPO). On Mistral and Llama 3 models, achieves up to 7.0% win rate gain on AlpacaEval 2 and 5.4% on Arena-Hard.

Conclusion: RPO provides a principled meta-framework for robust preference alignment that addresses fundamental limitations of current methods, with theoretical guarantees and empirical improvements across multiple benchmarks and models.

Abstract: Standard human preference-based alignment methods, such as Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), are a cornerstone technology for aligning
Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values. However, these methods are all
underpinned by a critical, yet flawed assumption: human preferences are
homogeneous (representing a single, unified preference) and the collected data
is noiseless (free from error). In reality, neither is true since human
preference is pluralistic and annotators can make mistakes. This creates a
discrepancy between the recorded data and the ground-truth preferences, which
can misguide the model and degrade its performance. To address this challenge,
we introduce Robust Preference Optimization (RPO). RPO employs an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to infer the posterior probability of
each label's correctness, which is used to adaptively re-weigh each data point
in the training loss to mitigate noise. We further generalize this approach by
establishing a theoretical link between arbitrary preference losses and their
corresponding probabilistic models. This generalization enables the systematic
transformation of existing alignment algorithms into their robust counterparts,
elevating RPO from a specific algorithm to a meta-framework for robust
preference alignment. Theoretically, we prove that under the condition of a
perfectly calibrated model, RPO is guaranteed to converge to the true noise
level of the dataset. Our experiments demonstrate RPO's effectiveness as a
meta-framework, consistently enhancing four state-of-the-art alignment
algorithms (DPO, IPO, SimPO, and CPO). When applied to Mistral and Llama 3
models, the RPO-enhanced methods achieve substantial win rate gains on
AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, with improvements of up to 7.0% and 5.4%,
respectively.

### [432] [Humanline: Online Alignment as Perceptual Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24207)
*Sijia Liu,Niklas Muennighoff,Kawin Ethayarajh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Online alignment methods like GRPO outperform offline methods like DPO because they better match human perceptual biases in probability assessment. The paper shows that PPO/GRPO clipping naturally incorporates human perceptual distortions, and proposes "humanline" variants that achieve similar performance using offline data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why online alignment methods perform better than offline methods, drawing insights from behavioral economics and prospect theory about human perception of probability.

Method: Proposed a design pattern that explicitly incorporates perceptual distortions of probability into alignment objectives (DPO/KTO/GRPO), creating "humanline" variants that can be trained with offline off-policy data.

Result: Humanline variants trained with offline off-policy data can match the performance of their online counterparts on both verifiable and unverifiable tasks.

Conclusion: The online/offline dichotomy is incidental to maximizing human utility - the key insight is incorporating human perceptual biases, which can be achieved through selective training that mimics human perception rather than restricting to online data.

Abstract: Online alignment (e.g., GRPO) is generally more performant than offline
alignment (e.g., DPO) -- but why? Drawing on prospect theory from behavioral
economics, we propose a human-centric explanation. We prove that online
on-policy sampling better approximates the human-perceived distribution of what
the model can produce, and PPO/GRPO-style clipping -- originally introduced to
just stabilize training -- recovers a perceptual bias in how humans perceive
probability. In this sense, PPO/GRPO act as perceptual losses already. Our
theory further suggests that the online/offline dichotomy is itself incidental
to maximizing human utility, since we can achieve the same effect by
selectively training on any data in a manner that mimics human perception,
rather than restricting ourselves to online on-policy data. Doing so would
allow us to post-train more quickly, cheaply, and flexibly without sacrificing
performance. To this end, we propose a design pattern that explicitly
incorporates perceptual distortions of probability into objectives like
DPO/KTO/GRPO, creating humanline variants of them. Surprisingly, we find that
these humanline variants, even when trained with offline off-policy data, can
match the performance of their online counterparts on both verifiable and
unverifiable tasks.

*Shaobin Ling,Yun Wang,Chenyou Fan,Tin Lun Lam,Junjie Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ELHPlan is a novel LLM-based multi-robot planning framework that uses Action Chains to balance adaptability and efficiency, achieving comparable task success with only 24% of tokens compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based multi-robot collaboration faces fundamental trade-offs: declarative methods lack adaptability in dynamic environments, while iterative methods have prohibitive computational costs that scale poorly with team size and task complexity.

Method: ELHPlan introduces Action Chains (sequences of actions explicitly bound to sub-goal intentions) as the fundamental planning primitive. It operates via a cyclical process: constructing intention-bound action sequences, proactive validation for conflicts/feasibility, targeted refinement, and execution of validated actions.

Result: Experiments on TDW-MAT and C-WAH benchmarks show ELHPlan achieves comparable task success rates while consuming only 24% of the tokens required by state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ELHPlan establishes a new efficiency-effectiveness frontier for LLM-based multi-agent planning systems by balancing adaptability and efficiency through its Action Chain approach and comprehensive efficiency metrics.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable intelligent multi-robot collaboration but
face fundamental trade-offs: declarative methods lack adaptability in dynamic
environments, while iterative methods incur prohibitive computational costs
that scale poorly with team size and task complexity. In this paper, we propose
ELHPlan, a novel framework that introduces Action Chains--sequences of actions
explicitly bound to sub-goal intentions--as the fundamental planning primitive.
ELHPlan operates via a cyclical process: 1) constructing intention-bound action
sequences, 2) proactively validating for conflicts and feasibility, 3) refining
issues through targeted mechanisms, and 4) executing validated actions. This
design balances adaptability and efficiency by providing sufficient planning
horizons while avoiding expensive full re-planning. We further propose
comprehensive efficiency metrics, including token consumption and planning
time, to more holistically evaluate multi-agent collaboration. Our experiments
on benchmark TDW-MAT and C-WAH demonstrate that ELHPlan achieves comparable
task success rates while consuming only 24% of the tokens required by
state-of-the-art methods. Our research establishes a new
efficiency-effectiveness frontier for LLM-based multi-agent planning systems.

*Yixin He,Lumingyuan Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FR-Ponder is a framework that adaptively allocates reasoning compute for LLMs by using a small controller to decide when to halt or apply ponder steps via latent steering vectors, optimizing compute usage without modifying backbone weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches like Best-of-N and majority voting apply uniform reasoning depth across all inputs, wasting computation on simple queries and potentially under-thinking complex ones.

Method: A <1M-parameter controller observes hidden states and decides to halt or apply ponder steps by adding pre-computed steering vectors to frozen representations. Uses Group Relative Policy Optimization for reward signals to regulate reasoning depth adaptively.

Result: On GSM8K and MATH500 benchmarks, FR-Ponder improves the compute-accuracy frontier, achieving lower FLOPs with better matched accuracy compared to early-exit baselines. Learned compute allocation correlates with problem difficulty.

Conclusion: FR-Ponder enables instance-adaptive reasoning compute allocation through latent steering, achieving efficient compute usage while maintaining accuracy without modifying backbone LLM weights.

Abstract: Test-time compute has emerged as a key paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning,
yet prevailing approaches like Best-of-N and majority voting apply uniform
depth across inputs, wasting computation on simple queries while potentially
under-thinking complex ones. We present FR-Ponder, a single-graph,
backbone-training-free framework that allocates instance-adaptive reasoning
compute via latent steering. A less than 1M-param controller observes hidden
states and decides to halt or apply a small ponder step by adding a
pre-computed steering vector to frozen representations. Our method extracts the
latent steering vector associated with deeper reasoning outputs and direct IO
from LLM and re-applies it through a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model
to adapt its reasoning depth to the complexity of each input. To balance
performance and computational cost, we employ Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) as a reward signal to adaptively regulate reasoning depth,
achieving task accuracy while mitigating overreasoning. Through curriculum
learning and careful reward engineering, FR-Ponder learns calibrated compute
allocation correlated with problem difficulty. On GSM8K and MATH500, FR-Ponder
improves the compute-accuracy frontier, delivering lower FLOPs with better
matched accuracy and comparing favorably to early-exit baselines, without
modifying backbone weights. Analyses visualize interpretable steering
directions and show learned compute allocation correlates with problem
difficulty.

*Yuanyi Wang,Yanggan Gu,Yiming Zhang,Qi Zhou,Zhaoyi Yan,Congkai Xie,Xinyao Wang,Jianbo Yuan,Hongxia Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies a power law that predicts scaling behavior in language model merging, showing how performance gains diminish with increasing experts and linking model capacity to merging efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish quantitative predictive rules for language model merging, which is widely used in practice but lacks systematic scaling laws to guide decisions about expert numbers and model sizes.

Method: Empirical study of scaling laws across diverse architectures and merging methods (Average, TA, TIES, DARE), identifying a compact power law that relates model size and expert number to cross-entropy performance.

Result: The identified power law tightly fits measured curves across all tested methods, showing that gains decrease roughly as 1/k with expert number, and that variability shrinks as more experts are included.

Conclusion: The scaling law enables predictive planning for model merging, allowing estimation of expert requirements, stopping criteria, and trade-offs between scaling base models versus adding experts, transforming merging from heuristic practice to a computationally efficient alternative to multitask training.

Abstract: We study empirical scaling laws for language model merging measured by
cross-entropy. Despite its wide practical use, merging lacks a quantitative
rule that predicts returns as we add experts or scale the model size. We
identify a compact power law that links model size and expert number: the
size-dependent floor decreases with model capacity, while the merging tail
exhibits clear diminishing returns in the number of experts. The law holds
in-domain and cross-domain, tightly fits measured curves across diverse
architectures and methods (Average, TA, TIES, DARE), and explains two robust
regularities: most gains arrive early, and variability shrinks as more experts
are included. Building on this, we present a simple theory that explains why
gains fall roughly as 1/k and links the floor and tail to properties of the
base model and the diversity across domains. This law enables predictive
planning: estimate how many experts are needed to reach a target loss, decide
when to stop adding experts, and trade off scaling the base model versus adding
experts under a fixed budget--turning merging from heuristic practice into a
computationally efficient, planable alternative to multitask training. This
suggests a scaling principle for distributed generative AI: predictable gains
can be achieved by composing specialists, offering a complementary path toward
AGI-level systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SpecExit is a novel framework that uses hidden states from a lightweight draft model to predict both future tokens and early-exit signals, reducing generation length by 66% and achieving 2.5x speedup in end-to-end latency without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models suffer from overthinking, producing unnecessarily long outputs with high latency, limiting real-world deployment. Existing early-exit mechanisms have detection overhead that limits latency gains and generalizability.

Method: Proposes SpecExit framework that predicts future tokens and early-exit signals directly from hidden states of a lightweight draft model, eliminating probing overhead. Inspired by speculative decoding but extended for early-exit capabilities.

Result: Significant improvements: 66% reduction in average generation length, 2.5x speedup in end-to-end latency compared to speculative decoding baseline, while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: Hidden states provide effective early-exit signals, suggesting broader use of hidden states for efficient reasoning. The method demonstrates practical deployment benefits for large reasoning models.

Abstract: Despite their strong performance on reasoning tasks, large reasoning models
(LRMs) often suffer from overthinking, producing unnecessarily long outputs and
incurring high end-to-end latency, a significant limitation to their real-world
deployment. To address overthinking, early-exit mechanisms have been proposed
to terminate reasoning before typical completion, showing that this approach
can effectively shorten generation length with minimal impact on accuracy.
However, their reliance on probing mechanisms introduces a detection overhead
that limits their end-to-end latency gains and compromises their
generalizability across diverse problems. Inspired by the use of hidden states
in speculative decoding, we propose SpecExit, a novel framework that predicts
both future tokens and an early-exit signal directly from a lightweight draft
model without probing overhead. Our method offers significant improvements,
reducing average generation length by 66\% and achieving a 2.5x speedup in
end-to-end latency compared to the speculative decoding baseline, without
compromising accuracy. Our method leverages the inherent signals from hidden
states to provide effective early-exit signals, suggesting broader use of
hidden states for efficient reasoning. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A system that uses program synthesis and narrated demonstrations to teach collaborative physical tasks, enabling users to inspect and correct system behavior without coding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Teaching collaborative physical tasks is complex because systems must infer users' assumptions about teammates' intent, which is ambiguous and dynamic, requiring interpretable and correctable representations.

Method: Frames collaborative task learning as program synthesis, representing behavior as editable programs using narrated demonstrations (paired physical actions and natural language) as a unified teaching modality.

Result: In a study with 20 users teaching soccer tactics, 70% successfully refined learned programs to match their intent and 90% found it easy to correct the programs.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enables teaching collaborative physical activities through interpretable program representations, though challenges remain in representing learning as programs and teaching collaborative tasks.

Abstract: Teaching systems physical tasks is a long standing goal in HCI, yet most
prior work has focused on non collaborative physical activities. Collaborative
tasks introduce added complexity, requiring systems to infer users assumptions
about their teammates intent, which is an inherently ambiguous and dynamic
process. This necessitates representations that are interpretable and
correctable, enabling users to inspect and refine system behavior. We address
this challenge by framing collaborative task learning as a program synthesis
problem. Our system represents behavior as editable programs and uses narrated
demonstrations, i.e. paired physical actions and natural language, as a unified
modality for teaching, inspecting, and correcting system logic without
requiring users to see or write code. The same modality is used for the system
to communicate its learning to users. In a within subjects study, 20 users
taught multiplayer soccer tactics to our system. 70 percent (14/20) of
participants successfully refined learned programs to match their intent and 90
percent (18/20) found it easy to correct the programs. The study surfaced
unique challenges in representing learning as programs and in enabling users to
teach collaborative physical activities. We discuss these issues and outline
mitigation strategies.

*Yuwei Hu,Xinyi Huang,Zhewei Wei,Yongchao Liu,Chuntao Hong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs for graph reasoning are underestimated due to improper focus on replicating algorithms rather than designing them. A new challenging benchmark GraphAlgorithm and a simple baseline Simple-RTC are introduced, achieving near-perfect accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM performance on graph reasoning tasks is underwhelming, with issues in existing methods and benchmarks. Base models like GPT-4o-mini are largely underestimated due to improper reasoning focus.

Method: Constructed a more challenging GraphAlgorithm benchmark with 239 graph problems and 3,041 test instances. Introduced Simple-Reasoning-Then-Coding (Simple-RTC) which guides LLMs to design graph algorithms first and then code to solve tasks.

Result: Simple-RTC achieves near-perfect accuracy on existing benchmarks and significantly outperforms GPT-4o-mini and all prior methods on the GraphAlgorithm benchmark.

Conclusion: Redirecting reasoning focus from replicating to designing graph algorithms enables LLMs to solve most graph reasoning tasks. Simple-RTC serves as a strong baseline for future advancements in LLMs for graph reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for Graph Reasoning have been extensively
studied over the past two years, involving enabling LLMs to understand graph
structures and reason on graphs to solve various graph problems, with graph
algorithm problems being the most prevalent. Recent studies underscore the
potential of LLMs in handling graph reasoning tasks, but their performance is
underwhelming. In this work, we point out issues with existing methods and
benchmarks, and rethink the direction that LLMs for graph reasoning should
strive toward. We find that base models, e.g., GPT-4o-mini, are largely
underestimated due to improper reasoning focus. Base models with reasoning
focus redirected from replicating graph algorithms to designing them can easily
solve most graph reasoning tasks in existing benchmarks. To truly evaluate the
graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we construct a more challenging
GraphAlgorithm benchmark, comprising 239 different graph problems and 3,041
test instances collected from 4 competition platforms. Finally, we introduce a
simple and strong baseline Simple-Reasoning-Then-Coding (Simple-RTC)-which
guides LLMs to design graph algorithms first and then code to address graph
reasoning tasks. Simple-RTC achieves near-perfect accuracy on existing
benchmarks and significantly outperforms GPT-4o-mini and all prior methods on
the GraphAlgorithm benchmark. This strong baseline encourages further
advancements in LLMs for Graph Reasoning in the future.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLVR improves LLMs on reasoning tasks but limits solution diversity due to exploration issues. The paper introduces Risk-Sensitive RL (RS-GRPO) to enhance exploration and boost multi-solution performance while maintaining single-solution accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods suffer from exploration dilemma where pre-trained LLMs' initial policies confine RL to narrow solutions, boosting pass@1 but suppressing diversity and pass@k performance, thus limiting discovery of new reasoning strategies.

Method: Proposes Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning framework with risk-seeking objective that interpolates between mean and maximum rewards, leading to RS-GRPO algorithm that amplifies learning from challenging prompts for deeper exploration.

Result: RS-GRPO consistently improves pass@k performance across six mathematical reasoning benchmarks and five different LLMs while maintaining or enhancing pass@1 accuracy.

Conclusion: Risk-sensitive RL approach effectively addresses exploration limitations in RLVR, enabling better multi-solution performance and discovery of new reasoning strategies with minimal implementation complexity.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective
for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. However,
existing methods suffer from an exploration dilemma: the sharply peaked initial
policies of pre-trained LLMs confine standard RL algorithms to a narrow set of
solutions, boosting single-solution accuracy (pass@1) but suppressing solution
diversity and multi-solution performance (pass@k). As a result, RLVR often
distills existing capabilities rather than discovering new reasoning
strategies. To overcome this, we introduce a Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement
Learning framework. Our approach employs a risk-seeking objective that
interpolates between mean and maximum rewards, leading to a novel algorithm,
Risk-Sensitive GRPO (RS-GRPO), which drives deeper exploration by amplifying
learning from challenging prompts. Remarkably, RS-GRPO is simple to implement,
requiring only minor code modifications. On six mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and with five different LLMs, RS-GRPO consistently improves pass@k
performance while maintaining or enhancing pass@1 accuracy.

Abstract: Messaging patients is a critical part of healthcare communication, helping to
improve things like medication adherence and healthy behaviors. However,
traditional mobile message design has significant limitations due to its
inability to explore the high-dimensional design space. We develop PAME-AI, a

high-performance messaging design. PAME-AI is composed of a system of
specialized computational agents that progressively transform raw experimental
data into actionable message design strategies. We demonstrate our approach's
effectiveness through a two-stage experiment, comprising of 444,691 patient
encounters in Stage 1 and 74,908 in Stage 2. The best-performing generated
message achieved 68.76% engagement compared to the 61.27% baseline,

*Zihao Zhu,Xinyu Wu,Gehan Hu,Siwei Lyu,Ke Xu,Baoyuan Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AdvChain is an alignment paradigm that teaches models dynamic self-correction through adversarial CoT tuning to address the snowball effect in reasoning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety CoT tuning methods suffer from the snowball effect where minor reasoning deviations progressively amplify, leading to harmful compliance or excessive refusal, because models imitate perfect reasoning scripts without learning to self-correct.

Method: AdvChain constructs a dataset with Temptation-Correction and Hesitation-Correction samples, teaching models to recover from harmful reasoning drifts and unnecessary cautions through adversarial CoT tuning.

Result: Extensive experiments show AdvChain significantly enhances robustness against jailbreak attacks and CoT hijacking while substantially reducing over-refusal on benign prompts, achieving superior safety-utility balance without compromising reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: AdvChain establishes a new direction for building more robust and reliable reasoning models by teaching dynamic self-correction capabilities.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex problem-solving through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the
multi-step nature of CoT introduces new safety challenges that extend beyond
conventional language model alignment. We identify a failure mode in current
safety CoT tuning methods: the \textit{snowball effect}, where minor reasoning
deviations progressively amplify throughout the thought process, leading to
either harmful compliance or excessive refusal. This effect stems from models
being trained to imitate perfect reasoning scripts without learning to
self-correct. To address this limitation, we propose AdvChain, an alignment
paradigm that teaches models dynamic self-correction through adversarial CoT
tuning. Our method involves constructing a dataset containing
Temptation-Correction and Hesitation-Correction samples, where models learn to
recover from harmful reasoning drifts and unnecessary cautions. Extensive
experiments show that AdvChain significantly enhances robustness against
jailbreak attacks and CoT hijacking while substantially reducing over-refusal
on benign prompts, achieving a superior safety-utility balance without
compromising reasoning capabilities. Our work establishes a new direction for
building more robust and reliable reasoning models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: G-reasoner is a unified framework that integrates graph and language models for reasoning over graph-structured knowledge, using a standardized QuadGraph abstraction and a 34M-parameter graph foundation model to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to fragmented information and weak modeling of knowledge structure, while LLMs cannot effectively reason over graph-structured data. Current GraphRAG approaches have scalability and generalization issues.

Method: Proposes G-reasoner framework with QuadGraph (four-layer abstraction for unifying knowledge sources), a 34M-parameter graph foundation model that captures graph topology and textual semantics, integrated with LLMs, and uses mixed-precision training and distributed message-passing for scalability.

Result: Extensive experiments on six benchmarks show G-reasoner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, significantly enhances LLM reasoning, and achieves strong efficiency and cross-graph generalization.

Conclusion: G-reasoner successfully bridges the gap between graph-structured knowledge and LLM reasoning, providing a scalable and effective solution for knowledge-intensive tasks with strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning but remain limited by
static and incomplete parametric knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) mitigates this by incorporating external knowledge, yet existing RAGs
struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to fragmented information and weak
modeling of knowledge structure. Graphs offer a natural way to model
relationships within knowledge, but LLMs are inherently unstructured and cannot
effectively reason over graph-structured data. Recent graph-enhanced RAG
(GraphRAG) attempts to bridge this gap by constructing tailored graphs and
enabling LLMs to reason on them. However, these methods often depend on ad-hoc
graph designs, heuristic search, or costly agent pipelines, which hinder
scalability and generalization. To address these challenges, we present
G-reasoner, a unified framework that integrates graph and language foundation
models for reasoning over diverse graph-structured knowledge. Central to our
approach is QuadGraph, a standardized four-layer abstraction that unifies
heterogeneous knowledge sources into a common graph representation. Building on
this, we introduce a 34M-parameter graph foundation model (GFM) that jointly
captures graph topology and textual semantics, and is integrated with LLMs to
enhance reasoning in downstream applications. To ensure scalability and
efficiency, mixed-precision training and distributed message-passing are
implemented to scale GFM with more GPUs. Extensive experiments on six
benchmarks show that G-reasoner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, significantly enhances LLM reasoning, and achieves strong efficiency
and cross-graph generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in verifying LLM-generated scientific answers by creating SCI-VerifyBench (a cross-disciplinary benchmark) and SCI-Verifier (a reasoning-augmented verification model) to improve systematic evaluation and verification capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scientific answer verification methods lack systematic evaluation standards, have insufficient disciplinary coverage, and rely too heavily on manual rule design or prompt engineering, limiting their effectiveness in complex reasoning scenarios and cross-disciplinary generalization.

Method: Two-pronged approach: (1) Data level - construct SCI-VerifyBench benchmark covering math, physics, biology, chemistry and general scientific QA using real LLM responses enhanced with domain-specific equivalence transformations; (2) Model level - develop SCI-Verifier, a unified reasoning-augmented verifier trained through post-training to enhance logical reasoning and equivalence judgment capabilities.

Result: SCI-VerifyBench provides rigorous evaluation with quality and diversity through model-based and expert annotations. SCI-Verifier demonstrates strong logical reasoning and equivalence judgment capabilities while maintaining concise and stable outputs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers both systematic evaluation standards and practical solutions to enhance the reliability and applicability of LLMs in scientific domains through principled scientific verification.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific
reasoning, the complexity of answer formats and the diversity of equivalent
expressions make answer verification a critical yet challenging task. Existing
verification studies in scientific domains suffer from two major limitations:
(a) the absence of systematic evaluation standards and insufficient
disciplinary coverage, which hinders their comprehensive assessment; and (b)
heavy reliance on cumbersome rule design or prompt engineering, which reduces
their effectiveness in complex reasoning scenarios or limits their
cross-disciplinary generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
solutions at both the data and model levels. On the data side, we construct
SCI-VerifyBench, a cross-disciplinary benchmark covering mathematics, physics,
biology, chemistry, and general scientific QA. The benchmark is built from real
LLM responses and enhanced with domain-specific equivalence transformations
that generate challenging and realistic data. Model-based and expert
annotations ensure both quality and diversity, enabling rigorous evaluation of
verification ability. On the model side, we emphasize the importance of
reasoning for verification and introduce SCI-Verifier, a unified
reasoning-augmented verifier for scientific domains. Through post-training,
SCI-Verifier demonstrates strong logical reasoning and equivalence judgment
capabilities while maintaining concise and stable outputs. Together,
SCI-VerifyBench and SCI-Verifier provide a principled framework for scientific
verification, offering both systematic evaluation and practical pathways to
enhance the reliability and applicability of LLMs in scientific domains.

TL;DR: MedMMV is a controllable multimodal multi-agent framework that addresses instability and hallucination in medical AI systems by using diversified reasoning paths, evidence grounding, and uncertainty scoring to improve reliability and accuracy in clinical decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal large language models show promise in medical applications but suffer from critical instability in early evidence interpretation that leads to hallucination and inconsistent conclusions, highlighting the need for more reliable clinical reasoning agents.

Method: MedMMV stabilizes reasoning through diversified short rollouts, grounds intermediate steps in a structured evidence graph supervised by a Hallucination Detector, and aggregates candidate paths using a Combined Uncertainty scorer.

Result: On six medical benchmarks, MedMMV improves accuracy by up to 12.7% and demonstrates superior reliability. Blind physician evaluations confirm substantial increases in reasoning truthfulness without sacrificing informational content.

Conclusion: By controlling instability through a verifiable, multi-agent process, MedMMV provides a robust path toward deploying trustworthy AI systems in high-stakes clinical domains.

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has demonstrated
promising performance on medical benchmarks and in preliminary trials as
clinical assistants. Yet, our pilot audit of diagnostic cases uncovers a
critical failure mode: instability in early evidence interpretation precedes
hallucination, creating branching reasoning trajectories that cascade into
globally inconsistent conclusions. This highlights the need for clinical
reasoning agents that constrain stochasticity and hallucination while producing
auditable decision flows. We introduce MedMMV, a controllable multimodal
multi-agent framework for reliable and verifiable clinical reasoning. MedMMV
stabilizes reasoning through diversified short rollouts, grounds intermediate
steps in a structured evidence graph under the supervision of a Hallucination
Detector, and aggregates candidate paths with a Combined Uncertainty scorer. On
six medical benchmarks, MedMMV improves accuracy by up to 12.7% and, more
critically, demonstrates superior reliability. Blind physician evaluations
confirm that MedMMV substantially increases reasoning truthfulness without
sacrificing informational content. By controlling instability through a
verifiable, multi-agent process, our framework provides a robust path toward
deploying trustworthy AI systems in high-stakes domains like clinical decision
support.

TL;DR: Fin-Solution 2.O introduces Fin-Vault dataset and Fin-Ally model to address unprofessional responses in financial chatbots by integrating commonsense reasoning, politeness, and human-like conversation dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale fine-tuning of LLMs in FinTech can produce contextually inappropriate responses that erode user trust, and there's a scarcity of domain-specific datasets for comprehensive financial advisory systems.

Method: Created Fin-Vault dataset (1,417 annotated multi-turn dialogues) and developed Fin-Ally model using COMET-BART-embedded commonsense context with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for human-aligned responses.

Result: Incorporating commonsense context enables language models to generate more refined, textually precise, and professionally grounded financial guidance for personalized budgeting, expense tracking, and financial planning.

Conclusion: This approach represents a next-generation AI solution for FinTech that addresses the limitations of current chatbot systems through integrated commonsense reasoning and domain-specific training.

Abstract: The exponential technological breakthrough of the FinTech industry has
significantly enhanced user engagement through sophisticated advisory chatbots.
However, large-scale fine-tuning of LLMs can occasionally yield unprofessional
or flippant remarks, such as ``With that money, you're going to change the
world,'' which, though factually correct, can be contextually inappropriate and
erode user trust. The scarcity of domain-specific datasets has led previous
studies to focus on isolated components, such as reasoning-aware frameworks or
the enhancement of human-like response generation. To address this research
gap, we present Fin-Solution 2.O, an advanced solution that 1) introduces the
multi-turn financial conversational dataset, Fin-Vault, and 2) incorporates a
unified model, Fin-Ally, which integrates commonsense reasoning, politeness,
and human-like conversational dynamics. Fin-Ally is powered by
COMET-BART-embedded commonsense context and optimized with a Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) mechanism to generate human-aligned responses. The novel
Fin-Vault dataset, consisting of 1,417 annotated multi-turn dialogues, enables
Fin-Ally to extend beyond basic account management to provide personalized
budgeting, real-time expense tracking, and automated financial planning. Our
comprehensive results demonstrate that incorporating commonsense context
enables language models to generate more refined, textually precise, and
professionally grounded financial guidance, positioning this approach as a
next-generation AI solution for the FinTech sector. Dataset and codes are

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AMCS is an adaptive Monte Carlo search framework that improves process data generation for training Process Reward Models (PRMs) by dynamically allocating samples to uncertain reasoning steps and using adaptive exploration-exploitation policies, achieving state-of-the-art performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for process data generation use fixed-budget sampling strategies and navigate vast search spaces inefficiently, leading to inflexible and suboptimal data quality for training PRMs.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Monte Carlo Search (AMCS) that transforms data generation from static to adaptive search through: 1) adaptive node value estimation by allocating more samples to uncertain reasoning steps, and 2) enhanced path expansion using Monte Carlo algorithm with temporally adaptive policy that shifts from broad exploration to focused exploitation.

Result: Created MathSearch-200K dataset with ~200K process supervision examples. Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS achieved 76.2% accuracy on MATH500, outperforming all baseline PRMs. A 7B model supervised by AMCS surpassed a 72B model with weaker supervision, and maintained consistent advantages on out-of-distribution problems.

Conclusion: AMCS effectively addresses inefficiencies in process data generation for PRMs, demonstrating superior performance and strong generalization capabilities in mathematical reasoning tasks, with the adaptive approach proving more efficient than fixed-budget strategies.

Abstract: The quality of process data plays a key role in training a Process Reward
Model (PRM), which can enhance the complex mathematical reasoning capability of
large language models. Existing methods estimate the quality of reasoning steps
based on a fixed-budget sampling strategy and navigate a vast search space to
perform path expansion during the automated data generation process, resulting
in their inefficiency and inflexibility. To address these issues, we propose
Adaptive Monte Carlo Search (AMCS), a framework that transforms data generation
from fixed, static to adaptive, dynamic search at the level of node value
estimation and path expansion. On one hand, AMCS adaptively refines estimation
by allocating more samples to uncertain reasoning steps while using fewer
samples for those that are easier to estimate. On the other hand, it enhances
the path expansion through a Monte Carlo algorithm with a temporally adaptive
policy that begins with broad exploration and gradually shifts toward
exploiting the most promising directions. With AMCS, we construct a large-scale
dataset MathSearch-200K of about 200K process supervision examples for training
PRMs. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive
experiments on four mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results
show that Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS achieves up to 76.2% accuracy on MATH500
with GLM-4-9B, outperforming all baseline PRMs. Notably, a 7B model supervised
by Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS surpasses a 72B model with weaker supervision.
Moreover, Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS maintains consistent advantages on
out-of-distribution problems, demonstrating strong generalization capability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PRISM is a novel framework that adaptively routes mathematical reasoning tasks to optimal strategies through instance-specific modeling, outperforming fixed-strategy approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use fixed strategies that cannot adapt to problem-specific requirements, overlooking the trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency in mathematical reasoning.

Method: Decouples reasoning into strategy planning and targeted execution using a lightweight Strategy Adapter trained on a multi-strategy preference dataset (MathStrat), with adaptive routing based on confidence distributions.

Result: Consistently outperforms individual strategies and ensemble baselines across five benchmarks, achieving 0.9% to 7.6% improvements across different base models.

Conclusion: The adaptive routing approach shows strong benefits for mathematical reasoning tasks across diverse model architectures, providing a more flexible and effective alternative to fixed-strategy methods.

Abstract: Existing methods usually leverage a fixed strategy, such as natural language
reasoning, code-augmented reasoning, tool-integrated reasoning, or
ensemble-based reasoning, to guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform
mathematical reasoning. Our analysis reveals that the single strategy cannot
adapt to problem-specific requirements and thus overlooks the trade-off between
effectiveness and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Planning and
Routing through Instance-Specific Modeling (PRISM), a novel framework that
decouples mathematical reasoning into two stages: strategy planning and
targeted execution. Specifically, we first curate a multi-strategy preference
dataset, which we call MathStrat, capturing correctness, process quality, and
computational efficiency for each problem--strategy pair. Then, we train a
lightweight Strategy Adapter based on the dataset to obtain confidence
distributions over the mentioned four reasoning strategies. At inference time,
an adaptive routing policy dynamically tailors the reasoning approach based on
predictor confidence. It directs the model to use single-strategy execution for
high-confidence predictions, dual-strategy verification for competitive
scenarios, or comprehensive multi-strategy exploration for uncertain cases.
Extensive experiments across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
that PRISM consistently outperforms individual strategies and ensemble
baselines, achieving improvements ranging from 0.9% to 7.6% across different
base models. The adaptive routing approach shows particularly strong benefits
for mathematical reasoning tasks across diverse model architectures. Our code
is released at https://github.com/reml-group/PRISM.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Intervened Preference Optimization (IPO), a method to align Large Reasoning Models' chain-of-thought reasoning for safety by identifying critical safety triggers and replacing compliance steps, achieving significant harm reduction while maintaining reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Large Reasoning Models often contain harmful content in their chain-of-thought reasoning that persists even when final responses appear safe, posing trustworthiness issues and potential risks if exploited by malicious users. Existing methods overlook the importance of safe reasoning alignment.

Method: Intervened Preference Optimization (IPO) - an alignment method that enforces safe reasoning by: 1) identifying critical safety trigger steps, 2) substituting compliance steps that correlate with unsafe continuations with safety triggers, and 3) constructing preference learning pairs with strong training signals.

Result: IPO achieves over 30% relative reduction in harmfulness on jailbreak and adversarial safety benchmarks, outperforming SFT-based and RL-based baselines while preserving excellent performance across diverse reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The results highlight the importance of explicit alignment for reasoning safety and provide a practical path to safer Large Reasoning Models through process supervision and intervention-based preference optimization.

Abstract: Although Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have progressed in solving complex
problems, their chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning often contains harmful content
that can persist even when the final responses appear safe. We show that this
issue still remains in existing methods which overlook the unique significance
of safe reasoning, undermining their trustworthiness and posing potential risks
in applications if unsafe reasoning is accessible for and exploited by
malicious users. We therefore shift our focus to aligning the safety of
reasoning itself in this paper and explore process supervision as the solution.
However, simply rewarding safe reasoning proves inadequate due to low rollout
diversity and limited training signals. To tackle this challenge, we first
delve into the characteristics of safe reasoning and uncover several critical
insights that 1) safe reasoning is often consolidated by a few critical steps
of safety triggers; 2) compliance cues strongly correlate with unsafe
continuations; and 3) corrective interventions reliably steer unsafe
trajectories towards safer traces. Motivated by these, we propose Intervened
Preference Optimization (IPO), an alignment method that enforces safe reasoning
by substituting compliance steps with safety triggers and constructing pairs
for preference learning with strong signals. Experiments on jailbreak and
adversarial safety benchmarks demonstrate that IPO remarkably improves overall
safety regarding both reasoning and responses, outperforming SFT-based and
RL-based baselines with a relative reduction of over 30% in harmfulness, while
preserving excellent performance across diverse reasoning tasks. The results
highlight the importance of explicit alignment for reasoning and provide a
practical path to safer LRMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PRMs show strong mathematical reasoning gains but lack generalization to other domains due to domain-specific training data and knowledge-based learning patterns.

Method: Shift learning objective to model domain-agnostic logical flow, focusing on contextual coherence between chain-of-thought steps. Implement novel data annotation and training framework.

Result: ContextPRM achieves 6.5% average accuracy improvement over majority voting baseline across nine non-mathematical domains in MMLU-Pro, significantly outperforming mathematics-focused PRMs (2.2% for VersaPRM, 0.5% for others).

Conclusion: Focusing on domain-agnostic logical flow rather than domain-specific knowledge enables consistent performance across both mathematical and non-mathematical domains.

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) have demonstrated significant efficacy in
enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) by leveraging test-time scaling (TTS). However, while most PRMs exhibit
substantial gains in mathematical domains, the scarcity of domain-specific
training data and knowledge-based learning patterns limits their generalization
ability when faced with other domains. To address this limitation, we shift the
learning objective from verifying domain-specific knowledge to modeling
domain-agnostic logical flow. Centering on contextual coherence between
chain-of-thought (CoT) steps, our approach is realized through a novel data
annotation and training framework, which enhances the model's generalization
capabilities across diverse domains. For instance, our resulting model,
ContextPRM, achieves a notable 6.5% average accuracy improvement over the
majority voting baseline via weighted majority voting across nine
non-mathematical domains in MMLU-Pro, including law, history, and philosophy,
significantly surpassing the 2.2% improvement from VersaPRM and 0.5% gains from
other mathematics-focused PRMs, demonstrating consistent performance across
both mathematical and non-mathematical domains.

*Vasileios Balafas,Dimos Tsouros,Nikolaos Ploskas,Kostas Stergiou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hybrid constraint acquisition framework combining passive learning with interactive query-driven refinement to prevent over-fitting in data-limited scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual constraint modeling is a bottleneck, and existing passive CA methods over-fit with limited data while purely active methods are query-intensive.

Method: Integrates passive learning for candidate generation, query-driven refinement using probabilistic confidence scores, subset exploration to recover valid substructures, and final active learning for completeness.

Result: Achieves high target model coverage and accuracy from limited examples with manageable query complexity in diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: Represents substantial advancement towards robust and practical constraint acquisition in data-limited scenarios.

Abstract: Manual modeling in Constraint Programming is a substantial bottleneck, which
Constraint Acquisition (CA) aims to automate. However, passive CA methods are
prone to over-fitting, often learning models that include spurious global
constraints when trained on limited data, while purely active methods can be
query-intensive. We introduce a hybrid CA framework specifically designed to
address the challenge of over-fitting in CA. Our approach integrates passive
learning for initial candidate generation, a query-driven interactive
refinement phase that utilizes probabilistic confidence scores (initialized by
machine learning priors) to systematically identify over-fitted constraints,
and a specialized subset exploration mechanism to recover valid substructures
from rejected candidates. A final active learning phase ensures model
completeness. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our
interactive refinement phase is crucial for achieving high target model
coverage and overall model accuracy from limited examples, doing so with
manageable query complexity. This framework represents a substantial
advancement towards robust and practical constraint acquisition in data-limited
scenarios.

TL;DR: NMT-Net is a neuroplastic multi-task network for demand forecasting that dynamically adapts its structure during training, achieving better performance than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more adaptable and scalable solution for multi-task demand forecasting by enabling structural changes in the computational graph during training, inspired by biological neuroplasticity.

Method: Uses similarity-based task identification and selective training of candidate ANN heads, with dynamic network adaptation triggered by each new task and performance-based integration.

Result: Achieved superior performance with lower RMSE and standard deviation compared to traditional baselines and state-of-the-art multi-task learning methods on three real-world datasets.

Conclusion: NMT-Net provides a scalable, adaptable solution for multi-task and continual learning in time series prediction, with code publicly available.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to Dynamic Artificial Neural Networks
(D-ANNs) for multi-task demand forecasting called Neuroplastic Multi-Task
Network (NMT-Net). Unlike conventional methods focusing on inference-time
dynamics or computational efficiency, our proposed method enables structural
adaptability of the computational graph during training, inspired by
neuroplasticity as seen in biological systems. Each new task triggers a dynamic
network adaptation, including similarity-based task identification and
selective training of candidate ANN heads, which are then assessed and
integrated into the model based on their performance. We evaluated our
framework using three real-world multi-task demand forecasting datasets from
Kaggle. We demonstrated its superior performance and consistency, achieving
lower RMSE and standard deviation compared to traditional baselines and
state-of-the-art multi-task learning methods. NMT-Net offers a scalable,
adaptable solution for multi-task and continual learning in time series
prediction. The complete code for NMT-Net is available from our GitHub

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EvoPH is a novel framework that co-evolves prompts and heuristic algorithms using LLMs, integrating island migration and elite selection to avoid local optima in automatic algorithm design for combinatorial optimization problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional heuristic algorithms require extensive domain expertise and implementation effort. While LLM-powered automatic heuristics design shows promise, existing methods often stagnate in local optima.

Method: EvoPH integrates island migration model with elite selection algorithm to simulate diverse heuristics populations. It co-evolves prompts with heuristic algorithms guided by performance feedback.

Result: EvoPH achieves the lowest relative error against optimal solutions on Traveling Salesman Problem and Bin Packing Problem datasets compared to other methods.

Conclusion: The framework advances automatic algorithm design with LLMs by effectively preventing local optima stagnation through co-evolution of prompts and heuristics.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are traditionally tackled with
handcrafted heuristic algorithms, which demand extensive domain expertise and
significant implementation effort. Recent progress has highlighted the
potential of automatic heuristics design powered by large language models
(LLMs), enabling the automatic generation and refinement of heuristics. These
approaches typically maintain a population of heuristics and employ LLMs as
mutation operators to evolve them across generations. While effective, such
methods often risk stagnating in local optima. To address this issue, we
propose the Experience-Guided Reflective Co-Evolution of Prompt and Heuristics
(EvoPH) for automatic algorithm design, a novel framework that integrates the
island migration model with the elites selection algorithm to simulate diverse
heuristics populations. In EvoPH, prompts are co-evolved with heuristic
algorithms, guided by performance feedback. We evaluate our framework on two
problems, i.e., Traveling Salesman Problem and Bin Packing Problem.
Experimental results demonstrate that EvoPH achieves the lowest relative error
against optimal solutions across both datasets, advancing the field of
automatic algorithm design with LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous world models struggled with accurately predicting object interactions in complex environments, limiting their practical applications in domains like robotics where real-world interaction can be unsafe and slow.

Method: Uses a shortcut forcing objective and efficient transformer architecture for real-time interactive inference, learning general action conditioning from small amounts of data while extracting most knowledge from diverse unlabeled videos.

Result: Outperforms previous world models by a large margin in Minecraft, accurately predicting object interactions and game mechanics, and becomes the first agent to obtain diamonds in Minecraft purely from offline data without environment interaction.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable recipe for imagination training that marks a significant step towards developing intelligent agents capable of learning complex behaviors from offline data.

Abstract: World models learn general knowledge from videos and simulate experience for
training behaviors in imagination, offering a path towards intelligent agents.
However, previous world models have been unable to accurately predict object
interactions in complex environments. We introduce Dreamer 4, a scalable agent
that learns to solve control tasks by reinforcement learning inside of a fast
and accurate world model. In the complex video game Minecraft, the world model
accurately predicts object interactions and game mechanics, outperforming
previous world models by a large margin. The world model achieves real-time
interactive inference on a single GPU through a shortcut forcing objective and
an efficient transformer architecture. Moreover, the world model learns general
action conditioning from only a small amount of data, allowing it to extract
the majority of its knowledge from diverse unlabeled videos. We propose the
challenge of obtaining diamonds in Minecraft from only offline data, aligning
with practical applications such as robotics where learning from environment
interaction can be unsafe and slow. This task requires choosing sequences of
over 20,000 mouse and keyboard actions from raw pixels. By learning behaviors
in imagination, Dreamer 4 is the first agent to obtain diamonds in Minecraft
purely from offline data, without environment interaction. Our work provides a
scalable recipe for imagination training, marking a step towards intelligent
agents.

*Nikolaos Kondylidis,Andrea Rafanelli,Ilaria Tiddi,Annette ten Teije,Frank van Harmelen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a human-agent teaching architecture where humans can teach AI agents subjective tasks through demonstrations, focusing on efficient learning from few examples using domain knowledge and strategic example selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To replicate human-like quick learning from few examples in AI systems, especially for subjective tasks where data is scarce, by creating an intuitive teaching interaction.

Method: Human-agent teaching architecture using demonstrations, leveraging domain knowledge for broader task understanding, efficient learning methods for few-shot learning, and optimization of example selection for representativeness and minimal redundancy.

Result: Applied to ingredient substitution task, the agent achieved half its task performance with only 100 examples compared to full 50k training set, showing efficient generalization through strategic example ordering and external symbolic knowledge.

Conclusion: Strategic example selection combined with learning methods that leverage external knowledge enables AI agents to generalize efficiently from limited examples in subjective tasks.

Abstract: Humans quickly learn new concepts from a small number of examples.
Replicating this capacity with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems has proven
to be challenging. When it comes to learning subjective tasks-where there is an
evident scarcity of data-this capacity needs to be recreated. In this work, we
propose an intuitive human-agent teaching architecture in which the human can
teach an agent how to perform a task by providing demonstrations, i.e.,
examples. To have an intuitive interaction, we argue that the agent should be
able to learn incrementally from a few single examples. To allow for this, our
objective is to broaden the agent's task understanding using domain knowledge.
Then, using a learning method to enable the agent to learn efficiently from a
limited number of examples. Finally, to optimize how human can select the most
representative and less redundant examples to provide the agent with. We apply
our proposed method to the subjective task of ingredient substitution, where
the agent needs to learn how to substitute ingredients in recipes based on
human examples. We replicate human input using the Recipe1MSubs dataset. In our
experiments, the agent achieves half its task performance after only 100
examples are provided, compared to the complete training set of 50k examples.
We show that by providing examples in strategic order along with a learning
method that leverages external symbolic knowledge, the agent can generalize
more efficiently.

*Nikolaos Kondylidis,Anil Yaman,Frank van Harmelen,Erman Acar,Annette ten Teije*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether successful coordination through communication necessarily implies mutual understanding. Using signaling games where agents develop new vocabularies without observing others' signal usage, the research reveals that populations can achieve optimal coordination while maintaining different interpretations of signals - a phenomenon called 'successful misunderstandings'.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that successful coordination through communication implies mutual understanding, particularly in hybrid populations (humans and AI agents) with different environmental perceptions.

Method: The study uses signaling games where agents develop new vocabularies without common observations beyond communication signals and interaction outcomes. Agents develop signals, use them, and refine interpretations while not observing how other agents are using the signals.

Result: While populations always converge to optimal coordination levels, they sometimes develop 'successful misunderstandings' where agents coordinate effectively despite having different interpretations of signals. These agents fail to coordinate with new partners. Having at least three interacting agents ensures shared interpretations emerge.

Conclusion: Successful coordination does not guarantee mutual understanding. At least three interacting agents are needed to ensure shared interpretations emerge, compensating for the lack of shared observations of signal usage.

Abstract: The main approach to evaluating communication is by assessing how well it
facilitates coordination. If two or more individuals can coordinate through
communication, it is generally assumed that they understand one another. We
investigate this assumption in a signaling game where individuals develop a new
vocabulary of signals to coordinate successfully. In our game, the individuals
do not have common observations besides the communication signal and outcome of
the interaction, i.e. received reward. This setting is used as a proxy to study
communication emergence in populations of agents that perceive their
environment very differently, e.g. hybrid populations that include humans and
artificial agents. Agents develop signals, use them, and refine interpretations
while not observing how other agents are using them. While populations always
converge to optimal levels of coordination, in some cases, interacting agents
interpret and use signals differently, converging to what we call successful
misunderstandings. However, agents of population that coordinate using
misaligned interpretations, are unable to establish successful coordination
with new interaction partners. Not leading to coordination failure immediately,
successful misunderstandings are difficult to spot and repair. Having at least
three agents that all interact with each other are the two minimum conditions
to ensure the emergence of shared interpretations. Under these conditions, the
agent population exhibits this emergent property of compensating for the lack
of shared observations of signal use, ensuring the emergence of shared
interpretations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LRMs can detect their capability boundaries through reasoning confidence patterns and hidden states, enabling boundary-aware strategies that cut token usage by 62.7-93.6% while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LRMs waste computation on unsolvable problems by engaging in unproductive reasoning until context limit, highlighting the need for self-awareness of capability boundaries.

Method: Two monitoring approaches: 1) Reasoning expression monitoring using confidence trajectories, 2) Hidden states monitoring using linear separability of solvable/unsolvable problems in white-box models.

Result: Boundary-aware strategies successfully avoid unproductive reasoning, significantly reducing token usage by 62.7-93.6% without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: LRMs possess inherent boundary awareness that can be leveraged to improve reliability and efficiency through simple monitoring strategies.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks such as mathematics, yet they also display misbehaviors that
expose their limitations. In particular, when faced with hard questions, LRMs
often engage in unproductive reasoning until context limit, producing wrong
answers while wasting substantial computation. This phenomenon reflects a
fundamental issue: current answering paradigms overlook the relationship
between questions and LRMs' capability boundaries. In this paper, we
investigate whether LRMs possess self-awareness of capability boundaries. We
begin by an observation that LRMs may know what they cannot solve through
expressed reasoning confidence. For black-box models, we find that reasoning
expressions reveal boundary signals, with accelerated growing confidence
trajectory for solvable problems but convergent uncertainty trajectory for
unsolvable ones. For white-box models, we show that hidden states of the last
input token encode boundary information, with solvable and unsolvable problems
linearly separable even before reasoning begins. Building on these findings, we
propose two simple yet effective optimization strategies: reasoning expression
monitoring and hidden states monitoring. Experiments demonstrate that these
boundary-aware strategies enable LRMs to avoid unproductive reasoning without
sacrificing accuracy, significantly improving reliability and efficiency by
cutting token usage up to 62.7 - 93.6%.

Motivation: EEG signals are high-dimensional, noisy, and non-Euclidean, making visual neural representation decoding challenging. Need to address spatial brain connectivity, temporal dynamics, and high intra-subject variability.

Method: SFTG framework with EEG Graph Transformer (EGT) for spatial-temporal encoding and Graph Archetype Contrastive Learning (GAC) for learning subject-specific EEG graph archetypes to improve feature consistency.

Result: Significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art EEG decoding methods on Things-EEG dataset in both subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluations.

Conclusion: Integration of graph-based learning with contrastive objectives shows transformative potential for enhancing EEG-based brain decoding, enabling more generalizable and robust neural representations.

Abstract: Decoding visual neural representations from Electroencephalography (EEG)

simultaneously encodes spatial brain connectivity and temporal neural dynamics.
To mitigate high intra-subject variability, we propose Graph Archetype

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LogicAgent is a semiotic-square-guided framework that addresses both logical and semantic complexity in LLM reasoning, using multi-perspective FOL deduction with existential import checks and a three-valued decision scheme. It achieves SOTA performance on the new RepublicQA benchmark and generalizes well to other reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook the interplay between logical complexity and semantic complexity, struggling with abstract propositions, ambiguous contexts, and conflicting stances that are central to human reasoning.

Method: Proposes LogicAgent framework with semiotic-square guidance, multi-perspective first-order logic deduction, existential import checks, and three-valued decision scheme (True, False, Uncertain) to handle boundary cases.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on RepublicQA with 6.25% average gain over baselines, and generalizes effectively to other benchmarks (ProntoQA, ProofWriter, FOLIO, ProverQA) with additional 7.05% average gain.

Conclusion: The semiotic-grounded multi-perspective reasoning approach significantly boosts LLMs' logical performance, demonstrating strong effectiveness in handling complex logical and semantic challenges.

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a fundamental capability of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing studies largely overlook the interplay between
logical complexity and semantic complexity, resulting in methods that struggle
to address challenging scenarios involving abstract propositions, ambiguous
contexts, and conflicting stances, which are central to human reasoning. For
this gap, we propose LogicAgent, a semiotic-square-guided framework designed to
jointly address logical complexity and semantic complexity. LogicAgent
explicitly performs multi-perspective deduction in first-order logic (FOL),
while mitigating vacuous reasoning through existential import checks that
incorporate a three-valued decision scheme (True, False, Uncertain) to handle
boundary cases more faithfully. Furthermore, to overcome the semantic
simplicity and low logical complexity of existing datasets, we introduce
RepublicQA, a benchmark that reaches college-level difficulty (FKGL = 11.94)
and exhibits substantially greater lexical and structural diversity than prior
benchmarks. RepublicQA is grounded in philosophical concepts, featuring
abstract propositions and systematically organized contrary and contradictory
relations, making it the most semantically rich resource for evaluating logical
reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that LogicAgent achieves state-of-the-art
performance on RepublicQA, with a 6.25% average gain over strong baselines, and
generalizes effectively to mainstream logical reasoning benchmarks including
ProntoQA, ProofWriter, FOLIO, and ProverQA, achieving an additional 7.05%
average gain. These results highlight the strong effectiveness of our
semiotic-grounded multi-perspective reasoning in boosting LLMs' logical
performance.

TL;DR: TSR-Suite introduces four atomic tasks for time series reasoning across perception, extrapolation, and decision-making capabilities, with TimeOmni-1 model showing strong generalization and outperforming GPT-4.1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal time series datasets lack genuine reasoning depth, limiting progress in practical time series reasoning models due to absence of well-defined reasoning tasks and high-quality data.

Method: Introduces TSR-Suite with four atomic tasks spanning perception (scenario understanding, causality discovery), extrapolation (event-aware forecasting), and decision-making. Develops TimeOmni-1 model trained with multi-stage approach using mixture of task scenarios, novel reward functions, and tailored optimizations.

Result: TimeOmni-1 achieves strong out-of-distribution generalization across all tasks with high valid response rates. Significantly improves causality discovery accuracy (64.0% vs 35.9% with GPT-4.1) and increases valid response rate by over 6% compared to GPT-4.1 on event-aware forecasting.

Conclusion: TSR-Suite provides the first comprehensive framework for time series reasoning evaluation and model development, with TimeOmni-1 demonstrating superior performance over existing models in genuine time series reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal time series learning underscore a paradigm
shift from analytics centered on basic patterns toward advanced time series
understanding and reasoning. However, existing multimodal time series datasets
mostly remain at the level of surface alignment and question answering, without
reaching the depth of genuine reasoning. The absence of well-defined tasks that
genuinely require time series reasoning, along with the scarcity of
high-quality data, has limited progress in building practical time series
reasoning models (TSRMs). To this end, we introduce Time Series Reasoning Suite
(TSR-Suite), which formalizes four atomic tasks that span three fundamental
capabilities for reasoning with time series: (1) perception, acquired through
scenario understanding and causality discovery; (2) extrapolation, realized via
event-aware forecasting; and (3) decision-making, developed through
deliberation over perception and extrapolation. TSR-Suite is the first
comprehensive time series reasoning suite that supports not only thorough
evaluation but also the data pipeline and training of TSRMs. It contains more
than 23K samples, of which 2.3K are carefully curated through a human-guided
hierarchical annotation process. Building on this foundation, we introduce
TimeOmni-1, the first unified reasoning model designed to address diverse
real-world problems demanding time series reasoning. The model is trained in
multiple stages, integrating a mixture of task scenarios, novel reward
functions, and tailored optimizations. Experiments show that TimeOmni-1
delivers strong out-of-distribution generalization across all tasks and
achieves a high rate of valid responses. It significantly improves causality
discovery accuracy (64.0% vs. 35.9% with GPT-4.1) and raises the valid response
rate by over 6% compared to GPT-4.1 on the event-aware forecasting task.

*Tung-Yu Wu,Fazl Barez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Query circuits are introduced as a method to trace specific input-output information flow in language models, providing more faithful explanations than global capability circuits or surrogate-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods only uncover global capability circuits but fail to explain why models produce specific outputs for particular inputs, creating a need for input-level explanations.

Method: Developed query circuits that directly trace information flow within models, introduced Normalized Deviation Faithfulness (NDF) metric for evaluation, and used sampling-based methods to identify sparse yet faithful circuits.

Result: Found extremely sparse query circuits covering only 1.3% of model connections can recover about 60% of performance on MMLU questions, demonstrating effectiveness across multiple benchmarks (IOI, arithmetic, MMLU, ARC).

Conclusion: Query circuits provide a step towards faithful, scalable explanations of how language models process individual inputs, offering more computationally accessible and accurate explanations than existing methods.

Abstract: Explaining why a language model produces a particular output requires local,
input-level explanations. Existing methods uncover global capability circuits
(e.g., indirect object identification), but not why the model answers a
specific input query in a particular way. We introduce query circuits, which
directly trace the information flow inside a model that maps a specific input
to the output. Unlike surrogate-based approaches (e.g., sparse autoencoders),
query circuits are identified within the model itself, resulting in more
faithful and computationally accessible explanations. To make query circuits
practical, we address two challenges. First, we introduce Normalized Deviation
Faithfulness (NDF), a robust metric to evaluate how well a discovered circuit
recovers the model's decision for a specific input, and is broadly applicable
to circuit discovery beyond our setting. Second, we develop sampling-based
methods to efficiently identify circuits that are sparse yet faithfully
describe the model's behavior. Across benchmarks (IOI, arithmetic, MMLU, and
ARC), we find that there exist extremely sparse query circuits within the model
that can recover much of its performance on single queries. For example, a
circuit covering only 1.3% of model connections can recover about 60% of
performance on an MMLU questions. Overall, query circuits provide a step
towards faithful, scalable explanations of how language models process
individual inputs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI) to measure logical reasoning complexity in training data and proposes a re-cognizing optimization strategy that enhances reasoning intensity rather than increasing data volume, significantly improving LLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches focus on data format transformation but neglect internal reasoning complexity, leaving reasoning potential under-explored. The authors posit that LLM reasoning performance is constrained by both data potential and model cognitive capacity.

Method: Introduces Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI) metric to quantify logical reasoning complexity by decomposing and aggregating logical structures. Proposes a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances logical reasoning intensity of existing training data to better align with LLM's reasoning boundary.

Result: Extensive experiments show significant performance and generalization improvements over data-centric strategies. Method was also validated under reinforcement learning framework, demonstrating effectiveness across different training paradigms.

Conclusion: Prioritizing reasoning complexity in data rather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs' full cognitive potential. The approach shifts focus from data quantity to reasoning quality for better utilization of LLM capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight the importance of
training data structure and quality in shaping reasoning behavior. However,
most existing approaches focus on transforming data formats while neglecting
the internal reasoning complexity of training samples, leaving the reasoning
potential of data under-explored and underutilized. In this work, we posit that
LLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of
the training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this
relationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel
metric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by
decomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze
how well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify
performance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we
introduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the
logical reasoning intensity of training data.Rather than increasing data
volume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's
logical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach
significantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric
strategies. We further validate our method under a reinforcement learning
framework. Our results indicate that prioritizing reasoning complexity in data
rather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs'
full cognitive potential.

*Fangchen Yu,Junchi Yao,Ziyi Wang,Haiyuan Wan,Youling Huang,Bo Zhang,Shuyue Hu,Dongzhan Zhou,Ning Ding,Ganqu Cui,Lei Bai,Wanli Ouyang,Peng Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PhysicsMinions is a coevolutionary multi-agent system that achieves state-of-the-art performance on Physics Olympiad problems by combining visual interpretation, logical reasoning, and dual-stage verification through three synergistic studios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics Olympiads represent the pinnacle of competitive physics problem-solving but remain largely unexplored in AI research, with existing single-model approaches failing to reach gold-medal-level performance.

Method: A three-studio architecture: Visual Studio for diagram interpretation, Logic Studio for solution formulation, and Review Studio for dual-stage verification, all working in a coevolutionary iterative refinement loop where feedback guides self-correction.

Result: Achieves three major breakthroughs: strong generalization across model sizes, elevates open-source models from 1-2 to 6 gold medals across 7 Olympiads, and advances open-source performance to rank 4th out of 406 contestants on the latest IPhO.

Conclusion: PhysicsMinions provides a generalizable framework for Olympiad-level problem solving that can potentially extend across disciplines, demonstrating the power of multi-agent coevolutionary systems for complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Physics is central to understanding and shaping the real world, and the
ability to solve physics problems is a key indicator of real-world physical
intelligence. Physics Olympiads, renowned as the crown of competitive physics,
provide a rigorous testbed requiring complex reasoning and deep multimodal
understanding, yet they remain largely underexplored in AI research. Existing
approaches are predominantly single-model based, and open-source MLLMs rarely
reach gold-medal-level performance. To address this gap, we propose
PhysicsMinions, a coevolutionary multi-agent system for Physics Olympiad. Its
architecture features three synergistic studios: a Visual Studio to interpret
diagrams, a Logic Studio to formulate solutions, and a Review Studio to perform
dual-stage verification. The system coevolves through an iterative refinement
loop where feedback from the Review Studio continuously guides the Logic
Studio, enabling the system to self-correct and converge towards the ground
truth. Evaluated on the HiPhO benchmark spanning 7 latest physics Olympiads,
PhysicsMinions delivers three major breakthroughs: (i) Strong generalization:
it consistently improves both open-source and closed-source models of different
sizes, delivering clear benefits over their single-model baselines; (ii)
Historic breakthroughs: it elevates open-source models from only 1-2 to 6 gold
medals across 7 Olympiads, achieving the first-ever open-source gold medal in
the latest International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) under the average-score
metric; and (iii) Scaling to human expert: it further advances the open-source
Pass@32 score to 26.8/30 points on the latest IPhO, ranking 4th of 406
contestants and far surpassing the top single-model score of 22.7 (ranked
22nd). Generally, PhysicsMinions offers a generalizable framework for
Olympiad-level problem solving, with the potential to extend across
disciplines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A systematic review of 270 studies on the social science of large language models (LLMs) using computational methods to create a taxonomy that organizes research into three domains: LLM as Social Minds, LLM Societies, and LLM-Human Interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragmented nature of research on LLMs' social dimensions and provide a systematic framework for understanding how these systems evoke mind attributions, interact with each other, and transform human activity and institutions.

Method: Conducted a systematic review of 270 studies using text embeddings, unsupervised clustering, and topic modeling to build a computational taxonomy of the field.

Result: Identified three main domains: (1) LLM as Social Minds - examining cognition, morality and bias attributions; (2) LLM Societies - multi-agent interactions and collective processes; (3) LLM-Human Interactions - impacts on tasks, learning, trust, work and governance.

Conclusion: The taxonomy provides a reproducible map of the fragmented field, clarifies evidentiary standards across analysis levels, and highlights opportunities for cumulative progress in the social science of artificial intelligence.

Abstract: The social science of large language models (LLMs) examines how these systems
evoke mind attributions, interact with one another, and transform human
activity and institutions. We conducted a systematic review of 270 studies,
combining text embeddings, unsupervised clustering and topic modeling to build
a computational taxonomy. Three domains emerge organically across the reviewed
literature. LLM as Social Minds examines whether and when models display
behaviors that elicit attributions of cognition, morality and bias, while
addressing challenges such as test leakage and surface cues. LLM Societies
examines multi-agent settings where interaction protocols, architectures and
mechanism design shape coordination, norms, institutions and collective
epistemic processes. LLM-Human Interactions examines how LLMs reshape tasks,
learning, trust, work and governance, and how risks arise at the human-AI
interface. This taxonomy provides a reproducible map of a fragmented field,
clarifies evidentiary standards across levels of analysis, and highlights
opportunities for cumulative progress in the social science of artificial
intelligence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RealUnify is a benchmark for evaluating bidirectional capability synergy in unified multimodal models, testing whether understanding enhances generation and vice versa, revealing current models struggle with effective synergy despite architectural unification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks only assess understanding and generation in isolation, failing to determine if unified models can leverage their constituent capabilities synergistically (understanding enhancing generation and generation enhancing understanding).

Method: Created RealUnify benchmark with 1,000 human-annotated instances across 10 categories and 32 subtasks, featuring dual-evaluation protocol combining end-to-end assessment with diagnostic stepwise evaluation to identify performance bottlenecks.

Result: Evaluation of 12 leading unified models and 6 specialized baselines shows current unified models still struggle to achieve effective capability synergy, indicating architectural unification alone is insufficient.

Conclusion: New training strategies and inductive biases are needed to fully unlock the potential of unified multimodal modeling beyond mere architectural unification.

Abstract: The integration of visual understanding and generation into unified
multimodal models represents a significant stride toward general-purpose AI.
However, a fundamental question remains unanswered by existing benchmarks: does
this architectural unification actually enable synergetic interaction between
the constituent capabilities? Existing evaluation paradigms, which primarily
assess understanding and generation in isolation, are insufficient for
determining whether a unified model can leverage its understanding to enhance
its generation, or use generative simulation to facilitate deeper
comprehension. To address this critical gap, we introduce RealUnify, a
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate bidirectional capability synergy.
RealUnify comprises 1,000 meticulously human-annotated instances spanning 10
categories and 32 subtasks. It is structured around two core axes: 1)
Understanding Enhances Generation, which requires reasoning (e.g., commonsense,
logic) to guide image generation, and 2) Generation Enhances Understanding,
which necessitates mental simulation or reconstruction (e.g., of transformed or
disordered visual inputs) to solve reasoning tasks. A key contribution is our
dual-evaluation protocol, which combines direct end-to-end assessment with a
diagnostic stepwise evaluation that decomposes tasks into distinct
understanding and generation phases. This protocol allows us to precisely
discern whether performance bottlenecks stem from deficiencies in core
abilities or from a failure to integrate them. Through large-scale evaluations
of 12 leading unified models and 6 specialized baselines, we find that current
unified models still struggle to achieve effective synergy, indicating that
architectural unification alone is insufficient. These results highlight the
need for new training strategies and inductive biases to fully unlock the
potential of unified modeling.

*Max Pellert,Clemens M. Lechner,Indira Sen,Markus Strohmaier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SQuID enables neural embeddings to recover latent psychometric dimensions from survey items, achieving 55% variance explained compared to human data without domain-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a scalable and cost-effective alternative to traditional human surveys for psychometric measurement while maintaining comparable quality.

Method: Uses SQuID approach with large language model embeddings to process psychometric survey items from PVQ-RR, comparing multiple embedding models across various evaluation metrics.

Result: Embeddings explain 55% of variance in dimension-dimension similarities compared to human data, with fair factor congruence coefficients and alignment with underlying theory.

Conclusion: Semantic embeddings can effectively replicate psychometric structures, offering advantages in cost, scalability and flexibility while maintaining quality comparable to traditional methods.

Abstract: This study introduces "Survey and Questionnaire Item Embeddings
Differentials" (SQuID), a novel methodological approach that enables neural
network embeddings to effectively recover latent dimensions from psychometric
survey items. We demonstrate that embeddings derived from large language
models, when processed with SQuID, can recover the structure of human values
obtained from human rater judgments on the Revised Portrait Value Questionnaire
(PVQ-RR). Our experimental validation compares multiple embedding models across
a number of evaluation metrics. Unlike previous approaches, SQuID successfully
addresses the challenge of obtaining negative correlations between dimensions
without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning. Quantitative analysis reveals
that our embedding-based approach explains 55% of variance in
dimension-dimension similarities compared to human data. Multidimensional
scaling configurations from both types of data show fair factor congruence
coefficients and largely follow the underlying theory. These results
demonstrate that semantic embeddings can effectively replicate psychometric
structures previously established through extensive human surveys. The approach
offers substantial advantages in cost, scalability and flexibility while
maintaining comparable quality to traditional methods. Our findings have
significant implications for psychometrics and social science research,
providing a complementary methodology that could expand the scope of human
behavior and experience represented in measurement tools.

TL;DR: A Bayesian meta-learning framework that converts normative theories into probabilistic models using adaptive deep kernel Gaussian processes, improving data fitting and theory validation in biological systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the laborious process of arbitrating between competing normative theories and using them as inductive biases in data-driven biological research, enabling automated integration of theoretical knowledge.

Method: Meta-learning a kernel on synthetic data generated from normative theories using adaptive deep kernel Gaussian processes, creating Theory-Informed Kernels that specify probabilistic models.

Result: Improved response prediction accuracy in mouse retinal ganglion cells with natural scene stimuli, well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, interpretable representations, and accurate theory-match inference through Bayesian model selection.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable, automated approach for integrating theoretical knowledge into data-driven scientific inquiry, successfully demonstrated in neuroscience applications.

Abstract: Normative and task-driven theories offer powerful top-down explanations for
biological systems, yet the goals of quantitatively arbitrating between
competing theories, and utilizing them as inductive biases to improve
data-driven fits of real biological datasets are prohibitively laborious, and
often impossible. To this end, we introduce a Bayesian meta-learning framework
designed to automatically convert raw functional predictions from normative
theories into tractable probabilistic models. We employ adaptive deep kernel
Gaussian processes, meta-learning a kernel on synthetic data generated from a
normative theory. This Theory-Informed Kernel specifies a probabilistic model
representing the theory predictions -- usable for both fitting data and
rigorously validating the theory. As a demonstration, we apply our framework to
the early visual system, using efficient coding as our normative theory. We
show improved response prediction accuracy in ex vivo recordings of mouse
retinal ganglion cells stimulated by natural scenes compared to conventional
data-driven baselines, while providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates
and interpretable representations. Using exact Bayesian model selection, we
also show that our informed kernel can accurately infer the degree of
theory-match from data, confirming faithful encapsulation of theory structure.
This work provides a more general, scalable, and automated approach for
integrating theoretical knowledge into data-driven scientific inquiry in
neuroscience and beyond.

TL;DR: MASLegalBench is a legal benchmark for multi-agent systems using GDPR scenarios to evaluate LLM-based agents' capabilities in legal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing legal benchmarks don't leverage MAS advantages like task decomposition and agent specialization, limiting MAS potential in legal domain.

Method: Proposed MASLegalBench with GDPR scenarios, manually designed role-based MAS, and conducted experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: Identified strengths, limitations, and improvement areas for existing models and MAS architectures in legal reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: MASLegalBench effectively evaluates MAS capabilities in legal domain and provides insights for future improvements.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS), leveraging the remarkable capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), show great potential in addressing complex tasks. In
this context, integrating MAS with legal tasks is a crucial step. While
previous studies have developed legal benchmarks for LLM agents, none are
specifically designed to consider the unique advantages of MAS, such as task
decomposition, agent specialization, and flexible training. In fact, the lack
of evaluation methods limits the potential of MAS in the legal domain. To
address this gap, we propose MASLegalBench, a legal benchmark tailored for MAS
and designed with a deductive reasoning approach. Our benchmark uses GDPR as
the application scenario, encompassing extensive background knowledge and
covering complex reasoning processes that effectively reflect the intricacies
of real-world legal situations. Furthermore, we manually design various
role-based MAS and conduct extensive experiments using different
state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results highlight the strengths, limitations, and
potential areas for improvement of existing models and MAS architectures.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper conducts an empirical study on V2X cooperative perception systems, identifying six prevalent error patterns and evaluating critical components through large-scale analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: V2X cooperative perception systems face complex operational challenges due to diverse sensors, fusion schemes, and communication conditions, with insufficient understanding of error types and causes when systems produce erroneous predictions.

Method: Conducted systematic evaluation of V2X cooperative perception systems through large-scale study, analyzing six prevalent error patterns and assessing critical components including LiDAR-based cooperation, V2I/V2V communication, and robustness against communication interference.

Result: Key findings: (1) LiDAR-based cooperation has highest perception performance; (2) V2I and V2V show distinct performance under different fusion schemes; (3) Increased cooperative perception errors lead to more driving violations; (4) Systems lack robustness against online communication interference.

Conclusion: The study reveals potential risks and vulnerabilities in cooperative perception systems, providing insights to promote better design and repair of these critical systems.

Abstract: With the tremendous advancement of deep learning and communication
technology, Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception has the
potential to address limitations in sensing distant objects and occlusion for a
single-agent perception system. V2X cooperative perception systems are software
systems characterized by diverse sensor types and cooperative agents, varying
fusion schemes, and operation under different communication conditions.
Therefore, their complex composition gives rise to numerous operational
challenges. Furthermore, when cooperative perception systems produce erroneous
predictions, the types of errors and their underlying causes remain
insufficiently explored. To bridge this gap, we take an initial step by
conducting an empirical study of V2X cooperative perception. To systematically
evaluate the impact of cooperative perception on the ego vehicle's perception
performance, we identify and analyze six prevalent error patterns in
cooperative perception systems. We further conduct a systematic evaluation of
the critical components of these systems through our large-scale study and
identify the following key findings: (1) The LiDAR-based cooperation
configuration exhibits the highest perception performance; (2)
Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication
exhibit distinct cooperative perception performance under different fusion
schemes; (3) Increased cooperative perception errors may result in a higher
frequency of driving violations; (4) Cooperative perception systems are not
robust against communication interference when running online. Our results
reveal potential risks and vulnerabilities in critical components of
cooperative perception systems. We hope that our findings can better promote
the design and repair of cooperative perception systems.

TL;DR: SciExplorer is an AI agent that uses large language models to autonomously explore and discover scientific laws in unknown physical systems without task-specific instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fully automate the scientific discovery process by enabling free-form exploration of unknown systems without domain-specific blueprints or task tailoring.

Method: Uses large language model tool-use capabilities with minimal tools (primarily code execution) to explore physical systems through experiments and analysis in an iterative loop.

Result: Demonstrated impressive performance in recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring Hamiltonians from expectation values across mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution, and quantum many-body physics.

Conclusion: The approach enables effective scientific exploration across domains without finetuning or task-specific instructions, opening doors to broader automated scientific discovery.

Abstract: The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations,
analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being
adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an
open challenge to fully automate the open-ended, heuristic, iterative loop
required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through
experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a
given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large
language model tool-use capabilities to enable free-form exploration of systems
without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to the exploration of
physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer
on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution,
and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily
based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as
recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring
Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this
setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains,
without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.

TL;DR: CLPO introduces a curriculum-guided learning approach for RLVR that dynamically assesses problem difficulty and adapts training samples to match the model's current capabilities, improving learning efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods treat all training samples uniformly, failing to account for varying problem difficulty relative to model capabilities, leading to inefficient exploration and limited upper-bound performance.

Method: CLPO creates a dynamic pedagogical feedback loop using the model's rollout performance for real-time difficulty assessment, constructs an Online Curriculum, and implements Adaptive Problem Restructuring where the model diversifies medium-difficulty problems and simplifies challenging ones.

Result: CLPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks with an average pass@1 improvement of 6.96% over other methods.

Conclusion: CLPO transforms static training into a dynamic process co-evolving with model capabilities, demonstrating potential for more efficient training of reasoning models.

Abstract: Recently, online Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has
become a key paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs). However, existing methods typically treat all training
samples uniformly, overlooking the vast differences in problem difficulty
relative to the model's current capabilities. This uniform training strategy
leads to inefficient exploration of problems the model has already mastered,
while concurrently lacking effective guidance on problems that are challenging
its abilities the most, limiting both learning efficiency and upper-bound
performance. To address this, we propose CLPO (Curriculum-guided Learning for
Policy Optimization), a novel algorithm that creates a dynamic pedagogical
feedback loop within the policy optimization process. The core of CLPO
leverages the model's own rollout performance to conduct real-time difficulty
assessment, thereby constructing an Online Curriculum. This curriculum then
guides an Adaptive Problem Restructuring mechanism, where the model acts as its
own teacher: it diversifies medium-difficulty problems to promote
generalization and simplifies challenging problems to make them more
attainable. Our approach transforms the static training procedure into a
dynamic process that co-evolves with the model's capabilities. Experiments show
that CLPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight challenging
mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks, with an average pass@1
improvement of 6.96% over other methods, demonstrating its potential for more
efficiently training more capable reasoning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of high-quality downstream agentic task datasets that are diverse, feasible, and verifiable poses a key challenge in scaling post-training of MLLMs for interactive applications like computer-use, web navigation, and robotics.

Method: AutoPlay operates in two stages: (1) exploration phase where an MLLM explorer agent systematically uncovers novel environment states and functionalities, and (2) task generation phase where a task generator uses exploration trajectories and task guideline prompts to synthesize diverse, executable, and verifiable tasks.

Result: AutoPlay generated 20k tasks across 20 Android applications and 10k tasks across 13 Ubuntu applications, enabling training of MLLM-based UI agents that improved success rates by up to 20.0% on mobile-use and 10.9% on computer-use scenarios, with additional 5.7% gain when combined with reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: AutoPlay establishes itself as a scalable approach for post-training capable MLLM agents, significantly reducing reliance on human annotation while enabling large-scale task demonstration synthesis.

Abstract: Post-Training Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to build interactive
agents holds promise across domains such as computer-use, web navigation, and
robotics. A key challenge in scaling such post-training is lack of high-quality
downstream agentic task datasets with tasks that are diverse, feasible, and
verifiable. Existing approaches for task generation rely heavily on human
annotation or prompting MLLM with limited downstream environment information,
which is either costly or poorly scalable as it yield tasks with limited
coverage. To remedy this, we present AutoPlay, a scalable pipeline for task
generation that explicitly explores interactive environments to discover
possible interactions and current state information to synthesize
environment-grounded tasks. AutoPlay operates in two stages: (i) an exploration
phase, where an MLLM explorer agent systematically uncovers novel environment
states and functionalities, and (ii) a task generation phase, where a task
generator leverages exploration trajectories and a set of task guideline
prompts as context to synthesize diverse, executable, and verifiable tasks. We
show AutoPlay generates 20k tasks across 20 Android applications and 10k tasks
across 13 applications Ubuntu applications to train mobile-use and computer-use
agents. AutoPlay generated tasks enable large-scale task demonstration
synthesis without human annotation by employing an MLLM task executor and
verifier. This data enables training MLLM-based UI agents that improve success
rates up to $20.0\%$ on mobile-use and $10.9\%$ on computer-use scenarios. In
addition, AutoPlay generated tasks combined with MLLM verifier-based rewards
enable scaling reinforcement learning training of UI agents, leading to an
additional $5.7\%$ gain. coverage. These results establish AutoPlay as a
scalable approach for post-training capable MLLM agents reducing reliance on
human annotation.

TL;DR: CEL is a novel agent architecture that uses LLMs to learn game rules and strategies through explicit reasoning and planning, achieving mastery in grid-world games from sparse rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create more interpretable and general artificial agents that learn through explicit reasoning rather than opaque neural network weights, addressing the limitations of current deep reinforcement learning methods.

Method: CEL uses a cycle of interaction and reflection where it analyzes complete trajectories to perform Rule Induction (refining environment dynamics model) and Strategy/Playbook Summarization (distilling experiences into actionable strategies).

Result: CEL successfully learned to master diverse grid-world tasks (Minesweeper, Frozen Lake, Sokoban) by autonomously discovering game rules and developing effective policies from sparse rewards.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates a path toward more general and interpretable agents that build transparent world models through explicit reasoning on raw experience, with iterative processes being critical for sustained learning.

Abstract: The pursuit of artificial agents that can learn to master complex
environments has led to remarkable successes, yet prevailing deep reinforcement
learning methods often rely on immense experience, encoding their knowledge
opaquely within neural network weights. We propose a different paradigm, one in
which an agent learns to play by reasoning and planning. We introduce Cogito,
ergo ludo (CEL), a novel agent architecture that leverages a Large Language
Model (LLM) to build an explicit, language-based understanding of its
environment's mechanics and its own strategy. Starting from a tabula rasa state
with no prior knowledge (except action set), CEL operates on a cycle of
interaction and reflection. After each episode, the agent analyzes its complete
trajectory to perform two concurrent learning processes: Rule Induction, where
it refines its explicit model of the environment's dynamics, and Strategy and
Playbook Summarization, where it distills experiences into an actionable
strategic playbook. We evaluate CEL on diverse grid-world tasks (i.e.,
Minesweeper, Frozen Lake, and Sokoban), and show that the CEL agent
successfully learns to master these games by autonomously discovering their
rules and developing effective policies from sparse rewards. Ablation studies
confirm that the iterative process is critical for sustained learning. Our work
demonstrates a path toward more general and interpretable agents that not only
act effectively but also build a transparent and improving model of their world
through explicit reasoning on raw experience.

*Lifan Yuan,Weize Chen,Yuchen Zhang,Ganqu Cui,Hanbin Wang,Ziming You,Ning Ding,Zhiyuan Liu,Maosong Sun,Hao Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RL enables LLMs to acquire genuinely new compositional skills by combining existing atomic skills, not just reweighting existing strategies. This compositional ability generalizes to unseen function combinations and transfers across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the debate about whether RL teaches LLMs new skills or merely activates existing ones, and to provide concrete evidence about RL's role in skill acquisition.

Method: Developed a synthetic framework using string transformation functions, where skills are defined as inferring f(x) given x. Tested RL's ability to teach compositions h(x)=g(f(x)) when models already know f and g individually.

Result: RL enables LLMs to learn unseen function compositions, generalizes to compositions of >2 functions, and transfers compositional skills to different tasks without target-specific training. RL fundamentally changes reasoning behaviors, unlike next-token training.

Conclusion: RL can teach genuinely new compositional skills that generalize and transfer, suggesting the value of building base models with basic skills then using RL for advanced, generalizable problem-solving abilities.

Abstract: Does RL teach LLMs genuinely new skills, or does it merely activate existing
ones? This question lies at the core of ongoing debates about the role of RL in
LLM post-training. On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with
RL even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue
that RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies.
This work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills
during RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms
by which humans acquire new cognitive skills. To mitigate data contamination
and other confounding factors, and to allow precise control over task
complexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation.
Specifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string
transformation function f(x) given x. When an LLM has already learned f and g
prior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen
compositions of them h(x)=g(f(x)). Further, this compositional ability
generalizes to more difficult problems such as compositions of >2 functions
unseen during RL training. Surprisingly, our experiments show that
compositional skill acquired on a source task transfers to a different target
task. This transfer happens even without compositional training on the target,
requiring only prior knowledge of the target's atomic skills. Our qualitative
analysis shows that RL fundamentally changes the reasoning behaviors of the
models. In contrast, next-token training with the same data yields none of
these findings. Our systematic experiments provide fresh insights into LLM
learning, suggesting the value of first building base models with basic skills,
then using RL to incentivize advanced, generalizable skills for complex
problems.

### [481] [The Era of Real-World Human Interaction: RL from User Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25137)
*Chuanyang Jin,Jing Xu,Bo Liu,Leitian Tao,Olga Golovneva,Tianmin Shu,Wenting Zhao,Xian Li,Jason Weston*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLHI uses natural human interactions for model alignment through two methods: User-Guided Rewrites that revise outputs based on user follow-ups, and User-Based Rewards that personalize using long-term interaction history.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current conversational models rely on pre-annotated expert feedback, but future models need to learn from natural human interaction for continual improvement and multifaceted alignment.

Method: Two complementary RLHI methods: (1) User-Guided Rewrites that revise unsatisfactory outputs based on users' natural-language follow-up responses, (2) User-Based Rewards that learn via persona-conditioned reward models using long-term interaction history.

Result: Both RLHI variants outperform strong baselines in personalization and instruction-following on WildChat conversations, with similar feedback improving reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Organic human interaction provides scalable, effective supervision for personalized alignment, suggesting natural conversations can replace pre-annotated expert feedback.

Abstract: We posit that to achieve continual model improvement and multifaceted
alignment, future models must learn from natural human interaction. Current
conversational models are aligned using pre-annotated, expert-generated human
feedback. In this work, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Human
Interaction (RLHI), a paradigm that learns directly from in-the-wild user
conversations. We develop two complementary methods: (1) RLHI with User-Guided
Rewrites, which revises unsatisfactory model outputs based on users'
natural-language follow-up responses, (2) RLHI with User-Based Rewards, which
learns via a reward model conditioned on knowledge of the user's long-term
interaction history (termed persona). Together, these methods link long-term
user personas to turn-level preferences via persona-conditioned preference
optimization. Trained on conversations derived from WildChat, both RLHI
variants outperform strong baselines in personalization and
instruction-following, and similar feedback enhances performance on reasoning
benchmarks. These results suggest organic human interaction offers scalable,
effective supervision for personalized alignment.

*Yue Zhang,Tianyi Ma,Zun Wang,Yanyuan Qiao,Parisa Kordjamshidi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes using multi-perspective textual descriptions to enhance LLM-based Vision-and-Language Navigation agents through analogical reasoning, improving scene understanding and navigation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot LLM-based VLN agents either oversimplify visual details by encoding images as text or fail to capture abstract semantics when processing raw images, limiting their contextual understanding and reasoning capabilities.

Method: Incorporating textual descriptions from multiple perspectives to facilitate analogical reasoning across images, enabling better global scene understanding and spatial reasoning for navigation decisions.

Result: Evaluation on the R2R dataset shows significant improvements in navigation performance compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: Multi-perspective textual descriptions combined with analogical reasoning effectively enhance LLM-based VLN agents' contextual understanding and navigation capabilities.

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into embodied AI models is becoming
increasingly prevalent. However, existing zero-shot LLM-based
Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents either encode images as textual
scene descriptions, potentially oversimplifying visual details, or process raw
image inputs, which can fail to capture abstract semantics required for
high-level reasoning. In this paper, we improve the navigation agent's
contextual understanding by incorporating textual descriptions from multiple
perspectives that facilitate analogical reasoning across images. By leveraging
text-based analogical reasoning, the agent enhances its global scene
understanding and spatial reasoning, leading to more accurate action decisions.
We evaluate our approach on the R2R dataset, where our experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in navigation performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReasoningBank is a memory framework that enables LLM agents to learn from past experiences by distilling reasoning strategies from both successful and failed interactions, allowing continuous improvement over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents fail to learn from accumulated interaction history, forcing them to discard valuable insights and repeat past errors, limiting their effectiveness in persistent real-world roles.

Method: Proposes ReasoningBank memory framework that distills generalizable reasoning strategies from self-judged successful/failed experiences, and introduces memory-aware test-time scaling (MaTTS) to accelerate learning by scaling up interaction experience.

Result: Across web browsing and software engineering benchmarks, ReasoningBank consistently outperforms existing memory mechanisms that store raw trajectories or only successful routines, improving both effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: Memory-driven experience scaling establishes a new scaling dimension, enabling agents to self-evolve with emergent behaviors naturally arising from the synergy between memory and test-time scaling.

Abstract: With the growing adoption of large language model agents in persistent
real-world roles, they naturally encounter continuous streams of tasks. A key
limitation, however, is their failure to learn from the accumulated interaction
history, forcing them to discard valuable insights and repeat past errors. We
propose ReasoningBank, a novel memory framework that distills generalizable
reasoning strategies from an agent's self-judged successful and failed
experiences. At test time, an agent retrieves relevant memories from
ReasoningBank to inform its interaction and then integrates new learnings back,
enabling it to become more capable over time. Building on this powerful
experience learner, we further introduce memory-aware test-time scaling
(MaTTS), which accelerates and diversifies this learning process by scaling up
the agent's interaction experience. By allocating more compute to each task,
the agent generates abundant, diverse experiences that provide rich contrastive
signals for synthesizing higher-quality memory. The better memory in turn
guides more effective scaling, establishing a powerful synergy between memory
and test-time scaling. Across web browsing and software engineering benchmarks,
ReasoningBank consistently outperforms existing memory mechanisms that store
raw trajectories or only successful task routines, improving both effectiveness
and efficiency; MaTTS further amplifies these gains. These findings establish
memory-driven experience scaling as a new scaling dimension, enabling agents to
self-evolve with emergent behaviors naturally arise.

### [484] [Visual serial processing deficits explain divergences in human and VLM reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25142)
*Nicholas Budny,Kia Ghods,Declan Campbell,Raja Marjieh,Amogh Joshi,Sreejan Kumar,Jonathan D. Cohen,Taylor W. Webb,Thomas L. Griffiths*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VLMs struggle with simple visual reasoning tasks due to deficits in visually-grounded serial processing, as shown by correlation between decreased VLM accuracy and increased human reaction time across geometric reasoning, enumeration, and mental rotation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why VLMs fail on simple visual reasoning tasks despite success on standard benchmarks, hypothesizing that deficits in visually-grounded serial processing are a key factor.

Method: Compared human and VLM performance across tasks varying serial processing demands in three domains: geometric reasoning, perceptual enumeration, and mental rotation, using human reaction time as proxy for serial processing load.

Result: Decreased VLM accuracy strongly correlated with increased human reaction time across all domains - as serial processing demands increased (concept composition, enumeration, mental transformations), the VLM-human performance gap widened consistently.

Conclusion: Limitations in serial, visually grounded reasoning represent a fundamental bottleneck distinguishing current VLMs from humans.

Abstract: Why do Vision Language Models (VLMs), despite success on standard benchmarks,
often fail to match human performance on surprisingly simple visual reasoning
tasks? While the underlying computational principles are still debated, we
hypothesize that a crucial factor is a deficit in visually-grounded serial
processing. To test this hypothesis, we compared human and VLM performance
across tasks designed to vary serial processing demands in three distinct
domains: geometric reasoning, perceptual enumeration, and mental rotation.
Tasks within each domain varied serial processing load by manipulating factors
such as geometric concept complexity, perceptual individuation load, and
transformation difficulty. Across all domains, our results revealed a
consistent pattern: decreased VLM accuracy was strongly correlated with
increased human reaction time (used as a proxy for serial processing load). As
tasks require more demanding serial processing -- whether composing concepts,
enumerating items, or performing mental transformations -- the VLM-human
performance gap widens reliably. These findings support our hypothesis,
indicating that limitations in serial, visually grounded reasoning represent a
fundamental bottleneck that distinguishes current VLMs from humans.

### [485] [UniAPL: A Unified Adversarial Preference Learning Framework for Instruct-Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25148)
*FaQiang Qian,WeiKun Zhang,Ziliang Wang,Kang An,Xuhui Zheng,Liangjian Wen,Mengya Gao,Yong Dai,Yichao Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UniAPL is a unified preference learning framework that jointly trains on SFT and preference data in a single stage, solving distributional mismatch between static expert demonstrations and evolving policy distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard sequential alignment pipelines (SFT followed by RL) suffer from distributional mismatch where SFT uses static expert data but policy distributions drift during RL, making SFT knowledge brittle and RL updates ungrounded.

Method: UniAPL reframes alignment as constrained optimization and implements a single-stage unified training objective that learns from mixed batches of SFT and preference data, allowing expert demonstrations to directly ground and regularize online exploration.

Result: UniAPL matches or exceeds strong GRPO baselines: +5.77% on Qwen3-0.6B (matching a 32B model) and +3.75% on Qwen3-4B, even outperforming the teacher model. Response analysis shows outputs closely mimic expert demonstrations.

Conclusion: UniAPL achieves both stronger performance and better behavioral alignment by resolving distributional mismatch and maximizing data synergy between demonstration and preference learning modalities.

Abstract: Shaping powerful LLMs to be beneficial and safe is central to AI alignment.
We argue that post-training alignment is fundamentally a unified Preference
Learning problem, involving two modalities: demonstrated preferences (e.g.,
Supervised Fine-Tuning, SFT) and comparative preferences (e.g., Reinforcement
Learning, RL).The standard sequential pipeline-SFT followed by RL-is flawed due
to a critical distributional mismatch: SFT uses static expert data, but as the
policy evolves, its generation distribution drifts, making SFT knowledge
brittle. Subsequent RL then explores without direct access to the rich,
ground-truth knowledge in expert demonstrations, leading to inefficient,
ungrounded updates. This separation prevents mutual regularization between data
sources. To address this, we reframe alignment as a constrained optimization
problem and propose Unified Adversarial Preference Learning (UniAPL),a novel
framework that dynamically aligns the policy's distribution with the expert's.
UniAPL implements a single-stage unified training objective, jointly learning
from mixed batches of SFT and preference data. In every gradient step, dense
expert demonstrations directly ground and regularize online exploration,
inherently resolving distributional mismatch and maximizing data synergy.We
evaluate UniAPL on instruction-following tasks using Qwen3-235B-Instruct-2507
as the teacher. Our models match or exceed strong GRPO baselines: +5.77% on
Qwen3-0.6B (matching a 32B model) and +3.75% on Qwen3-4B,even outperforming the
teacher. Analyses of response length and log-probability distributions confirm
that UniAPL outputs closely mimic expert demonstrations, achieving both
stronger performance and better behavioral alignment.

TL;DR: This paper introduces J-Detector, a method for detecting LLM-generated judgments by analyzing the interaction between judgment scores and candidate content, addressing biases in LLM-based evaluation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based judgments are increasingly used for content evaluation, but their inherent biases and vulnerabilities create concerns, especially in sensitive scenarios like academic peer reviewing where distinguishing human from LLM judgments is crucial.

Method: The authors propose J-Detector, a lightweight neural detector that uses explicitly extracted linguistic and LLM-enhanced features to link LLM judges' biases with candidates' properties for accurate detection, focusing on judgment scores and candidate content interaction.

Result: Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate J-Detector's effectiveness in detecting LLM-generated judgments, outperforming existing LLM-generated text detection methods, and enabling quantification of biases in LLM judges through interpretable features.

Conclusion: The study validates the practical utility of judgment detection in real-world scenarios and analyzes key factors affecting the detectability of LLM-generated judgments, providing a solution for trustworthy LLM-based evaluation systems.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based judgments leverage powerful LLMs to
efficiently evaluate candidate content and provide judgment scores. However,
the inherent biases and vulnerabilities of LLM-generated judgments raise
concerns, underscoring the urgent need for distinguishing them in sensitive
scenarios like academic peer reviewing. In this work, we propose and formalize
the task of judgment detection and systematically investigate the detectability
of LLM-generated judgments. Unlike LLM-generated text detection, judgment
detection relies solely on judgment scores and candidates, reflecting
real-world scenarios where textual feedback is often unavailable in the
detection process. Our preliminary analysis shows that existing LLM-generated
text detection methods perform poorly given their incapability to capture the
interaction between judgment scores and candidate content -- an aspect crucial
for effective judgment detection. Inspired by this, we introduce
\textit{J-Detector}, a lightweight and transparent neural detector augmented
with explicitly extracted linguistic and LLM-enhanced features to link LLM
judges' biases with candidates' properties for accurate detection. Experiments
across diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of \textit{J-Detector}
and show how its interpretability enables quantifying biases in LLM judges.
Finally, we analyze key factors affecting the detectability of LLM-generated
judgments and validate the practical utility of judgment detection in
real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an effective control method for autonomous personal mobility vehicles (SEATER) that can handle non-holonomic constraints and obstacle avoidance while maintaining real-time performance.

Method: Uses Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) with single-shooting approach to solve optimal control problems via non-linear programming, implemented on a differential drive non-holonomic vehicle using odometry data for localization within ROS/Gazebo framework.

Result: Simulation results show the NMPC-based approach successfully controls the vehicle to reach target locations while satisfying constraints including obstacle avoidance in both obstacle-free and static obstacle environments.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the robustness and real-time effectiveness of NMPC with single-shooting approach for autonomous vehicle control in the evaluated scenarios.

Abstract: This paper introduces a proposed control method for autonomous personal
mobility vehicles, specifically the Single-passenger Electric Autonomous
Transporter (SEATER), using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). The
proposed method leverages a single-shooting approach to solve the optimal
control problem (OCP) via non-linear programming (NLP). The proposed NMPC is
implemented to a non-holonomic vehicle with a differential drive system, using
odometry data as localization feedback to guide the vehicle towards its target
pose while achieving objectives and adhering to constraints, such as obstacle
avoidance. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, a number of
simulations have been conducted in both obstacle-free and static obstacle
environments. The SEATER model and testing environment have been developed in
the Gazebo Simulation and the NMPC are implemented within the Robot Operating
System (ROS) framework. The simulation results demonstrate that the NMPC-based
approach successfully controls the vehicle to reach the desired target location
while satisfying the imposed constraints. Furthermore, this study highlights
the robustness and real-time effectiveness of NMPC with a single-shooting
approach for autonomous vehicle control in the evaluated scenarios.

TL;DR: ReSeFlow introduces rectified flows to SE(3)-equivariant diffusion models for robotic manipulation, achieving fast inference with only one step while maintaining geodesic consistency and outperforming baselines with 100-step inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments requires robust, long-horizon trajectory policies that are data-efficient and generalize well under rigid-body motions, but existing SE(3)-equivariant diffusion models suffer from slow inference times.

Method: Proposes ReSeFlow by applying rectified flow principles to SE(3)-equivariant diffusion models, using SE(3)-equivariant networks to preserve rotational and translational symmetry, enabling geodesic-consistent policy generation with minimal computational steps.

Result: ReSeFlow with only one inference step achieves better performance than baseline methods with 100-step inference, reducing errors by 48.5% on painting tasks and 21.9% on rotating triangle tasks, while maintaining lower geodesic distance.

Conclusion: ReSeFlow successfully combines SE(3) equivariance with rectified flow to create a data-efficient and inference-efficient generative policy learning method suitable for real-world robotic applications.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments requires the generation of
robust and long-horizon trajectory-level policy with conditions of perceptual
observations and benefits from the advantages of SE(3)-equivariant diffusion
models that are data-efficient. However, these models suffer from the inference
time costs. Inspired by the inference efficiency of rectified flows, we
introduce the rectification to the SE(3)-diffusion models and propose the
ReSeFlow, i.e., Rectifying SE(3)-Equivariant Policy Learning Flows, providing
fast, geodesic-consistent, least-computational policy generation. Crucially,
both components employ SE(3)-equivariant networks to preserve rotational and
translational symmetry, enabling robust generalization under rigid-body
motions. With the verification on the simulated benchmarks, we find that the
proposed ReSeFlow with only one inference step can achieve better performance
with lower geodesic distance than the baseline methods, achieving up to a 48.5%
error reduction on the painting task and a 21.9% reduction on the rotating
triangle task compared to the baseline's 100-step inference. This method takes
advantages of both SE(3) equivariance and rectified flow and puts it forward
for the real-world application of generative policy learning models with the
data and inference efficiency.

audio-visual navigation (AVN) research mainly focuses on single-agent systems,
their limitations emerge in dynamic 3D environments where rapid multi-agent
coordination is critical, especially for time-sensitive applications like

to collaboratively localize and navigate toward an audio target in shared 3D
environments. By integrating cross-agent communication protocols and joint
audio-visual fusion mechanisms, MASTAVN enhances spatial reasoning and temporal
synchronization. Through rigorous evaluation in photorealistic 3D simulators
(Replica and Matterport3D), MASTAVN achieves significant reductions in task
completion time and notable improvements in navigation success rates compared
to single-agent and non-collaborative baselines. This highlights the essential
role of spatiotemporal coordination in multi-agent systems. Our findings
validate MASTAVN's effectiveness in time-sensitive emergency scenarios and

TL;DR: LLMs fine-tuned on synthetic datasets achieve efficient 3D IC space planning with post-order slicing trees, reducing dead space while maintaining legality and runtime efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D ICs address scaling limits of 2D designs but require effective space planning to reduce dead space and ensure layout quality as complexity increases.

Method: Fine-tuned open-source LLMs on synthetic datasets using post-order slicing tree representation to guarantee legal space plans while minimizing dead space.

Result: Achieves favorable balance between runtime efficiency, legality, and dead-space reduction, with zero-dead-space layouts in significant test cases under practical runtime budgets.

Conclusion: LLM-based space planning serves as data-driven complement to traditional EDA methods, showing potential for cross-domain applications in logistics and 3D object placement.

Abstract: Three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D ICs) have emerged as a promising
solution to the scaling limits of two-dimensional designs, offering higher
integration density, shorter interconnects, and improved performance. As design
complexity increases, effective space planning becomes essential to reduce dead
space and ensure layout quality. This study investigates the use of large
language models (LLMs) for 3D IC space planning through a post-order slicing
tree representation, which guarantees legal space plans while aiming to
minimize dead space. Open-source LLMs were fine-tuned on large-scale synthetic
datasets and further evaluated on MCNC-derived 3D benchmarks. Experimental
results indicate that the proposed framework achieves a favorable balance
between runtime efficiency, legality, and dead-space reduction, with
zero-dead-space layouts obtained in a significant portion of test cases under
practical runtime budgets. Beyond synthetic benchmarks, the method generalizes
to MCNC cases such as ami33 and ami49, though larger and irregular instances
remain challenging. The approach also shows potential for cross-domain
applications, including logistics and 3D object placement, where spatial
efficiency is critical. Overall, the results suggest that LLM-based space
planning can serve as a data-driven complement to traditional electronic design
automation (EDA) methods, providing new insights for scalable 3D layout
generation.

Motivation: Existing methods either focus only on geometric elements or treat traffic rules as temporary classifications, failing to capture their persistent effectiveness when signs are no longer visible.

Method: Introduces Map-Rule Co-Construction for processing driving scenes in temporal segments and Map-Rule Cache for maintaining rule consistency across segments. Also develops MapDRv2 dataset with improved lane geometry annotations.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance in joint vector-rule mapping tasks while maintaining persistent rule effectiveness throughout extended driving sequences.

Conclusion: PAMR successfully achieves both accurate HD map construction and persistent awareness of traffic rules, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Safe autonomous driving requires both accurate HD map construction and
persistent awareness of traffic rules, even when their associated signs are no
longer visible. However, existing methods either focus solely on geometric
elements or treat rules as temporary classifications, failing to capture their
persistent effectiveness across extended driving sequences. In this paper, we
present PAMR (Persistent Autoregressive Mapping with Traffic Rules), a novel
framework that performs autoregressive co-construction of lane vectors and
traffic rules from visual observations. Our approach introduces two key
mechanisms: Map-Rule Co-Construction for processing driving scenes in temporal
segments, and Map-Rule Cache for maintaining rule consistency across these
segments. To properly evaluate continuous and consistent map generation, we
develop MapDRv2, featuring improved lane geometry annotations. Extensive

### [495] [Teleoperator-Aware and Safety-Critical Adaptive Nonlinear MPC for Shared Autonomy in Obstacle Avoidance of Legged Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22815)
*Ruturaj Sambhus,Muneeb Ahmad,Basit Muhammad Imran,Sujith Vijayan,Dylan P. Losey,Kaveh Akbari Hamed*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a safety-critical adaptive nonlinear model predictive control framework for shared autonomy in quadrupedal robots, enabling safe human-robot collaboration through online learning of human intent and hierarchical control architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional shared-control approaches for legged robots use fixed blending strategies that don't capture locomotion dynamics and may compromise safety in cluttered environments during teleoperation.

Method: Uses adaptive nonlinear model predictive control with control barrier function constraints, modeling human input with a noisily rational Boltzmann model adapted online using projected gradient descent. Features hierarchical control: high-level ANMPC (10Hz) for velocity references, mid-level NMPC (60Hz) for single rigid body dynamics, and low-level whole-body controller (500Hz) for full dynamics.

Result: Extensive numerical and hardware experiments on Unitree Go2 quadruped demonstrate real-time obstacle avoidance, successful online learning of human intent parameters, and safe teleoperator collaboration validated through user studies.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables effective and safe shared autonomy for quadrupedal robots in obstacle-avoidance tasks by combining adaptive human intent modeling with safety-critical control constraints.

Abstract: Ensuring safe and effective collaboration between humans and autonomous
legged robots is a fundamental challenge in shared autonomy, particularly for
teleoperated systems navigating cluttered environments. Conventional
shared-control approaches often rely on fixed blending strategies that fail to
capture the dynamics of legged locomotion and may compromise safety. This paper
presents a teleoperator-aware, safety-critical, adaptive nonlinear model
predictive control (ANMPC) framework for shared autonomy of quadrupedal robots
in obstacle-avoidance tasks. The framework employs a fixed arbitration weight
between human and robot actions but enhances this scheme by modeling the human
input with a noisily rational Boltzmann model, whose parameters are adapted
online using a projected gradient descent (PGD) law from observed joystick
commands. Safety is enforced through control barrier function (CBF) constraints
integrated into a computationally efficient NMPC, ensuring forward invariance
of safe sets despite uncertainty in human behavior. The control architecture is
hierarchical: a high-level CBF-based ANMPC (10 Hz) generates blended
human-robot velocity references, a mid-level dynamics-aware NMPC (60 Hz)
enforces reduced-order single rigid body (SRB) dynamics to track these
references, and a low-level nonlinear whole-body controller (500 Hz) imposes
the full-order dynamics via quadratic programming to track the mid-level
trajectories. Extensive numerical and hardware experiments, together with a
user study, on a Unitree Go2 quadrupedal robot validate the framework,
demonstrating real-time obstacle avoidance, online learning of human intent
parameters, and safe teleoperator collaboration.

### [496] [Parameter Identification of a Differentiable Human Arm Musculoskeletal Model without Deep Muscle EMG Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22825)
*Philip Sanderink,Yingfan Zhou,Shuzhen Luo,Cheng Fang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to identify bone and superficial muscle parameters for human arm musculoskeletal models without needing deep muscle EMG measurements, using differentiable optimization and least-squares solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EMG-based parameter identification methods for musculoskeletal models are limited by the difficulty of invasively measuring deep muscle EMGs, and existing reconstruction methods have reliability issues due to assumptions about deep muscle behavior.

Method: The approach uses differentiable optimization framework where only the least-squares solution of deep muscle forces is needed to calculate loss gradients with respect to model parameters, eliminating the need to reconstruct deep muscle EMGs.

Result: Extensive comparative simulations showed that the proposed method achieves comparable estimation accuracy to methods that have access to all muscle EMGs.

Conclusion: The method successfully identifies musculoskeletal model parameters without requiring deep muscle EMG measurements, providing a practical alternative to existing approaches while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate parameter identification of a subject-specific human musculoskeletal
model is crucial to the development of safe and reliable physically
collaborative robotic systems, for instance, assistive exoskeletons.
Electromyography (EMG)-based parameter identification methods have demonstrated
promising performance for personalized musculoskeletal modeling, whereas their
applicability is limited by the difficulty of measuring deep muscle EMGs
invasively. Although several strategies have been proposed to reconstruct deep
muscle EMGs or activations for parameter identification, their reliability and
robustness are limited by assumptions about the deep muscle behavior. In this
work, we proposed an approach to simultaneously identify the bone and
superficial muscle parameters of a human arm musculoskeletal model without
reconstructing the deep muscle EMGs. This is achieved by only using the
least-squares solution of the deep muscle forces to calculate a loss gradient
with respect to the model parameters for identifying them in a framework of
differentiable optimization. The results of extensive comparative simulations
manifested that our proposed method can achieve comparable estimation accuracy
compared to a similar method, but with all the muscle EMGs available.

### [497] [Dynamic Buffers: Cost-Efficient Planning for Tabletop Rearrangement with Stacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22828)
*Arman Barghi,Hamed Hosseini,Seraj Ghasemi,Mehdi Tale Masouleh,Ahmad Kalhor*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Buffers - temporary movable stacks that can be transported as units - to improve rearrangement planning efficiency in cluttered tabletop environments, reducing manipulator travel costs by 11.89% in dense scenarios and 5.69% in large settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical rearrangement planners are inefficient in cluttered environments due to individual object shuffling and static buffers (fixed empty spaces or stacks). Static stacking limits efficiency since base objects cannot be moved once supporting others.

Method: Proposes Dynamic Buffers inspired by human grouping strategies, allowing robots to form temporary movable stacks that can be transported as units, providing flexible buffer capacity.

Result: Reduces manipulator travel cost by 11.89% in dense scenarios with stationary robot and 5.69% in large, low-density settings with mobile manipulator. Validated through experiments on Delta parallel robot with two-finger gripper.

Conclusion: Dynamic buffering establishes a key primitive for cost-efficient and robust rearrangement planning, improving both feasibility and efficiency in various tabletop scenarios.

Abstract: Rearranging objects in cluttered tabletop environments remains a
long-standing challenge in robotics. Classical planners often generate
inefficient, high-cost plans by shuffling objects individually and using fixed
buffers--temporary spaces such as empty table regions or static stacks--to
resolve conflicts. When only free table locations are used as buffers, dense
scenes become inefficient, since placing an object can restrict others from
reaching their goals and complicate planning. Allowing stacking provides extra
buffer capacity, but conventional stacking is static: once an object supports
another, the base cannot be moved, which limits efficiency. To overcome these
issues, a novel planning primitive called the Dynamic Buffer is introduced.
Inspired by human grouping strategies, it enables robots to form temporary,
movable stacks that can be transported as a unit. This improves both
feasibility and efficiency in dense layouts, and it also reduces travel in
large-scale settings where space is abundant. Compared with a state-of-the-art
rearrangement planner, the approach reduces manipulator travel cost by 11.89%
in dense scenarios with a stationary robot and by 5.69% in large, low-density
settings with a mobile manipulator. Practicality is validated through
experiments on a Delta parallel robot with a two-finger gripper. These findings
establish dynamic buffering as a key primitive for cost-efficient and robust
rearrangement planning.

### [498] [Empart: Interactive Convex Decomposition for Converting Meshes to Parts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22847)
*Brandon Vu,Shameek Ganguly,Pushkar Joshi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Empart is an interactive tool for region-specific 3D mesh simplification that allows users to apply different simplification tolerances to selected areas, improving the trade-off between accuracy and simulation performance compared to uniform decomposition methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mesh simplification methods use uniform error tolerance across entire meshes, leading to sub-optimal performance in robotics applications where high-fidelity geometry is needed only in critical areas like contact surfaces, while other regions can be coarsely simplified.

Method: Empart leverages existing convex decomposition algorithms as a sub-routine but uses a novel parallelized framework to handle region-specific constraints efficiently. It provides an interactive interface with visual feedback for iterative refinement.

Result: Empart significantly reduces the number of convex parts compared to state-of-the-art method V-HACD at fixed error thresholds, leading to 69% reduction in simulation time for robotic pick-and-place tasks compared to uniform decomposition.

Conclusion: Interactive, region-specific mesh simplification provides substantial performance benefits for robotics applications by optimizing the trade-off between geometric accuracy and computational efficiency where it matters most.

Abstract: Simplifying complex 3D meshes is a crucial step in robotics applications to
enable efficient motion planning and physics simulation. Common methods, such
as approximate convex decomposition, represent a mesh as a collection of simple
parts, which are computationally inexpensive to simulate. However, existing
approaches apply a uniform error tolerance across the entire mesh, which can
result in a sub-optimal trade-off between accuracy and performance. For
instance, a robot grasping an object needs high-fidelity geometry in the
vicinity of the contact surfaces but can tolerate a coarser simplification
elsewhere. A uniform tolerance can lead to excessive detail in non-critical
areas or insufficient detail where it's needed most.
  To address this limitation, we introduce Empart, an interactive tool that
allows users to specify different simplification tolerances for selected
regions of a mesh. Our method leverages existing convex decomposition
algorithms as a sub-routine but uses a novel, parallelized framework to handle
region-specific constraints efficiently. Empart provides a user-friendly
interface with visual feedback on approximation error and simulation
performance, enabling designers to iteratively refine their decomposition. We
demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the number of convex parts
compared to a state-of-the-art method (V-HACD) at a fixed error threshold,
leading to substantial speedups in simulation performance. For a robotic
pick-and-place task, Empart-generated collision meshes reduced the overall
simulation time by 69% compared to a uniform decomposition, highlighting the
value of interactive, region-specific simplification for performant robotics
applications.

### [499] [Multi-Robot Allocation for Information Gathering in Non-Uniform Spatiotemporal Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22883)
*Kaleb Ben Naveed,Haejoon Lee,Dimitra Panagou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A two-phase multi-robot framework for estimating non-uniform spatiotemporal fields that adaptively learns region-specific spatial and temporal lengthscales using Gaussian Processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GP methods often assume global lengthscales or ignore temporal changes, leading to inaccurate uncertainty estimates in non-uniform spatiotemporal environments with distinct regional dynamics.

Method: Phase 1: Variogram-driven planner learns region-specific spatial lengthscales. Phase 2: Allocation strategy reassigns robots based on current uncertainty using clarity metric, while refining temporal lengthscales through adaptive sampling.

Result: The method is evaluated across diverse environments with convergence analysis for spatial lengthscale estimation and dynamic regret bounds quantifying performance gap to oracle allocation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of existing GP methods by adaptively learning both spatial and temporal lengthscales in non-uniform spatiotemporal environments.

Abstract: Autonomous robots are increasingly deployed to estimate spatiotemporal fields
(e.g., wind, temperature, gas concentration) that vary across space and time.
We consider environments divided into non-overlapping regions with distinct
spatial and temporal dynamics, termed non-uniform spatiotemporal environments.
Gaussian Processes (GPs) can be used to estimate these fields. The GP model
depends on a kernel that encodes how the field co-varies in space and time,
with its spatial and temporal lengthscales defining the correlation. Hence,
when these lengthscales are incorrect or do not correspond to the actual field,
the estimates of uncertainty can be highly inaccurate. Existing GP methods
often assume one global lengthscale or update only periodically; some allow
spatial variation but ignore temporal changes. To address these limitations, we
propose a two-phase framework for multi-robot field estimation. Phase 1 uses a
variogram-driven planner to learn region-specific spatial lengthscales. Phase 2
employs an allocation strategy that reassigns robots based on the current
uncertainty, and updates sampling as temporal lengthscales are refined. For
encoding uncertainty, we utilize clarity, an information metric from our
earlier work. We evaluate the proposed method across diverse environments and
provide convergence analysis for spatial lengthscale estimation, along with
dynamic regret bounds quantifying the gap to the oracle's allocation sequence.

### [500] [Good Weights: Proactive, Adaptive Dead Reckoning Fusion for Continuous and Robust Visual SLAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22910)
*Yanwei Du,Jing-Chen Peng,Patricio A. Vela*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The Good Weights algorithm adaptively integrates dead reckoning odometry with visual SLAM to maintain accurate pose estimation in texture-less or visually degraded environments where traditional visual SLAM fails.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual SLAM struggles in texture-less or visually degraded environments (plain walls, low lighting) leading to poor pose estimation and track loss, while dead reckoning provides reasonable short-term performance but unreliable long-term accuracy.

Method: The Good Weights algorithm provides a framework for adaptive integration of dead reckoning with passive visual SLAM, modifying all SLAM system modules to incorporate DR with adaptive weighting that increases DR influence when visual tracking is unreliable and reduces it when visual features are strong.

Result: Experiments on collected datasets and real-world deployment demonstrate that Good Weights improves visual SLAM performance and robustness, maintaining continuous and accurate frame-level pose estimation without overreliance on dead reckoning.

Conclusion: Good Weights yields a practical solution for mobile navigation that enhances visual SLAM robustness by adaptively combining dead reckoning with visual tracking, particularly effective in challenging visual environments.

Abstract: Given that Visual SLAM relies on appearance cues for localization and scene
understanding, texture-less or visually degraded environments (e.g., plain
walls or low lighting) lead to poor pose estimation and track loss. However,
robots are typically equipped with sensors that provide some form of dead
reckoning odometry with reasonable short-time performance but unreliable
long-time performance. The Good Weights (GW) algorithm described here provides
a framework to adaptively integrate dead reckoning (DR) with passive visual
SLAM for continuous and accurate frame-level pose estimation. Importantly, it
describes how all modules in a comprehensive SLAM system must be modified to
incorporate DR into its design. Adaptive weighting increases DR influence when
visual tracking is unreliable and reduces when visual feature information is
strong, maintaining pose track without overreliance on DR. Good Weights yields
a practical solution for mobile navigation that improves visual SLAM
performance and robustness. Experiments on collected datasets and in real-world
deployment demonstrate the benefits of Good Weights.

Result: ARMimic reduces demonstration time by 50% compared to teleoperation and improves task success by 11% over ACT baseline trained on teleoperated data. It successfully handles challenging long-horizon tasks like bowl stacking.

Conclusion: ARMimic enables safe, seamless, and in-the-wild data collection, offering great potential for scalable robot learning in diverse real-world settings with minimal hardware requirements.

Abstract: Imitation learning is a powerful paradigm for robot skill acquisition, yet
conventional demonstration methods--such as kinesthetic teaching and
teleoperation--are cumbersome, hardware-heavy, and disruptive to workflows.
Recently, passive observation using extended reality (XR) headsets has shown
promise for egocentric demonstration collection, yet current approaches require
additional hardware, complex calibration, or constrained recording conditions
that limit scalability and usability. We present ARMimic, a novel framework
that overcomes these limitations with a lightweight and hardware-minimal setup
for scalable, robot-free data collection using only a consumer XR headset and a
stationary workplace camera. ARMimic integrates egocentric hand tracking,
augmented reality (AR) robot overlays, and real-time depth sensing to ensure
collision-aware, kinematically feasible demonstrations. A unified imitation
learning pipeline is at the core of our method, treating both human and virtual
robot trajectories as interchangeable, which enables policies that generalize
across different embodiments and environments. We validate ARMimic on two
manipulation tasks, including challenging long-horizon bowl stacking. In our
experiments, ARMimic reduces demonstration time by 50% compared to
teleoperation and improves task success by 11% over ACT, a state-of-the-art
baseline trained on teleoperated data. Our results demonstrate that ARMimic
enables safe, seamless, and in-the-wild data collection, offering great
potential for scalable robot learning in diverse real-world settings.

TL;DR: The paper presents a trajectory synthesis method for autonomous racing overtaking using Differential Bayesian Filtering over Composite Bezier Curves, achieving 87% success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing optimization and graph-based methods for autonomous racing overtaking rely on oversimplified assumptions for collision-avoidance and dynamic constraints.

Method: Extension of Differential Bayesian Filtering framework that frames trajectory synthesis as Bayesian Inference over Composite Bezier Curves, making it derivative-free without spherical vehicle approximations or constraint linearization.

Result: DBF-MA successfully overtakes opponents in 87% of tested scenarios, outperforming existing autonomous overtaking methods in closed-loop analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses autonomous racing overtaking challenges without relying on simplifying assumptions that limit existing methods.

Abstract: A significant challenge in autonomous racing is to generate overtaking
maneuvers. Racing agents must execute these maneuvers on complex racetracks
with little room for error. Optimization techniques and graph-based methods
have been proposed, but these methods often rely on oversimplified assumptions
for collision-avoidance and dynamic constraints. In this work, we present an
approach to trajectory synthesis based on an extension of the Differential
Bayesian Filtering framework. Our approach for collision-free trajectory
synthesis frames the problem as one of Bayesian Inference over the space of
Composite Bezier Curves. Our method is derivative-free, does not require a
spherical approximation of the vehicle footprint, linearization of constraints,
or simplifying upper bounds on collision avoidance. We conduct a closed-loop
analysis of DBF-MA and find it successfully overtakes an opponent in 87% of
tested scenarios, outperforming existing methods in autonomous overtaking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address communication time delays in human-robot collaboration tasks that arise from sensor processing, network delays, or computational limitations, while ensuring safety and handling unknown robot kinematics and dynamics.

Method: Developed adaptive controller using Barrier Lyapunov Function (BLF) for safety constraints, ICL-based adaptive law for unknown kinematics, gradient-based adaptive law for unknown dynamics, and Barrier Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals for stability analysis.

Result: The controller ensures synchronization and parameter estimation errors remain semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB), with simulation results demonstrating effectiveness in human-robot synchronization scenarios with time delay.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive controller successfully handles time delays and unknown parameters in human-robot collaboration while maintaining safety constraints through barrier functions and achieves bounded synchronization errors.

Abstract: In this paper, an adaptive controller is designed for the synchronization of
the trajectory of a robot with unknown kinematics and dynamics to that of the
current human trajectory in the task space using the delayed human trajectory
information. The communication time delay may be a result of various factors
that arise in human-robot collaboration tasks, such as sensor processing or
fusion to estimate trajectory/intent, network delays, or computational
limitations. The developed adaptive controller uses Barrier Lyapunov Function
(BLF) to constrain the Cartesian coordinates of the robot to ensure safety, an
ICL-based adaptive law to account for the unknown kinematics, and a
gradient-based adaptive law to estimate unknown dynamics. Barrier
Lyapunov-Krasovskii (LK) functionals are used for the stability analysis to
show that the synchronization and parameter estimation errors remain
semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). The simulation results
based on a human-robot synchronization scenario with time delay are provided to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed synchronization controller with

Conclusion: The automated system provides a reliable, scalable solution for EoL phone disassembly that enhances disassembly economics, converting an unprofitable process into one yielding net profit per unit weight.

Abstract: End-of-Life (EoL) phones significantly exacerbate global e-waste challenges

vision-based robotic sorting system, and a battery removal system. The system
can process over 120 phones per hour with an average disassembly success rate
of 98.9%, efficiently delivering selected high-value components to downstream

*Soofiyan Atar,Daniel Huang,Florian Richter,Michael Yip*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a reinforcement learning approach for dexterous in-hand manipulation of articulated tools using robotic hands, combining simulation-trained policies with sensor-driven refinement from hardware demonstrations to handle complex contact dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL policies are brittle when dealing with articulated mechanisms due to complex contact-rich dynamics and under-modeled joint phenomena like friction, stiction, backlash, and clearances that are difficult to simulate accurately.

Method: The controller augments a simulation-trained base policy with sensor-driven refinement learned from hardware demonstrations. It uses proprioception and target articulation states, fusing whole-hand tactile and force feedback with policy action intent via cross-attention-based integration.

Result: The approach enables online adaptation to instance-specific articulation properties, stabilizes contact interactions, regulates internal forces, and coordinates coupled-link motion under perturbations. It was validated on various real-world tools including scissors, pliers, surgical tools, and staplers.

Conclusion: The method achieves robust sim-to-real transfer, improved disturbance resilience, and generalization to unseen articulated tools, reducing reliance on precise physical modeling in contact-rich manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) and sim-to-real transfer have advanced robotic
manipulation of rigid objects. Yet, policies remain brittle when applied to
articulated mechanisms due to contact-rich dynamics and under-modeled joint
phenomena such as friction, stiction, backlash, and clearances. We address this
challenge through dexterous in-hand manipulation of articulated tools using a
robotic hand with reduced articulation and kinematic redundancy relative to the
human hand. Our controller augments a simulation-trained base policy with a
sensor-driven refinement learned from hardware demonstrations, conditioning on
proprioception and target articulation states while fusing whole-hand tactile
and force feedback with the policy's internal action intent via
cross-attention-based integration. This design enables online adaptation to
instance-specific articulation properties, stabilizes contact interactions,
regulates internal forces, and coordinates coupled-link motion under
perturbations. We validate our approach across a diversity of real-world
examples, including scissors, pliers, minimally invasive surgical tools, and
staplers. We achieve robust transfer from simulation to hardware, improved
disturbance resilience, and generalization to previously unseen articulated
tools, thereby reducing reliance on precise physical modeling in contact-rich
settings.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ST-OVSG is a spatio-temporal scene graph representation that addresses latency issues in teleoperation by enriching open-vocabulary perception with temporal dynamics and latency annotations, enabling robust planning despite transmission delays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate command misunderstanding and incorrect execution caused by transmission latency in teleoperation systems, where gaps between remote perceived states and operator intent occur in dynamic remote scenes.

Method: Leverages LVLMs to construct open-vocabulary 3D object representations, extends them temporally via Hungarian assignment with temporal matching cost, embeds latency tags for retrospective querying, and uses task-oriented subgraph filtering to reduce redundancy.

Result: Achieves 74% node accuracy on Replica benchmark (outperforming ConceptGraph) and 70.5% planning success rate in latency-robustness experiments.

Conclusion: ST-OVSG generalizes to novel categories and enhances planning robustness against transmission latency without requiring fine-tuning, making it effective for teleoperation in high-latency environments.

Abstract: Teleoperation via natural-language reduces operator workload and enhances
safety in high-risk or remote settings. However, in dynamic remote scenes,
transmission latency during bidirectional communication creates gaps between
remote perceived states and operator intent, leading to command
misunderstanding and incorrect execution. To mitigate this, we introduce the
Spatio-Temporal Open-Vocabulary Scene Graph (ST-OVSG), a representation that
enriches open-vocabulary perception with temporal dynamics and lightweight
latency annotations. ST-OVSG leverages LVLMs to construct open-vocabulary 3D
object representations, and extends them into the temporal domain via Hungarian
assignment with our temporal matching cost, yielding a unified spatio-temporal
scene graph. A latency tag is embedded to enable LVLM planners to
retrospectively query past scene states, thereby resolving local-remote state
mismatches caused by transmission delays. To further reduce redundancy and
highlight task-relevant cues, we propose a task-oriented subgraph filtering
strategy that produces compact inputs for the planner. ST-OVSG generalizes to
novel categories and enhances planning robustness against transmission latency
without requiring fine-tuning. Experiments show that our method achieves 74
percent node accuracy on the Replica benchmark, outperforming ConceptGraph.
Notably, in the latency-robustness experiment, the LVLM planner assisted by
ST-OVSG achieved a planning success rate of 70.5 percent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic environmental interference in Industry 4.0 creates highly nonlinear and coupled interactions between environment and robotic behavior, but current robotic datasets lack effective representation of dynamic environmental states through multimodal sensor fusion.

Method: Dataset integrates multi-dimensional interference features (size, color, lighting variations) using high-precision sensors to synchronously collect visual, torque, and joint-state measurements. Includes scenarios with geometric similarity >85% and standardized lighting gradients, with microsecond-level time-synchronization and vibration-resistant protocols via ROS.

Result: Experimental results show the dataset enhances model validation robustness and improves robotic operational stability in dynamic, interference-rich environments.

Conclusion: The presented industrial-grade multimodal interference dataset addresses critical challenges in robotic perception and control under complex conditions, with publicly available data for research and development.

Abstract: In Industry 4.0 applications, dynamic environmental interference induces
highly nonlinear and strongly coupled interactions between the environmental
state and robotic behavior. Effectively representing dynamic environmental
states through multimodal sensor data fusion remains a critical challenge in
current robotic datasets. To address this, an industrial-grade multimodal
interference dataset is presented, designed for robotic perception and control
under complex conditions. The dataset integrates multi-dimensional interference
features including size, color, and lighting variations, and employs
high-precision sensors to synchronously collect visual, torque, and joint-state
measurements. Scenarios with geometric similarity exceeding 85\% and
standardized lighting gradients are included to ensure real-world
representativeness. Microsecond-level time-synchronization and
vibration-resistant data acquisition protocols, implemented via the Robot
Operating System (ROS), guarantee temporal and operational fidelity.
Experimental results demonstrate that the dataset enhances model validation
robustness and improves robotic operational stability in dynamic,
interference-rich environments. The dataset is publicly available

*Ryo Watanabe,Maxime Alvarez,Pablo Ferreiro,Pavel Savkin,Genki Sano*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A multimodal Imitation Learning policy that combines visual, joint state, and force/torque sensing improves manipulation of upright beverage bottles in retail environments by detecting and exploiting contact transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manipulator robots in retail environments still require costly human teleoperation for contact-rich edge cases like upright lying beverage bottles, where visual cues alone are insufficient for precise manipulation.

Method: Augmented Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) with force and torque sensing for end-to-end learning over images, joint states, and forces/torques, deployed on Ghost single-arm platform.

Result: Hardware experiments show greater task success compared to baseline ACT, with force/torque signals proving beneficial in press and place phases where visual observability is limited.

Conclusion: Combining modern imitation learning architectures with lightweight force/torque sensing provides a practical path to scaling retail manipulation by using interaction forces as complementary modality for contact-rich skills.

Abstract: Manipulator robots are increasingly being deployed in retail environments,
yet contact rich edge cases still trigger costly human teleoperation. A
prominent example is upright lying beverage bottles, where purely visual cues
are often insufficient to resolve subtle contact events required for precise
manipulation. We present a multimodal Imitation Learning policy that augments
the Action Chunking Transformer with force and torque sensing, enabling
end-to-end learning over images, joint states, and forces and torques. Deployed
on Ghost, single-arm platform by Telexistence Inc, our approach improves
Pick-and-Reorient bottle task by detecting and exploiting contact transitions
during pressing and placement. Hardware experiments demonstrate greater task
success compared to baseline matching the observation space of ACT as an
ablation and experiments indicate that force and torque signals are beneficial
in the press and place phases where visual observability is limited, supporting
the use of interaction forces as a complementary modality for contact rich
skills. The results suggest a practical path to scaling retail manipulation by
combining modern imitation learning architectures with lightweight force and
torque sensing.

### [512] [EKF-Based Fusion of Wi-Fi/LiDAR/IMU for Indoor Localization and Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23118)
*Zeyi Li,Zhe Tang,Kyeong Soo Kim,Sihao Li,Jeremy S. Smith*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a multi-sensor fusion framework combining Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprinting, LiDAR-based SLAM, and IMU navigation using EKF to achieve accurate indoor localization with mean 2D errors of 0.24-0.38m.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of conventional Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprinting (low accuracy) and LiDAR-based solutions (high cost/complexity) for indoor localization.

Method: Integrates DNN-based Wi-Fi RSSI for coarse localization, IMU-based dynamic positioning with Gmapping SLAM for occupancy grid mapping, and EKF for sensor fusion to suppress noise and drift errors.

Result: Achieves stable accuracy across all path configurations with mean 2D errors of 0.2449-0.3781m, significantly outperforming individual approaches (Wi-Fi: up to 1.3404m, LiDAR/IMU: 0.6233-2.8803m).

Conclusion: The multi-sensor fusion framework effectively suppresses instability from individual approaches and provides robust, accurate indoor localization.

Abstract: Conventional Wi-Fi received signal strength indicator (RSSI) fingerprinting
cannot meet the growing demand for accurate indoor localization and navigation
due to its lower accuracy, while solutions based on light detection and ranging
(LiDAR) can provide better localization performance but is limited by their
higher deployment cost and complexity. To address these issues, we propose a
novel indoor localization and navigation framework integrating Wi-Fi RSSI
fingerprinting, LiDAR-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and
inertial measurement unit (IMU) navigation based on an extended Kalman filter
(EKF). Specifically, coarse localization by deep neural network (DNN)-based
Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprinting is refined by IMU-based dynamic positioning using a
Gmapping-based SLAM to generate an occupancy grid map and output high-frequency
attitude estimates, which is followed by EKF prediction-update integrating
sensor information while effectively suppressing Wi-Fi-induced noise and IMU
drift errors. Multi-group real-world experiments conducted on the IR building
at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University demonstrates that the proposed
multi-sensor fusion framework suppresses the instability caused by individual
approaches and thereby provides stable accuracy across all path configurations
with mean two-dimensional (2D) errors ranging from 0.2449 m to 0.3781 m. In
contrast, the mean 2D errors of Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprinting reach up to 1.3404 m
in areas with severe signal interference, and those of LiDAR/IMU localization
are between 0.6233 m and 2.8803 m due to cumulative drift.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LAGEA is a framework that uses natural language feedback from vision language models to help robots learn from mistakes through structured reflections, temporal grounding, and adaptive reward shaping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic agents lack principled ways to learn from their own mistakes, and the authors investigate whether natural language can serve as effective feedback for error reasoning and course correction.

Method: LAGEA converts episodic reflections from vision language models into temporally grounded guidance for reinforcement learning by summarizing attempts, localizing decisive moments, aligning feedback with visual state, and converting goal progress into adaptive shaping rewards.

Result: On Meta-World MT10 benchmark, LAGEA improves average success by 9.0% on random goals and 5.3% on fixed goals over state-of-the-art methods, while converging faster.

Conclusion: Language, when structured and temporally grounded, is an effective mechanism for teaching robots to self-reflect on mistakes and make better choices.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation benefits from foundation models that describe goals, but
today's agents still lack a principled way to learn from their own mistakes. We
ask whether natural language can serve as feedback, an error reasoning signal
that helps embodied agents diagnose what went wrong and correct course. We
introduce LAGEA (Language Guided Embodied Agents), a framework that turns
episodic, schema-constrained reflections from a vision language model (VLM)
into temporally grounded guidance for reinforcement learning. LAGEA summarizes
each attempt in concise language, localizes the decisive moments in the
trajectory, aligns feedback with visual state in a shared representation, and
converts goal progress and feedback agreement into bounded, step-wise shaping
rewardswhose influence is modulated by an adaptive, failure-aware coefficient.
This design yields dense signals early when exploration needs direction and
gracefully recedes as competence grows. On the Meta-World MT10 embodied
manipulation benchmark, LAGEA improves average success over the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 9.0% on random goals and 5.3% on fixed
goals, while converging faster. These results support our hypothesis: language,
when structured and grounded in time, is an effective mechanism for teaching
robots to self-reflect on mistakes and make better choices. Code will be
released soon.

TL;DR: Integrated planning framework for quadrupedal locomotion over dynamically changing terrains combining reactive synthesis for symbolic controllers with MICP for footstep planning, featuring symbolic repair and real-time replanning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for quadrupedal locomotion either rely on heuristic foothold selection (limiting robustness) or computationally intensive trajectory optimization, creating a need for more efficient and adaptive approaches.

Method: Combines reactive synthesis for correct-by-construction symbolic controllers with mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) for footstep planning, using symbolic repair to reduce MICP solves and runtime coordination for online operation.

Result: Validated through simulation and hardware experiments, the framework successfully identifies missing locomotion skills and responds effectively in safety-critical environments like scattered stepping stones and rebar scenarios.

Conclusion: The integrated approach enables robust quadrupedal locomotion over unforeseen terrains by bridging offline synthesis with online operation through real-time replanning and symbolic repair mechanisms.

Abstract: We present an integrated planning framework for quadrupedal locomotion over
dynamically changing, unforeseen terrains. Existing methods often depend on
heuristics for real-time foothold selection-limiting robustness and
adaptability-or rely on computationally intensive trajectory optimization
across complex terrains and long horizons. In contrast, our approach combines
reactive synthesis for generating correct-by-construction symbolic-level
controllers with mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) for dynamic and
physically feasible footstep planning during each symbolic transition. To
reduce the reliance on costly MICP solves and accommodate specifications that
may be violated due to physical infeasibility, we adopt a symbolic repair
mechanism that selectively generates only the required symbolic transitions.
During execution, real-time MICP replanning based on actual terrain data,
combined with runtime symbolic repair and delay-aware coordination, enables
seamless bridging between offline synthesis and online operation. Through
extensive simulation and hardware experiments, we validate the framework's
ability to identify missing locomotion skills and respond effectively in
safety-critical environments, including scattered stepping stones and rebar
scenarios.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CE-Nav is a two-stage framework that decouples universal geometric reasoning from embodiment-specific dynamics adaptation, enabling efficient generalization of navigation policies across diverse robot morphologies without costly real robot data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in generalizing navigation policies across different robot types, including the need for expensive embodiment-specific data, tight coupling of planning and control, and the multi-modal decision problem where deterministic models fail.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) Train embodiment-agnostic General Expert (VelFlow) using imitation learning on planner-generated data to learn kinematically-sound action distributions; (2) Freeze expert and train lightweight Dynamics-Aware Refiner via online RL for specific robot dynamics adaptation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on quadrupeds, bipeds, and quadrotors while drastically reducing adaptation cost. Successfully deployed in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: CE-Nav provides an efficient and scalable solution for building generalizable navigation systems by systematically separating geometric reasoning from dynamic adaptation.

Abstract: Generalizing local navigation policies across diverse robot morphologies is a
critical challenge. Progress is often hindered by the need for costly and
embodiment-specific data, the tight coupling of planning and control, and the
"disastrous averaging" problem where deterministic models fail to capture
multi-modal decisions (e.g., turning left or right). We introduce CE-Nav, a
novel two-stage (IL-then-RL) framework that systematically decouples universal
geometric reasoning from embodiment-specific dynamic adaptation. First, we
train an embodiment-agnostic General Expert offline using imitation learning.
This expert, a conditional normalizing flow model named VelFlow, learns the
full distribution of kinematically-sound actions from a large-scale dataset
generated by a classical planner, completely avoiding real robot data and
resolving the multi-modality issue. Second, for a new robot, we freeze the
expert and use it as a guiding prior to train a lightweight, Dynamics-Aware
Refiner via online reinforcement learning. This refiner rapidly learns to
compensate for the target robot's specific dynamics and controller
imperfections with minimal environmental interaction. Extensive experiments on
quadrupeds, bipeds, and quadrotors show that CE-Nav achieves state-of-the-art
performance while drastically reducing adaptation cost. Successful real-world
deployments further validate our approach as an efficient and scalable solution
for building generalizable navigation systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes using simulated annealing with a Boltzmann distribution to gradually shift from uniform to optimal sampling distribution for multi-robot active information acquisition, improving both transient and asymptotic entropy compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To maintain consistent acquisition quality across all regions by keeping relative uncertainty at the same level, while dealing with unknown and initially unreliable noise level estimates that can cause fluctuating values.

Method: Using simulated annealing to generate target sampling distribution, starting from uniform and gradually shifting to estimated optimal distribution by varying the coldness parameter of a Boltzmann distribution with estimated sampling entropy as energy.

Result: Simulation results show substantial improvement in both transient and asymptotic entropy compared to uniform and direct-ergodic searches. Physical validation with TurtleBot swarm system demonstrates practical applicability.

Conclusion: The proposed simulated annealing approach effectively handles unknown sampling noise levels and improves information acquisition performance in multi-robot systems, with both simulation and physical validation confirming its effectiveness.

Abstract: One of the goals of active information acquisition using multi-robot teams is
to keep the relative uncertainty in each region at the same level to maintain
identical acquisition quality (e.g., consistent target detection) in all the
regions. To achieve this goal, ergodic coverage can be used to assign the
number of samples according to the quality of observation, i.e., sampling noise
levels. However, the noise levels are unknown to the robots. Although this
noise can be estimated from samples, the estimates are unreliable at first and
can generate fluctuating values. The main contribution of this paper is to use
simulated annealing to generate the target sampling distribution, starting from
uniform and gradually shifting to an estimated optimal distribution, by varying
the coldness parameter of a Boltzmann distribution with the estimated sampling
entropy as energy. Simulation results show a substantial improvement of both
transient and asymptotic entropy compared to both uniform and direct-ergodic
searches. Finally, a demonstration is performed with a TurtleBot swarm system
to validate the physical applicability of the algorithm.

*Ye Chen,Zichen Zhou,Jianyu Dou,Te Cui,Yi Yang,Yufeng Yue*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GLUE is a global-local unified encoding framework for robotic imitation learning that uses text-guided key-patch tracking to address covariate shift in complex OOD environments with clutter and occlusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global visual representations in imitation learning suffer from diluted attention in complex OOD settings with clutter and occlusion, leading to degraded policy performance. Local representations offer invariance for task-relevant objects but need effective integration.

Method: GLUE selects and tracks key-patches using text-guided mechanism, then fuses global and local features through a novel framework where global patches query local patches to distill essential information, creating fine-grained local features with low heterogeneity.

Result: GLUE outperforms strongest baselines by 17.6% in simulation, 36.3% in real-world environments, and 58.3% on real-world generalization settings across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: The global-local unified encoding framework effectively aligns training and testing distributions into similar feature spaces, enhancing imitation learning policy robustness by steering visual attention to task-relevant objects while preserving global context.

Abstract: In recent years, visual representation learning has gained widespread
attention in robotic imitation learning. However, in complex
Out-of-Distribution(OOD) settings characterized by clutter and occlusion, the
attention of global visual representations can be diluted or interfered,
leading to degraded policy performance. The invariance of local representations
for task-relevant objects offers a solution. By efficiently utilizing these
local representations, training and testing data can be mapped to a more
similar feature space, thereby mitigating the covariate shift problem.
Accordingly, we propose GLUE, a global-local unified encoding framework for
imitation learning based on key-patch tracking. GLUE selects and tracks
key-patches as critical local representations by employing a text-guided
mechanism. It features a novel fusion framework where global patch features
query local patches to distill essential information, yielding fine-grained
local features with low heterogeneity relative to the global context. This
fused representation steers the robot's visual attention toward task-relevant
objects and preserves precise global context, which together align the training
and testing distributions into a similar and task-informative feature space,
ultimately enhancing the robustness of the imitation learning policy.
Experiments demonstrate that GLUE achieves strong performance across diverse
tasks in both simulation and real-world settings, outperforming the strongest
baseline by 17.6% in simulation, 36.3% in real-world environments, and 58.3% on
real-world generalization settings. The project website of GLUE is available at

*Aoqian Zhang,Zixuan Zhuang,Chunzheng Wang,Shuzhi Sam Ge,Fan Shi,Cheng Xiang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A switched policy framework for quadruped robots that combines force compliance with safety mechanisms to handle large external disturbances, using reinforcement learning and capture point concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quadruped control methods lack adaptive and adjustable compliance like animals, and often fail under large perturbations. There's a need for controllers that provide tunable compliance while ensuring safety.

Method: 1) Train a force compliant policy with adjustable compliance levels using teacher-student RL without explicit force sensing. 2) Develop a safe policy based on capture point concept for stabilization. 3) Use a recoverability network to predict failure likelihood and switch between compliant and safe policies.

Result: The framework enables quadruped robots to achieve both force compliance and robust safety when subjected to severe external disturbances, overcoming limitations of existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed switched policy framework successfully provides quadruped robots with animal-like adaptive compliance while maintaining safety through intelligent policy switching, addressing key limitations in current locomotion control approaches.

Abstract: Quadruped robots are designed to achieve agile locomotion by mimicking legged
animals. However, existing control methods for quadrupeds often lack one of the
key capabilities observed in animals: adaptive and adjustable compliance in
response to external disturbances. Most locomotion controllers do not provide
tunable compliance and tend to fail under large perturbations. In this work, we
propose a switched policy framework for compliant and safe quadruped
locomotion. First, we train a force compliant policy with adjustable compliance
levels using a teacher student reinforcement learning framework, eliminating
the need for explicit force sensing. Next, we develop a safe policy based on
the capture point concept to stabilize the robot when the compliant policy
fails. Finally, we introduce a recoverability network that predicts the
likelihood of failure and switches between the compliant and safe policies.
Together, this framework enables quadruped robots to achieve both force
compliance and robust safety when subjected to severe external disturbances.

*Kohei Sendai,Maxime Alvarez,Tatsuya Matsushima,Yutaka Matsuo,Yusuke Iwasawa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A2C2 is a lightweight real-time correction module that improves VLA models' reactivity by adding time-aware corrections to action chunks without retraining the base policy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action models using action chunking suffer from poor reactivity under inference delay and long horizons, which limits their real-time deployment effectiveness.

Method: A lightweight correction head that runs every control step, combining latest observation, predicted VLA action, positional features, and base policy features to output per-step corrections.

Result: Consistent success rate improvements across increasing delays and execution horizons (+23% and +7% respectively vs RTC), with minimal overhead and improved robustness for long horizons.

Conclusion: A2C2 is an effective plug-in mechanism for deploying high-capacity chunking policies in real-time control, preserving base model competence while restoring closed-loop responsiveness.

Abstract: To improve efficiency and temporal coherence, Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models often predict action chunks; however, this action chunking harms
reactivity under inference delay and long horizons. We introduce Asynchronous
Action Chunk Correction (A2C2), which is a lightweight real-time chunk
correction head that runs every control step and adds a time-aware correction
to any off-the-shelf VLA's action chunk. The module combines the latest
observation, the predicted action from VLA (base action), a positional feature
that encodes the index of the base action within the chunk, and some features
from the base policy, then outputs a per-step correction. This preserves the
base model's competence while restoring closed-loop responsiveness. The
approach requires no retraining of the base policy and is orthogonal to
asynchronous execution schemes such as Real Time Chunking (RTC). On the dynamic
Kinetix task suite (12 tasks) and LIBERO Spatial, our method yields consistent
success rate improvements across increasing delays and execution horizons (+23%
point and +7% point respectively, compared to RTC), and also improves
robustness for long horizons even with zero injected delay. Since the
correction head is small and fast, there is minimal overhead compared to the
inference of large VLA models. These results indicate that A2C2 is an
effective, plug-in mechanism for deploying high-capacity chunking policies in
real-time control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Goal Recognition research is fragmented due to inconsistencies in benchmarks, domains, and evaluation protocols, making it difficult to compare and advance algorithms effectively.

Method: Developed two complementary frameworks: gr-libs (modular implementations of MDP-based GR baselines, diagnostic tools, and evaluation utilities) and gr-envs (curated suite of environments for goal-directed behavior with RL toolkit compatibility wrappers).

Result: Created standardized, extensible, and reproducible platforms that support development, evaluation, and comparison of GR algorithms in Gym-compatible environments.

Conclusion: These open-source frameworks provide a unified platform to advance Goal Recognition research by addressing current fragmentation issues and enabling better algorithm comparison and development.

Abstract: Goal Recognition (GR) is the task of inferring an agent's intended goal from
partial observations of its behavior, typically in an online and one-shot
setting. Despite recent advances in model-free GR, particularly in applications
such as human-robot interaction, surveillance, and assistive systems, the field
remains fragmented due to inconsistencies in benchmarks, domains, and
evaluation protocols.
  To address this, we introduce gr-libs
(https://github.com/MatanShamir1/gr_libs) and gr-envs
(https://github.com/MatanShamir1/gr_envs), two complementary open-source
frameworks that support the development, evaluation, and comparison of GR
algorithms in Gym-compatible environments. gr-libs includes modular
implementations of MDP-based GR baselines, diagnostic tools, and evaluation
utilities. gr-envs provides a curated suite of environments adapted for dynamic
and goal-directed behavior, along with wrappers that ensure compatibility with
standard reinforcement learning toolkits. Together, these libraries offer a
standardized, extensible, and reproducible platform for advancing GR research.
Both packages are open-source and available on GitHub and PyPI.

Motivation: LLMs and VLMs deployed in robotic environments are vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that bypass safety mechanisms, potentially causing unsafe or harmful behaviors. Existing data-driven defenses struggle with generalization in domains where specialized datasets are scarce.

Method: J-DAPT integrates textual and visual embeddings using attention-based fusion to capture semantic intent and environmental grounding. It aligns general-purpose jailbreak datasets with domain-specific reference data through domain adaptation.

Result: Evaluations across autonomous driving, maritime robotics, and quadruped navigation show J-DAPT boosts detection accuracy to nearly 100% with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: J-DAPT provides a practical defense for securing VLMs in robotic applications by effectively detecting jailbreak attempts while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are
increasingly deployed in robotic environments but remain vulnerable to
jailbreaking attacks that bypass safety mechanisms and drive unsafe or
physically harmful behaviors in the real world. Data-driven defenses such as
jailbreak classifiers show promise, yet they struggle to generalize in domains
where specialized datasets are scarce, limiting their effectiveness in robotics
and other safety-critical contexts. To address this gap, we introduce J-DAPT, a
lightweight framework for multimodal jailbreak detection through
attention-based fusion and domain adaptation. J-DAPT integrates textual and
visual embeddings to capture both semantic intent and environmental grounding,
while aligning general-purpose jailbreak datasets with domain-specific
reference data. Evaluations across autonomous driving, maritime robotics, and

TL;DR: A novel path planning sampler that identifies narrow passages using occupancy grid maps and increases sampling in these regions, outperforming baseline methods in planning time and milestone count.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Probabilistic path planning methods struggle in narrow passage environments, which is a common problem across most existing approaches.

Method: Proposed a deterministic sampler that identifies narrow passages using occupancy grid maps and increases sampling density in these regions.

Result: The algorithm showed higher performance in planning time and number of milestones compared to baseline samplers in benchmark studies across specific simulations, random environments, and real-world testing.

Conclusion: The proposed narrow passage-aware sampler effectively addresses the common problem of probabilistic methods in constrained environments and provides improved path planning performance.

Abstract: Autonomous technology, which has become widespread today, appears in many
different configurations such as mobile robots, manipulators, and drones. One
of the most important tasks of these vehicles during autonomous operations is
path planning. In the literature, path planners are generally divided into two
categories: probabilistic and deterministic methods. In the analysis of
probabilistic methods, the common problem of almost all methods is observed in
narrow passage environments. In this paper, a novel sampler is proposed that
deterministically identifies narrow passage environments using occupancy grid
maps and accordingly increases the amount of sampling in these regions. The
codes of the algorithm is provided as open source. To evaluate the performance
of the algorithm, benchmark studies are conducted in three distinct categories:
specific and random simulation environments, and a real-world environment. As a
result, it is observed that our algorithm provides higher performance in
planning time and number of milestones compared to the baseline samplers.

*Jun Chen,Jiaqing Ma,Philip Dames*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel motion planning framework that integrates frontier-based exploration, guaranteed coverage using Lloyd's algorithm, and sensor-based multi-target tracking to simultaneously optimize environmental exploration and target tracking in unknown non-convex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research lacks a unified framework for simultaneously optimizing environmental exploration, information search, and target tracking in complex non-convex environments like indoor and underground spaces, which is crucial for applications like environmental monitoring and rescue operations.

Method: Proposes a motion planning algorithm that integrates three control strategies: frontier-based exploration, guaranteed coverage strategy based on Lloyd's algorithm, and sensor-based multi-target tracking strategy.

Result: The approach successfully balances coverage search and high-precision active tracking during exploration, as validated through MATLAB simulations showing validity and superiority over standard approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the fundamental challenge of simultaneous environmental exploration and target tracking in unknown non-convex environments, demonstrating improved performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: In unknown non-convex environments, such as indoor and underground spaces,
deploying a fleet of robots to explore the surroundings while simultaneously
searching for and tracking targets of interest to maintain high-precision data
collection represents a fundamental challenge that urgently requires resolution
in applications such as environmental monitoring and rescue operations. Current
research has made significant progress in addressing environmental exploration,
information search, and target tracking problems, but has yet to establish a
framework for simultaneously optimizing these tasks in complex environments. In
this paper, we propose a novel motion planning algorithm framework that
integrates three control strategies: a frontier-based exploration strategy, a
guaranteed coverage strategy based on Lloyd's algorithm, and a sensor-based
multi-target tracking strategy. By incorporating these three strategies, the
proposed algorithm balances coverage search and high-precision active tracking
during exploration. Our approach is validated through a series of MATLAB
simulations, demonstrating validity and superiority over standard approaches.

Abstract: The growing ambition for space exploration demands robust autonomous systems

*Arjun Sadananda,Ravi Banavar,Kavi Arya*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Incorporating TRIAD algorithm's sub-optimal attitude estimation feature to mitigate magnetometer disturbances in Manifold EKF for improved pitch and roll axis determination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Magnetometers used in attitude determination are sensitive to calibration errors and external magnetic field disturbances, which can degrade the performance of Manifold EKF algorithms.

Method: Integration of TRIAD (Tri-Axial Attitude Determination) algorithm's sub-optimal attitude estimation capability into the Manifold EKF framework to reduce magnetometer influence on pitch and roll axis calculations.

Result: Experimental validation demonstrates improved attitude determination performance by mitigating magnetometer disturbances.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid approach combining TRIAD with Manifold EKF effectively addresses magnetometer sensitivity issues in attitude estimation systems.

Abstract: The manifold extended Kalman filter (Manifold EKF) has found extensive
application for attitude determination. Magnetometers employed as sensors for
such attitude determination are easily prone to disturbances by their
sensitivity to calibration and external magnetic fields. The TRIAD (Tri-Axial
Attitude Determination) algorithm is well known as a sub-optimal attitude
estimator. In this article, we incorporate this sub-optimal feature of the
TRIAD in mitigating the influence of the magnetometer reading in the pitch and
roll axis determination in the Manifold EKF algorithm. We substantiate our
results with experiments.

*Haonan Chen,Jiaming Xu,Hongyu Chen,Kaiwen Hong,Binghao Huang,Chaoqi Liu,Jiayuan Mao,Yunzhu Li,Yilun Du,Katherine Driggs-Campbell*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A diffusion-based multimodal policy that factorizes into specialized single-modality models with adaptive routing, outperforming feature concatenation in manipulation tasks and showing robustness to perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature concatenation is suboptimal for multimodal integration as dominant modalities can overwhelm sparse but critical signals, and monolithic architectures lack flexibility for new or missing modalities without retraining.

Method: Factorizes policy into specialized diffusion models for single representations (vision, touch) with a router network that learns consensus weights to adaptively combine contributions, enabling incremental addition of new representations.

Result: Significantly outperforms feature-concatenation baselines on multimodal reasoning tasks in RLBench simulation and real-world tasks (occluded object picking, in-hand spoon reorientation, puzzle insertion), with robustness to physical perturbations and sensor corruption.

Conclusion: The factorized diffusion approach enables adaptive multimodal integration, outperforms standard concatenation methods, and reveals adaptive modality shifts through perturbation analysis.

Abstract: Effectively integrating diverse sensory modalities is crucial for robotic
manipulation. However, the typical approach of feature concatenation is often
suboptimal: dominant modalities such as vision can overwhelm sparse but
critical signals like touch in contact-rich tasks, and monolithic architectures
cannot flexibly incorporate new or missing modalities without retraining. Our
method factorizes the policy into a set of diffusion models, each specialized
for a single representation (e.g., vision or touch), and employs a router
network that learns consensus weights to adaptively combine their
contributions, enabling incremental of new representations. We evaluate our
approach on simulated manipulation tasks in {RLBench}, as well as real-world
tasks such as occluded object picking, in-hand spoon reorientation, and puzzle
insertion, where it significantly outperforms feature-concatenation baselines
on scenarios requiring multimodal reasoning. Our policy further demonstrates
robustness to physical perturbations and sensor corruption. We further conduct
perturbation-based importance analysis, which reveals adaptive shifts between
modalities.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A decentralized framework using LLMs and STL for robots to request and provide help, achieving near-Oracle performance in minimizing system makespan without centralized control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for seamless collaboration in heterogeneous robot teams to resolve unforeseen conflicts in deployments like warehousing.

Method: Robots use LLMs to detect conflicts and request help via natural language. Helpers use LLMs grounded in STL with BNF grammar to translate NL to STL, then solve as MILP. Requester selects helper based on minimizing system task completion time.

Result: Framework significantly outperforms nearest-robot heuristic and achieves performance comparable to centralized Oracle baseline without heavy information demands.

Conclusion: The decentralized approach enables effective robot collaboration with minimal communication overhead, making it suitable for real-world heterogeneous robot teams.

Abstract: Increased robot deployment, such as in warehousing, has revealed a need for
seamless collaboration among heterogeneous robot teams to resolve unforeseen
conflicts. To address this challenge, we propose a novel decentralized
framework that enables robots to request and provide help. The process begins
when a robot detects a conflict and uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to decide
whether external assistance is required. If so, it crafts and broadcasts a
natural language (NL) help request. Potential helper robots reason over the
request and respond with offers of assistance, including information about the
effect on their ongoing tasks. Helper reasoning is implemented via an LLM
grounded in Signal Temporal Logic (STL) using a Backus-Naur Form (BNF) grammar,
ensuring syntactically valid NL-to-STL translations, which are then solved as a
Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). Finally, the requester robot selects a
helper by reasoning over the expected increase in system-level total task
completion time. We evaluated our framework through experiments comparing
different helper-selection strategies and found that considering multiple
offers allows the requester to minimize added makespan. Our approach
significantly outperforms heuristics such as selecting the nearest available
candidate helper robot, and achieves performance comparable to a centralized
"Oracle" baseline but without heavy information demands.

*Curtis C. Johnson,Carlo Alessi,Egidio Falotico,Marc D. Killpack*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a fast simulation framework for soft robot whole-body manipulation that enables zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, achieving 88% success rate on hardware with 10kg payloads using two continuum soft arms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft robots are well-suited for whole-body manipulation due to their passive compliance, but their kinematic and dynamic uncertainties pose challenges for simulation and control. The goal is to enable forceful, six-DoF manipulation using continuum soft arms.

Method: Developed a fast simulation framework running up to 350x real-time in MuJoCo, used reinforcement learning guided by motion primitives (instead of standard reward shaping) to learn whole-body manipulation policies, and demonstrated zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.

Result: Achieved 88% success rate on Baloo hardware platform with 10kg payloads, showing the learned policy exhibits beneficial reactive behaviors like re-grasping and perturbation recovery, though it can also show aggressive over-corrections.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the first successful forceful six-DoF whole-body manipulation using two continuum soft arms with zero-shot policy transfer, showing that motion primitive guidance is crucial for learning stable policies where standard methods fail.

Abstract: Whole-body manipulation is a powerful yet underexplored approach that enables
robots to interact with large, heavy, or awkward objects using more than just
their end-effectors. Soft robots, with their inherent passive compliance, are
particularly well-suited for such contact-rich manipulation tasks, but their
uncertainties in kinematics and dynamics pose significant challenges for
simulation and control. In this work, we address this challenge with a
simulation that can run up to 350x real time on a single thread in MuJoCo and
provide a detailed analysis of the critical tradeoffs between speed and
accuracy for this simulation. Using this framework, we demonstrate a successful
zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of a learned whole-body manipulation policy,
achieving an 88% success rate on the Baloo hardware platform. We show that
guiding RL with a simple motion primitive is critical to this success where
standard reward shaping methods struggled to produce a stable and successful
policy for whole-body manipulation. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the
learned policy does not simply mimic the motion primitive. It exhibits
beneficial reactive behavior, such as re-grasping and perturbation recovery. We
analyze and contrast this learned policy against an open-loop baseline to show
that the policy can also exhibit aggressive over-corrections under
perturbation. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of forceful,
six-DoF whole-body manipulation using two continuum soft arms on a large-scale
platform (10 kg payloads), with zero-shot policy transfer.

*Jianren Wang,Jie Han,Abhinav Gupta,Deepak Pathak,Yang Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a micro-scale axial-flux permanent-magnet motor using PCB windings with HDI technology to achieve high copper fill (45%) in a compact 19mm diameter package, overcoming limitations of conventional wound stators for quasi-direct-drive robotics applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quasi-direct-drive actuation requires motors with high torque at low speeds in thin, disc-shaped joints, but scaling axial-flux permanent-magnet machines below 20mm diameter is limited by poor copper fill in conventional stators, which increases resistance and reduces continuous torque.

Method: The authors use printed-circuit-board windings fabricated with advanced IC-substrate high-density interconnect technology, creating a 48-layer stator by stacking four 12-layer HDI modules to achieve high copper fill in a compact form factor.

Result: The prototype motor achieves a record 45% copper fill in a package only 5mm thick and 19mm in diameter, with performance characteristics verified through comprehensive electromagnetic and thermal analyses and experimental testing.

Conclusion: The PCB winding approach with HDI technology successfully enables micro-scale AFPM motors that meet the demanding requirements of quasi-direct-drive robotics, overcoming the copper fill limitations of conventional manufacturing methods.

Abstract: Quasi-direct-drive (QDD) actuation is transforming legged and manipulator
robots by eliminating high-ratio gearboxes, yet it demands motors that deliver
very high torque at low speed within a thin, disc-shaped joint envelope.
Axial-flux permanent-magnet (AFPM) machines meet these geometric and torque
requirements, but scaling them below a 20mm outer diameter is hampered by poor
copper fill in conventional wound stators, inflating resistance and throttling
continuous torque. This paper introduces a micro-scale AFPM motor that
overcomes these limitations through printed-circuit-board (PCB) windings
fabricated with advanced IC-substrate high-density interconnect (HDI)
technology. The resulting 48-layer stator-formed by stacking four 12-layer HDI
modules-achieves a record 45\% copper fill in a package only 5mm thick and 19mm
in diameter. We perform comprehensive electromagnetic and thermal analyses to
inform the motor design, then fabricate a prototype whose performance
characteristics are experimentally verified.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RAVEN is a 3D memory-based behavior tree framework for aerial semantic navigation in outdoor environments that combines semantic voxel-ray mapping with large vision-language models to enable long-range search and overcome limitations of reactive policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic navigation methods are limited to indoor settings with constrained spatial ranges and structured layouts, while outdoor approaches either use reactive policies that produce short-sighted behaviors or rely on precomputed scene graphs that lack adaptability for online deployment.

Method: RAVEN uses a spatially consistent semantic voxel-ray map as persistent memory, combines short-range voxel search and long-range ray search for scalability, leverages large vision-language models to suggest auxiliary cues, and coordinates these components through a behavior tree that adaptively switches behaviors.

Result: RAVEN outperforms baselines by 85.25% in simulation across 10 photorealistic outdoor environments over 100 semantic tasks, and demonstrates real-world applicability through successful deployment on an aerial robot in outdoor field tests.

Conclusion: RAVEN provides an effective solution for long-range aerial semantic navigation in unstructured outdoor environments by combining persistent 3D memory, scalable search strategies, and adaptive behavior coordination through behavior trees.

Abstract: Aerial outdoor semantic navigation requires robots to explore large,
unstructured environments to locate target objects. Recent advances in semantic
navigation have demonstrated open-set object-goal navigation in indoor
settings, but these methods remain limited by constrained spatial ranges and
structured layouts, making them unsuitable for long-range outdoor search. While
outdoor semantic navigation approaches exist, they either rely on reactive
policies based on current observations, which tend to produce short-sighted
behaviors, or precompute scene graphs offline for navigation, limiting
adaptability to online deployment. We present RAVEN, a 3D memory-based,
behavior tree framework for aerial semantic navigation in unstructured outdoor
environments. It (1) uses a spatially consistent semantic voxel-ray map as
persistent memory, enabling long-horizon planning and avoiding purely reactive
behaviors, (2) combines short-range voxel search and long-range ray search to
scale to large environments, (3) leverages a large vision-language model to
suggest auxiliary cues, mitigating sparsity of outdoor targets. These
components are coordinated by a behavior tree, which adaptively switches
behaviors for robust operation. We evaluate RAVEN in 10 photorealistic outdoor
simulation environments over 100 semantic tasks, encompassing single-object
search, multi-class, multi-instance navigation and sequential task changes.
Results show RAVEN outperforms baselines by 85.25% in simulation and
demonstrate its real-world applicability through deployment on an aerial robot
in outdoor field tests.

Motivation: Existing reinforcement learning methods for dexterous grasping often result in unnatural behaviors, limiting real-world robotic manipulation capabilities.

Method: Created ContactGrasp dataset with 773 objects across 82 categories, then developed Geometry-based Expert Selection (GES) framework that clusters objects by shape and selects specialized experts for different geometries.

Result: Achieved 99.4% success rate on training set and 96.3% on test set, demonstrating natural grasp postures and strong generalization across object categories.

Conclusion: The approach enables robust, human-like dexterous grasping with high success rates and good generalization to diverse object shapes and categories.

Abstract: Robust and human-like dexterous grasping of general objects is a critical
capability for advancing intelligent robotic manipulation in real-world

priors often result in unnatural behaviors. In this work, we present
\textit{ContactGrasp}, a robotic dexterous pre-grasp and grasp dataset that
explicitly accounts for task-relevant wrist orientation and thumb-index
pinching coordination. The dataset covers 773 objects in 82 categories,
providing a rich foundation for training human-like grasp strategies. Building
upon this dataset, we perform geometry-based clustering to group objects by
shape, enabling a two-stage Geometry-based Expert Selection (GES) framework
that selects among specialized experts for grasping diverse object geometries,
thereby enhancing adaptability to diverse shapes and generalization across
categories. Our approach demonstrates natural grasp postures and achieves high
success rates of 99.4\% and 96.3\% on the train and test sets, respectively,
showcasing strong generalization and high-quality grasp execution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hierarchical coarse-to-fine policies in robotic 3D manipulation suffer from generalization issues despite using pre-trained models, limiting their ability to handle novel instructions and environment variations.

Method: Proposes CLAP framework with three key components: 1) task decomposition, 2) VLM fine-tuning for 3D keypoint prediction, and 3) 3D-aware representation to enhance generalization capabilities.

Result: Achieves 12% higher average success rate than SOTA on GemBench benchmark while using only 1/5 of training trajectories. In real-world experiments, trained on only 10 demonstrations, successfully generalizes to novel instructions and environments.

Conclusion: CLAP demonstrates superior generalization capability in robotic 3D manipulation tasks, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods with much less training data in both simulation and real-world settings.

Abstract: Hierarchical coarse-to-fine policy, where a coarse branch predicts a region
of interest to guide a fine-grained action predictor, has demonstrated
significant potential in robotic 3D manipulation tasks by especially enhancing
sample efficiency and enabling more precise manipulation. However, even
augmented with pre-trained models, these hierarchical policies still suffer
from generalization issues. To enhance generalization to novel instructions and
environment variations, we propose Coarse-to-fine Language-Aligned manipulation
Policy (CLAP), a framework that integrates three key components: 1) task
decomposition, 2) VLM fine-tuning for 3D keypoint prediction, and 3) 3D-aware
representation. Through comprehensive experiments in simulation and on a real
robot, we demonstrate its superior generalization capability. Specifically, on
GemBench, a benchmark designed for evaluating generalization, our approach
achieves a 12\% higher average success rate than the SOTA method while using
only 1/5 of the training trajectories. In real-world experiments, our policy,
trained on only 10 demonstrations, successfully generalizes to novel
instructions and environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a formal definition of material safety for soft robots based on strain energy functions and develops a controller using high-order control barrier functions to enforce safety constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As soft robotics moves toward practical applications with feedback control, there's a need to formally define safety beyond the informal notion that soft robots are inherently safer than rigid robots due to their compliance.

Method: The authors characterize safe and unsafe sets for incompressible hyperelastic materials and develop a controller using high-order control barrier functions (HOCBF) with quadratic program-based feedback control. They demonstrate this on a pressurized hyperelastic tube model with inertial effects, viscous effects, and full-state feedback.

Result: Simulation results verify that the proposed methodology can successfully enforce the material safety specification, preventing material failure while maintaining useful functionality.

Conclusion: The work provides a formal framework for ensuring material safety in soft robots, addressing the inherent challenges of constitutive model accuracy and material failure risks through provably safe control strategies.

Abstract: Until recently, the concept of soft robot safety was an informal notion,
often attributed solely to the fact that soft robots are less likely to damage
their operating environment than rigid robots. As the field moves toward
feedback control for practical applications, it becomes increasingly important
to define what safety means and to characterize how soft robots can become
unsafe. The unifying theme of soft robotics is to achieve useful functionality
through deformation. Consequently, limitations in constitutive model accuracy
and risks of material failure are inherent to all soft robots and pose a key
challenge in designing provably safe controllers. This work introduces a formal
definition of material safety based on strain energy functions and provides a
controller that enforces it. We characterize safe and unsafe sets of an
incompressible hyperelastic material and demonstrate that safety can be
enforced using a high-order control barrier function (HOCBF) with quadratic
program-based feedback control. As a case study, we consider a pressurized
hyperelastic tube with inertial effects, first-order viscous effects, and
full-state feedback. Simulation results verify that the proposed methodology
can enforce the material safety specification.

TL;DR: KiVi is a Kinesthetic-Visuospatial integration framework for legged robots that separates proprioception and vision pathways, using proprioception as a stable backbone while selectively incorporating vision for terrain awareness and obstacle avoidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-based locomotion is vulnerable to occlusions, reflections, and lighting changes, causing instability. Inspired by animal sensorimotor integration, the authors aim to create a more robust system that can handle visual fragility.

Method: KiVi separates kinesthetic (proprioceptive sensing) and visuospatial (visual perception) pathways, using proprioception as the stable backbone while selectively incorporating vision. It employs modality-balanced design with memory-enhanced attention to robustly interpret visual cues while maintaining fallback stability through proprioception.

Result: Extensive experiments show quadruped robots can stably traverse diverse terrains and operate reliably in unstructured outdoor environments. The system remains robust to out-of-distribution visual noise and occlusion unseen during training.

Conclusion: KiVi demonstrates effectiveness and applicability to real-world legged locomotion by providing robust performance even when visual information is compromised, highlighting the importance of balanced sensor integration.

Abstract: Vision-based locomotion has shown great promise in enabling legged robots to
perceive and adapt to complex environments. However, visual information is
inherently fragile, being vulnerable to occlusions, reflections, and lighting
changes, which often cause instability in locomotion. Inspired by animal
sensorimotor integration, we propose KiVi, a Kinesthetic-Visuospatial
integration framework, where kinesthetics encodes proprioceptive sensing of
body motion and visuospatial reasoning captures visual perception of
surrounding terrain. Specifically, KiVi separates these pathways, leveraging
proprioception as a stable backbone while selectively incorporating vision for
terrain awareness and obstacle avoidance. This modality-balanced, yet
integrative design, combined with memory-enhanced attention, allows the robot
to robustly interpret visual cues while maintaining fallback stability through
proprioception. Extensive experiments show that our method enables quadruped
robots to stably traverse diverse terrains and operate reliably in unstructured
outdoor environments, remaining robust to out-of-distribution (OOD) visual
noise and occlusion unseen during training, thereby highlighting its
effectiveness and applicability to real-world legged locomotion.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HeLoM is a hierarchical whole-body manipulation framework for hexapod robots that enables stable pushing of heavy objects through coordinated multi-limb control, trained in simulation and deployed directly on real robots without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots need to manipulate objects comparable to their own weight, and pushing provides a more efficient non-prehensile strategy than grasping, but requires maintaining stability while exerting sufficient force, especially for heavy or irregular objects.

Method: A learning-based hierarchical framework with high-level planner for pushing behaviors and target poses, and low-level controller for locomotion stability and joint actions. Uses coordinated multi-limb control inspired by insects, leveraging redundant contact points and degrees of freedom for dynamic force redistribution.

Result: The framework successfully enables hexapod robots to stably push boxes of varying sizes and unknown physical properties to designated goal poses in real-world experiments, with policies trained in simulation working directly on real robots.

Conclusion: HeLoM demonstrates effective whole-body manipulation through coordinated multi-limb control, allowing stable pushing of heavy objects while maintaining balance, with successful sim-to-real transfer without additional fine-tuning.

Abstract: Robots in real-world environments are often required to move/manipulate
objects comparable in weight to their own bodies. Compared to grasping and
carrying, pushing provides a more straightforward and efficient non-prehensile
manipulation strategy, avoiding complex grasp design while leveraging direct
contact to regulate an object's pose. Achieving effective pushing, however,
demands both sufficient manipulation forces and the ability to maintain
stability, which is particularly challenging when dealing with heavy or
irregular objects. To address these challenges, we propose HeLoM, a
learning-based hierarchical whole-body manipulation framework for a hexapod
robot that exploits coordinated multi-limb control. Inspired by the cooperative
strategies of multi-legged insects, our framework leverages redundant contact
points and high degrees of freedom to enable dynamic redistribution of contact
forces. HeLoM's high-level planner plans pushing behaviors and target object
poses, while its low-level controller maintains locomotion stability and
generates dynamically consistent joint actions. Our policies trained in
simulation are directly deployed on real robots without additional fine-tuning.
This design allows the robot to maintain balance while exerting continuous and
controllable pushing forces through coordinated foreleg interaction and
supportive hind-leg propulsion. We validate the effectiveness of HeLoM through
both simulation and real-world experiments. Results show that our framework can
stably push boxes of varying sizes and unknown physical properties to

### [537] [Focusing on What Matters: Object-Agent-centric Tokenization for Vision Language Action models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23655)
*Rokas Bendikas,Daniel Dijkman,Markus Peschl,Sanjay Haresh,Pietro Mazzaglia*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Oat-VLA introduces object-agent-centric tokenization to reduce computational costs in Vision-Language-Action models while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language-Action models have high computational costs due to inefficient visual tokenization schemes when adapting Vision-Language Models for robotics.

Method: Proposes Oat-VLA with object-agent-centric tokenization that introduces inductive bias towards scene objects and agent's visual information, drastically reducing visual tokens.

Result: Oat-VLA converges at least twice as fast as OpenVLA on LIBERO suite and outperforms OpenVLA in real-world pick and place tasks.

Conclusion: Object-agent-centric tokenization enables efficient VLA training with significantly reduced computational costs while maintaining or improving performance.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a pivotal approach to learning
robotic manipulation at scale by repurposing large pre-trained
Vision-Language-Models (VLM) to output robotic actions. However, adapting VLMs
for robotic domains comes with an unnecessarily high computational cost, which
we attribute to the tokenization scheme of visual inputs. In this work, we aim
to enable efficient VLA training by proposing Oat-VLA, an Object-Agent-centric
Tokenization for VLAs. Building on the insights of object-centric
representation learning, our method introduces an inductive bias towards scene
objects and the agent's own visual information. As a result, we find that
Oat-VLA can drastically reduce the number of visual tokens to just a few tokens
without sacrificing performance. We reveal that Oat-VLA converges at least
twice as fast as OpenVLA on the LIBERO suite, as well as outperform OpenVLA in
diverse real-world pick and place tasks.

### [538] [Certifiably Optimal State Estimation and Robot Calibration Using Trace-Constrained SDP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23656)
*Liangting Wu,Roberto Tron*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a trace-constrained semidefinite programming (SDP) framework for robotics problems, with a gradient-based refinement method to achieve rank-1 solutions and global optimality certification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many robotics problems are nonconvex but can be relaxed via SDP for global optimality; however, practical solutions require rank-1 matrices which need additional tightening methods.

Method: Introduces trace-constrained SDPs with customized fixed-trace variables for rotations/translations, plus a gradient-based refinement procedure to project solutions toward rank-1 candidates with global optimality certification via dual problems.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness in PnP estimation, hand-eye calibration, and dual-robot system calibration through simulations, with a modular "virtual robot" abstraction for easier modeling.

Conclusion: Trace-constrained SDP framework effectively handles various robotics tasks by ensuring rank-1 solutions and global optimality through specialized constraints and refinement procedures.

Abstract: Many nonconvex problems in robotics can be relaxed into convex formulations
via semidefinite programming (SDP), which offers the advantage of global
optimality. The practical quality of these solutions, however, critically
depends on achieving rank-1 matrices, a condition that typically requires
additional tightening. In this work, we focus on trace-constrained SDPs, where
the decision variables are positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices with fixed
trace values. These additional constraints not only capture important
structural properties but also facilitate first-order methods for recovering
rank-1 solutions. We introduce customized fixed-trace variables and constraints
to represent common robotic quantities such as rotations and translations,
which can be exactly recovered when the corresponding variables are rank-1. To
further improve practical performance, we develop a gradient-based refinement
procedure that projects relaxed SDP solutions toward rank-1, low-cost
candidates, which can then be certified for global optimality via the dual
problem. We demonstrate that many robotics tasks can be expressed within this
trace-constrained SDP framework, and showcase its effectiveness through
simulations in perspective-n-point (PnP) estimation, hand-eye calibration, and
dual-robot system calibration. To support broader use, we also introduce a
modular ``virtual robot'' abstraction that simplifies modeling across different
problem settings.

*Jun Chen,Mingjia Chen,Shinkyu Park*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel Multi-robot Dynamic Coverage Path Planning (MDCPP) algorithm that dynamically assigns coverage regions based on robots' remaining workload using Gaussian mixture models and capacity-constrained Voronoi diagrams, addressing speed adaptation and workload balancing issues in multi-robot coverage tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional multi-robot coverage path planning assumes fixed robot velocities, which is unrealistic in real-world applications and leads to imbalanced workload distribution and increased completion time.

Method: MDCPP dynamically estimates each robot's remaining workload by approximating target distribution with Gaussian mixture models, assigns coverage regions using capacity-constrained Voronoi diagram, and includes a distributed implementation for range-constrained robotic networks.

Result: Simulation results show qualitative improvements and superior performance compared to existing sweeping algorithm, with quantifiable impact of communication range on coverage efficiency.

Conclusion: MDCPP effectively addresses the limitations of conventional approaches by enabling dynamic speed adaptation and balanced workload distribution in multi-robot coverage tasks.

Abstract: Multi-robot Coverage Path Planning (MCPP) addresses the problem of computing
paths for multiple robots to effectively cover a large area of interest.
Conventional approaches to MCPP typically assume that robots move at fixed
velocities, which is often unrealistic in real-world applications where robots
must adapt their speeds based on the specific coverage tasks assigned to
them.Consequently, conventional approaches often lead to imbalanced workload
distribution among robots and increased completion time for coverage tasks. To
address this, we introduce a novel Multi-robot Dynamic Coverage Path Planning
(MDCPP) algorithm for complete coverage in two-dimensional environments. MDCPP
dynamically estimates each robot's remaining workload by approximating the
target distribution with Gaussian mixture models, and assigns coverage regions
using a capacity-constrained Voronoi diagram. We further develop a distributed
implementation of MDCPP for range-constrained robotic networks. Simulation
results validate the efficacy of MDCPP, showing qualitative improvements and
superior performance compared to an existing sweeping algorithm, and a
quantifiable impact of communication range on coverage efficiency.

*Chi Chu,Huazhe Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DA-MMP is a motion generation framework for dynamic manipulation that learns motion manifolds from planned trajectories and adapts them to real-world dynamics using conditional flow matching, achieving high success in ring-tossing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of manually designed action parameterizations in dynamic manipulation and the dynamics gap between planned and executed trajectories caused by control inaccuracies and environmental uncertainties.

Method: Extends motion manifold primitives to variable-length trajectories with compact parametrization, learns a high-quality manifold from planned motions, and trains a conditional flow matching model in latent space using real-world trials to account for execution dynamics.

Result: Achieves high success rates in real-world ring-tossing, surpassing trained human experts, and generalizes to novel targets beyond training range, demonstrating successful learning of trajectory-dynamics mapping.

Conclusion: DA-MMP effectively bridges the dynamics gap in dynamic manipulation tasks by combining motion planning with learned dynamics adaptation, enabling coordinated and smooth motion generation that transfers well to real-world execution.

Abstract: Dynamic manipulation is a key capability for advancing robot performance,
enabling skills such as tossing. While recent learning-based approaches have
pushed the field forward, most methods still rely on manually designed action
parameterizations, limiting their ability to produce the highly coordinated
motions required in complex tasks. Motion planning can generate feasible
trajectories, but the dynamics gap-stemming from control inaccuracies, contact
uncertainties, and aerodynamic effects-often causes large deviations between
planned and executed trajectories. In this work, we propose Dynamics-Aware
Motion Manifold Primitives (DA-MMP), a motion generation framework for
goal-conditioned dynamic manipulation, and instantiate it on a challenging
real-world ring-tossing task. Our approach extends motion manifold primitives
to variable-length trajectories through a compact parametrization and learns a
high-quality manifold from a large-scale dataset of planned motions. Building
on this manifold, a conditional flow matching model is trained in the latent
space with a small set of real-world trials, enabling the generation of
throwing trajectories that account for execution dynamics. Experiments show
that our method can generate coordinated and smooth motion trajectories for the
ring-tossing task. In real-world evaluations, it achieves high success rates
and even surpasses the performance of trained human experts. Moreover, it
generalizes to novel targets beyond the training range, indicating that it
successfully learns the underlying trajectory-dynamics mapping.

*Min Liu,Deepak Pathak,Ananye Agarwal*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LocoFormer is a generalist locomotion model that can control unseen legged and wheeled robots without precise kinematics knowledge, adapting to morphology and dynamics changes at test time through large-scale RL training and extended context length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern locomotion controllers are manually tuned for specific embodiments, lacking generalization across different robot morphologies and dynamics.

Method: Train massive scale RL on procedurally generated robots with aggressive domain randomization, and extend context length by orders of magnitude to span episode boundaries.

Result: LocoFormer shows robust control on varied robots with large disturbances (weight change, motor failures) and exhibits emergent adaptation across episodes, learning from falls to improve control strategies.

Conclusion: This simple yet general recipe can be used to train foundation models for other robotic skills, enabling adaptation to unseen embodiments without precise kinematic knowledge.

Abstract: Modern locomotion controllers are manually tuned for specific embodiments. We
present LocoFormer, a generalist omni-bodied locomotion model that can control
previously unseen legged and wheeled robots, even without precise knowledge of
their kinematics. LocoFormer is able to adapt to changes in morphology and
dynamics at test time. We find that two key choices enable adaptation. First,
we train massive scale RL on procedurally generated robots with aggressive
domain randomization. Second, in contrast to previous policies that are myopic
with short context lengths, we extend context by orders of magnitude to span
episode boundaries. We deploy the same LocoFormer to varied robots and show
robust control even with large disturbances such as weight change and motor
failures. In extreme scenarios, we see emergent adaptation across episodes,
LocoFormer learns from falls in early episodes to improve control strategies in
later ones. We believe that this simple, yet general recipe can be used to
train foundation models for other robotic skills in the future. Videos at

*Zeyuan Zhang,Chaoran Li,Shao Zhang,Ying Wen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SePar uses Transformer-based sequence modeling for Multi-Agent Pickup and Delivery tasks, achieving linear complexity and outperforming existing methods while generalizing to unseen environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based MAPD methods perform poorly in warehouse-like environments with narrow pathways when relying only on local observations, and communication learning introduces high computational complexity.

Method: Formulate MAPF as sequence modeling problem, prove order-invariant optimality, and propose SePar - a Transformer-based approach that enables implicit information exchange through sequence modeling.

Result: SePar consistently outperforms existing learning-based methods across various MAPF tasks and variants, generalizes well to unseen environments, and reduces decision-making complexity from exponential to linear.

Conclusion: Transformer-based sequence modeling effectively addresses MAPD challenges, and imitation learning is necessary for complex warehouse environments.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Pickup and Delivery (MAPD) is a challenging extension of
Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF), where agents are required to sequentially
complete tasks with fixed-location pickup and delivery demands. Although
learning-based methods have made progress in MAPD, they often perform poorly in
warehouse-like environments with narrow pathways and long corridors when
relying only on local observations for distributed decision-making.
Communication learning can alleviate the lack of global information but
introduce high computational complexity due to point-to-point communication. To
address this challenge, we formulate MAPF as a sequence modeling problem and
prove that path-finding policies under sequence modeling possess
order-invariant optimality, ensuring its effectiveness in MAPD. Building on
this, we propose the Sequential Pathfinder (SePar), which leverages the
Transformer paradigm to achieve implicit information exchange, reducing
decision-making complexity from exponential to linear while maintaining
efficiency and global awareness. Experiments demonstrate that SePar
consistently outperforms existing learning-based methods across various MAPF
tasks and their variants, and generalizes well to unseen environments.
Furthermore, we highlight the necessity of integrating imitation learning in
complex maps like warehouses.

Abstract: To address the need for high-precision localization of climbing robots in
complex high-altitude environments, this paper proposes a multi-sensor fusion
system that overcomes the limitations of single-sensor approaches. Firstly, the
localization scenarios and the problem model are analyzed. An integrated
architecture of Attention Mechanism-based Fusion Algorithm (AMFA) incorporating
planar array Ultra-Wideband (UWB), GPS, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and
barometer is designed to handle challenges such as GPS occlusion and UWB
Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) problem. Then, End-to-end neural network inference
models for UWB and barometer are developed, along with a multimodal attention
mechanism for adaptive data fusion. An Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is applied
to refine the trajectory, improving accuracy and robustness. Finally,
real-world experiments show that the method achieves 0.48 m localization
accuracy and lower MAX error of 1.50 m, outperforming baseline algorithms such
as GPS/INS-EKF and demonstrating stronger robustness.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DexFlyWheel is a scalable framework for generating diverse dexterous manipulation datasets through a self-improving cycle that combines imitation learning, residual reinforcement learning, and data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dexterous manipulation requires diverse, high-quality datasets, but existing methods are limited by human dependency, engineering overhead, or lack of diversity, restricting scalability and generalization.

Method: Uses iterative cycles with seed demonstrations, imitation learning to extract human behaviors, residual RL for generalization, rollout trajectory collection in simulation, and data augmentation across diverse environments.

Result: Generated over 2,000 diverse demonstrations across four challenging tasks, achieving 81.9% average success rate on test sets and 78.3% success rate on real-world dual-arm lift tasks via digital twin transfer.

Conclusion: The self-improving flywheel approach effectively scales policy performance by continuously enriching data diversity, enabling successful real-world transfer of dexterous manipulation skills.

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation is critical for advancing robot capabilities in
real-world applications, yet diverse and high-quality datasets remain scarce.
Existing data collection methods either rely on human teleoperation or require
significant human engineering, or generate data with limited diversity, which
restricts their scalability and generalization. In this paper, we introduce
DexFlyWheel, a scalable data generation framework that employs a self-improving
cycle to continuously enrich data diversity. Starting from efficient seed
demonstrations warmup, DexFlyWheel expands the dataset through iterative
cycles. Each cycle follows a closed-loop pipeline that integrates Imitation
Learning (IL), residual Reinforcement Learning (RL), rollout trajectory
collection, and data augmentation. Specifically, IL extracts human-like
behaviors from demonstrations, and residual RL enhances policy generalization.
The learned policy is then used to generate trajectories in simulation, which
are further augmented across diverse environments and spatial configurations
before being fed back into the next cycle. Over successive iterations, a
self-improving data flywheel effect emerges, producing datasets that cover
diverse scenarios and thereby scaling policy performance. Experimental results
demonstrate that DexFlyWheel generates over 2,000 diverse demonstrations across
four challenging tasks. Policies trained on our dataset achieve an average
success rate of 81.9\% on the challenge test sets and successfully transfer to
the real world through digital twin, achieving a 78.3\% success rate on

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MAD-PINN is a decentralized physics-informed ML framework that solves multi-agent state-constrained optimal control problems, achieving superior safety-performance trade-offs and scalability through epigraph reformulation, reduced-agent training, and HJ reachability-based neighbor selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for multi-agent systems (MARL, safety filtering, MPC) lack strict safety guarantees, suffer from conservatism, or fail to scale effectively, creating a need for methods that can co-optimize safety and performance in large-scale systems.

Method: Uses epigraph-based reformulation of state-constrained optimal control problems, physics-informed neural networks for solution approximation, decentralized deployment with local observations, HJ reachability-based neighbor selection for safety prioritization, and receding-horizon policy execution for dynamic adaptation.

Result: Experiments on multi-agent navigation tasks show superior safety-performance trade-offs, maintained scalability with growing agent numbers, and consistent outperformance of state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: MAD-PINN provides an effective framework for decentralized multi-agent control that successfully addresses the fundamental challenge of co-optimizing safety and performance at scale.

Abstract: Co-optimizing safety and performance in large-scale multi-agent systems
remains a fundamental challenge. Existing approaches based on multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL), safety filtering, or Model Predictive Control
(MPC) either lack strict safety guarantees, suffer from conservatism, or fail
to scale effectively. We propose MAD-PINN, a decentralized physics-informed
machine learning framework for solving the multi-agent state-constrained
optimal control problem (MASC-OCP). Our method leverages an epigraph-based
reformulation of SC-OCP to simultaneously capture performance and safety, and
approximates its solution via a physics-informed neural network. Scalability is
achieved by training the SC-OCP value function on reduced-agent systems and
deploying them in a decentralized fashion, where each agent relies only on
local observations of its neighbours for decision-making. To further enhance
safety and efficiency, we introduce an Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability-based
neighbour selection strategy to prioritize safety-critical interactions, and a
receding-horizon policy execution scheme that adapts to dynamic interactions
while reducing computational burden. Experiments on multi-agent navigation
tasks demonstrate that MAD-PINN achieves superior safety-performance
trade-offs, maintains scalability as the number of agents grows, and
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Flash is a lightweight Visual Place Recognition system that uses sub-millisecond event camera data for fast place recognition, achieving 11.33x and 5.92x improvement in Recall@1 over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing event camera VPR methods rely on dense representations of sparse event data and require tens to hundreds of milliseconds of data, limiting their speed and efficiency.

Method: Flash encodes active pixel locations from event cameras using efficient binary frames and computes similarities via fast bitwise operations, with normalization based on relative event activity.

Result: Flash improves Recall@1 by 11.33x on QCR-Event-Dataset and 5.92x on Brisbane-Event-VPR dataset, while reducing localization latency through Time to Correct Match metric.

Conclusion: This is the first work to demonstrate sub-millisecond VPR using event cameras, significantly improving speed and reducing position awareness latency for autonomous navigation.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) enables systems to identify previously visited
locations within a map, a fundamental task for autonomous navigation. Prior
works have developed VPR solutions using event cameras, which asynchronously
measure per-pixel brightness changes with microsecond temporal resolution.
However, these approaches rely on dense representations of the inherently
sparse camera output and require tens to hundreds of milliseconds of event data
to predict a place. Here, we break this paradigm with Flash, a lightweight VPR
system that predicts places using sub-millisecond slices of event data. Our
method is based on the observation that active pixel locations provide strong
discriminative features for VPR. Flash encodes these active pixel locations
using efficient binary frames and computes similarities via fast bitwise
operations, which are then normalized based on the relative event activity in
the query and reference frames. Flash improves Recall@1 for sub-millisecond VPR
over existing baselines by 11.33x on the indoor QCR-Event-Dataset and 5.92x on
the 8 km Brisbane-Event-VPR dataset. Moreover, our approach reduces the
duration for which the robot must operate without awareness of its position, as
evidenced by a localization latency metric we term Time to Correct Match (TCM).
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate
sub-millisecond VPR using event cameras.

TL;DR: A linear-time diversity maintenance method for particle filtering that clusters particles based on ancestry tree topology to prevent premature convergence in multimodal environments while maintaining estimate compactness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To prevent premature convergence in multimodal environments during particle filtering without relying on domain-specific spatial metrics, and to maintain diversity efficiently.

Method: Clusters particles based on ancestry tree topology where closely related particles in large subtrees are grouped together, combined with intra-cluster fitness sharing and protection of unclustered particles.

Result: Achieves high success rates with minimal negative impact on compactness, showing robustness across different domains and challenging initial conditions compared to existing methods like Deterministic Resampling and Particle Gaussian Mixtures.

Conclusion: The ancestry tree-based clustering approach effectively maintains diversity in particle filtering while preserving estimate quality, demonstrating strong performance in both simulated and real-world multimodal environments.

Abstract: We propose a method for linear-time diversity maintenance in particle
filtering. It clusters particles based on ancestry tree topology: closely
related particles in sufficiently large subtrees are grouped together. The main
idea is that the tree structure implicitly encodes similarity without the need
for spatial or other domain-specific metrics. This approach, when combined with
intra-cluster fitness sharing and the protection of particles not included in a
cluster, effectively prevents premature convergence in multimodal environments
while maintaining estimate compactness. We validate our approach in a
multimodal robotics simulation and a real-world multimodal indoor environment.
We compare the performance to several diversity maintenance algorithms from the
literature, including Deterministic Resampling and Particle Gaussian Mixtures.
Our algorithm achieves high success rates with little to no negative effect on
compactness, showing particular robustness to different domains and challenging
initial conditions.

*Athanasios Bacharis,Konstantinos D. Polyzos,Georgios B. Giannakis,Nikolaos Papanikolopoulos*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel view planning framework using Bayesian optimization to efficiently determine optimal camera placements for 3D reconstruction in agricultural environments, handling noise and enabling generalization to similar unseen environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active vision is crucial for agricultural tasks like crop monitoring and harvesting. Traditional methods using many arbitrary images are inefficient, while view planning aims to capture fewer but more informative images. Challenges include camera/measurement noise and the need for generalization across similar environments without retraining.

Method: Proposes a reconstruction quality-based optimization framework using structure-from-motion for 3D reconstruction. Uses Bayesian optimization to efficiently solve the view planning problem with few function evaluations, handling cases with different noise levels.

Result: Numerical tests on simulated and real agricultural settings show the approach efficiently estimates optimal camera placement for accurate 3D reconstruction and generalizes well to similar unknown environments.

Conclusion: The Bayesian optimization-based view planning framework successfully addresses noise challenges and enables efficient 3D reconstruction with generalization capability, making it suitable for practical agricultural applications.

Abstract: Active vision (AV) has been in the spotlight of robotics research due to its
emergence in numerous applications including agricultural tasks such as
precision crop monitoring and autonomous harvesting to list a few. A major AV
problem that gained popularity is the 3D reconstruction of targeted
environments using 2D images from diverse viewpoints. While collecting and
processing a large number of arbitrarily captured 2D images can be arduous in
many practical scenarios, a more efficient solution involves optimizing the
placement of available cameras in 3D space to capture fewer, yet more
informative, images that provide sufficient visual information for effective
reconstruction of the environment of interest. This process termed as view
planning (VP), can be markedly challenged (i) by noise emerging in the location
of the cameras and/or in the extracted images, and (ii) by the need to
generalize well in other unknown similar agricultural environments without need
for re-optimizing or re-training. To cope with these challenges, the present
work presents a novel VP framework that considers a reconstruction
quality-based optimization formulation that relies on the notion of
`structure-from-motion' to reconstruct the 3D structure of the sought
environment from the selected 2D images. With no analytic expression of the
optimization function and with costly function evaluations, a Bayesian
optimization approach is proposed to efficiently carry out the VP process using
only a few function evaluations, while accounting for different noise cases.
Numerical tests on both simulated and real agricultural settings signify the
benefits of the advocated VP approach in efficiently estimating the optimal
camera placement to accurately reconstruct 3D environments of interest, and
generalize well on similar unknown environments.

*Priyanka Mandikal,Jiaheng Hu,Shivin Dass,Sagnik Majumder,Roberto Martín-Martín,Kristen Grauman*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPARTA is a unified framework for object state change manipulation tasks (like mashing, spreading, slicing) that uses spatially-progressing object change segmentation maps to generate structured policy observations and dense rewards, enabling efficient robot learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most robot manipulation focuses on kinematic state changes (picking, placing), but many real-world tasks involve progressive physical/visual state changes without position changes. Current approaches lack unified methods for this class of tasks.

Method: SPARTA integrates spatially progressing object change segmentation maps to perceive actionable vs. transformed regions. It generates structured policy observations (removing appearance variability) and dense rewards (capturing incremental progress). Two policy variants: RL for fine-grained control without demonstrations, and greedy control for fast deployment.

Result: Validated on real robot for 3 challenging tasks across 10 diverse real-world objects. Achieved significant improvements in training time and accuracy over sparse rewards and visual goal-conditioned baselines.

Conclusion: Progress-aware visual representations provide a versatile foundation for object state manipulation tasks, enabling efficient learning and deployment across diverse real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Most robot manipulation focuses on changing the kinematic state of objects:
picking, placing, opening, or rotating them. However, a wide range of
real-world manipulation tasks involve a different class of object state
change--such as mashing, spreading, or slicing--where the object's physical and
visual state evolve progressively without necessarily changing its position. We
present SPARTA, the first unified framework for the family of object state
change manipulation tasks. Our key insight is that these tasks share a common
structural pattern: they involve spatially-progressing, object-centric changes
that can be represented as regions transitioning from an actionable to a
transformed state. Building on this insight, SPARTA integrates spatially
progressing object change segmentation maps, a visual skill to perceive
actionable vs. transformed regions for specific object state change tasks, to
generate a) structured policy observations that strip away appearance
variability, and b) dense rewards that capture incremental progress over time.
These are leveraged in two SPARTA policy variants: reinforcement learning for
fine-grained control without demonstrations or simulation; and greedy control
for fast, lightweight deployment. We validate SPARTA on a real robot for three
challenging tasks across 10 diverse real-world objects, achieving significant
improvements in training time and accuracy over sparse rewards and visual
goal-conditioned baselines. Our results highlight progress-aware visual
representations as a versatile foundation for the broader family of object

### [552] [A Novel Model for 3D Motion Planning for a Generalized Dubins Vehicle with Pitch and Yaw Rate Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24143)
*Deepak Prakash Kumar,Swaroop Darbha,Satyanarayana Gupta Manyam,David Casbeer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A new 3D motion planning approach for fixed-wing UAVs that considers full orientation (roll, pitch, yaw) and uses two control inputs for bounded pitch/yaw rates, generating optimal paths faster than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods are insufficient because they only consider partial orientation (pitch and/or heading) and use single control inputs like path curvature, which cannot accurately model 3D kinematics of fixed-wing UAVs with full orientation requirements.

Method: Uses rotation minimizing frame to describe vehicle configuration, constructs paths by concatenating optimal Dubins paths on spherical, cylindrical, or planar surfaces, with two control inputs representing bounded pitch and yaw rates.

Result: Numerical simulations show the approach generates feasible paths within 10 seconds on average and produces shorter paths than existing methods in most cases.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses limitations of previous approaches by incorporating full vehicle orientation and dual control inputs, enabling more accurate 3D motion planning for fixed-wing UAVs with improved efficiency and path quality.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new modeling approach and a fast algorithm for 3D
motion planning, applicable for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles. The goal
is to construct the shortest path connecting given initial and final
configurations subject to motion constraints. Our work differs from existing
literature in two ways. First, we consider full vehicle orientation using a
body-attached frame, which includes roll, pitch, and yaw angles. However,
existing work uses only pitch and/or heading angle, which is insufficient to
uniquely determine orientation. Second, we use two control inputs to represent
bounded pitch and yaw rates, reflecting control by two separate actuators. In
contrast, most previous methods rely on a single input, such as path curvature,
which is insufficient for accurately modeling the vehicle's kinematics in 3D.
We use a rotation minimizing frame to describe the vehicle's configuration and
its evolution, and construct paths by concatenating optimal Dubins paths on
spherical, cylindrical, or planar surfaces. Numerical simulations show our
approach generates feasible paths within 10 seconds on average and yields
shorter paths than existing methods in most cases.

*Tomoyuki Kagaya,Subramanian Lakshmi,Yuxuan Lou,Thong Jing Yuan,Jayashree Karlekar,Sugiri Pranata,Natsuki Murakami,Akira Kinose,Yang You*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MTP is a framework that uses successful control-code examples from different environments as procedural knowledge to guide LLM-driven planning for robot manipulation, improving adaptability without model updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based robot manipulation methods struggle with environment adaptation, requiring specific policy training or fixed prompts that limit transferability and need manual re-tuning.

Method: MTP generates initial plan/code with LLMs, retrieves relevant successful examples from code memory, and contextually adapts retrieved code to target setting for re-planning without parameter updates.

Result: MTP consistently improved success rate and adaptability on RLBench, CALVIN, and physical robots compared to fixed-prompt generation, naive retrieval, and memory-free re-planning. Simulation memory also worked effectively in hardware experiments.

Conclusion: MTP provides a practical approach that exploits procedural knowledge for robust LLM-based planning across diverse robotic manipulation scenarios, enhancing adaptability to novel environments and bridging simulation-to-real deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly explored in robot manipulation,
but many existing methods struggle to adapt to new environments. Many systems
require either environment-specific policy training or depend on fixed prompts
and single-shot code generation, leading to limited transferability and manual
re-tuning. We introduce Memory Transfer Planning (MTP), a framework that
leverages successful control-code examples from different environments as
procedural knowledge, using them as in-context guidance for LLM-driven
planning. Specifically, MTP (i) generates an initial plan and code using LLMs,
(ii) retrieves relevant successful examples from a code memory, and (iii)
contextually adapts the retrieved code to the target setting for re-planning
without updating model parameters. We evaluate MTP on RLBench, CALVIN, and a
physical robot, demonstrating effectiveness beyond simulation. Across these
settings, MTP consistently improved success rate and adaptability compared with
fixed-prompt code generation, naive retrieval, and memory-free re-planning.
Furthermore, in hardware experiments, leveraging a memory constructed in
simulation proved effective. MTP provides a practical approach that exploits
procedural knowledge to realize robust LLM-based planning across diverse
robotic manipulation scenarios, enhancing adaptability to novel environments
and bridging simulation and real-world deployment.

*Wanming Yu,Adrian Röfer,Abhinav Valada,Sethu Vijayakumar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Multimodal LLMs are fine-tuned with custom stacking preference datasets to improve robotic manipulation planning for long-horizon container stacking tasks involving hidden physics properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pretrained LLMs lack knowledge and effectiveness in planning long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks requiring reasoning about physical properties like weight and stability, especially for container stacking with hidden objects.

Method: Use multimodal LLMs as high-level planners that take multimodal inputs for objects and infer stacking sequences by reasoning over preferences. Create custom dataset with stacking preferences (weight, stability, size, footprint) to fine-tune LLMs without explicit instructions.

Result: Fine-tuned LLMs show improved stacking completion compared to pretrained LLMs with prompt tuning, demonstrated through large-scale simulation evaluation. Framework effectiveness validated on real humanoid robot for online long-horizon stacking tasks.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning multimodal LLMs with custom stacking preference datasets enables effective planning for complex robotic manipulation tasks requiring reasoning about hidden physical properties.

Abstract: Pretrained large language models (LLMs) can work as high-level robotic
planners by reasoning over abstract task descriptions and natural language
instructions, etc. However, they have shown a lack of knowledge and
effectiveness in planning long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks where the
physical properties of the objects are essential. An example is the stacking of
containers with hidden objects inside, which involves reasoning over hidden
physics properties such as weight and stability. To this end, this paper
proposes to use multimodal LLMs as high-level planners for such long-horizon
robotic stacking tasks. The LLM takes multimodal inputs for each object to
stack and infers the current best stacking sequence by reasoning over stacking
preferences. Furthermore, in order to enable the LLM to reason over multiple
preferences at the same time without giving explicit instructions, we propose
to create a custom dataset considering stacking preferences including weight,
stability, size, and footprint, to fine-tune the LLM. Compared to the
pretrained LLM with prompt tuning, we demonstrate the improved stacking
completion of the LLM fine-tuned with our custom dataset via large-scale
simulation evaluation. Furthermore, we showcase the effectiveness of the
proposed framework for the long-horizon stacking task on a real humanoid robot
in an online manner.

*Tomoyuki Kagaya,Subramanian Lakshmi,Anbang Ye,Thong Jing Yuan,Jayashree Karlekar,Sugiri Pranata,Natsuki Murakami,Akira Kinose,Yang You*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ViReSkill is a framework that combines vision-grounded replanning with skill memory to enable robots to adapt quickly to new tasks through autonomous continual learning, outperforming conventional methods in task success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL/IL-trained robots adapt slowly to new tasks, while LLMs/VLMs offer knowledge-rich planning but face issues with geometric grounding and output reliability for motion planning.

Method: Pairs vision-grounded replanning with skill memory - replans actions based on current scene when failures occur, stores successful plans as reusable skills for future use without additional LLM/VLM calls.

Result: Consistently outperforms conventional baselines in task success rate across simulators (LIBERO, RLBench) and physical robot, demonstrating robust sim-to-real generalization.

Conclusion: ViReSkill enables autonomous continual learning where each attempt expands the skill set and stabilizes subsequent executions, providing a reliable framework for robot task adaptation.

Abstract: Robots trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) or Imitation Learning (IL)
often adapt slowly to new tasks, whereas recent Large Language Models (LLMs)
and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) promise knowledge-rich planning from minimal
data. Deploying LLMs/VLMs for motion planning, however, faces two key
obstacles: (i) symbolic plans are rarely grounded in scene geometry and object
physics, and (ii) model outputs can vary for identical prompts, undermining
execution reliability. We propose ViReSkill, a framework that pairs
vision-grounded replanning with a skill memory for accumulation and reuse. When
a failure occurs, the replanner generates a new action sequence conditioned on
the current scene, tailored to the observed state. On success, the executed
plan is stored as a reusable skill and replayed in future encounters without
additional calls to LLMs/VLMs. This feedback loop enables autonomous continual
learning: each attempt immediately expands the skill set and stabilizes
subsequent executions. We evaluate ViReSkill on simulators such as LIBERO and
RLBench as well as on a physical robot. Across all settings, it consistently
outperforms conventional baselines in task success rate, demonstrating robust
sim-to-real generalization.

*Xuan Lin,Jiming Ren,Yandong Luo,Weijun Xie,Ye Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Logic Network Flow is an optimization-based task and motion planning framework that integrates temporal logic into mixed-integer programs using network flow models with polyhedron constraints on edges, achieving significant computational speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Logic Tree formulations have limitations in efficiency for temporal logic planning, particularly for complex robot tasks requiring real-time performance under dynamic conditions.

Method: Encodes temporal predicates as polyhedron constraints on network flow edges, uses network-flow-based Fourier-Motzkin elimination to remove continuous variables while preserving convex relaxation tightness, and integrates temporal logic specifications into mixed-integer programs.

Result: Achieves computational speedups of up to several orders of magnitude in vehicle routing, multi-robot coordination, and temporal logic control tasks, with hardware demonstrations showing real-time replanning capabilities on quadrupedal robots.

Conclusion: The Logic Network Flow framework provides a more efficient and scalable approach to temporal logic planning with provably tighter convex relaxations and fewer constraints than traditional methods, enabling real-time robot planning in dynamic environments.

Abstract: This paper proposes an optimization-based task and motion planning framework,
named "Logic Network Flow", that integrates temporal logic specifications into
mixed-integer programs for efficient robot planning. Inspired by the
Graph-of-Convex-Sets formulation, temporal predicates are encoded as polyhedron
constraints on each edge of a network flow model, instead of as constraints
between nodes in traditional Logic Tree formulations. We further propose a
network-flow-based Fourier-Motzkin elimination procedure that removes
continuous flow variables while preserving convex relaxation tightness, leading
to provably tighter convex relaxations and fewer constraints than Logic Tree
formulations. For temporal logic motion planning with piecewise-affine dynamic
systems, comprehensive experiments across vehicle routing, multi-robot
coordination, and temporal logic control on dynamical systems using point mass
and linear inverted pendulum models demonstrate computational speedups of up to
several orders of magnitude. Hardware demonstrations with quadrupedal robots
validate real-time replanning capabilities under dynamically changing
environmental conditions. The project website is at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hybrid RGB-D SLAM system that combines learning-based pose initialization with optimization-based refinement to achieve robust real-time dense reconstruction during unstable camera motions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RGB-D SLAM systems fail with large viewpoint changes, fast motions, or sudden shaking. Optimization-based methods are accurate but fail with poor initialization, while learning-based approaches are robust but lack accuracy for dense reconstruction.

Method: Uses a camera pose regression network to predict metric-aware relative poses from consecutive RGB-D frames, then applies randomized optimization algorithm to further align depth images with scene geometry.

Result: Outperforms best competitors on challenging benchmarks while maintaining comparable accuracy on stable motion sequences. Operates in real-time.

Conclusion: Combining simple and principled techniques can achieve both robustness for unstable motions and accuracy for dense reconstruction.

Abstract: Real-time dense scene reconstruction during unstable camera motions is
crucial for robotics, yet current RGB-D SLAM systems fail when cameras
experience large viewpoint changes, fast motions, or sudden shaking. Classical
optimization-based methods deliver high accuracy but fail with poor
initialization during large motions, while learning-based approaches provide
robustness but lack sufficient accuracy for dense reconstruction. We address
this challenge through a combination of learning-based initialization with
optimization-based refinement. Our method employs a camera pose regression
network to predict metric-aware relative poses from consecutive RGB-D frames,
which serve as reliable starting points for a randomized optimization algorithm
that further aligns depth images with the scene geometry. Extensive experiments
demonstrate promising results: our approach outperforms the best competitor on
challenging benchmarks, while maintaining comparable accuracy on stable motion
sequences. The system operates in real-time, showcasing that combining simple
and principled techniques can achieve both robustness for unstable motions and
accuracy for dense reconstruction. Project page:

*Jeongyong Yang,Seunghwan Jang,Soojean Han*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SafeFlowMatcher combines flow matching with control barrier functions to achieve real-time planning with certified safety guarantees through a prediction-correction integrator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative planners based on flow matching can produce high-quality paths quickly but lack formal safety guarantees and may yield incomplete paths near constraints.

Method: Uses a two-phase prediction-correction integrator: prediction phase integrates learned flow matching to get candidate path, correction phase refines with vanishing time-scaled vector field and CBF-based quadratic program that minimally perturbs the vector field.

Result: Proves barrier certificate for the flow system, establishing forward invariance of robust safe set and finite-time convergence to safe set. Achieves faster, smoother, and safer paths than diffusion- and FM-based baselines in maze navigation and locomotion benchmarks.

Conclusion: SafeFlowMatcher successfully couples flow matching with control barrier functions to provide both real-time efficiency and certified safety, avoiding distributional drift and mitigating local trap problems while maintaining path quality.

Abstract: Generative planners based on flow matching (FM) can produce high-quality
paths in one or a few ODE steps, but their sampling dynamics offer no formal
safety guarantees and can yield incomplete paths near constraints. We present
SafeFlowMatcher, a planning framework that couples FM with control barrier
functions (CBFs) to achieve both real-time efficiency and certified safety.
SafeFlowMatcher uses a two-phase prediction-correction (PC) integrator: (i) a
prediction phase integrates the learned FM once (or a few steps) to obtain a
candidate path without intervention; (ii) a correction phase refines this path
with a vanishing time-scaled vector field and a CBF-based quadratic program
that minimally perturbs the vector field. We prove a barrier certificate for
the resulting flow system, establishing forward invariance of a robust safe set
and finite-time convergence to the safe set. By enforcing safety only on the
executed path (rather than on all intermediate latent paths), SafeFlowMatcher
avoids distributional drift and mitigates local trap problems. Across maze
navigation and locomotion benchmarks, SafeFlowMatcher attains faster, smoother,
and safer paths than diffusion- and FM-based baselines. Extensive ablations
corroborate the contributions of the PC integrator and the barrier certificate.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A Bayesian Optimization approach using Gaussian Processes to select optimal environmental contexts for data collection, enabling adaptive neural network parameter tuning in quadrotor disturbance estimation without exhaustive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional adaptive controllers require extensive fine-tuning for specific scenarios and are brittle to changing conditions. Machine learning approaches need exhaustive data collection across all possible environments, which is impractical and inefficient.

Method: Proposes Contextual NeuroMHE - a sequential decision making strategy using Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian Process to select which environmental contexts to collect data from, enabling dynamic neural network parameter adaptation.

Result: Outperforms prior work by 20.3% in maximum absolute position error, captures environmental variations with few carefully chosen contexts, and maintains robust performance across different conditions.

Conclusion: The method eliminates need for exhaustive training across all environments while improving efficiency and generalization, demonstrating effective adaptation to real-world environmental variability.

Abstract: Adaptive controllers on quadrotors typically rely on estimation of
disturbances to ensure robust trajectory tracking. Estimating disturbances
across diverse environmental contexts is challenging due to the inherent
variability and uncertainty in the real world. Such estimators require
extensive fine-tuning for a specific scenario, which makes them inflexible and
brittle to changing conditions. Machine-learning approaches, such as training a
neural network to tune the estimator's parameters, are promising. However,
collecting data across all possible environmental contexts is impossible. It is
also inefficient as the same estimator parameters could work for "nearby"
contexts. In this paper, we present a sequential decision making strategy that
decides which environmental contexts, using Bayesian Optimization with a
Gaussian Process, to collect data from in order to ensure robust performance
across a wide range of contexts. Our method, Contextual NeuroMHE, eliminates
the need for exhaustive training across all environments while maintaining
robust performance under different conditions. By enabling the neural network
to adapt its parameters dynamically, our method improves both efficiency and
generalization. Experimental results in various real-world settings demonstrate
that our approach outperforms the prior work by 20.3\% in terms of maximum
absolute position error and can capture the variations in the environment with
a few carefully chosen contexts.

TL;DR: A hybrid framework combining reinforcement learning with analytical trajectory generation for autonomous driving motion planning, achieving 99% fewer samples and 84% runtime reduction while maintaining planning quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sampling-based motion planning in autonomous driving often produces many infeasible or irrelevant trajectories in complex urban scenarios, leading to inefficiency.

Method: Uses a reinforcement learning agent to guide sampling toward feasible regions while keeping trajectory generation and evaluation analytical. Coupled with a world model based on decodable deep set encoder for variable traffic participants.

Result: Achieved up to 99% fewer required samples and 84% runtime reduction while maintaining planning success and collision-free rates in CommonRoad simulation.

Conclusion: The approach enables faster, more reliable decision-making for autonomous vehicles in urban environments, achieving safer and more responsive navigation under real-world constraints.

Abstract: Sampling-based motion planning is a well-established approach in autonomous
driving, valued for its modularity and analytical tractability. In complex
urban scenarios, however, uniform or heuristic sampling often produces many
infeasible or irrelevant trajectories. We address this limitation with a hybrid
framework that learns where to sample while keeping trajectory generation and
evaluation fully analytical and verifiable. A reinforcement learning (RL) agent
guides the sampling process toward regions of the action space likely to yield
feasible trajectories, while evaluation and final selection remains governed by
deterministic feasibility checks and cost functions. We couple the RL sampler
with a world model (WM) based on a decodable deep set encoder, enabling both
variable numbers of traffic participants and reconstructable latent
representations. The approach is evaluated in the CommonRoad simulation
environment, showing up to 99% fewer required samples and a runtime reduction
of up to 84% while maintaining planning quality in terms of success and
collision-free rates. These improvements lead to faster, more reliable
decision-making for autonomous vehicles in urban environments, achieving safer
and more responsive navigation under real-world constraints. Code and trained

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing modular approaches rely heavily on training data quality and have poor generalization, while Vision-Language Model methods perform poorly when semantic cues are weak. The paper aims to address both limitations.

Method: Proposes SONAR which integrates a semantic map-based target prediction module with a Vision-Language Model-based value map module. Uses multi-scale semantic maps with confidence maps to mitigate false target detections.

Result: Evaluated in Gazebo simulator using Matterport 3D dataset, achieving 38.4% success rate and 17.7% SPL (Success weighted by Path Length).

Conclusion: SONAR effectively balances generalization ability with scene adaptability, enabling more robust navigation in unknown environments with varying semantic cue levels.

Abstract: Understanding human instructions and accomplishing Vision-Language Navigation
tasks in unknown environments is essential for robots. However, existing
modular approaches heavily rely on the quality of training data and often
exhibit poor generalization. Vision-Language Model based methods, while
demonstrating strong generalization capabilities, tend to perform
unsatisfactorily when semantic cues are weak. To address these issues, this
paper proposes SONAR, an aggregated reasoning approach through a cross modal
paradigm. The proposed method integrates a semantic map based target prediction
module with a Vision-Language Model based value map module, enabling more
robust navigation in unknown environments with varying levels of semantic cues,
and effectively balancing generalization ability with scene adaptability. In
terms of target localization, we propose a strategy that integrates multi-scale
semantic maps with confidence maps, aiming to mitigate false detections of
target objects. We conducted an evaluation of the SONAR within the Gazebo
simulator, leveraging the most challenging Matterport 3D (MP3D) dataset as the
experimental benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate that SONAR achieves a
success rate of 38.4% and an SPL of 17.7%.

Conclusion: AdaNav demonstrates that adaptive reasoning based on uncertainty can significantly improve VLN performance while being data-efficient, making it suitable for embodied tasks with strict data limitations.

Abstract: Vision Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow natural language
instructions by grounding them in sequential visual observations over long
horizons. Explicit reasoning could enhance temporal consistency and perception
action alignment, but reasoning at fixed steps often leads to suboptimal
performance and unnecessary computation. To address this, we propose AdaNav, an
uncertainty-based adaptive reasoning framework for VLN. At its core is the
Uncertainty Adaptive Reasoning Block (UAR), a lightweight plugin that
dynamically triggers reasoning. We introduce Action Entropy as a policy prior
for UAR and progressively refine it through a Heuristics to RL training method,
enabling agents to learn difficulty aware reasoning policies under the strict
data limitations of embodied tasks. Results show that with only 6K training
samples, AdaNav achieves substantial gains over closed source models trained on
million scale data, improving success rate by 20% on R2R val-unseen, 11.7% on
RxR-CE, and 11.4% in real world scenes. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robots strictly following human instructions, especially those with misleading information, may encounter execution errors and safety hazards, similar to counterfactuals in NLP but overlooked in robotics research.

Method: Developed DynaMIC framework that generates robot task flows to identify directive counterfactuals (DCFs) and provides proactive feedback to humans about potential misleading instructions.

Result: Conducted semantic-level experiments and ablation studies demonstrating the effectiveness of the DynaMIC framework in identifying counterfactual directives and enhancing execution reliability.

Conclusion: The proposed approach helps robots become sensitive to potential directive counterfactuals, thereby improving the reliability and safety of robot task execution when dealing with human instructions.

Abstract: The emergence of large pre-trained models based on natural language has
breathed new life into robotics development. Extensive research has integrated
large models with robots, utilizing the powerful semantic understanding and
generation capabilities of large models to facilitate robot control through
natural language instructions gradually. However, we found that robots that
strictly adhere to human instructions, especially those containing misleading
information, may encounter errors during task execution, potentially leading to
safety hazards. This resembles the concept of counterfactuals in natural
language processing (NLP), which has not yet attracted much attention in
robotic research. In an effort to highlight this issue for future studies, this
paper introduced directive counterfactuals (DCFs) arising from misleading human
directives. We present DynaMIC, a framework for generating robot task flows to
identify DCFs and relay feedback to humans proactively. This capability can
help robots be sensitive to potential DCFs within a task, thus enhancing the
reliability of the execution process. We conducted semantic-level experiments
and ablation studies, showcasing the effectiveness of this framework.

Motivation: Current VLA models struggle with limited generalization, and existing VLM-VLA integration approaches use rigid sequential structures that lead to ineffective collaboration and poor grounding challenges in physical environments.

Method: PhysiAgent incorporates monitor, memory, self-reflection mechanisms and lightweight off-the-shelf toolboxes to create an autonomous scaffolding framework that prompts VLMs to organize components based on real-time proficiency feedback from VLAs.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements in task-solving performance on complex real-world robotic tasks, demonstrating effective self-regulation of VLMs, coherent tool collaboration, and adaptive evolution during execution.

Conclusion: PhysiAgent makes practical and pioneering efforts to integrate VLMs and VLAs, effectively grounding embodied agent frameworks in real-world settings through autonomous collaboration and self-regulation mechanisms.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved notable success but often
struggle with limited generalizations. To address this, integrating generalized
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as assistants to VLAs has emerged as a popular
solution. However, current approaches often combine these models in rigid,
sequential structures: using VLMs primarily for high-level scene understanding
and task planning, and VLAs merely as executors of lower-level actions, leading
to ineffective collaboration and poor grounding challenges. In this paper, we
propose an embodied agent framework, PhysiAgent, tailored to operate
effectively in physical environments. By incorporating monitor, memory,
self-reflection mechanisms, and lightweight off-the-shelf toolboxes, PhysiAgent
offers an autonomous scaffolding framework to prompt VLMs to organize different
components based on real-time proficiency feedback from VLAs to maximally
exploit VLAs' capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in task-solving performance on complex real-world robotic tasks,
showcasing effective self-regulation of VLMs, coherent tool collaboration, and
adaptive evolution of the framework during execution. PhysiAgent makes
practical and pioneering efforts to integrate VLMs and VLAs, effectively

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how robots can promote trust and cooperation in human-robot mixed groups, and understand the role robots play in fostering group cohesion.

Method: Modified Public Good Game with three human participants and the iCub robot, testing different robot strategies (always cooperate, always free ride, tit-for-tat) during a pilot study with 19 participants.

Result: Preliminary analysis shows participants preferred not to invest money in the common pool despite perceiving the robot as generous, suggesting robot generosity alone may not increase human cooperation.

Conclusion: The research provides insights for developing social robots that can foster trust and cooperation in mixed human-robot groups, though initial findings indicate more complex dynamics than expected.

Abstract: In this study, we explore the potential of Game Theory as a means to
investigate cooperation and trust in human-robot mixed groups. Particularly, we
introduce the Public Good Game (PGG), a model highlighting the tension between
individual self-interest and collective well-being. In this work, we present a
modified version of the PGG, where three human participants engage in the game
with the humanoid robot iCub to assess whether various robot game strategies
(e.g., always cooperate, always free ride, and tit-for-tat) can influence the
participants' inclination to cooperate. We test our setup during a pilot study
with nineteen participants. A preliminary analysis indicates that participants
prefer not to invest their money in the common pool, despite they perceive the
robot as generous. By conducting this research, we seek to gain valuable
insights into the role that robots can play in promoting trust and cohesion
during human-robot interactions within group contexts. The results of this
study may hold considerable potential for developing social robots capable of
fostering trust and cooperation within mixed human-robot groups.

### [567] [Unlocking the Potential of Soft Actor-Critic for Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24539)
*Nayari Marie Lessa,Melya Boukheddimi,Frank Kirchner*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes AMP+SAC framework combining Adversarial Motion Priors with Soft Actor-Critic for more efficient and robust imitation learning in robotics, outperforming traditional AMP+PPO approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current imitation learning frameworks rely on PPO which prioritizes stability over sample efficiency and policy generalization, limiting naturalistic behavior and adaptability.

Method: Integrates Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) with off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, leveraging replay-driven learning and entropy-regularized exploration.

Result: Achieves higher imitation rewards and maintains stable task execution on quadruped gaits across multiple reference motions and diverse terrains compared to AMP+PPO.

Conclusion: Off-policy imitation learning formulation shows significant potential for advancing motion generation in robotics through improved data efficiency and robustness.

Abstract: Learning-based methods have enabled robots to acquire bio-inspired movements
with increasing levels of naturalness and adaptability. Among these, Imitation
Learning (IL) has proven effective in transferring complex motion patterns from
animals to robotic systems. However, current state-of-the-art frameworks
predominantly rely on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), an on-policy
algorithm that prioritizes stability over sample efficiency and policy
generalization. This paper proposes a novel IL framework that combines
Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) with the off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)
algorithm to overcome these limitations. This integration leverages
replay-driven learning and entropy-regularized exploration, enabling
naturalistic behavior and task execution, improving data efficiency and
robustness. We evaluate the proposed approach (AMP+SAC) on quadruped gaits
involving multiple reference motions and diverse terrains. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed framework not only maintains stable task
execution but also achieves higher imitation rewards compared to the widely
used AMP+PPO method. These findings highlight the potential of an off-policy IL
formulation for advancing motion generation in robotics.

*Nicolas Pfitzer,Eduardo Sebastián,Ajay Shankar,Amanda Prorok*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework that uses language models to translate natural language tasks into decentralized multi-robot control policies by encoding task logic as deterministic finite automata in recurrent neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage language models' reasoning capabilities for understanding high-level human intent and apply them to multi-robot collaboration, addressing the challenge of specifying individual behaviors in collective systems that must continuously adapt.

Method: Represent tasks as deterministic finite automata (DFA) encoded in RNNs, distill language model decompositions into RNNs, and train graph neural network control policies conditioned on RNN hidden states and language embeddings for decentralized execution.

Result: The approach enables robots to execute sequential and collaborative tasks in both simulated and real-world environments using a single lightweight interpretable model.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges natural language understanding with decentralized multi-robot control, allowing robots to perform complex collaborative tasks specified through high-level human expressions.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework towards prompting multi-robot teams with
high-level tasks using natural language expressions. Our objective is to use
the reasoning capabilities demonstrated by recent language models in
understanding and decomposing human expressions of intent, and repurpose these
for multi-robot collaboration and decision-making. The key challenge is that an
individual's behavior in a collective can be hard to specify and interpret, and
must continuously adapt to actions from others. This necessitates a framework
that possesses the representational capacity required by the logic and
semantics of a task, and yet supports decentralized and interactive real-time
operation. We solve this dilemma by recognizing that a task can be represented
as a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), and that recurrent neural networks
(RNNs) can encode numerous automata. This allows us to distill the logic and
sequential decompositions of sub-tasks obtained from a language model into an
RNN, and align its internal states with the semantics of a given task. By
training a graph neural network (GNN) control policy that is conditioned on the
hidden states of the RNN and the language embeddings, our method enables robots
to execute task-relevant actions in a decentralized manner. We present
evaluations of this single light-weight interpretable model on various
simulated and real-world multi-robot tasks that require sequential and
collaborative behavior by the team -- sites.google.com/view/prompting-teams.

Motivation: To address the limitations of existing Diffusion Policy in U-Net architecture (DP-U), which suffers from limited global context modeling and over-smoothing artifacts, by developing a more powerful framework that preserves U-Net advantages while incorporating Transformer capabilities.

Method: Proposed U-DiT Policy, a U-shaped Diffusion Transformer framework that integrates multi-scale feature fusion from U-Net with global context modeling from Transformers, enhancing representational power and policy expressiveness for robotic visuomotor control.

Result: In simulation, U-DiT achieved 10% average performance gain over baselines and 6% improvement over Transformer-based diffusion policies (DP-T) under comparable parameters. On real-world tasks, it showed 22.5% average improvement over DP-U, with superior generalization and robustness under distractor and lighting variations.

Conclusion: U-DiT Policy demonstrates effectiveness and practical potential as a new foundation for diffusion-based robotic manipulation, combining the strengths of U-Net and Transformers to overcome limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Diffusion-based methods have been acknowledged as a powerful paradigm for
end-to-end visuomotor control in robotics. Most existing approaches adopt a
Diffusion Policy in U-Net architecture (DP-U), which, while effective, suffers
from limited global context modeling and over-smoothing artifacts. To address
these issues, we propose U-DiT Policy, a novel U-shaped Diffusion Transformer
framework. U-DiT preserves the multi-scale feature fusion advantages of U-Net
while integrating the global context modeling capability of Transformers,
thereby enhancing representational power and policy expressiveness. We evaluate
U-DiT extensively across both simulation and real-world robotic manipulation
tasks. In simulation, U-DiT achieves an average performance gain of 10\% over
baseline methods and surpasses Transformer-based diffusion policies (DP-T) that
use AdaLN blocks by 6\% under comparable parameter budgets. On real-world
robotic tasks, U-DiT demonstrates superior generalization and robustness,
achieving an average improvement of 22.5\% over DP-U. In addition, robustness
and generalization experiments under distractor and lighting variations further
highlight the advantages of U-DiT. These results highlight the effectiveness
and practical potential of U-DiT Policy as a new foundation for diffusion-based
robotic manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate the need for multi-stage pipelines in robotics by unifying perception and control within a single framework, enabling more efficient and scalable embodied AI systems.

Method: Uses conditional diffusion model to map RGB images to structured robot states (3D keypoints/joint angles), then extends to video-to-action inverse dynamics by conditioning on sparse video keyframes from world models with overlap-averaging for smooth action sequences.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time performance on DREAM dataset for pose estimation, and substantially improves success rates on Libero-Object manipulation tasks over existing inverse dynamics modules under offline settings.

Conclusion: PoseDiff provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient bridge between perception, planning, and control in embodied AI, demonstrating the effectiveness of unified diffusion-based approaches for robotics.

Abstract: We present PoseDiff, a conditional diffusion model that unifies robot state
estimation and control within a single framework. At its core, PoseDiff maps
raw visual observations into structured robot states-such as 3D keypoints or
joint angles-from a single RGB image, eliminating the need for multi-stage
pipelines or auxiliary modalities. Building upon this foundation, PoseDiff
extends naturally to video-to-action inverse dynamics: by conditioning on
sparse video keyframes generated by world models, it produces smooth and
continuous long-horizon action sequences through an overlap-averaging strategy.
This unified design enables scalable and efficient integration of perception
and control. On the DREAM dataset, PoseDiff achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
and real-time performance for pose estimation. On Libero-Object manipulation
tasks, it substantially improves success rates over existing inverse dynamics
modules, even under strict offline settings. Together, these results show that
PoseDiff provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient bridge between
perception, planning, and control in embodied AI. The video visualization

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CEDex is a cross-embodiment dexterous grasp synthesis method that bridges human grasping kinematics with robot kinematics through human-like contact representations and topological merging, creating the largest cross-embodiment grasp dataset with 20M grasps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches lack human-like kinematic understanding or require extensive manual data collection limited to anthropomorphic structures, making versatile robotic manipulation challenging across different hand morphologies.

Method: Uses Conditional Variational Auto-encoder pretrained on human contact data to generate human-like contact representations, performs kinematic human contact alignment through topological merging, and conducts signed distance field-based grasp optimization with physics-aware constraints.

Result: Constructed the largest cross-embodiment grasp dataset with 500K objects across four gripper types and 20M total grasps, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches and benefiting cross-embodiment grasp learning.

Conclusion: CEDex successfully bridges human and robot kinematics for dexterous grasp synthesis, providing high-quality diverse grasps that advance cross-embodiment robotic manipulation capabilities.

Abstract: Cross-embodiment dexterous grasp synthesis refers to adaptively generating
and optimizing grasps for various robotic hands with different morphologies.
This capability is crucial for achieving versatile robotic manipulation in
diverse environments and requires substantial amounts of reliable and diverse
grasp data for effective model training and robust generalization. However,
existing approaches either rely on physics-based optimization that lacks
human-like kinematic understanding or require extensive manual data collection
processes that are limited to anthropomorphic structures. In this paper, we
propose CEDex, a novel cross-embodiment dexterous grasp synthesis method at
scale that bridges human grasping kinematics and robot kinematics by aligning
robot kinematic models with generated human-like contact representations. Given
an object's point cloud and an arbitrary robotic hand model, CEDex first
generates human-like contact representations using a Conditional Variational
Auto-encoder pretrained on human contact data. It then performs kinematic human
contact alignment through topological merging to consolidate multiple human
hand parts into unified robot components, followed by a signed distance
field-based grasp optimization with physics-aware constraints. Using CEDex, we
construct the largest cross-embodiment grasp dataset to date, comprising 500K
objects across four gripper types with 20M total grasps. Extensive experiments
show that CEDex outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and our dataset
benefits cross-embodiment grasp learning with high-quality diverse grasps.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A physics-informed imitation learning approach for humanoid robot control that incorporates physics priors and control principles to generate more stable and physically feasible trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional imitation learning methods for humanoid robots lack physical constraints and prior knowledge, leading to unstable trajectories and sliding contacts that limit real-world performance.

Method: Two-pronged strategy: 1) Encoding physics priors during supervised imitation learning to promote trajectory feasibility, 2) Applying proportional-integral controller at inference time to minimize drift. Validated on ergoCub humanoid with physics-informed loss for zero contact foot velocity.

Result: The approach significantly improves trajectory accuracy and physical constraint conformity, and is compatible with multiple controllers on a real robot.

Conclusion: Incorporating physics priors and control principles into imitation learning enables more stable and physically feasible humanoid robot motions that better conform to real-world constraints.

Abstract: Recent trends in humanoid robot control have successfully employed imitation
learning to enable the learned generation of smooth, human-like trajectories
from human data. While these approaches make more realistic motions possible,
they are limited by the amount of available motion data, and do not incorporate
prior knowledge about the physical laws governing the system and its
interactions with the environment. Thus they may violate such laws, leading to
divergent trajectories and sliding contacts which limit real-world stability.
We address such limitations via a two-pronged learning strategy which leverages
the known physics of the system and fundamental control principles. First, we
encode physics priors during supervised imitation learning to promote
trajectory feasibility. Second, we minimize drift at inference time by applying
a proportional-integral controller directly to the generated output state. We
validate our method on various locomotion behaviors for the ergoCub humanoid
robot, where a physics-informed loss encourages zero contact foot velocity. Our
experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is compatible with multiple
controllers on a real robot and significantly improves the accuracy and
physical constraint conformity of generated trajectories.

TL;DR: LLM-Handover is a framework that uses LLM reasoning and part segmentation to enable context-aware grasp selection for robot-human handovers, optimizing post-handover usability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robot handover approaches often neglect human post-handover actions and rely on limiting assumptions, creating a need for more context-aware systems that support intended use.

Method: Integrates LLM-based reasoning with part segmentation using RGB-D images and task descriptions to infer relevant object parts and select optimal grasps for post-handover usability.

Result: Achieved 83% success rate in zero-shot setting, improved part segmentation performance, higher grasp success rates, and 86% user preference in context-aware handovers.

Conclusion: LLM-Handover enables more intuitive and context-aware robot-human handovers that better adapt to post-handover task constraints, representing a significant improvement over conventional approaches.

Abstract: Effective human-robot collaboration depends on task-oriented handovers, where
robots present objects in ways that support the partners intended use. However,
many existing approaches neglect the humans post-handover action, relying on
assumptions that limit generalizability. To address this gap, we propose
LLM-Handover, a novel framework that integrates large language model
(LLM)-based reasoning with part segmentation to enable context-aware grasp
selection and execution. Given an RGB-D image and a task description, our
system infers relevant object parts and selects grasps that optimize
post-handover usability. To support evaluation, we introduce a new dataset of
60 household objects spanning 12 categories, each annotated with detailed part
labels. We first demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of the
used state-of-the-art part segmentation method, in the context of robot-human
handovers. Next, we show that LLM-Handover achieves higher grasp success rates
and adapts better to post-handover task constraints. During hardware
experiments, we achieve a success rate of 83% in a zero-shot setting over
conventional and unconventional post-handover tasks. Finally, our user study
underlines that our method enables more intuitive, context-aware handovers,
with participants preferring it in 86% of cases.

Motivation: Single-sensor systems have limitations - LiDAR lacks texture information while cameras have restricted field of view, creating challenges for reliable onboard perception in dynamic environments with strict reaction-time constraints.

Method: Integrates reflexive evasion with active hierarchical perception, strategically combining LiDAR-based omnidirectional scanning with camera-based active focusing to achieve comprehensive environmental awareness.

Result: Extensive sim-to-real experiments on a quadruped platform show substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines in both safety metrics and operational efficiency across diverse obstacle types, trajectories, and approach directions.

Conclusion: APREBot demonstrates potential for dependable autonomy in safety-critical scenarios by providing comprehensive environmental awareness essential for agile obstacle avoidance in quadruped robots.

Abstract: Reliable onboard perception is critical for quadruped robots navigating
dynamic environments, where obstacles can emerge from any direction under
strict reaction-time constraints. Single-sensor systems face inherent
limitations: LiDAR provides omnidirectional coverage but lacks rich texture
information, while cameras capture high-resolution detail but suffer from
restricted field of view. We introduce APREBot (Active Perception System for

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SSR-ZSON is a zero-shot object navigation method that addresses insufficient semantic guidance and limited spatial memory by integrating spatial-semantic relative exploration with LLM-based global guidance, achieving significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot object navigation faces challenges from insufficient semantic guidance leading to inefficient exploration and limited spatial memory causing entrapment in local regions.

Method: Proposes SSR-ZSON based on TARE hierarchical exploration framework, integrating viewpoint generation strategy balancing spatial coverage and semantic density with LLM-based global guidance mechanism.

Result: Achieves real-time operation and superior performance on Matterport3D and Habitat-Matterport3D datasets, improving Success Rate by 18.5% and 11.2%, and SPL by 0.181 and 0.140 respectively over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SSR-ZSON effectively addresses key limitations in zero-shot object navigation through spatial-semantic relative exploration and LLM guidance, demonstrating significant performance gains in both simulation and physical platforms.

Abstract: Zero-shot object navigation in unknown environments presents significant
challenges, mainly due to two key limitations: insufficient semantic guidance
leads to inefficient exploration, while limited spatial memory resulting from
environmental structure causes entrapment in local regions. To address these
issues, we propose SSR-ZSON, a spatial-semantic relative zero-shot object
navigation method based on the TARE hierarchical exploration framework,
integrating a viewpoint generation strategy balancing spatial coverage and
semantic density with an LLM-based global guidance mechanism. The performance
improvement of the proposed method is due to two key innovations. First, the
viewpoint generation strategy prioritizes areas of high semantic density within
traversable sub-regions to maximize spatial coverage and minimize invalid
exploration. Second, coupled with an LLM-based global guidance mechanism, it
assesses semantic associations to direct navigation toward high-value spaces,
preventing local entrapment and ensuring efficient exploration. Deployed on
hybrid Habitat-Gazebo simulations and physical platforms, SSR-ZSON achieves
real-time operation and superior performance. On Matterport3D and
Habitat-Matterport3D datasets, it improves the Success Rate(SR) by 18.5\% and
11.2\%, and the Success weighted by Path Length(SPL) by 0.181 and 0.140,
respectively, over state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: IA-VLA is a framework that enhances vision-language-action models by using a large vision language model for pre-processing to improve context understanding, particularly for complex tasks involving visually indistinguishable objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLAs have limited language understanding capabilities due to size constraints needed for real-time robot control, making them struggle with complex language instructions like identifying objects by relative positions.

Method: The framework uses a large vision language model as a pre-processing stage to generate improved context that augments the input of a VLA, enabling better handling of semantically complex tasks.

Result: Experiments on scenes with duplicate objects show that VLAs benefit from the augmentation scheme, especially when dealing with language instructions requiring extrapolation from demonstration concepts.

Conclusion: The IA-VLA framework successfully enhances VLA performance on complex manipulation tasks by leveraging external language understanding capabilities through pre-processing augmentation.

Abstract: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have become an increasingly popular
approach for addressing robot manipulation problems in recent years. However,
such models need to output actions at a rate suitable for robot control, which
limits the size of the language model they can be based on, and consequently,
their language understanding capabilities. Manipulation tasks may require
complex language instructions, such as identifying target objects by their
relative positions, to specify human intention. Therefore, we introduce IA-VLA,
a framework that utilizes the extensive language understanding of a large
vision language model as a pre-processing stage to generate improved context to
augment the input of a VLA. We evaluate the framework on a set of semantically
complex tasks which have been underexplored in VLA literature, namely tasks
involving visual duplicates, i.e., visually indistinguishable objects. A
dataset of three types of scenes with duplicate objects is used to compare a
baseline VLA against two augmented variants. The experiments show that the VLA
benefits from the augmentation scheme, especially when faced with language
instructions that require the VLA to extrapolate from concepts it has seen in
the demonstrations. For the code, dataset, and videos, see

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CIFT framework improves robot policy generalization by optimizing data composition using information fidelity metrics, achieving 54%+ OOD success rate improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalist robot policies suffer from shortcut learning and poor out-of-distribution generalization due to naive mixing of real and synthetic data that prioritizes visual diversity over information fidelity.

Method: Proposes Coherent Information Fidelity Tuning (CIFT) framework that treats data composition as optimization problem, uses feature-space geometry as proxy for Information Fidelity, identifies Decoherence Point, and employs Multi-View Video Augmentation (MVAug) for causally disentangled data synthesis.

Result: Applied to π₀ and Diffusion Policy architectures, improves out-of-distribution success rates by over 54%.

Conclusion: Fidelity-aware data composition, beyond just data synthesis, is crucial for developing robust, general-purpose robots.

Abstract: Generalist robot policies trained on large-scale, visually homogeneous
datasets can be susceptible to shortcut learning, which impairs their
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. While generative data augmentation is
a common approach to introduce diversity, it presents a subtle challenge: data
composition. Naively mixing real and synthetic data can corrupt the learning
signal, as this process often prioritizes visual diversity at the expense of
information fidelity. This paper suggests that robust generalization depends on
principled, fidelity-aware data composition. We introduce Coherent Information
Fidelity Tuning (CIFT), a framework that treats data composition as an
optimization problem. CIFT uses a practical proxy for Information Fidelity
based on the feature-space geometry of a dataset. This enables the
identification of a phase transition, termed the Decoherence Point, where
training stability degrades. The framework includes a generative engine,
Multi-View Video Augmentation (MVAug), to synthesize a causally disentangled
data spectrum for this tuning process. Applying CIFT to policy architectures
such as $\pi_0$ and Diffusion Policy improves OOD success rates by over 54\%.
These results indicate that fidelity-aware composition, beyond data synthesis
alone, is an important component for developing robust, general-purpose robots.

*Mariadas Capsran Roshan,Edgar M Hidalgo,Mats Isaksson,Michelle Dunn,Jagannatha Charjee Pyaraka*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a robot-mounted 2D LiDAR system for automated initial probe pose estimation in robotic echocardiography, achieving sub-3mm reconstruction accuracy and consistent probe placement within 20-30mm of clinical targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Teleoperated robotic echocardiography faces challenges with longer examination times compared to manual procedures, creating diagnostic delays and increased operator workload. Current vision- and depth-based approaches for initial probe pose estimation are sensitive to lighting, texture, and anatomical variability.

Method: The authors developed a robot-mounted 2D LiDAR system that reconstructs the chest surface in 3D from two linear sweeps. They used plane-based extrinsic calibration to estimate the transformation between LiDAR and robot frames, then aligned reconstructed chest surfaces with non-rigid templates to identify initial probe poses.

Result: The system achieved: plane-based calibration with 1.8mm RMS residual and <0.2° rotational uncertainty; mannequin studies showing mean surface errors of 2.78±0.21mm; human trials (N=5) demonstrating probe initial points 20-30mm from clinical targets with <4mm variation across repeated trials.

Conclusion: The proposed 2D LiDAR-based approach successfully automates initial probe pose estimation for robotic echocardiography, offering improved robustness over vision-based methods and potentially reducing examination time and operator burden in teleoperated cardiac imaging.

Abstract: Echocardiography is a key imaging modality for cardiac assessment but remains
highly operator-dependent, and access to trained sonographers is limited in
underserved settings. Teleoperated robotic echocardiography has been proposed
as a solution; however, clinical studies report longer examination times than
manual procedures, increasing diagnostic delays and operator workload.
Automating non-expert tasks, such as automatically moving the probe to an ideal
starting pose, offers a pathway to reduce this burden. Prior vision- and
depth-based approaches to estimate an initial probe pose are sensitive to
lighting, texture, and anatomical variability. We propose a robot-mounted 2D
LiDAR-based approach that reconstructs the chest surface in 3D and estimates
the initial probe pose automatically. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first demonstration of robot-mounted 2D LiDAR used for 3D reconstruction of a
human body surface. Through plane-based extrinsic calibration, the
transformation between the LiDAR and robot base frames was estimated with an
overall root mean square (RMS) residual of 1.8 mm and rotational uncertainty
below 0.2{\deg}. The chest front surface, reconstructed from two linear LiDAR
sweeps, was aligned with non-rigid templates to identify an initial probe pose.
A mannequin-based study assessing reconstruction accuracy showed mean surface
errors of 2.78 +/- 0.21 mm. Human trials (N=5) evaluating the proposed approach
found probe initial points typically 20-30 mm from the clinically defined
initial point, while the variation across repeated trials on the same subject
was less than 4 mm.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: JuggleRL is the first reinforcement learning system for aerial ball juggling using quadrotors, achieving over 300 hits on average in real-world deployment and significantly outperforming model-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aerial robots need precise, contact-rich maneuvers under uncertainty for object interaction tasks like ball juggling, which requires accurate timing, stable control, and continuous adaptation.

Method: Learns closed-loop policies in simulation with calibrated dynamics to reduce sim-to-real gap, uses reward shaping for racket-centered hits and sustained juggling, and applies domain randomization for robustness. Deploys zero-shot with enhanced perception and real-time control.

Result: Achieves average 311 hits over 10 trials (max 462 hits) in real world, far exceeding model-based baseline (average 3.1 hits, max 14 hits). Generalizes to unseen conditions with 5g ball (average 145.9 hits).

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning can empower aerial robots with robust and stable control in dynamic interaction tasks, demonstrating superior performance over traditional model-based approaches.

Abstract: Aerial robots interacting with objects must perform precise, contact-rich
maneuvers under uncertainty. In this paper, we study the problem of aerial ball
juggling using a quadrotor equipped with a racket, a task that demands accurate
timing, stable control, and continuous adaptation. We propose JuggleRL, the
first reinforcement learning-based system for aerial juggling. It learns
closed-loop policies in large-scale simulation using systematic calibration of
quadrotor and ball dynamics to reduce the sim-to-real gap. The training
incorporates reward shaping to encourage racket-centered hits and sustained
juggling, as well as domain randomization over ball position and coefficient of
restitution to enhance robustness and transferability. The learned policy
outputs mid-level commands executed by a low-level controller and is deployed
zero-shot on real hardware, where an enhanced perception module with a
lightweight communication protocol reduces delays in high-frequency state
estimation and ensures real-time control. Experiments show that JuggleRL
achieves an average of $311$ hits over $10$ consecutive trials in the real
world, with a maximum of $462$ hits observed, far exceeding a model-based
baseline that reaches at most $14$ hits with an average of $3.1$. Moreover, the
policy generalizes to unseen conditions, successfully juggling a lighter $5$ g
ball with an average of $145.9$ hits. This work demonstrates that reinforcement
learning can empower aerial robots with robust and stable control in dynamic
interaction tasks.

TL;DR: DRCP is a real-time cooperative perception framework that uses cross-modal fusion and diffusion-based refinement to improve detection accuracy in challenging driving scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in real-world cooperative perception deployments, particularly hard detection cases like partial detections and noise accumulation that reduce downstream detection accuracy.

Method: Integrates two components: (1) Precise-Pyramid-Cross-Modality-Cross-Agent module for camera-intrinsic-aware angular partitioning and adaptive convolution, and (2) Mask-Diffusion-Mask-Aggregation module for lightweight diffusion-based refinement of bird's-eye-view features.

Result: Achieves real-time performance on mobile platforms while significantly improving robustness under challenging conditions.

Conclusion: DRCP provides an effective solution for robust cooperative perception in dynamic driving environments with practical deployment capabilities.

Abstract: Cooperative perception enabled by Vehicle-to-Everything communication has
shown great promise in enhancing situational awareness for autonomous vehicles
and other mobile robotic platforms. Despite recent advances in perception
backbones and multi-agent fusion, real-world deployments remain challenged by
hard detection cases, exemplified by partial detections and noise accumulation
which limit downstream detection accuracy. This work presents Diffusion on
Reinforced Cooperative Perception (DRCP), a real-time deployable framework
designed to address aforementioned issues in dynamic driving environments. DRCP
integrates two key components: (1) Precise-Pyramid-Cross-Modality-Cross-Agent,
a cross-modal cooperative perception module that leverages
camera-intrinsic-aware angular partitioning for attention-based fusion and
adaptive convolution to better exploit external features; and (2)
Mask-Diffusion-Mask-Aggregation, a novel lightweight diffusion-based refinement
module that encourages robustness against feature perturbations and aligns
bird's-eye-view features closer to the task-optimal manifold. The proposed
system achieves real-time performance on mobile platforms while significantly
improving robustness under challenging conditions. Code will be released in
late 2025.

*Thanh Long Nguyen,Duc Phu Nguyen,Thanh Thao Ton Nu,Quan Le,Thuan Hoang Tran,Manh Duong Phung*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework for recognizing human group interactions using RGB-D camera data, 3D keypoint estimation, PCA for interaction directions, and shoelace formula for engagement areas, achieving real-time performance on robotic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic systems focus on obstacle avoidance but lack social awareness needed for natural human-robot interaction in shared environments.

Method: Uses RGB-D camera to estimate 3D human keypoints and positions, applies PCA to determine dominant interaction directions, and uses shoelace formula to compute interest points and engagement areas.

Result: Successfully recognizes group interactions across different scenarios with varying numbers of individuals, processes each frame in ~4ms on single-board computers, and is implemented as ROS 2 package.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables socially aware navigation by effectively detecting human group interactions in real-time, making it easily integrable into existing robotic navigation systems.

Abstract: {Recognizing human interactions is essential for social robots as it enables
them to navigate safely and naturally in shared environments. Conventional
robotic systems however often focus on obstacle avoidance, neglecting social
cues necessary for seamless human-robot interaction. To address this gap, we
propose a framework to recognize human group interactions for socially aware
navigation. Our method utilizes color and depth frames from a monocular RGB-D
camera to estimate 3D human keypoints and positions. Principal component
analysis (PCA) is then used to determine dominant interaction directions. The
shoelace formula is finally applied to compute interest points and engagement
areas. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the validity of
the proposed method. The results show that our method is capable of recognizing
group interactions across different scenarios with varying numbers of
individuals. It also achieves high-speed performance, processing each frame in
approximately 4 ms on a single-board computer used in robotic systems. The
method is implemented as a ROS 2 package making it simple to integrate into
existing navigation systems. Source code is available at

### [583] [From Code to Action: Hierarchical Learning of Diffusion-VLM Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24917)
*Markus Peschl,Pietro Mazzaglia,Daniel Dijkman*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Hierarchical framework using code-generating VLMs and diffusion policies for robotic imitation learning, leveraging API functions as structured supervision to decompose tasks into executable subroutines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in imitation learning for robotic manipulation, including poor generalization and data scarcity in complex, long-horizon tasks.

Method: Train VLM to decompose tasks into subroutines, ground them with diffusion policy, and incorporate memory mechanism for non-Markovian tasks like object swapping.

Result: Enables interpretable policy decomposition, improves generalization over flat policies, and allows separate evaluation of high-level planning and low-level control.

Conclusion: Hierarchical approach with code-generating VLMs and structured API supervision effectively addresses generalization and data scarcity in complex robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Imitation learning for robotic manipulation often suffers from limited
generalization and data scarcity, especially in complex, long-horizon tasks. In
this work, we introduce a hierarchical framework that leverages code-generating
vision-language models (VLMs) in combination with low-level diffusion policies
to effectively imitate and generalize robotic behavior. Our key insight is to
treat open-source robotic APIs not only as execution interfaces but also as
sources of structured supervision: the associated subtask functions - when
exposed - can serve as modular, semantically meaningful labels. We train a VLM
to decompose task descriptions into executable subroutines, which are then
grounded through a diffusion policy trained to imitate the corresponding robot
behavior. To handle the non-Markovian nature of both code execution and certain
real-world tasks, such as object swapping, our architecture incorporates a
memory mechanism that maintains subtask context across time. We find that this
design enables interpretable policy decomposition, improves generalization when
compared to flat policies and enables separate evaluation of high-level
planning and low-level control.

cinematography, and ethics. Built on model predictive control, CineWild
dynamically adjusts flight paths and camera settings to balance cinematic
quality with animal welfare. Key features include adaptive zoom for filming

*Shunan Yin,Zehui Lu,Shaoshuai Mou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An adaptive Bayesian algorithm for real-time trajectory prediction that simultaneously estimates target intentions and motion parameters, achieving 270 Hz performance without training or prior knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for robust trajectory prediction when target intentions and motion characteristics are unknown and can change abruptly, which existing methods struggle with.

Method: Joint estimation of Markovian latent intention state and intention parameter describing adherence to shortest-path policy, using sampling-based trajectory prediction with quantified uncertainty.

Result: Significantly outperforms non-adaptive and partially adaptive methods in numerical experiments (500-trial Monte Carlo) and hardware demonstrations on quadrotor and quadrupedal platforms.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides robust, real-time trajectory prediction that adapts to changing intentions and unknown dynamics, making it applicable across various robotic systems.

Abstract: This work introduces an adaptive Bayesian algorithm for real-time trajectory
prediction via intention inference, where a target's intentions and motion
characteristics are unknown and subject to change. The method concurrently
estimates two critical variables: the target's current intention, modeled as a
Markovian latent state, and an intention parameter that describes the target's
adherence to a shortest-path policy. By integrating this joint update
technique, the algorithm maintains robustness against abrupt intention shifts
and unknown motion dynamics. A sampling-based trajectory prediction mechanism
then exploits these adaptive estimates to generate probabilistic forecasts with
quantified uncertainty. We validate the framework through numerical
experiments: Ablation studies of two cases, and a 500-trial Monte Carlo
analysis; Hardware demonstrations on quadrotor and quadrupedal platforms.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly
outperforms non-adaptive and partially adaptive methods. The method operates in
real time around 270 Hz without requiring training or detailed prior knowledge
of target behavior, showcasing its applicability in various robotic systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: World-Env is an RL-based post-training framework that uses a world model-based virtual simulator to address data scarcity and safety issues in VLA models, enabling effective training with minimal expert demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models trained via imitation learning suffer from performance degradation in data-scarce scenarios and face challenges in real-world deployment due to non-resettable environments and lack of task completion detection mechanisms, especially in high-risk domains like industrial automation.

Method: Proposes World-Env framework with two components: (1) video-based world simulator for generating future visual observations, and (2) VLM-guided instant reflector for continuous rewards and action termination prediction. This enables safe exploration in virtual environments.

Result: Achieves notable performance gains with as few as five expert demonstrations per task. Experiments on complex robotic manipulation tasks show effective overcoming of data inefficiency, safety constraints, and inefficient execution compared to conventional VLA models.

Conclusion: World-Env offers a practical and scalable solution for post-training VLA models in resource-constrained settings by replacing physical interaction with low-cost virtual simulation, enabling safe exploration and generalization beyond initial imitation learning distribution.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models trained via imitation learning suffer
from significant performance degradation in data-scarce scenarios due to their
reliance on large-scale demonstration datasets. Although reinforcement learning
(RL)-based post-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity, its
application to VLA models is hindered by the non-resettable nature of
real-world environments. This limitation is particularly critical in high-risk
domains such as industrial automation, where interactions often induce state
changes that are costly or infeasible to revert. Furthermore, existing VLA
approaches lack a reliable mechanism for detecting task completion, leading to
redundant actions that reduce overall task success rates. To address these
challenges, we propose World-Env, an RL-based post-training framework that
replaces physical interaction with a low-cost, world model-based virtual
simulator. World-Env consists of two key components: (1) a video-based world
simulator that generates temporally consistent future visual observations, and
(2) a vision-language model (VLM)-guided instant reflector that provides
continuous reward signals and predicts action termination. This simulated
environment enables VLA models to safely explore and generalize beyond their
initial imitation learning distribution. Our method achieves notable
performance gains with as few as five expert demonstrations per task.
Experiments on complex robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that World-Env
effectively overcomes the data inefficiency, safety constraints, and
inefficient execution of conventional VLA models that rely on real-world
interaction, offering a practical and scalable solution for post-training in
resource-constrained settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative robot policies like Flow Matching are flexible but sample-inefficient, and existing object-centric approaches don't fully resolve this limitation.

Method: Multi-Stream Generative Policy (MSG) trains multiple object-centric policies and combines them at inference time. It's model-agnostic and inference-only, making it widely applicable to various generative policies and training paradigms.

Result: MSG learns high-quality generative policies from as few as five demonstrations (95% reduction), improves policy performance by 89% compared to single-stream approaches, and enables zero-shot object instance transfer.

Conclusion: MSG provides a practical framework for improving sample efficiency and generalization in generative robot policies through inference-time composition of multiple object-centric policies.

Abstract: Generative robot policies such as Flow Matching offer flexible, multi-modal
policy learning but are sample-inefficient. Although object-centric policies
improve sample efficiency, it does not resolve this limitation. In this work,
we propose Multi-Stream Generative Policy (MSG), an inference-time composition
framework that trains multiple object-centric policies and combines them at
inference to improve generalization and sample efficiency. MSG is
model-agnostic and inference-only, hence widely applicable to various
generative policies and training paradigms. We perform extensive experiments
both in simulation and on a real robot, demonstrating that our approach learns
high-quality generative policies from as few as five demonstrations, resulting
in a 95% reduction in demonstrations, and improves policy performance by 89
percent compared to single-stream approaches. Furthermore, we present
comprehensive ablation studies on various composition strategies and provide
practical recommendations for deployment. Finally, MSG enables zero-shot object
instance transfer. We make our code publicly available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A one-shot imitation learning method that enables robots to learn multi-step manipulation tasks from a single demonstration without additional training or annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods perform well on single-step tasks but struggle with long-horizon, multi-step tasks without requiring additional model training or manual annotation.

Method: Proposed method uses single demonstration without additional model training or manual annotation, and evaluates different pre-trained feature extractors for computational efficiency.

Result: Achieved 82.5% success rate on multi-step tasks and 90% on single-step tasks, outperforming baseline methods in both cases.

Conclusion: The method successfully enables one-shot imitation learning for complex multi-step manipulation tasks while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in one-shot imitation learning have enabled robots to acquire
new manipulation skills from a single human demonstration. While existing
methods achieve strong performance on single-step tasks, they remain limited in
their ability to handle long-horizon, multi-step tasks without additional model
training or manual annotation. We propose a method that can be applied to this
setting provided a single demonstration without additional model training or
manual annotation. We evaluated our method on multi-step and single-step
manipulation tasks where our method achieves an average success rate of 82.5%
and 90%, respectively. Our method matches and exceeds the performance of the
baselines in both these cases. We also compare the performance and
computational efficiency of alternative pre-trained feature extractors within
our framework.

*Da Saem Lee,Akash Karthikeyan,Yash Vardhan Pant,Sebastian Fischmeister*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Path Diffuser (PD) is a two-stage diffusion model that generates realistic traffic scenarios without requiring historical agent trajectories, using map data and motion primitives to ensure road-compliant trajectory generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule-based planners lack diversity and realism, while learning-based simulators rely on historical data and struggle with out-of-distribution scenarios. Existing methods require agents' past trajectories and pose information, limiting scalability and producing unrealistic trajectories.

Method: Two-stage diffusion model that generates agent pose initializations and trajectories conditioned only on map data, incorporating motion primitive-based prior using Frenet frame candidate trajectories to enhance diversity while ensuring road compliance.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods by 1.92x on distribution metrics, 1.14x on common-sense metrics, and 1.62x on road compliance from adversarial benchmarks. Demonstrated effectiveness on Argoverse2 Dataset and OOD map variants.

Conclusion: Path Diffuser successfully generates diverse and realistic traffic scenarios without historical trajectory data, showing strong performance across multiple metrics and generalizability to out-of-distribution scenarios.

Abstract: Simulating diverse and realistic traffic scenarios is critical for developing
and testing autonomous planning. Traditional rule-based planners lack diversity
and realism, while learning-based simulators often replay, forecast, or edit
scenarios using historical agent trajectories. However, they struggle to
generate new scenarios, limiting scalability and diversity due to their
reliance on fully annotated logs and historical data. Thus, a key challenge for
a learning-based simulator's performance is that it requires agents' past
trajectories and pose information in addition to map data, which might not be
available for all agents on the road.Without which, generated scenarios often
produce unrealistic trajectories that deviate from drivable areas, particularly
under out-of-distribution (OOD) map scenes (e.g., curved roads). To address
this, we propose Path Diffuser (PD): a two-stage, diffusion model for
generating agent pose initializations and their corresponding trajectories
conditioned on the map, free of any historical context of agents' trajectories.
Furthermore, PD incorporates a motion primitive-based prior, leveraging Frenet
frame candidate trajectories to enhance diversity while ensuring road-compliant
trajectory generation. We also explore various design choices for modeling
complex multi-agent interactions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method through extensive experiments on the Argoverse2 Dataset and additionally
evaluate the generalizability of the approach on OOD map variants. Notably,
Path Diffuser outperforms the baseline methods by 1.92x on distribution
metrics, 1.14x on common-sense metrics, and 1.62x on road compliance from
adversarial benchmarks.

Conclusion: AIRoA MoMa provides a critical benchmark for advancing Vision-Language-Action models by uniquely integrating mobile manipulation, contact-rich interaction, and long-horizon structure.

Abstract: As robots transition from controlled settings to unstructured human
environments, building generalist agents that can reliably follow natural

Conclusion: Low-cost, reconfigurable over-the-row robots can achieve effective weed management with reduced crop damage and labor requirements, while providing a versatile platform for various agricultural applications. Design files are released to accelerate research and adoption.

Abstract: We present the AgriCruiser, an open-source over-the-row agricultural robot
developed for low-cost deployment and rapid adaptation across diverse crops and

Motivation: Conventional linear crop layouts optimized for tractors create navigation challenges for robots including tight turns, long travel distances, and perceptual aliasing.

Method: Developed a robot-centric square spiral layout with central tramline, combined with DH-ResNet18 waypoint regression, pixel-to-odometry mapping, A* planning, and model predictive control (MPC).

Result: Spiral layout achieved 28% shorter paths and 25% faster execution for waypoint tasks, with comparable full-field coverage to optimized linear U-turn strategy. Multi-robot coordination using greedy allocator achieved 33-37% lower batch completion times.

Conclusion: Redesigning field geometry to suit autonomous agriculture shows significant potential for improving robotic navigation efficiency and coordination.

Abstract: Conventional linear crop layouts, optimised for tractors, hinder robotic
navigation with tight turns, long travel distances, and perceptual aliasing. We
propose a robot-centric square spiral layout with a central tramline, enabling
simpler motion and more efficient coverage. To exploit this geometry, we
develop a navigation stack combining DH-ResNet18 waypoint regression,
pixel-to-odometry mapping, A* planning, and model predictive control (MPC). In
simulations, the spiral layout yields up to 28% shorter paths and about 25%
faster execution for waypoint-based tasks across 500 waypoints than linear
layouts, while full-field coverage performance is comparable to an optimised
linear U-turn strategy. Multi-robot studies demonstrate efficient coordination
on the spirals rule-constrained graph, with a greedy allocator achieving 33-37%
lower batch completion times than a Hungarian assignment under our setup. These
results highlight the potential of redesigning field geometry to better suit
autonomous agriculture.

### [593] [Curriculum Imitation Learning of Distributed Multi-Robot Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25097)
*Jesús Roche,Eduardo Sebastián,Eduardo Montijano*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes an imitation learning framework for multi-robot systems that improves long-term coordination through curriculum learning and enables learning from global demonstrations by approximating egocentric perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning control policies for multi-robot systems is challenging due to long-term coordination difficulties and the lack of realistic training data. The paper addresses both limitations to enable scalable distributed policies.

Method: Two main contributions: 1) Curriculum learning that gradually increases expert trajectory length to improve long-term coordination, 2) A method to approximate egocentric perception from third-person global state demonstrations by filtering neighbors, converting reference frames, and simulating sensor variability.

Result: Experiments across tasks with varying team sizes and noise levels show that the curriculum improves long-term accuracy, and the perceptual estimation method yields policies robust to realistic uncertainty.

Conclusion: The combined strategies enable learning of robust, distributed controllers from global demonstrations without requiring expert actions or onboard measurements, addressing key challenges in multi-robot system control.

Abstract: Learning control policies for multi-robot systems (MRS) remains a major
challenge due to long-term coordination and the difficulty of obtaining
realistic training data. In this work, we address both limitations within an
imitation learning framework. First, we shift the typical role of Curriculum
Learning in MRS, from scalability with the number of robots, to focus on
improving long-term coordination. We propose a curriculum strategy that
gradually increases the length of expert trajectories during training,
stabilizing learning and enhancing the accuracy of long-term behaviors. Second,
we introduce a method to approximate the egocentric perception of each robot
using only third-person global state demonstrations. Our approach transforms
idealized trajectories into locally available observations by filtering
neighbors, converting reference frames, and simulating onboard sensor
variability. Both contributions are integrated into a physics-informed
technique to produce scalable, distributed policies from observations. We
conduct experiments across two tasks with varying team sizes and noise levels.
Results show that our curriculum improves long-term accuracy, while our
perceptual estimation method yields policies that are robust to realistic
uncertainty. Together, these strategies enable the learning of robust,
distributed controllers from global demonstrations, even in the absence of
expert actions or onboard measurements.

Motivation: Address semantic planning in unknown environments with perceptual uncertainty, where robots must reach desired locations while maintaining class-dependent distances from unknown semantically labeled regions/objects with user-defined probability guarantees.

Method: Quantify uncertainty in semantic maps constructed on-the-fly from perceptual measurements using conformal prediction in a model- and distribution-free manner.

Result: The approach consistently outperforms baselines in mission success rates and validates theoretical mission completion rates through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: First planner for semantic reach-avoid tasks that achieves user-specified mission completion rates without requiring any knowledge of sensor models or noise characteristics.

Abstract: This paper addresses semantic planning problems in unknown environments under
perceptual uncertainty. The environment contains multiple unknown semantically
labeled regions or objects, and the robot must reach desired locations while
maintaining class-dependent distances from them. We aim to compute robot paths
that complete such semantic reach-avoid tasks with user-defined probability
despite uncertain perception. Existing planning algorithms either ignore
perceptual uncertainty - thus lacking correctness guarantees - or assume known
sensor models and noise characteristics. In contrast, we present the first
planner for semantic reach-avoid tasks that achieves user-specified mission
completion rates without requiring any knowledge of sensor models or noise.
This is enabled by quantifying uncertainty in semantic maps - constructed
on-the-fly from perceptual measurements - using conformal prediction in a
model- and distribution-free manner. We validate our approach and the
theoretical mission completion rates through extensive experiments, showing
that it consistently outperforms baselines in mission success rates.
