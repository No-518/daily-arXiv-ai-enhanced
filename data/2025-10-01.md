### [1] [LUMA: Low-Dimension Unified Motion Alignment with Dual-Path Anchoring for Text-to-Motion Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25304)
*Haozhe Jia,Wenshuo Chen,Yuqi Lin,Yang Yang,Lei Wang,Mang Ning,Bowen Tian,Songning Lai,Nanqian Jia,Yifan Chen,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LUMA is a text-to-motion diffusion model that uses dual-path anchoring to address gradient attenuation and improve semantic alignment, achieving state-of-the-art performance with faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based text-to-motion models suffer from semantic misalignment and kinematic artifacts due to severe gradient attenuation in deep network layers, leading to insufficient learning of high-level features.

Method: Proposes LUMA with dual-path anchoring: 1) temporal domain supervision via lightweight MoCLIP trained with contrastive learning, and 2) frequency domain alignment using low-frequency DCT components. These anchors are adaptively fused through temporal modulation for progressive refinement during denoising.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art FID scores of 0.035 on HumanML3D and 0.123 on KIT-ML, with 1.4× faster convergence compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: LUMA provides an efficient and scalable solution for high-fidelity text-to-motion generation by effectively addressing gradient attenuation through dual-path semantic alignment.

Abstract: While current diffusion-based models, typically built on U-Net architectures,
have shown promising results on the text-to-motion generation task, they still
suffer from semantic misalignment and kinematic artifacts. Through analysis, we
identify severe gradient attenuation in the deep layers of the network as a key
bottleneck, leading to insufficient learning of high-level features. To address
this issue, we propose \textbf{LUMA} (\textit{\textbf{L}ow-dimension
\textbf{U}nified \textbf{M}otion \textbf{A}lignment}), a text-to-motion
diffusion model that incorporates dual-path anchoring to enhance semantic
alignment. The first path incorporates a lightweight MoCLIP model trained via
contrastive learning without relying on external data, offering semantic
supervision in the temporal domain. The second path introduces complementary
alignment signals in the frequency domain, extracted from low-frequency DCT
components known for their rich semantic content. These two anchors are
adaptively fused through a temporal modulation mechanism, allowing the model to
progressively transition from coarse alignment to fine-grained semantic
refinement throughout the denoising process. Experimental results on HumanML3D
and KIT-ML demonstrate that LUMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
FID scores of 0.035 and 0.123, respectively. Furthermore, LUMA accelerates
convergence by 1.4$\times$ compared to the baseline, making it an efficient and
scalable solution for high-fidelity text-to-motion generation.

### [2] [VisualOverload: Probing Visual Understanding of VLMs in Really Dense Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25339)
*Paul Gavrikov,Wei Lin,M. Jehanzeb Mirza,Soumya Jahagirdar,Muhammad Huzaifa,Sivan Doveh,Serena Yeung-Levy,James Glass,Hilde Kuehne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisualOverload is a new VQA benchmark that challenges VLMs with densely populated scenes from public-domain paintings, revealing significant performance gaps despite claims of solved visual understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test if current VLMs truly solve basic visual understanding by creating a benchmark with overloaded scenes that require detailed reasoning, as existing benchmarks may overestimate model capabilities.

Method: Created 2,720 question-answer pairs from high-resolution scans of public-domain paintings with dense content, manually annotated across six task categories to probe thorough scene understanding.

Result: Best model (o3) achieved only 19.6% accuracy on hardest test split and 69.5% overall across 37 tested models, revealing major gaps in counting, OCR, and logical reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: VisualOverload exposes critical limitations in current vision models and provides a crucial resource for developing better models that can handle complex, densely populated scenes.

Abstract: Is basic visual understanding really solved in state-of-the-art VLMs? We
present VisualOverload, a slightly different visual question answering (VQA)
benchmark comprising 2,720 question-answer pairs, with privately held
ground-truth responses. Unlike prior VQA datasets that typically focus on near
global image understanding, VisualOverload challenges models to perform simple,
knowledge-free vision tasks in densely populated (or, overloaded) scenes. Our
dataset consists of high-resolution scans of public-domain paintings that are
populated with multiple figures, actions, and unfolding subplots set against
elaborately detailed backdrops. We manually annotated these images with
questions across six task categories to probe for a thorough understanding of
the scene. We hypothesize that current benchmarks overestimate the performance
of VLMs, and encoding and reasoning over details is still a challenging task
for them, especially if they are confronted with densely populated scenes.
Indeed, we observe that even the best model (o3) out of 37 tested models only
achieves 19.6% accuracy on our hardest test split and overall 69.5% accuracy on
all questions. Beyond a thorough evaluation, we complement our benchmark with
an error analysis that reveals multiple failure modes, including a lack of
counting skills, failure in OCR, and striking logical inconsistencies under
complex tasks. Altogether, VisualOverload exposes a critical gap in current
vision models and offers a crucial resource for the community to develop better
models.

### [3] [Editing Physiological Signals in Videos Using Latent Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25348)
*Tianwen Zhou,Akshay Paruchuri,Josef Spjut,Kaan Akşit*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework that edits physiological signals (heart rate) in facial videos while preserving visual quality, addressing privacy concerns by controlling biometric information disclosure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera-based heart rate monitoring raises privacy concerns as physiological signals can reveal sensitive health and emotional information. There's a need to edit these signals while maintaining video quality.

Method: Uses a pretrained 3D VAE to encode videos, embeds target HR prompts via text encoder, fuses them with trainable spatio-temporal layers using AdaLN, and applies FiLM in decoder with fine-tuned output layer to avoid signal degradation.

Result: Achieves high visual quality (PSNR 38.96 dB, SSIM 0.98) while maintaining accurate HR modulation (10.00 bpm MAE, 10.09% MAPE) using state-of-the-art rPPG estimator.

Conclusion: The method enables controllable HR editing for applications like anonymizing biometric signals in real videos or synthesizing realistic videos with desired vital signs, balancing privacy protection with visual fidelity.

Abstract: Camera-based physiological signal estimation provides a non-contact and
convenient means to monitor Heart Rate (HR). However, the presence of vital
signals in facial videos raises significant privacy concerns, as they can
reveal sensitive personal information related to the health and emotional
states of an individual. To address this, we propose a learned framework that
edits physiological signals in videos while preserving visual fidelity. First,
we encode an input video into a latent space via a pretrained 3D Variational
Autoencoder (3D VAE), while a target HR prompt is embedded through a frozen
text encoder. We fuse them using a set of trainable spatio-temporal layers with
Adaptive Layer Normalizations (AdaLN) to capture the strong temporal coherence
of remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals. We apply Feature-wise Linear
Modulation (FiLM) in the decoder with a fine-tuned output layer to avoid the
degradation of physiological signals during reconstruction, enabling accurate
physiological modulation in the reconstructed video. Empirical results show
that our method preserves visual quality with an average PSNR of 38.96 dB and
SSIM of 0.98 on selected datasets, while achieving an average HR modulation
error of 10.00 bpm MAE and 10.09% MAPE using a state-of-the-art rPPG estimator.
Our design's controllable HR editing is useful for applications such as
anonymizing biometric signals in real videos or synthesizing realistic videos
with desired vital signs.

### [4] [SpinBench: Perspective and Rotation as a Lens on Spatial Reasoning in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25390)
*Yuyou Zhang,Radu Corcodel,Chiori Hori,Anoop Cherian,Ding Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpinBench is a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating spatial reasoning in vision language models, focusing on perspective taking across translation, rotation, object relative pose, and viewpoint change tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the core challenge of spatial reasoning in VLMs - perspective taking - which requires recognizing objects across views, relative positions grounding, and mentally simulating transformations.

Method: Created a benchmark with fine-grained diagnostic categories targeting different spatial reasoning aspects, progressively structured from single-object tasks to demanding multi-object perspective-taking scenarios. Evaluated 37 state-of-the-art VLMs.

Result: Revealed systematic weaknesses including strong egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding, and inconsistencies under symmetrical and syntactic reformulations. Human subjects achieved 91.2% accuracy, with human response time strongly correlating with VLM accuracy.

Conclusion: SpinBench provides critical insights into spatial reasoning gaps in VLMs and captures spatial reasoning challenges shared across humans and models, highlighting key deficiencies in their ability to reason about physical space.

Abstract: We present SpinBench, a cognitively grounded diagnostic benchmark for
evaluating spatial reasoning in vision language models (VLMs). SpinBench is
designed around the core challenge of spatial reasoning: perspective taking,
the ability to reason about how scenes and object relations change under
viewpoint transformation. Since perspective taking requires multiple cognitive
capabilities, such as recognizing objects across views, relative positions
grounding, and mentally simulating transformations, SpinBench introduces a set
of fine-grained diagnostic categories. Our categories target translation,
rotation, object relative pose, and viewpoint change, and are progressively
structured so that single-object simpler tasks scaffold toward the most
demanding multi-object perspective-taking setting. We evaluate 37
state-of-the-art VLMs, both proprietary and open source. Results reveal
systematic weaknesses: strong egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding,
and inconsistencies under symmetrical and syntactic reformulations. Scaling
analysis shows both smooth improvements and emergent capabilities. While human
subjects achieve high accuracy (91.2\%), task difficulty as measured by human
response time shows strong correlation with VLM accuracy, indicating that
SpinBench captures spatial reasoning challenges shared across humans and VLMs.
We believe SpinBench provides critical insights into spatial reasoning in VLMs
and highlights key gaps in their ability to reason about physical space. Our

### [5] [A Deep Learning Approach for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of InSAR Ground Deformation in Eastern Ireland](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25393)
*Wendong Yao,Binhua Huang,Soumyabrata Dev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MM-STT is a novel multi-modal transformer framework that fuses dynamic displacement data with static physical priors using joint spatio-temporal attention, achieving state-of-the-art performance in high-resolution land subsidence forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard architectures like ConvLSTM fail to model long-range dependencies in land subsidence forecasting, and prior work is limited by uni-modal data paradigms that don't leverage multiple data sources effectively.

Method: Proposes Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT) with joint spatio-temporal attention mechanism that processes multi-modal features (dynamic displacement data and static physical priors) in a unified manner.

Result: Establishes new state-of-the-art on EGMS dataset, reducing long-range forecast RMSE by an order of magnitude compared to all baselines including SOTA methods like STGCN and STAEformer.

Conclusion: For land subsidence forecasting problems, an architecture's inherent capacity for deep multi-modal fusion is paramount for achieving transformative performance, demonstrating the superiority of multi-modal approaches over uni-modal paradigms.

Abstract: Forecasting high-resolution land subsidence is a critical yet challenging
task due to its complex, non-linear dynamics. While standard architectures like
ConvLSTM often fail to model long-range dependencies, we argue that a more
fundamental limitation of prior work lies in the uni-modal data paradigm. To
address this, we propose the Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT),
a novel framework that fuses dynamic displacement data with static physical
priors. Its core innovation is a joint spatio-temporal attention mechanism that
processes all multi-modal features in a unified manner. On the public EGMS
dataset, MM-STT establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing the long-range
forecast RMSE by an order of magnitude compared to all baselines, including
SOTA methods like STGCN and STAEformer. Our results demonstrate that for this
class of problems, an architecture's inherent capacity for deep multi-modal
fusion is paramount for achieving transformative performance.

### [6] [DepthLM: Metric Depth From Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25413)
*Zhipeng Cai,Ching-Feng Yeh,Hu Xu,Zhuang Liu,Gregory Meyer,Xinjie Lei,Changsheng Zhao,Shang-Wen Li,Vikas Chandra,Yangyang Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs can achieve expert-level 3D understanding through simple text-based supervised finetuning with sparse labels, without needing specialized architectures or complex losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art VLMs struggle with 3D understanding from 2D inputs, while expert vision models excel at metric depth estimation but require task-specific designs. This gap motivates exploring whether VLMs can reach expert accuracy without architectural changes.

Method: Uses text-based supervised finetuning with sparse labels, addressing pixel reference and camera ambiguity through visual prompting and intrinsic-conditioned augmentation. No dense prediction heads or complex regression losses needed.

Result: DepthLM surpasses advanced VLMs by over 2x in accuracy, making VLMs comparable to pure vision models for the first time. It naturally avoids over-smoothing and has fewer flying points at boundaries than pure vision models.

Conclusion: Simple text-based finetuning is sufficient for VLMs to unlock strong 3D understanding, enabling a single VLM to handle various 3D tasks beyond metric depth estimation.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) can flexibly address various vision tasks
through text interactions. Although successful in semantic understanding,
state-of-the-art VLMs including GPT-5 still struggle in understanding 3D from
2D inputs. On the other hand, expert pure vision models achieve super-human
accuracy in metric depth estimation, a key 3D understanding task. However, they
require task-specific architectures and losses. Such difference motivates us to
ask: Can VLMs reach expert-level accuracy without architecture or loss change?
We take per-pixel metric depth estimation as the representative task and show
that the answer is yes! Surprisingly, comprehensive analysis shows that
text-based supervised-finetuning with sparse labels is sufficient for VLMs to
unlock strong 3D understanding, no dense prediction head or complex
regression/regularization loss is needed. The bottleneck for VLMs lies actually
in pixel reference and cross-dataset camera ambiguity, which we address through
visual prompting and intrinsic-conditioned augmentation. With much smaller
models, our method DepthLM surpasses the accuracy of most advanced VLMs by over
2x, making VLMs for the first time comparable with pure vision models.
Interestingly, without explicit enforcement during training, VLMs trained with
DepthLM naturally avoids over-smoothing, having much fewer flying points at
boundary regions than pure vision models. The simplicity of DepthLM also
enables a single VLM to cover various 3D tasks beyond metric depth. Our code
and model will be released at the link below.

### [7] [Bayesian Transformer for Pan-Arctic Sea Ice Concentration Mapping and Uncertainty Estimation using Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2 Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25437)
*Mabel Heffring,Lincoln Linlin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Bayesian Transformer approach for high-resolution Pan-Arctic sea ice concentration mapping with uncertainty quantification using multi-sensor data fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution mapping of Pan-Arctic sea ice with reliable uncertainty is essential for operational sea ice concentration charting, but faces challenges including subtle ice signature features, model uncertainty, and data heterogeneity.

Method: 1) Designed a novel high-resolution Transformer model with global and local modules for better feature extraction of subtle sea ice patterns; 2) Extended the Transformer to Bayesian framework treating parameters as random variables for uncertainty quantification; 3) Fused Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2 data at decision-level to address data heterogeneity.

Result: Tested on Pan-Arctic datasets from September 2021, the proposed model achieved both high-resolution SIC maps and robust uncertainty maps compared to other uncertainty quantification approaches.

Conclusion: The Bayesian Transformer approach successfully addresses key challenges in sea ice concentration mapping by combining advanced deep learning architecture with uncertainty quantification and multi-sensor data fusion.

Abstract: Although high-resolution mapping of Pan-Arctic sea ice with reliable
corresponding uncertainty is essential for operational sea ice concentration
(SIC) charting, it is a difficult task due to some key challenges, e.g., the
subtle nature of ice signature features, model uncertainty, and data
heterogeneity. This letter presents a novel Bayesian Transformer approach for
Pan-Arctic SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification using Sentinel-1,
RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), and Advanced Microwave Scanning
Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) data. First, to improve feature extraction, we design a
novel high-resolution Transformer model with both global and local modules that
can better discern the subtle differences in sea ice patterns. Second, to
improve uncertainty quantification, we design a Bayesian extension of the
proposed Transformer model, treating its parameters as random variables to more
effectively capture uncertainties. Third, to address data heterogeneity, we
fuse three different data types (Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2) at decision-level
to improve both SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification. The proposed
approach is tested on Pan-Arctic datasets from September 2021, and the results
demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve both high-resolution SIC maps
and robust uncertainty maps compared to other uncertainty quantification
approaches.

*Suhala Rabab Saba,Sakib Khan,Minhaj Uddin Ahmad,Jiahe Cao,Mizanur Rahman,Li Zhao,Nathan Huynh,Eren Erman Ozguven*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a sensor fusion framework using roadside cameras and LiDAR with Kalman Filter-based late fusion to improve vehicle detection and localization in work zones, achieving up to 70% reduction in longitudinal error while maintaining lateral accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address practical deployment barriers in infrastructure-based sensing for work zone safety, including perspective distortion, complex geometry, occlusions, and cost constraints.

Method: Integration of roadside camera and LiDAR sensors into a cosimulation environment, employing Kalman Filter-based late fusion strategy to enhance trajectory consistency and accuracy.

Result: Fusion algorithm reduced longitudinal error by up to 70% compared to individual sensors while preserving lateral accuracy within 1-3 meters. Field validation showed fused trajectories closely match real vehicle paths even with intermittent or degraded single-sensor data.

Conclusion: KF-based sensor fusion reliably compensates for individual sensor limitations, providing precise and robust vehicle tracking capabilities for infrastructure-enabled multi-sensor systems in complex traffic environments.

Abstract: Infrastructure-based sensing and real-time trajectory generation show promise
for improving safety in high-risk roadway segments such as work zones, yet
practical deployments are hindered by perspective distortion, complex geometry,
occlusions, and costs. This study tackles these barriers by integrating
roadside camera and LiDAR sensors into a cosimulation environment to develop a
scalable, cost-effective vehicle detection and localization framework, and
employing a Kalman Filter-based late fusion strategy to enhance trajectory
consistency and accuracy. In simulation, the fusion algorithm reduced
longitudinal error by up to 70 percent compared to individual sensors while
preserving lateral accuracy within 1 to 3 meters. Field validation in an active
work zone, using LiDAR, a radar-camera rig, and RTK-GPS as ground truth,
demonstrated that the fused trajectories closely match real vehicle paths, even
when single-sensor data are intermittent or degraded. These results confirm
that KF based sensor fusion can reliably compensate for individual sensor
limitations, providing precise and robust vehicle tracking capabilities. Our
approach thus offers a practical pathway to deploy infrastructure-enabled
multi-sensor systems for proactive safety measures in complex traffic
environments.

### [9] [Seeing Before Reasoning: A Unified Framework for Generalizable and Explainable Fake Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25502)
*Kaiqing Lin,Zhiyuan Yan,Ruoxin Chen,Junyan Ye,Ke-Yue Zhang,Yue Zhou,Peng Jin,Bin Li,Taiping Yao,Shouhong Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Forensic-Chat, a new MLLM-based approach for AI-generated image detection that emphasizes 'seeing before reasoning' by first training models to perceive forgery artifacts before reasoning about them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs perform poorly in AI-generated image detection because their vision encoders are optimized for semantic recognition rather than low-level forgery traces, and fine-tuning causes catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge.

Method: Proposed Forensic-Chat framework that trains MLLMs to first perceive artifacts (artifact-aware visual perception) before reasoning, and introduced ExplainFake-Bench benchmark for evaluating explainability in image forensics.

Result: Extensive experiments show Forensic-Chat achieves superior generalization and genuinely reliable explainability compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The 'seeing before reasoning' paradigm enables MLLMs to become effective, generalizable, and explainable assistants for fake image detection while maintaining conversational capabilities.

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated images with multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
has gained increasing attention, due to their rich world knowledge,
common-sense reasoning, and potential for explainability. However, naively
applying those MLLMs for detection often leads to suboptimal performance. We
argue that the root of this failure lies in a fundamental mismatch: MLLMs are
asked to reason about fakes before they can truly see them. First, they do not
really see: existing MLLMs' vision encoders are primarily optimized for
semantic-oriented recognition rather than the perception of low-level signals,
leaving them insensitive to subtle forgery traces. Without access to reliable
perceptual evidence, the model grounds its judgment on incomplete and limited
visual observations. Second, existing finetuning data for detection typically
uses narrow, instruction-style formats, which diverge sharply from the diverse,
heterogeneous distributions seen in pretraining. In the absence of meaningful
visual cues, the model therefore exploits these linguistic shortcuts, resulting
in catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge (even the basic dialogue
capabilities). In response, we advocate for a new paradigm: seeing before
reasoning. We propose that MLLMs should first be trained to perceive
artifacts-strengthening their artifact-aware visual perception-so that
subsequent reasoning is grounded in actual observations. We therefore propose
Forensic-Chat, a generalizable, explainable, and still-conversational (for
multi-round dialogue) assistant for fake image detection. We also propose
ExplainFake-Bench, a benchmark tailored for the evaluation of the MLLM's
explainability for image forensics from five key aspects. Extensive experiments
show its superiority of generalization and genuinely reliable explainability.

### [10] [DeepFake Detection in Dyadic Video Calls using Point of Gaze Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25503)
*Odin Kohler,Rahul Vijaykumar,Masudul H. Imtiaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Real-time deepfake detection method using gaze tracking to identify phishing attacks in video calls by analyzing subtle nonverbal communication patterns that deepfakes cannot replicate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Malicious actors are using real-time deepfake technology for phishing attacks during video meetings, exploiting the ability to see what the deepfake is viewing and leveraging gaze information.

Method: Built model using explainable features from research on gaze patterns during dyadic conversations, utilizing point-of-gaze tracking to detect deepfakes based on their inability to mimic subtle nonverbal communication.

Result: Achieved 82% accuracy on a novel dataset, making this the first method to utilize point-of-gaze tracking for deepfake detection.

Conclusion: Point-of-gaze tracking provides an effective biometric approach for real-time deepfake detection in video meetings, leveraging subtle nonverbal communication patterns that current deepfake technology cannot replicate.

Abstract: With recent advancements in deepfake technology, it is now possible to
generate convincing deepfakes in real-time. Unfortunately, malicious actors
have started to use this new technology to perform real-time phishing attacks
during video meetings. The nature of a video call allows access to what the
deepfake is ``seeing,'' that is, the screen displayed to the malicious actor.
Using this with the estimated gaze from the malicious actors streamed video
enables us to estimate where the deepfake is looking on screen, the point of
gaze. Because the point of gaze during conversations is not random and is
instead used as a subtle nonverbal communicator, it can be used to detect
deepfakes, which are not capable of mimicking this subtle nonverbal
communication. This paper proposes a real-time deepfake detection method
adapted to this genre of attack, utilizing previously unavailable biometric
information. We built our model based on explainable features selected after
careful review of research on gaze patterns during dyadic conversations. We
then test our model on a novel dataset of our creation, achieving an accuracy
of 82\%. This is the first reported method to utilize point-of-gaze tracking
for deepfake detection.

TL;DR: A novel vision-based 6-DoF object pose estimation method for Mars Sample Return missions using custom renderer and edge-based template matching with low-fidelity 3D models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for robotic arm to localize objects for pickup and insertion in Mars missions under severely constrained hardware limitations.

Method: Custom renderer combined with new template matching metric tailored to edge domain, using only low-fidelity textureless 3D models as inputs.

Result: Consistently outperforms state-of-the-art in compute and memory-constrained localization, showing improved robustness and accuracy in synthetic datasets, Earth testbeds, and Mars imagery.

Conclusion: Enables new possibilities for cheap and reliable localization on general-purpose hardware for space applications.

Abstract: We consider the problem of vision-based 6-DoF object pose estimation in the
context of the notional Mars Sample Return campaign, in which a robotic arm
would need to localize multiple objects of interest for low-clearance pickup
and insertion, under severely constrained hardware. We propose a novel
localization algorithm leveraging a custom renderer together with a new
template matching metric tailored to the edge domain to achieve robust pose
estimation using only low-fidelity, textureless 3D models as inputs. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic datasets as well as from physical testbeds on Earth
and in situ Mars imagery shows that our method consistently beats the state of
the art in compute and memory-constrained localization, both in terms of
robustness and accuracy, in turn enabling new possibilities for cheap and
reliable localization on general-purpose hardware.

*Pranav Saxena,Avigyan Bhattacharya,Ji Zhang,Wenshan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLM-RG is a hybrid pipeline combining vision-language models and large language models for referential grounding in outdoor driving scenes, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Talk2Car benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Outdoor driving scenes present challenges for referential grounding due to large scene variability, visually similar objects, and dynamic elements that complicate resolving natural-language references.

Method: A hybrid pipeline that uses LLMs to extract object types/attributes, detects candidate regions, generates visual descriptors with VLMs, and combines these with spatial metadata into natural-language prompts for chain-of-thought reasoning to identify referent bounding boxes.

Result: LLM-RG yields substantial gains over both LLM and VLM-based baselines on the Talk2Car benchmark, with ablations showing that adding 3D spatial cues further improves grounding performance.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates complementary strengths of VLMs and LLMs applied in zero-shot manner for robust outdoor referential grounding.

Abstract: Referential grounding in outdoor driving scenes is challenging due to large
scene variability, many visually similar objects, and dynamic elements that
complicate resolving natural-language references (e.g., "the black car on the
right"). We propose LLM-RG, a hybrid pipeline that combines off-the-shelf
vision-language models for fine-grained attribute extraction with large
language models for symbolic reasoning. LLM-RG processes an image and a
free-form referring expression by using an LLM to extract relevant object types
and attributes, detecting candidate regions, generating rich visual descriptors
with a VLM, and then combining these descriptors with spatial metadata into
natural-language prompts that are input to an LLM for chain-of-thought
reasoning to identify the referent's bounding box. Evaluated on the Talk2Car
benchmark, LLM-RG yields substantial gains over both LLM and VLM-based
baselines. Additionally, our ablations show that adding 3D spatial cues further
improves grounding. Our results demonstrate the complementary strengths of VLMs
and LLMs, applied in a zero-shot manner, for robust outdoor referential
grounding.

### [13] [VISOR++: Universal Visual Inputs based Steering for Large Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25533)
*Ravikumar Balakrishnan,Mansi Phute*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISOR++ introduces universal visual input-based steering to control Vision Language Model behaviors without runtime model access, using optimized images that work across multiple VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing behavioral control methods for VLMs have limitations - system prompts can be overridden and activation-based steering requires invasive model access, making them unsuitable for API-based services and closed-source models.

Method: Develop VISOR++ images that are optimized visual inputs crafted to induce target activation patterns, enabling behavioral control through visual inputs alone without runtime model access.

Result: VISOR++ images achieve performance parity with steering vectors for refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct tasks on open-access models, work on unseen models (including closed-access), and preserve 99.9% performance on unrelated MMLU tasks.

Conclusion: VISOR++ provides a deployment-agnostic approach to VLM behavioral control using universal visual inputs, eliminating the need for runtime model access while maintaining effectiveness across multiple models.

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) are deployed across safety-critical
applications, understanding and controlling their behavioral patterns has
become increasingly important. Existing behavioral control methods face
significant limitations: system prompting approaches could easily be overridden
by user instructions, while applying activation-based steering vectors requires
invasive runtime access to model internals, precluding deployment with
API-based services and closed-source models. Finding steering methods that
transfer across multiple VLMs is still an open area of research. To this end,
we introduce universal visual input based steering for output redirection
(VISOR++), to achieve behavioral control through optimized visual inputs alone.
We demonstrate that a single VISOR++ image can be generated for an ensemble of
VLMs to emulate each of their steering vectors. By crafting universal visual
inputs that induce target activation patterns, VISOR++ eliminates the need for
runtime model access while remaining deployment-agnostic. This means that when
an underlying model supports multimodal capability, model behaviors can be
steered by inserting an image input replacing runtime steering vector based
interventions. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the VISOR++ images on
open-access models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and IDEFICS2-8B along three alignment
directions: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. Both the model-specific
steering images and the jointly optimized images achieve performance parity
closely following that of steering vectors for both positive and negative
steering tasks. We also show the promise of VISOR++ images in achieving
directional behavioral shifts for unseen models including both open-access and
closed-access ones. Furthermore, VISOR++ images are able to preserve 99.9%
performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU evaluation tasks.

*Qinsi Wang,Bo Liu,Tianyi Zhou,Jing Shi,Yueqian Lin,Yiran Chen,Hai Helen Li,Kun Wan,Wentian Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-Zero is a domain-agnostic framework that enables vision-language models to self-improve through competitive visual games generated from arbitrary image pairs, eliminating the need for human-annotated training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods for enhancing VLM reasoning capabilities heavily depend on labor-intensive datasets requiring manual construction and verification, leading to high training costs and limiting practical deployment.

Method: Uses strategic self-play framework with 'Who Is the Spy'-style games where models engage in strategic reasoning across multiple roles, generating training data autonomously. Introduces Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization (Iterative-SPO) that alternates between self-play and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning, chart question answering, and vision-centric understanding tasks despite using label-free data, surpassing other annotation-based methods.

Conclusion: Vision-Zero demonstrates that VLMs can effectively self-improve through gamified learning without human annotation, showing strong generalization across diverse domains and achieving sustainable performance gains.

Abstract: Although reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively enhance the reasoning
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), current methods remain heavily
dependent on labor-intensive datasets that require extensive manual
construction and verification, leading to extremely high training costs and
consequently constraining the practical deployment of VLMs. To address this
challenge, we propose Vision-Zero, a domain-agnostic framework enabling VLM
self-improvement through competitive visual games generated from arbitrary
image pairs. Specifically, Vision-Zero encompasses three main attributes: (1)
Strategic Self-Play Framework: Vision-Zero trains VLMs in "Who Is the
Spy"-style games, where the models engage in strategic reasoning and actions
across multiple roles. Through interactive gameplay, models autonomously
generate their training data without human annotation. (2) Gameplay from
Arbitrary Images: Unlike existing gamified frameworks, Vision-Zero can generate
games from arbitrary images, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning ability
across diverse domains and showing strong generalization to different tasks. We
demonstrate this versatility using three distinct types of image datasets:
CLEVR-based synthetic scenes, charts, and real-world images. (3) Sustainable
Performance Gain: We introduce Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization
(Iterative-SPO), a novel training algorithm that alternates between Self-Play
and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), mitigating the
performance plateau often seen in self-play-only training and achieving
sustained long-term improvements. Despite using label-free data, Vision-Zero
achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning, chart question answering,
and vision-centric understanding tasks, surpassing other annotation-based
methods. Models and code has been released at

### [15] [Hybrid Approach for Enhancing Lesion Segmentation in Fundus Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25549)
*Mohammadmahdi Eshragh,Emad A. Mohammed,Behrouz Far,Ezekiel Weis,Carol L Shields,Sandor R Ferenczy,Trafford Crump*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a hybrid model combining mathematical/clustering segmentation with U-Net insights for precise choroidal nevus segmentation in fundus images, achieving superior performance over Attention U-Net.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of choroidal nevi is critical for preventing transformation to melanoma, but current AI methods face challenges due to low-resolution datasets and inconsistent labeling, limiting segmentation accuracy.

Method: Hybrid approach combining mathematical/clustering segmentation models with U-Net insights, leveraging strengths of both methods to reduce dependency on large annotated datasets.

Result: Achieved Dice coefficient of 89.7% and IoU of 80.01% on 1024*1024 fundus images, significantly outperforming Attention U-Net (51.3% Dice, 34.2% IoU) and demonstrating better generalizability on external datasets.

Conclusion: The hybrid model provides a robust solution for choroidal nevus segmentation with potential for developing decision support systems and automated lesion annotation tools to enhance diagnostic speed and accuracy.

Abstract: Choroidal nevi are common benign pigmented lesions in the eye, with a small
risk of transforming into melanoma. Early detection is critical to improving
survival rates, but misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis can lead to poor
outcomes. Despite advancements in AI-based image analysis, diagnosing choroidal
nevi in colour fundus images remains challenging, particularly for clinicians
without specialized expertise. Existing datasets often suffer from low
resolution and inconsistent labelling, limiting the effectiveness of
segmentation models. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving precise
segmentation of fundus lesions, a critical step toward developing robust
diagnostic tools. While deep learning models like U-Net have demonstrated
effectiveness, their accuracy heavily depends on the quality and quantity of
annotated data. Previous mathematical/clustering segmentation methods, though
accurate, required extensive human input, making them impractical for medical
applications. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines
mathematical/clustering segmentation models with insights from U-Net,
leveraging the strengths of both methods. This hybrid model improves accuracy,
reduces the need for large-scale training data, and achieves significant
performance gains on high-resolution fundus images. The proposed model achieves
a Dice coefficient of 89.7% and an IoU of 80.01% on 1024*1024 fundus images,
outperforming the Attention U-Net model, which achieved 51.3% and 34.2%,
respectively. It also demonstrated better generalizability on external
datasets. This work forms a part of a broader effort to develop a decision
support system for choroidal nevus diagnosis, with potential applications in
automated lesion annotation to enhance the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and
monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs perform poorly in fine-grained fish species recognition (<10% accuracy), prompting creation of FishNet++ benchmark with extensive multimodal annotations to advance aquatic science.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs show impressive cross-domain capabilities but their proficiency in specialized scientific fields like marine biology remains underexplored, particularly for critical tasks like fish species recognition needed for monitoring marine ecosystems under anthropogenic pressure.

Method: Systematically evaluated state-of-the-art MLLMs and introduced FishNet++, a large-scale multimodal benchmark with 35,133 textual descriptions, 706,426 key-point annotations, and 119,399 bounding boxes to facilitate development of specialized vision-language models.

Result: Revealed significant limitations in MLLMs' ability to perform fine-grained recognition of fish species, with best open-source models achieving less than 10% accuracy.

Conclusion: FishNet++ addresses the domain knowledge gap in MLLMs for marine biology and provides comprehensive annotations to enable development of specialized models capable of advancing aquatic science.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
cross-domain capabilities, yet their proficiency in specialized scientific
fields like marine biology remains underexplored. In this work, we
systematically evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs and reveal significant
limitations in their ability to perform fine-grained recognition of fish
species, with the best open-source models achieving less than 10\% accuracy.
This task is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems under anthropogenic
pressure. To address this gap and investigate whether these failures stem from
a lack of domain knowledge, we introduce FishNet++, a large-scale, multimodal
benchmark. FishNet++ significantly extends existing resources with 35,133
textual descriptions for multimodal learning, 706,426 key-point annotations for
morphological studies, and 119,399 bounding boxes for detection. By providing
this comprehensive suite of annotations, our work facilitates the development
and evaluation of specialized vision-language models capable of advancing
aquatic science.

*Hakan Emre Gedik,Andrew Martin,Mustafa Munir,Oguzhan Baser,Radu Marculescu,Sandeep P. Chinchali,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed AttentionViG, a Vision Graph Neural Network using cross-attention for node-neighbor aggregation, achieving SOTA on ImageNet-1K and strong transfer performance on downstream tasks while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph convolution methods in ViGs lack a versatile aggregation method that effectively captures complex node-neighbor relationships without architecture-specific refinements.

Method: Cross-attention-based aggregation where query projections come from nodes and key projections from neighbors, implemented in AttentionViG architecture for non-local message passing.

Result: Achieved SOTA performance on ImageNet-1K benchmark and demonstrated strong transferability to object detection, instance segmentation on MS COCO 2017, and semantic segmentation on ADE20K.

Conclusion: The proposed cross-attention aggregation method enables effective node-neighbor relationship modeling while maintaining competitive accuracy with comparable FLOPs to prior vision GNN architectures.

Abstract: Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) have demonstrated promising performance
in image recognition tasks against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
Vision Transformers (ViTs). An essential part of the ViG framework is the
node-neighbor feature aggregation method. Although various graph convolution
methods, such as Max-Relative, EdgeConv, GIN, and GraphSAGE, have been
explored, a versatile aggregation method that effectively captures complex
node-neighbor relationships without requiring architecture-specific refinements
is needed. To address this gap, we propose a cross-attention-based aggregation
method in which the query projections come from the node, while the key
projections come from its neighbors. Additionally, we introduce a novel
architecture called AttentionViG that uses the proposed cross-attention
aggregation scheme to conduct non-local message passing. We evaluated the image
recognition performance of AttentionViG on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, where it
achieved SOTA performance. Additionally, we assessed its transferability to
downstream tasks, including object detection and instance segmentation on MS
COCO 2017, as well as semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our results demonstrate
that the proposed method not only achieves strong performance, but also
maintains efficiency, delivering competitive accuracy with comparable FLOPs to
prior vision GNN architectures.

### [18] [MetaChest: Generalized few-shot learning of patologies from chest X-rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25590)
*Berenice Montalvo-Lezama,Gibran Fuentes-Pineda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MetaChest, a large-scale chest X-ray dataset for few-shot learning, and shows that standard transfer learning outperforms specialized few-shot methods like ProtoNet in medical image classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image analysis faces data scarcity issues, and existing few-shot learning methods are typically studied in standard settings rather than the more practical generalized few-shot scenario where new classes are learned alongside known ones.

Method: Created MetaChest dataset with 479,215 chest X-rays from 4 public databases, designed meta-set partition for few-shot classification, developed algorithm for multi-label episode generation, and evaluated transfer learning vs ProtoNet extension across various few-shot multi-label classification tasks.

Result: Increasing classes per episode and training examples per class improves performance; transfer learning consistently outperforms ProtoNet despite not being designed for few-shot learning; higher-resolution images improve accuracy but increase computation; efficient models achieve comparable performance with fewer resources.

Conclusion: Standard transfer learning approaches can be more effective than specialized few-shot methods for medical image classification, and practical considerations like computational efficiency and dataset design significantly impact performance in real-world medical applications.

Abstract: The limited availability of annotated data presents a major challenge for
applying deep learning methods to medical image analysis. Few-shot learning
methods aim to recognize new classes from only a small number of labeled
examples. These methods are typically studied under the standard few-shot
learning setting, where all classes in a task are new. However, medical
applications such as pathology classification from chest X-rays often require
learning new classes while simultaneously leveraging knowledge of previously
known ones, a scenario more closely aligned with generalized few-shot
classification. Despite its practical relevance, few-shot learning has been
scarcely studied in this context. In this work, we present MetaChest, a
large-scale dataset of 479,215 chest X-rays collected from four public
databases. MetaChest includes a meta-set partition specifically designed for
standard few-shot classification, as well as an algorithm for generating
multi-label episodes. We conduct extensive experiments evaluating both a
standard transfer learning approach and an extension of ProtoNet across a wide
range of few-shot multi-label classification tasks. Our results demonstrate
that increasing the number of classes per episode and the number of training
examples per class improves classification performance. Notably, the transfer
learning approach consistently outperforms the ProtoNet extension, despite not
being tailored for few-shot learning. We also show that higher-resolution
images improve accuracy at the cost of additional computation, while efficient
model architectures achieve comparable performance to larger models with
significantly reduced resource requirements.

### [19] [K-Prism: A Knowledge-Guided and Prompt Integrated Universal Medical Image Segmentation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25594)
*Bangwei Guo,Yunhe Gao,Meng Ye,Difei Gu,Yang Zhou,Leon Axel,Dimitris Metaxas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: K-Prism is a unified medical image segmentation framework that integrates three knowledge paradigms: semantic priors, in-context knowledge from reference examples, and interactive feedback, using a dual-prompt representation with Mixture-of-Experts decoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical image segmentation models are fragmented and trained on single knowledge sources, while clinical practice requires seamless integration of diverse knowledge from anatomical priors, exemplar-based reasoning, and iterative refinement.

Method: The framework encodes heterogeneous knowledge sources into dual-prompt representation (1-D sparse prompts for what to segment and 2-D dense prompts for where to attend), dynamically routed through a Mixture-of-Experts decoder for flexible switching between paradigms.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on 18 public datasets across diverse modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, pathology, ultrasound) show state-of-the-art performance in semantic, in-context, and interactive segmentation settings.

Conclusion: K-Prism successfully unifies multiple knowledge paradigms in medical image segmentation, mirroring clinical flexibility and achieving superior performance across diverse tasks without architectural modifications.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is fundamental to clinical decision-making, yet
existing models remain fragmented. They are usually trained on single knowledge
sources and specific to individual tasks, modalities, or organs. This
fragmentation contrasts sharply with clinical practice, where experts
seamlessly integrate diverse knowledge: anatomical priors from training,
exemplar-based reasoning from reference cases, and iterative refinement through
real-time interaction. We present $\textbf{K-Prism}$, a unified segmentation
framework that mirrors this clinical flexibility by systematically integrating
three knowledge paradigms: (i) $\textit{semantic priors}$ learned from
annotated datasets, (ii) $\textit{in-context knowledge}$ from few-shot
reference examples, and (iii) $\textit{interactive feedback}$ from user inputs
like clicks or scribbles. Our key insight is that these heterogeneous knowledge
sources can be encoded into a dual-prompt representation: 1-D sparse prompts
defining $\textit{what}$ to segment and 2-D dense prompts indicating
$\textit{where}$ to attend, which are then dynamically routed through a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder. This design enables flexible switching
between paradigms and joint training across diverse tasks without architectural
modifications. Comprehensive experiments on 18 public datasets spanning diverse
modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, pathology, ultrasound, etc.) demonstrate that
K-Prism achieves state-of-the-art performance across semantic, in-context, and
interactive segmentation settings. Code will be released upon publication.

### [20] [GaussianLens: Localized High-Resolution Reconstruction via On-Demand Gaussian Densification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25603)
*Yijia Weng,Zhicheng Wang,Songyou Peng,Saining Xie,Howard Zhou,Leonidas J. Guibas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes GaussianLens for localized high-resolution 3D reconstruction using on-demand Gaussian densification, enabling fine detail capture in user-specified regions without full high-resolution reconstruction costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human perception focuses on regions of interest, requiring spatially varying detail levels in scene reconstruction. Current methods either produce uniform resolution outputs (inefficient for high-res) or require dense observations and lengthy optimization.

Method: Given low-resolution 3DGS reconstruction, uses a generalizable network to densify 3DGS in user-specified regions using sparse high-resolution observations. Features multi-modal fusion and pixel-guided densification mechanism for large resolution increases.

Result: Superior performance in local fine detail reconstruction with strong scalability to 1024×1024 resolution images.

Conclusion: GaussianLens effectively bridges the gap between costly holistic high-resolution reconstruction and user needs for localized fine details through on-demand Gaussian densification.

Abstract: We perceive our surroundings with an active focus, paying more attention to
regions of interest, such as the shelf labels in a grocery store. When it comes
to scene reconstruction, this human perception trait calls for spatially
varying degrees of detail ready for closer inspection in critical regions,
preferably reconstructed on demand. While recent works in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) achieve fast, generalizable reconstruction from sparse views, their
uniform resolution output leads to high computational costs unscalable to
high-resolution training. As a result, they cannot leverage available images at
their original high resolution to reconstruct details. Per-scene optimization
methods reconstruct finer details with adaptive density control, yet require
dense observations and lengthy offline optimization. To bridge the gap between
the prohibitive cost of high-resolution holistic reconstructions and the user
needs for localized fine details, we propose the problem of localized
high-resolution reconstruction via on-demand Gaussian densification. Given a
low-resolution 3DGS reconstruction, the goal is to learn a generalizable
network that densifies the initial 3DGS to capture fine details in a
user-specified local region of interest (RoI), based on sparse high-resolution
observations of the RoI. This formulation avoids the high cost and redundancy
of uniformly high-resolution reconstructions and fully leverages
high-resolution captures in critical regions. We propose GaussianLens, a
feed-forward densification framework that fuses multi-modal information from
the initial 3DGS and multi-view images. We further design a pixel-guided
densification mechanism that effectively captures details under large
resolution increases. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance
in local fine detail reconstruction and strong scalability to images of up to
$1024\times1024$ resolution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A large-scale multimodal ophthalmology benchmark dataset with 32,633 instances across 12 eye diseases and 5 imaging modalities, designed to evaluate MLLMs for medical image interpretation in ophthalmology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-threatening eye diseases pose major global health burdens, but timely diagnosis is limited by workforce shortages and restricted access to specialized care. Current MLLM advancement in ophthalmology is hindered by lack of comprehensive benchmark datasets suitable for evaluating generative models.

Method: Created a multimodal benchmark integrating imaging, anatomical structures, demographics, and free-text annotations. Extended preliminary LMOD benchmark with 50% dataset expansion (especially color fundus photography), broadened task coverage (binary/multi-class diagnosis, severity classification, demographic prediction), and systematically evaluated 24 state-of-the-art MLLMs.

Result: Top-performing models achieved ~58% accuracy in disease screening under zero-shot settings, but performance remained suboptimal for challenging tasks like disease staging. The benchmark enables evaluation across anatomical structure recognition, disease screening, disease staging, and demographic prediction for bias evaluation.

Conclusion: The publicly released dataset, curation pipeline, and leaderboard will potentially advance ophthalmic AI applications and help reduce the global burden of vision-threatening diseases by enabling better evaluation and development of MLLMs for ophthalmology.

Abstract: Vision-threatening eye diseases pose a major global health burden, with
timely diagnosis limited by workforce shortages and restricted access to
specialized care. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise
for medical image interpretation, advancing MLLMs for ophthalmology is hindered
by the lack of comprehensive benchmark datasets suitable for evaluating
generative models. We present a large-scale multimodal ophthalmology benchmark
comprising 32,633 instances with multi-granular annotations across 12 common
ophthalmic conditions and 5 imaging modalities. The dataset integrates imaging,
anatomical structures, demographics, and free-text annotations, supporting
anatomical structure recognition, disease screening, disease staging, and
demographic prediction for bias evaluation. This work extends our preliminary
LMOD benchmark with three major enhancements: (1) nearly 50% dataset expansion
with substantial enlargement of color fundus photography; (2) broadened task
coverage including binary disease diagnosis, multi-class diagnosis, severity
classification with international grading standards, and demographic
prediction; and (3) systematic evaluation of 24 state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our
evaluations reveal both promise and limitations. Top-performing models achieved
~58% accuracy in disease screening under zero-shot settings, and performance
remained suboptimal for challenging tasks like disease staging. We will
publicly release the dataset, curation pipeline, and leaderboard to potentially
advance ophthalmic AI applications and reduce the global burden of
vision-threatening diseases.

*Xingtao Ling,Chenlin Fu,Yingying Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AFGeo is an anchor-free cross-view object geo-localization method that directly predicts directional offsets to ground-truth boxes, eliminating dependency on predefined anchors through Gaussian Position Encoding and Cross-view Object Association Module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anchor-based methods are constrained by predefined anchors, which limits their flexibility and performance in cross-view object geo-localization scenarios.

Method: AFGeo uses anchor-free formulation with directional offset prediction, Gaussian Position Encoding to model click point uncertainty, and Cross-view Object Association Module to relate objects across viewpoints despite appearance gaps.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets while being lightweight and computationally efficient with minimal parameter overhead.

Conclusion: Anchor-free formulation combined with GPE and CVOAM provides an effective and efficient solution for cross-view object geo-localization, outperforming traditional anchor-based approaches.

Abstract: Most existing cross-view object geo-localization approaches adopt
anchor-based paradigm. Although effective, such methods are inherently
constrained by predefined anchors. To eliminate this dependency, we first
propose an anchor-free formulation for cross-view object geo-localization,
termed AFGeo. AFGeo directly predicts the four directional offsets (left,
right, top, bottom) to the ground-truth box for each pixel, thereby localizing
the object without any predefined anchors. To obtain a more robust spatial
prior, AFGeo incorporates Gaussian Position Encoding (GPE) to model the click
point in the query image, mitigating the uncertainty of object position that
challenges object localization in cross-view scenarios. In addition, AFGeo
incorporates a Cross-view Object Association Module (CVOAM) that relates the
same object and its surrounding context across viewpoints, enabling reliable
localization under large cross-view appearance gaps. By adopting an anchor-free
localization paradigm that integrates GPE and CVOAM with minimal parameter
overhead, our model is both lightweight and computationally efficient,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Generalized Contrastive Learning (GCL) to improve multimodal retrieval performance without requiring new dataset curation, by enforcing contrastive learning across all modalities within mini-batches using existing image-caption pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-modal retrieval models like CLIP perform poorly when retrieving multimodal keys (e.g., Wikipedia pages with both images and text), and existing approaches require careful curation of new composed datasets that fail to generalize to unseen modality combinations.

Method: GCL is a novel loss formulation that enforces contrastive learning across all modalities within a mini-batch, learning a unified representation space using existing image-caption paired datasets without needing new dataset curation.

Result: GCL demonstrates consistent performance improvements on off-the-shelf multimodal retrieval models (VISTA, CLIP, TinyCLIP) across M-BEIR, MMEB, and CoVR benchmarks.

Conclusion: GCL effectively addresses multimodal retrieval challenges by improving performance without the burdensome need for new dataset curation, showing consistent improvements across various models and benchmarks.

Abstract: Despite their consistent performance improvements, cross-modal retrieval
models (e.g., CLIP) show degraded performances with retrieving keys composed of
fused image-text modality (e.g., Wikipedia pages with both images and text). To
address this critical challenge, multimodal retrieval has been recently
explored to develop a unified single retrieval model capable of retrieving keys
across diverse modality combinations. A common approach involves constructing
new composed sets of image-text triplets (e.g., retrieving a pair of image and
text given a query image). However, such an approach requires careful curation
to ensure the dataset quality and fails to generalize to unseen modality
combinations. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes Generalized
Contrastive Learning (GCL), a novel loss formulation that improves multimodal
retrieval performance without the burdensome need for new dataset curation.
Specifically, GCL operates by enforcing contrastive learning across all
modalities within a mini-batch, utilizing existing image-caption paired
datasets to learn a unified representation space. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of GCL by showing consistent performance improvements on
off-the-shelf multimodal retrieval models (e.g., VISTA, CLIP, and TinyCLIP)
using the M-BEIR, MMEB, and CoVR benchmarks.

TL;DR: Synthetic images from video games can effectively train CNNs for truck axle detection, achieving 99% mAP and providing a low-cost alternative to real data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CNNs require large amounts of expensive real data, so this paper explores using synthetic images from video games as a cost-effective alternative for training.

Method: Created three databases with real-life and synthetic trucks, trained three YOLO architectures, and evaluated using recall, precision, F1-score, mAP, and Mann-Whitney U test for statistical significance.

Result: Synthetic images proved reliable for training, contributing to all networks' performance with the highest mAP reaching 99%. Statistical tests confirmed significance.

Conclusion: Synthetic images from video games can successfully train neural networks, providing a reliable and low-cost data source for computer vision tasks.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) traditionally require large amounts of
data to train models with good performance. However, data collection is an
expensive process, both in time and resources. Generated synthetic images are a
good alternative, with video games producing realistic 3D models. This paper
aims to determine whether images extracted from a video game can be effectively
used to train a CNN to detect real-life truck axles. Three different databases
were created, with real-life and synthetic trucks, to provide training and
testing examples for three different You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures.
Results were evaluated based on four metrics: recall, precision, F1-score, and
mean Average Precision (mAP). To evaluate the statistical significance of the
results, the Mann-Whitney U test was also applied to the resulting mAP of all
models. Synthetic images from trucks extracted from a video game proved to be a
reliable source of training data, contributing to the performance of all
networks. The highest mAP score reached 99\%. Results indicate that synthetic
images can be used to train neural networks, providing a reliable, low-cost
data source for extracting knowledge.

TL;DR: Proposes Geo-DLC, a novel object-level fine-grained image captioning task for remote sensing, with a new dataset DE-Dataset, evaluation benchmark DE-Benchmark, and DescribeEarth MLLM model that outperforms SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing remote sensing image captioning focuses on image level, lacking object-level fine-grained interpretation, preventing full utilization of rich semantic and structural information in remote sensing images.

Method: Introduces DescribeEarth, a Multi-modal Large Language Model architecture with scale-adaptive focal strategy and domain-guided fusion module leveraging remote sensing vision-language model features to encode high-resolution details and category priors while maintaining global context.

Result: DescribeEarth consistently outperforms state-of-the-art general MLLMs on DE-Benchmark, demonstrating superior factual accuracy, descriptive richness, and grammatical soundness, particularly in capturing intrinsic object features and environmental attributes across various remote sensing scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed Geo-DLC task, DE-Dataset, DE-Benchmark, and DescribeEarth model effectively address the limitation of existing methods by enabling object-level fine-grained interpretation of remote sensing images.

Abstract: Automated textual description of remote sensing images is crucial for
unlocking their full potential in diverse applications, from environmental
monitoring to urban planning and disaster management. However, existing studies
in remote sensing image captioning primarily focus on the image level, lacking
object-level fine-grained interpretation, which prevents the full utilization
and transformation of the rich semantic and structural information contained in
remote sensing images. To address this limitation, we propose Geo-DLC, a novel
task of object-level fine-grained image captioning for remote sensing. To
support this task, we construct DE-Dataset, a large-scale dataset contains 25
categories and 261,806 annotated instances with detailed descriptions of object
attributes, relationships, and contexts. Furthermore, we introduce
DE-Benchmark, a LLM-assisted question-answering based evaluation suite designed
to systematically measure model capabilities on the Geo-DLC task. We also
present DescribeEarth, a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture
explicitly designed for Geo-DLC, which integrates a scale-adaptive focal
strategy and a domain-guided fusion module leveraging remote sensing
vision-language model features to encode high-resolution details and remote
sensing category priors while maintaining global context. Our DescribeEarth
model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art general MLLMs on DE-Benchmark,
demonstrating superior factual accuracy, descriptive richness, and grammatical
soundness, particularly in capturing intrinsic object features and surrounding
environmental attributes across simple, complex, and even out-of-distribution
remote sensing scenarios. All data, code and weights are released at

used as the dataset for training the YOLO model to detect the defects on the
surfaces and in the holes of metal sheets. However, the lack of metal sheet
images significantly degrades the performance of detection accuracy. To address
this issue, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a considerable amount of data.
Four versions of the YOLO model (i.e., YOLOv3, v4, v7, and v9) are combined
with the ConSinGAN for data augmentation. The proposed YOLOv9 model with
ConSinGAN outperforms the other YOLO models with an accuracy of 91.3%, and a
detection time of 146 ms. The proposed YOLOv9 model is integrated into
manufacturing hardware and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
system to establish a practical automated optical inspection (AOI) system.
Additionally, the proposed automated defect detection is easily applied to
other components in industrial manufacturing.

### [27] [OmniDFA: A Unified Framework for Open Set Synthesis Image Detection and Few-Shot Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25682)
*Shiyu Wu,Shuyan Li,Jing Li,Jing Liu,Yequan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes OmniDFA framework for AI-generated image detection and source attribution using few-shot learning, with OmniFake dataset of 1.17M images from 45 generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in AI-generated image detection and source attribution due to model diversity, overfitting issues, and lack of large-scale synthetic datasets.

Method: Introduces open-set, few-shot source identification paradigm and OmniDFA framework that combines detection and attribution using limited samples.

Result: OmniDFA achieves excellent open-set attribution capability and state-of-the-art generalization performance on AIGI detection.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and dataset advance practical AI-generated image forensics by enabling reliable detection and attribution with limited data.

Abstract: AI-generated image (AIGI) detection and source model attribution remain
central challenges in combating deepfake abuses, primarily due to the
structural diversity of generative models. Current detection methods are prone
to overfitting specific forgery traits, whereas source attribution offers a
robust alternative through fine-grained feature discrimination. However,
synthetic image attribution remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale,
well-categorized synthetic datasets, limiting its practicality and
compatibility with detection systems. In this work, we propose a new paradigm
for image attribution called open-set, few-shot source identification. This
paradigm is designed to reliably identify unseen generators using only limited
samples, making it highly suitable for real-world application. To this end, we
introduce OmniDFA (Omni Detector and Few-shot Attributor), a novel framework
for AIGI that not only assesses the authenticity of images, but also determines
the synthesis origins in a few-shot manner. To facilitate this work, we
construct OmniFake, a large class-aware synthetic image dataset that curates
$1.17$ M images from $45$ distinct generative models, substantially enriching
the foundational resources for research on both AIGI detection and attribution.
Experiments demonstrate that OmniDFA exhibits excellent capability in open-set
attribution and achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on AIGI
detection. Our dataset and code will be made available.

*Xiping Li,Jianghong Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AIMCoT is an active information-driven multimodal Chain-of-Thought framework that improves vision-language reasoning by addressing limitations in existing methods through reliable attention maps, proactive visual selection, and dynamic triggering mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal CoT methods rely on unreliable attention maps and passive selection strategies that fail to capture the model's cognitive needs for information during reasoning.

Method: AIMCoT introduces three components: Context-enhanced Attention-map Generation (CAG) for reliable attention maps, Active Visual Probing (AVP) for goal-oriented visual selection using information theory, and Dynamic Attention-shifting Trigger (DAT) for optimal timing of visual information insertion.

Result: Extensive experiments on three challenging benchmarks show that AIMCoT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across different settings.

Conclusion: AIMCoT represents a critical step towards more robust, effective, and human-like multimodal reasoning by actively foraging for information and dynamically structuring the reasoning process.

Abstract: Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has emerged as a powerful technique for
enhancing the vision-language reasoning with interleaved information. However,
existing methods often rely on simplistic heuristics for constructing
interleaved CoT, typically depending on attention maps, which our empirical
analysis reveals can be unreliable. What's more, the shortcomings of their
passive and purposeless selection strategies and their arbitrary triggering
mechanisms in capturing the model's cognitive need for information are further
amplified. In this paper, we propose \textbf{AIMCoT}, an \textbf{A}ctive
\textbf{I}nformation-driven \textbf{M}ulti-modal
\textbf{C}hain-\textbf{o}f-\textbf{T}hought framework that addresses these
fundamental limitations. AIMCoT introduces three synergistic components: (1)
\textbf{Context-enhanced Attention-map Generation (CAG)}, which mitigates the
text-vision granularity imbalance, thereby producing more reliable attention
maps as a foundation. (2) \textbf{Active Visual Probing (AVP)}, which replaces
passive selection with a proactive, goal-oriented strategy grounded in
information theory to select image regions that help answer the questions
maximally. (3) \textbf{Dynamic Attention-shifting Trigger (DAT)}, which
intelligently determines the optimal moments to insert visual information by
monitoring the model's text-to-vision attention shifts. Extensive experiments
on three challenging benchmarks demonstrate that AIMCoT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across different settings. By actively
foraging for information and dynamically structuring its reasoning process,
AIMCoT represents a critical step towards more robust, effective, and
human-like multimodal reasoning. Our code is available at

### [29] [How Diffusion Models Memorize](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25705)
*Juyeop Kim,Songkuk Kim,Jong-Seok Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion models memorize training data due to early denoising overestimation, where classifier-free guidance amplifies predictions and forces latent trajectories to converge toward memorized samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why and how diffusion models memorize training data, addressing privacy and copyright concerns that arise from this memorization behavior.

Method: Analyzed diffusion and denoising processes, latent space dynamics, and the effects of classifier-free guidance on training loss and memorization patterns.

Result: Memorization is driven by overestimation of training samples during early denoising, which collapses denoising trajectories and accelerates convergence toward memorized images. Deviations from theoretical denoising schedules correlate with memorization severity.

Conclusion: Early overestimation is identified as the central mechanism driving memorization in diffusion models, explaining how memorized prompts inject training images into noise predictions and steer denoising toward paired samples.

Abstract: Despite their success in image generation, diffusion models can memorize
training data, raising serious privacy and copyright concerns. Although prior
work has sought to characterize, detect, and mitigate memorization, the
fundamental question of why and how it occurs remains unresolved. In this
paper, we revisit the diffusion and denoising process and analyze latent space
dynamics to address the question: "How do diffusion models memorize?" We show
that memorization is driven by the overestimation of training samples during
early denoising, which reduces diversity, collapses denoising trajectories, and
accelerates convergence toward the memorized image. Specifically: (i)
memorization cannot be explained by overfitting alone, as training loss is
larger under memorization due to classifier-free guidance amplifying
predictions and inducing overestimation; (ii) memorized prompts inject training
images into noise predictions, forcing latent trajectories to converge and
steering denoising toward their paired samples; and (iii) a decomposition of
intermediate latents reveals how initial randomness is quickly suppressed and
replaced by memorized content, with deviations from the theoretical denoising
schedule correlating almost perfectly with memorization severity. Together,
these results identify early overestimation as the central underlying mechanism
of memorization in diffusion models.

*Yuan Gao,Sangwook Kim,Jianzhong You,Chris McIntosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProbMED introduces probabilistic contrastive learning for medical vision-language pretraining, modeling embedding distributions instead of deterministic estimates to handle many-to-many modality mappings across chest X-rays, ECGs, echocardiograms, and clinical text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical vision-language pretraining models fail to account for many-to-many modality mappings in medical decision-making, where diverse information like imaging and clinical narratives need integration.

Method: Uses probabilistic contrastive learning with InfoNCE loss and Hellinger distance for inter-modality alignment, plus probabilistic synthetic sampling loss for intra-modality binding based on modality-specific mean and variance.

Result: Outperforms current Med-VLPMs across 13 medical datasets in cross-modality retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification, with improved intra- and inter-medical modality binding.

Conclusion: Probabilistic modeling of embeddings effectively handles many-to-many modality mappings in medical AI, enabling robust integration of multiple modalities for improved prognostication.

Abstract: Medical decision-making requires integrating diverse medical information,
from imaging to clinical narratives. These medical modalities are often
acquired in a many-to-many manner. However, current medical vision-language
pretraining models (Med-VLPMs) fail to directly account for this many-to-many
mapping in their model training and embeddings. To address this, we present
Probabilistic Modality-Enhanced Diagnosis (ProbMED), a multimodal Med-VLPM that
employs probabilistic contrastive learning to model distributions over
embeddings rather than deterministic estimates. ProbMED aligns four distinct
modalities -- chest X-rays, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and clinical
text -- into a unified probabilistic embedding space. We use InfoNCE loss with
Hellinger distance to integrate inter-modality distributions. We introduce a
probabilistic synthetic sampling loss that captures modality-specific mean and
variance to improve intra-modality binding. Extensive experiments across 13
medical datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms current Med-VLPMs in
cross-modality retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification. We also
demonstrate the robust integration of multiple modalities for prognostication,
showing improved intra- and inter-medical modality binding.

*Xintong Li,Chuhan Wang,Junda Wu,Rohan Surana,Tong Yu,Julian McAuley,Jingbo Shang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MISP-DPO enhances multimodal DPO by using multiple semantically diverse negative images instead of single oversimplified negatives, improving multimodal alignment through semantic-aware sampling and Plackett-Luce modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal DPO methods rely on oversimplified pairwise comparisons with single negative images from basic perturbations or similarity retrieval, which fail to capture complex multimodal preferences and cause optimization bias and hallucinations.

Method: Proposes MISP-DPO framework that embeds prompts and images in CLIP space, uses sparse autoencoder to uncover semantic deviations, selects negative samples based on reconstruction difficulty, semantic deviation from positive, and mutual diversity, and employs Plackett-Luce objective with importance sampling.

Result: Experiments across five diverse benchmarks show MISP-DPO consistently improves multimodal alignment over prior methods, validating the effectiveness of semantic-aware, multi-negative sampling.

Conclusion: Semantic-aware multi-negative sampling in preference-based learning significantly enhances multimodal DPO performance by providing broader and more informative supervision.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been extended from
text-only models to vision-language models. However, existing methods rely on
oversimplified pairwise comparisons, generating a single negative image via
basic perturbations or similarity-based retrieval, which fail to capture the
complex nature of multimodal preferences, inducing optimization bias and
hallucinations. To address this issue, we propose MISP-DPO, the first framework
to incorporate multiple, semantically diverse negative images in multimodal DPO
via the Plackett-Luce model. Our method embeds prompts and candidate images in
CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) space and applies a sparse
autoencoder to uncover semantic deviations into interpretable factors. Negative
samples are selected based on reconstruction difficulty, semantic deviation
from the positive, and mutual diversity, yielding broader and more informative
supervision. To handle multi-negative comparisons, we adopt a Plackett-Luce
objective and introduce an importance sampling strategy that improves training
efficiency. Experiments across five diverse benchmarks demonstrate that
MISP-DPO consistently improves multimodal alignment over prior methods,
validating the effectiveness of semantic-aware, multi-negative sampling in
preference-based learning.

TL;DR: SAGE is a unified training pipeline for Visual Place Recognition that enhances spatial-visual discrimination through adaptive graph exploration, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior VPR methods focus on descriptor fine-tuning or fixed sampling strategies but neglect the dynamic interplay between spatial context and visual similarity during training, limiting their ability to handle large appearance, viewpoint, and environmental variations.

Method: SAGE introduces three key components: 1) Soft Probing module that learns residual weights for patch descriptors before bilinear aggregation, 2) Online geo-visual graph reconstruction that fuses geographic proximity and current visual similarity, 3) Greedy weighted clique expansion sampler that concentrates learning on informative place neighborhoods. Implemented with frozen DINOv2 backbone and parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves SOTA across eight benchmarks: 98.9% Recall@1 on SPED, 95.8% on Pitts30k-test, 94.5% on MSLS-val, and 96.0% on Nordland. Notably obtains 100% Recall@10 on SPED using only 4096D global descriptors.

Conclusion: SAGE demonstrates that jointly improving local feature aggregation, organizing samples during training, and hard sample mining through adaptive graph exploration significantly enhances VPR performance, achieving superior results with efficient parameter usage.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) requires robust retrieval of geotagged images
despite large appearance, viewpoint, and environmental variation. Prior methods
focus on descriptor fine-tuning or fixed sampling strategies yet neglect the
dynamic interplay between spatial context and visual similarity during
training. We present SAGE (Spatial-visual Adaptive Graph Exploration), a
unified training pipeline that enhances granular spatial-visual discrimination
by jointly improving local feature aggregation, organize samples during
training, and hard sample mining. We introduce a lightweight Soft Probing
module that learns residual weights from training data for patch descriptors
before bilinear aggregation, boosting distinctive local cues. During training
we reconstruct an online geo-visual graph that fuses geographic proximity and
current visual similarity so that candidate neighborhoods reflect the evolving
embedding landscape. To concentrate learning on the most informative place
neighborhoods, we seed clusters from high-affinity anchors and iteratively
expand them with a greedy weighted clique expansion sampler. Implemented with a
frozen DINOv2 backbone and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, SAGE achieves SOTA
across eight benchmarks. It attains 98.9%, 95.8%, 94.5%, and 96.0% Recall@1 on
SPED, Pitts30k-test, MSLS-val, and Nordland, respectively. Notably, our method
obtains 100% Recall@10 on SPED only using 4096D global descriptors. Code and

### [33] [LaTo: Landmark-tokenized Diffusion Transformer for Fine-grained Human Face Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25731)
*Zhenghao Zhang,Ziying Zhang,Junchao Liao,Xiangyu Meng,Qiang Hu,Siyu Zhu,Xiaoyun Zhang,Long Qin,Weizhi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaTo is a landmark-tokenized diffusion transformer that enables fine-grained, identity-preserving face editing by quantizing landmarks into discrete tokens and using location-mapping positional encoding, achieving superior identity preservation and semantic consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal face editing models struggle with precise attribute control and identity preservation, especially when conditional landmarks deviate significantly from source images due to large expression/pose changes or inaccurate landmark estimates.

Method: Proposes LaTo with three key innovations: (1) landmark tokenizer that quantizes raw coordinates into discrete facial tokens, (2) location-mapping positional encoding that integrates facial and image tokens for unified processing, and (3) landmark predictor using vision-language models with structured chain-of-thought for accurate target landmark inference.

Result: LaTo outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.8% in identity preservation and 4.6% in semantic consistency. Created HFL-150K, the largest benchmark with over 150K real face pairs and fine-grained instructions.

Conclusion: LaTo provides a robust solution for fine-grained face editing with strong identity preservation through landmark tokenization and unified geometry-appearance processing, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Recent multimodal models for instruction-based face editing enable semantic
manipulation but still struggle with precise attribute control and identity
preservation. Structural facial representations such as landmarks are effective
for intermediate supervision, yet most existing methods treat them as rigid
geometric constraints, which can degrade identity when conditional landmarks
deviate significantly from the source (e.g., large expression or pose changes,
inaccurate landmark estimates). To address these limitations, we propose LaTo,
a landmark-tokenized diffusion transformer for fine-grained,
identity-preserving face editing. Our key innovations include: (1) a landmark
tokenizer that directly quantizes raw landmark coordinates into discrete facial
tokens, obviating the need for dense pixel-wise correspondence; (2) a
location-mapping positional encoding that integrates facial and image tokens
for unified processing, enabling flexible yet decoupled geometry-appearance
interactions with high efficiency and strong identity preservation; and (3) a
landmark predictor that leverages vision-language models to infer target
landmarks from instructions and source images, whose structured
chain-of-thought improves estimation accuracy and interactive control. To
mitigate data scarcity, we curate HFL-150K, to our knowledge the largest
benchmark for this task, containing over 150K real face pairs with fine-grained
instructions. Extensive experiments show that LaTo outperforms state-of-the-art
methods by 7.8% in identity preservation and 4.6% in semantic consistency. Code
and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video Object Segmentation remains challenging in complex real-world scenarios with long-term object disappearances/reappearances and small/inconspicuous objects, as addressed by the MOSEv1 and LVOS datasets.

Method: Freeze SAM2 feature extractor during training while fine-tuning other components; use pixel-check strategy during inference to progressively refine predictions by fusing multiple models' complementary strengths.

Result: Achieved J&F score of 86.37% on test set, ranking 1st in MOSEv1 Challenge at LSVOS 2025.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses VOS challenges in complex scenarios through confidence-guided fusion and progressive refinement strategies.

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) aims to track and segment specific objects
across entire video sequences, yet it remains highly challenging under complex
real-world scenarios. The MOSEv1 and LVOS dataset, adopted in the MOSEv1
challenge on LSVOS 2025, which is specifically designed to enhance the
robustness of VOS models in complex real-world scenarios, including long-term
object disappearances and reappearances, as well as the presence of small and
inconspicuous objects. In this paper, we present our improved method,
Confidence-Guided Fusion Segmentation (CGFSeg), for the VOS task in the MOSEv1
Challenge. During training, the feature extractor of SAM2 is frozen, while the
remaining components are fine-tuned to preserve strong feature extraction
ability and improve segmentation accuracy. In the inference stage, we introduce
a pixel-check strategy that progressively refines predictions by exploiting
complementary strengths of multiple models, thereby yielding robust final
masks. As a result, our method achieves a J&F score of 86.37% on the test set,
ranking 1st in the MOSEv1 Challenge at LSVOS 2025. These results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges of VOS task in
complex scenarios.

*Donghwan Kim,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel SO(3) diffusion model for Human Mesh Recovery that generates pose distributions instead of single outputs, addressing ambiguity in 3D pose estimation from 2D images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HMR methods either produce single deterministic outputs or probabilistic methods that trade off accuracy for diversity. The inherent ambiguity in recovering 3D pose from 2D observations requires modeling pose distributions rather than single predictions.

Method: Uses SO(3) diffusion model to generate pose parameter distributions represented as 3D rotations, with conditioning dropout for image-conditional generation. Employs transformer for hierarchical joint structure learning and small MLP-based denoising model for per-joint distribution learning.

Result: The model effectively predicts accurate pose probability distributions, addressing the accuracy-diversity trade-off in existing probabilistic methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully models well-aligned pose distributions to 2D observations, providing a better solution for handling ambiguity in 3D human pose recovery from single images.

Abstract: We tackle the problem of Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from a single RGB image,
formulating it as an image-conditioned human pose and shape generation. While
recovering 3D human pose from 2D observations is inherently ambiguous, most
existing approaches have regressed a single deterministic output. Probabilistic
methods attempt to address this by generating multiple plausible outputs to
model the ambiguity. However, these methods often exhibit a trade-off between
accuracy and sample diversity, and their single predictions are not competitive
with state-of-the-art deterministic models. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a novel approach that models well-aligned distribution to 2D
observations. In particular, we introduce $SO(3)$ diffusion model, which
generates the distribution of pose parameters represented as 3D rotations
unconditional and conditional to image observations via conditioning dropout.
Our model learns the hierarchical structure of human body joints using the
transformer. Instead of using transformer as a denoising model, the
time-independent transformer extracts latent vectors for the joints and a small
MLP-based denoising model learns the per-joint distribution conditioned on the
latent vector. We experimentally demonstrate and analyze that our model
predicts accurate pose probability distribution effectively.

TL;DR: GeoDrag is a geometry-guided drag-based image editing method that incorporates 3D geometric cues into pixel-level editing to enable precise and consistent manipulations, especially for geometry-intensive operations like rotations and perspective transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current drag-based image editing methods primarily operate on 2D pixel planes with limited 3D cues, leading to imprecise and inconsistent edits in geometry-intensive scenarios such as rotations and perspective transformations.

Method: Built upon a unified displacement field that jointly encodes 3D geometry and 2D spatial priors, with a conflict-free partitioning strategy to isolate editing regions and prevent interference.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior precision, structural consistency, and reliable multi-point editability across various editing scenarios.

Conclusion: GeoDrag enables coherent, high-fidelity, and structure-consistent editing in a single forward pass by effectively incorporating 3D geometric guidance into interactive point-based image editing.

Abstract: Interactive point-based image editing serves as a controllable editor,
enabling precise and flexible manipulation of image content. However, most
drag-based methods operate primarily on the 2D pixel plane with limited use of
3D cues. As a result, they often produce imprecise and inconsistent edits,
particularly in geometry-intensive scenarios such as rotations and perspective
transformations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
geometry-guided drag-based image editing method - GeoDrag, which addresses
three key challenges: 1) incorporating 3D geometric cues into pixel-level
editing, 2) mitigating discontinuities caused by geometry-only guidance, and 3)
resolving conflicts arising from multi-point dragging. Built upon a unified
displacement field that jointly encodes 3D geometry and 2D spatial priors,
GeoDrag enables coherent, high-fidelity, and structure-consistent editing in a
single forward pass. In addition, a conflict-free partitioning strategy is
introduced to isolate editing regions, effectively preventing interference and
ensuring consistency. Extensive experiments across various editing scenarios
validate the effectiveness of our method, showing superior precision,
structural consistency, and reliable multi-point editability. The code will be

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IPDRecon is an image-plane decoding framework for indoor scene reconstruction that reduces dependency on multi-view geometric constraints by exploiting spatial information within individual views, achieving superior stability with minimal performance drop when view count reduces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing volume-based indoor scene reconstruction methods rely heavily on multi-view pixel back-projection ray intersections, causing reconstruction quality to depend on input view density with poor performance in overlapping regions and unobserved areas.

Method: Proposes IPDRecon framework with three core components: Pixel-level Confidence Encoder (PCE), Affine Compensation Module (ACM), and Image-Plane Spatial Decoder (IPSD), which collaboratively decode 3D structural information from 2D images through physical imaging processes.

Result: On ScanNetV2, IPDRecon achieves superior reconstruction stability with nearly identical quality when view count reduces by 40%, achieving coefficient of variation of 0.24%, performance retention rate of 99.7%, and maximum performance drop of 0.42%.

Conclusion: Exploiting intra-view spatial information provides a robust solution for view-limited scenarios in practical applications, effectively preserving spatial geometric features while significantly enhancing view-invariant reconstruction.

Abstract: Volume-based indoor scene reconstruction methods demonstrate significant
research value due to their superior generalization capability and real-time
deployment potential. However, existing methods rely on multi-view pixel
back-projection ray intersections as weak geometric constraints to determine
spatial positions, causing reconstruction quality to depend heavily on input
view density with poor performance in overlapping regions and unobserved areas.
To address these issues, the key lies in reducing dependency on inter-view
geometric constraints while exploiting rich spatial information within
individual views. We propose IPDRecon, an image-plane decoding framework
comprising three core components: Pixel-level Confidence Encoder (PCE), Affine
Compensation Module (ACM), and Image-Plane Spatial Decoder (IPSD). These
modules collaboratively decode 3D structural information encoded in 2D images
through physical imaging processes, effectively preserving spatial geometric
features including edges, hollow structures, and complex textures while
significantly enhancing view-invariant reconstruction. Experiments on ScanNetV2
confirm that IPDRecon achieves superior reconstruction stability, maintaining
nearly identical quality when view count reduces by 40%. The method achieves a
coefficient of variation of only 0.24%, performance retention rate of 99.7%,
and maximum performance drop of merely 0.42%. This demonstrates that exploiting
intra-view spatial information provides a robust solution for view-limited
scenarios in practical applications.

Method: Testing joint reasoning over transcripts, audio, and video using 624 annotated YouTube short-form videos across all seven modality combinations (T, A, V, TA, TV, AV, TAV) for five topics: main recommendation, sentiment analysis, video purpose, visual analysis, and financial entity recognition.

Result: Video alone performs strongly on four of five topics, capturing visual context and effective cues like emotions, gestures, and body language. Selective pairs such as TV or AV often surpass TAV, suggesting too many modalities may introduce noise.

Conclusion: This establishes the first baselines for financial short-form video captioning and illustrates both the potential and challenges of grounding complex visual cues in this domain.

Motivation: Ultrasound faces challenges like operator dependence, image noise, and real-time scanning that hinder AI integration, while existing large multimodal models struggle with ultrasound's complexities.

Method: Curated a 2-million-scale multimodal dataset combining textbook knowledge, public data, synthetic samples, and general corpora. Employed three-stage training: domain-specialized pretraining, instruction-driven alignment, and reinforcement-based refinement. Dolphin R1 uses reinforcement learning with ultrasound-specific rewards for enhanced reasoning.

Result: Dolphin R1 achieves a U2-score of 0.5835 on U2-Bench across eight ultrasound tasks - over twice the second-best model (0.2968), setting a new state of the art. Dolphin v1.0 also performs competitively.

Conclusion: The unified framework successfully addresses ultrasound AI challenges, and reasoning-enhanced training significantly improves diagnostic accuracy, consistency, and interpretability, highlighting its importance for high-stakes medical AI.

### [40] [ART-VITON: Measurement-Guided Latent Diffusion for Artifact-Free Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25749)
*Junseo Park,Hyeryung Jang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ART-VITON is a virtual try-on method that uses measurement-guided diffusion to preserve non-try-on regions while generating realistic garment images, eliminating boundary artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing virtual try-on methods using latent diffusion models struggle with preserving non-try-on regions (identity and background) and often produce boundary artifacts when directly replacing these regions.

Method: Reformulates VITON as a linear inverse problem and uses trajectory-aligned solvers with residual prior-based initialization and artifact-free measurement-guided sampling that combines data consistency, frequency-level correction, and periodic standard denoising.

Result: Experiments on VITON-HD, DressCode, and SHHQ-1.0 show effective preservation of identity and background, elimination of boundary artifacts, and improved visual fidelity and robustness over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: ART-VITON successfully addresses the challenge of preserving non-try-on regions in virtual try-on while maintaining high-quality garment synthesis through measurement-guided diffusion framework.

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VITON) aims to generate realistic images of a person wearing
a target garment, requiring precise garment alignment in try-on regions and
faithful preservation of identity and background in non-try-on regions. While
latent diffusion models (LDMs) have advanced alignment and detail synthesis,
preserving non-try-on regions remains challenging. A common post-hoc strategy
directly replaces these regions with original content, but abrupt transitions
often produce boundary artifacts. To overcome this, we reformulate VITON as a
linear inverse problem and adopt trajectory-aligned solvers that progressively
enforce measurement consistency, reducing abrupt changes in non-try-on regions.
However, existing solvers still suffer from semantic drift during generation,
leading to artifacts. We propose ART-VITON, a measurement-guided diffusion
framework that ensures measurement adherence while maintaining artifact-free
synthesis. Our method integrates residual prior-based initialization to
mitigate training-inference mismatch and artifact-free measurement-guided
sampling that combines data consistency, frequency-level correction, and
periodic standard denoising. Experiments on VITON-HD, DressCode, and SHHQ-1.0
demonstrate that ART-VITON effectively preserves identity and background,
eliminates boundary artifacts, and consistently improves visual fidelity and
robustness over state-of-the-art baselines.

*Jia Jun Cheng Xian,Muchen Li,Haotian Yang,Xin Tao,Pengfei Wan,Leonid Sigal,Renjie Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Text Preference Optimization (TPO) is a framework that aligns text-to-image models with human preferences without needing paired image preference data, using mismatched prompts generated by LLMs instead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLHF methods for text-to-image alignment rely on costly human annotations and paired image preference data, limiting scalability.

Method: TPO trains models to prefer matched prompts over mismatched prompts constructed by perturbing original captions using large language models, extending DPO and KTO algorithms.

Result: TPO methods consistently outperform original counterparts across multiple benchmarks, achieving better human preference scores and improved text-to-image alignment.

Conclusion: TPO enables "free-lunch" alignment of T2I models without costly human annotations, providing a scalable solution for text-to-image alignment.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have led to
remarkable success in generating high-quality images from textual prompts.
However, ensuring accurate alignment between the text and the generated image
remains a significant challenge for state-of-the-art diffusion models. To
address this, existing studies employ reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) to align T2I outputs with human preferences. These methods,
however, either rely directly on paired image preference data or require a
learned reward function, both of which depend heavily on costly, high-quality
human annotations and thus face scalability limitations. In this work, we
introduce Text Preference Optimization (TPO), a framework that enables
"free-lunch" alignment of T2I models, achieving alignment without the need for
paired image preference data. TPO works by training the model to prefer matched
prompts over mismatched prompts, which are constructed by perturbing original
captions using a large language model. Our framework is general and compatible
with existing preference-based algorithms. We extend both DPO and KTO to our
setting, resulting in TDPO and TKTO. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
across multiple benchmarks show that our methods consistently outperform their
original counterparts, delivering better human preference scores and improved
text-to-image alignment. Our Open-source code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: v-HUB is a visual-centric video humor understanding benchmark that evaluates multimodal large language models' ability to comprehend humor from visual cues alone, using minimally verbal short videos from silent films and online resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and diagnose the capacity of multimodal large language models for humor understanding, which has practical applications like enhancing engagement in human-machine interactions.

Method: Created v-HUB benchmark with curated short videos requiring minimal verbal content, paired with rich annotations (captions, descriptions, explanations). Evaluated diverse MLLMs including specialized Video-LLMs and versatile OmniLLMs that can process audio, covering both open-source and proprietary models.

Result: MLLMs struggle to comprehend humor from visual cues alone, with all models showing significant performance drop on caption matching when moving from text-based to video-based evaluation without audio. Incorporating audio helps with video humor understanding.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs face difficulties in understanding humor from purely visual information, but incorporating audio shows promise for improving performance on complex video understanding tasks involving humor comprehension.

Abstract: AI models capable of comprehending humor hold real-world promise -- for
example, enhancing engagement in human-machine interactions. To gauge and
diagnose the capacity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for humor
understanding, we introduce v-HUB, a novel visual-centric video humor
understanding benchmark. v-HUB comprises a curated collection of minimally
verbal short videos, sourced from classic silent films and online resources,
and reflecting real-world scenarios where humor can be appreciated purely
through visual cues. Each video clip is paired with rich annotations, including
captions, descriptions, and explanations, supporting evaluation tasks like
caption matching and humor explanation. To broaden its applicability, we
further construct an open-ended video QA task, making it readily integrable
into existing video understanding benchmarks. We evaluate a diverse set of
MLLMs, from specialized Video-LLMs to versatile OmniLLMs that can process
audio, covering both open-source and proprietary domains. The experimental
results expose the difficulties MLLMs face in comprehending humor from visual
cues alone. For example, all models exhibit a marked performance drop on
caption matching when moving from text-based to video-based evaluation (without
audio). Our findings also demonstrate that incorporating audio helps with video
humor understanding, highlighting the informativeness of sound and the promise
of integrating richer modalities for complex video understanding tasks.

### [43] [PCPO: Proportionate Credit Policy Optimization for Aligning Image Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25774)
*Jeongjae Lee,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCPO is a new reinforcement learning framework that addresses training instability in text-to-image models by enforcing proportional credit assignment, leading to faster convergence and better image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current policy gradient methods for text-to-image model alignment suffer from training instability and high variance due to disproportionate credit assignment in the generative sampler, which hinders convergence and compromises image quality.

Method: Proportionate Credit Policy Optimization (PCPO) framework that enforces proportional credit assignment through stable objective reformulation and principled reweighting of timesteps to correct volatile feedback.

Result: PCPO stabilizes training, accelerates convergence significantly, improves image quality by mitigating model collapse, and substantially outperforms existing policy gradient baselines including state-of-the-art DanceGRPO.

Conclusion: The PCPO framework successfully addresses the core issue of disproportionate credit assignment in T2I model alignment, providing more stable training and superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the alignment of text-to-image
(T2I) models, state-of-the-art policy gradient methods are still hampered by
training instability and high variance, hindering convergence speed and
compromising image quality. Our analysis identifies a key cause of this
instability: disproportionate credit assignment, in which the mathematical
structure of the generative sampler produces volatile and non-proportional
feedback across timesteps. To address this, we introduce Proportionate Credit
Policy Optimization (PCPO), a framework that enforces proportional credit
assignment through a stable objective reformulation and a principled
reweighting of timesteps. This correction stabilizes the training process,
leading to significantly accelerated convergence and superior image quality.
The improvement in quality is a direct result of mitigating model collapse, a
common failure mode in recursive training. PCPO substantially outperforms
existing policy gradient baselines on all fronts, including the
state-of-the-art DanceGRPO.

*Mingyu Kang,Yong Suk Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ENM Inversion is a novel noise map inversion technique for text-guided image editing that improves both content preservation and editability compared to previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous inversion methods for text-guided image editing struggle to adhere closely to target text prompts because inverted noise maps, while enabling faithful reconstruction of source images, restrict editing flexibility.

Method: The proposed ENM Inversion searches for optimal noise maps that ensure both content preservation and editability. It analyzes noise map properties for enhanced editability and introduces an editable noise refinement that aligns with desired edits by minimizing the difference between reconstructed and edited noise maps.

Result: Extensive experiments show ENM Inversion outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of image editing tasks in both preservation and edit fidelity with target prompts. The method can also be applied to video editing, enabling temporal consistency and content manipulation across frames.

Conclusion: ENM Inversion successfully addresses the limitations of previous inversion methods by providing optimal noise maps that balance content preservation with editability, making it effective for both image and video editing tasks.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating
high-quality and diverse images. Building on these advancements, diffusion
models have also demonstrated exceptional performance in text-guided image
editing. A key strategy for effective image editing involves inverting the
source image into editable noise maps associated with the target image.
However, previous inversion methods face challenges in adhering closely to the
target text prompt. The limitation arises because inverted noise maps, while
enabling faithful reconstruction of the source image, restrict the flexibility
needed for desired edits. To overcome this issue, we propose Editable Noise Map
Inversion (ENM Inversion), a novel inversion technique that searches for
optimal noise maps to ensure both content preservation and editability. We
analyze the properties of noise maps for enhanced editability. Based on this
analysis, our method introduces an editable noise refinement that aligns with
the desired edits by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed and
edited noise maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ENM Inversion
outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of image editing tasks in
both preservation and edit fidelity with target prompts. Our approach can also
be easily applied to video editing, enabling temporal consistency and content
manipulation across frames.

*Wen Wen,Tianwu Zhi,Kanglong Fan,Yang Li,Xinge Peng,Yabin Zhang,Yiting Liao,Junlin Li,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvoQuality is a self-supervised framework that enables vision-language models to autonomously improve their image quality assessment capabilities without ground-truth labels by using self-consistency principles and iterative refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for improving vision-language models rely on costly human-annotated data through supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. Self-supervised techniques have been effective for reasoning tasks but remain unexplored for perceptual domains like image quality assessment.

Method: EvoQuality adapts self-consistency to IQA's ranking-based nature by generating pseudo-labels through pairwise majority voting on the VLM's own outputs. These pseudo-rankings create a fidelity reward that guides iterative evolution using group relative policy optimization (GRPO).

Result: EvoQuality boosts the base VLM's zero-shot performance by 31.8% on PLCC across diverse IQA benchmarks. Despite being entirely self-supervised, it achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art supervised VLM-based IQA models, outperforming them on 5 out of 7 benchmarks.

Conclusion: EvoQuality demonstrates that vision-language models can autonomously refine their perceptual capabilities through self-supervised learning, achieving performance comparable to supervised methods without requiring costly human annotations.

Abstract: Improving vision-language models (VLMs) in the post-training stage typically
relies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, methods that
necessitate costly, human-annotated data. While self-supervised techniques such
as self-consistency have proven effective for enhancing reasoning capabilities,
their application to perceptual domains such as image quality assessment (IQA)
remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce EvoQuality, a novel
framework that enables a VLM to autonomously refine its quality perception
capabilities without any ground-truth labels. EvoQuality adapts the principle
of self-consistency to the ranking-based nature of IQA. It generates
pseudo-labels by performing pairwise majority voting on the VLM's own outputs
to establish a consensus on relative quality. These pseudo-rankings are then
formulated into a fidelity reward that guides the model's iterative evolution
through group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By iteratively leveraging
its own predictions, EvoQuality progressively refines the VLM's perceptual
capability. Extensive experiments show that EvoQuality boosts the base VLM's
zero-shot performance by 31.8\% on PLCC across diverse IQA benchmarks.
Remarkably, despite being entirely self-supervised, EvoQuality achieves
performance that is competitive with, or even surpasses, state-of-the-art
supervised VLM-based IQA models, outperforming these models on 5 out of 7 IQA
benchmarks.

TL;DR: EchoingECG is a probabilistic student-teacher model that uses ECG data to predict cardiac function measurements traditionally derived from echocardiograms, outperforming state-of-the-art ECG foundation models in various settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECGs are low-cost and accessible, while echocardiograms require significant hospital resources but are crucial for cardiac assessment. The goal is to enable ECGs to predict broader cardiac function measurements typically obtained from ECHOs.

Method: A probabilistic student-teacher model that integrates Probabilistic Cross-Modal Embeddings (PCME++) with ECHO-CLIP (a vision-language pre-trained model trained on ECHO-text pairs) to distill ECHO knowledge into ECG representations.

Result: EchoingECG outperforms state-of-the-art foundation ECG models in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tune settings for ECHO predictions based on ECG. Variance estimation enhanced understanding of model performance by identifying regions of uncertainty within ECGs.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully enables ECG-based prediction of cardiac function measurements traditionally requiring echocardiograms, with improved performance and uncertainty awareness.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used tool for assessing cardiac function
due to its low cost and accessibility. Emergent research shows that ECGs can
help make predictions on key outcomes traditionally derived from more complex
modalities such as echocardiograms (ECHO), enabling the use of ECGs as a more
accessible method to predict broader measurements of cardiac function. ECHO, in
particular, are of great importance because they require considerable hospital
resources while playing a key role in clinical cardiac assessment. To aid this
use case, we introduce EchoingECG, a probabilistic student-teacher model that
leverages uncertainty-aware ECG embeddings and ECHO supervision to improve
ECG-based cardiac function prediction. Our approach integrates Probabilistic
Cross-Modal Embeddings (PCME++), a probabilistic contrastive framework, with
ECHO-CLIP, a vision-language pre-trained model trained on ECHO-text pairs, to
distill ECHO knowledge into ECG representations. Through experiments and
external validation, we showed that EchoingECG outperforms state-of-the-art
foundation ECG models in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tune settings for ECHO
predictions based on ECG. We also highlighted that variance estimation (enabled
through our method) enhanced our understanding of model performance by
identifying underlying regions of uncertainty within ECGs. The code is

TL;DR: A new dataset and benchmark for visual-inertial SLAM with egocentric, multi-modal data, featuring metric, centimeter-accurate ground truth poses obtained through surveying tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing SLAM benchmarks that don't reflect real-world egocentric challenges like diverse motions, dynamic content, and long sessions with time-varying sensor calibration.

Method: Record hours of trajectories through a city center using glasses-like devices with various sensors, leveraging surveying tools for control points as indirect pose annotations that are metric and centimeter-accurate.

Result: State-of-the-art academic SLAM systems show poor robustness to real-world egocentric challenges, with specific components identified as problematic. The dataset enables evaluation of extreme scenarios like night walking and vehicle travel.

Conclusion: The new dataset and benchmark fill a critical gap in SLAM evaluation, providing realistic egocentric data with accurate ground truth to drive development of more robust SLAM systems.

Abstract: Precise 6-DoF simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) from onboard
sensors is critical for wearable devices capturing egocentric data, which
exhibits specific challenges, such as a wider diversity of motions and
viewpoints, prevalent dynamic visual content, or long sessions affected by
time-varying sensor calibration. While recent progress on SLAM has been swift,
academic research is still driven by benchmarks that do not reflect these
challenges or do not offer sufficiently accurate ground truth poses. In this
paper, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for visual-inertial SLAM with
egocentric, multi-modal data. We record hours and kilometers of trajectories
through a city center with glasses-like devices equipped with various sensors.
We leverage surveying tools to obtain control points as indirect pose
annotations that are metric, centimeter-accurate, and available at city scale.
This makes it possible to evaluate extreme trajectories that involve walking at
night or traveling in a vehicle. We show that state-of-the-art systems
developed by academia are not robust to these challenges and we identify
components that are responsible for this. In addition, we design tracks with
different levels of difficulty to ease in-depth analysis and evaluation of less
mature approaches. The dataset and benchmark are available at

Motivation: Existing benchmarks evaluate VLMs through multiple-choice questions based on image annotations, lacking systematic assessment of embodied reasoning through precise visual grounding.

Method: Proposed hierarchical evaluation protocol with three stages (S1: referred-object localization, S2: task-driven pointing, S3: visual trace prediction) using data from indoor, kitchen, driving, and robotic manipulation scenarios.

Result: Extensive experiments with 10+ VLMs reveal GPT-4o underperforms in precise visual grounding despite excelling in other benchmarks; MoLMO performs well in S1-S2 but struggles in S3 requiring visual trace planning.

Conclusion: The PIO benchmark provides systematic assessment of VLMs' embodied reasoning abilities, revealing limitations in current models' visual grounding capabilities and highlighting the need for improved visual trace planning.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive world knowledge
across a wide range of tasks, making them promising candidates for embodied
reasoning applications. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate the
embodied reasoning ability of VLMs through multiple-choice questions based on
image annotations -- for example, selecting which trajectory better describes
an event in the image. In this work, we introduce the Point-It-Out (PIO)
benchmark, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess the embodied
reasoning abilities of VLMs through precise visual grounding. We propose a
hierarchical evaluation protocol spanning three stages (S1: referred-object
localization, S2: task-driven pointing, and S3: visual trace prediction), with
data collected from critical domains for embodied intelligence, including
indoor, kitchen, driving, and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive
experiments with over ten state-of-the-art VLMs reveal several interesting
findings. For example, strong general-purpose models such as GPT-4o, while
excelling on many benchmarks (e.g., language, perception, and reasoning),
underperform compared to some open-source models in precise visual grounding;
models such as MoLMO perform well in S1 and S2 but struggle in S3, where
requires grounding combined with visual trace planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of foundation models for agricultural computer vision is challenging due to limited training data and complex field conditions, requiring adaptation under extreme data constraints.

Method: DSGA uses dynamic similarity graph construction with learnable polynomial decay-initialized weight ranking and adaptive local feature aggregation, integrated with LoRA to create a complementary optimization framework capturing both local and global dependencies.

Result: Achieved 17.31% improvement in Structure-measure and 62.36% gain in adaptive F-measure compared to baseline SAM fine-tuning, with progressive performance gains as shot count increased from 2 to 10 shots.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates practical utility for automated agricultural monitoring, achieving accurate pod-counting with adjusted R-squared of 0.8987 under challenging field conditions, validating effectiveness through comprehensive ablation studies and visualization analyses.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of foundation models for agricultural
computer vision tasks remains challenging due to limited training data and
complex field conditions. This study introduces a Dynamic Similarity-based
Graph Adaptation (DSGA) module to adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) under
extreme data constraints for precise foreground and instance segmentation of
small dense objects in complex agricultural environments. Through dynamic
similarity graph construction with a learnable polynomial decay-initialized
weight ranking mechanism and adaptive local feature aggregation, DSGA
establishes robust spatial and dynamic similarity representation with only
4.00M trainable parameters, which is 4.26% of the original SAM. Integrating
this graph-based feature adaptation with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) creates a
complementary optimization framework that effectively captures both local and
global dependencies in image embeddings while preserving model stability and
parameter efficiency. Experimental results on a challenging chickpea pod
dataset demonstrated that DSGA with LoRA achieved superior performance across
multiple metrics evaluated under 2, 4, 8 and 10 shots, with progressive
performance gains as shot count increased. Quantitative metrics showed a 17.31%
improvement in Structure-measure and a 62.36% gain in adaptive F-measure
compared to the baseline SAM fine-tuning. Comprehensive ablation studies and
visualization analyses through Grad-CAM and t-SNE validated the framework's
effectiveness in feature discrimination. The proposed adaptation demonstrated
practical utility for automated agricultural monitoring applications, achieving
accurate pod-counting with an adjusted R-squared of 0.8987 for images with 10
to 120 pods under challenging field conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Logo-VGR is a novel method for open-world logo recognition that reformulates the task as comparison-based matching rather than direct brand label generation, enabling generalization to large-scale brand recognition with limited supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal large language models are primarily evaluated on general-purpose benchmarks, leaving domain-specific applications like intelligent product moderation underexplored. Traditional logo recognition methods that memorize thousands of brand representations are impractical for real-world settings.

Method: Logo-VGR introduces domain-specific multimodal reasoning with two key components: Logo Perception Grounding to inject domain knowledge, and Logo-Guided Visual Grounded Reasoning to enhance reasoning capabilities. The approach frames logo recognition as a comparison task where models match product images with candidate logos.

Result: Experimental results show Logo-VGR outperforms strong baselines by nearly 10 points in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed Logo-VGR method effectively addresses the limitations of traditional logo recognition by enabling robust generalization to unseen brands through domain-specific multimodal reasoning, making it practical for real-world product moderation applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been
primarily evaluated on general-purpose benchmarks, while their applications in
domain-specific scenarios, such as intelligent product moderation, remain
underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce an open-world logo recognition
benchmark, a core challenge in product moderation. Unlike traditional logo
recognition methods that rely on memorizing representations of tens of
thousands of brands-an impractical approach in real-world settings-our proposed
method, Logo-VGR, enables generalization to large-scale brand recognition with
supervision from only a small subset of brands. Specifically, we reformulate
logo recognition as a comparison-based task, requiring the model to match
product images with candidate logos rather than directly generating brand
labels. We further observe that existing models tend to overfit by memorizing
brand distributions instead of learning robust multimodal reasoning, which
results in poor performance on unseen brands. To overcome this limitation,
Logo-VGR introduces a new paradigm of domain-specific multimodal reasoning:
Logo Perception Grounding injects domain knowledge, and Logo-Guided Visual
Grounded Reasoning enhances the model's reasoning capability. Experimental
results show that Logo-VGR outperforms strong baselines by nearly 10 points in
OOD settings, demonstrating superior generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance species distribution modeling using deep learning and remote sensing data, and understand the relationship between environment and species presence across Europe.

Method: Organized an open machine learning competition with 5 million plant observations, using high-resolution remote sensing imagery, land cover, elevation, and coarse-resolution climate, soil, and human footprint variables for multi-label classification.

Result: Evaluated models' ability to predict species composition in 22,000 small plots, identified biases in methods trained with single positive labels, and discovered effective learning strategies combining single and multi-label data.

Conclusion: The competition highlighted important biases in species distribution modeling and demonstrated new effective training approaches that combine different types of label data for improved performance.

Abstract: Understanding the spatio-temporal distribution of species is a cornerstone of
ecology and conservation. By pairing species observations with geographic and
environmental predictors, researchers can model the relationship between an
environment and the species which may be found there. To advance the
state-of-the-art in this area with deep learning models and remote sensing
data, we organized an open machine learning challenge called GeoLifeCLEF 2023.
The training dataset comprised 5 million plant species observations (single
positive label per sample) distributed across Europe and covering most of its
flora, high-resolution rasters: remote sensing imagery, land cover, elevation,
in addition to coarse-resolution data: climate, soil and human footprint
variables. In this multi-label classification task, we evaluated models ability
to predict the species composition in 22 thousand small plots based on
standardized surveys. This paper presents an overview of the competition,
synthesizes the approaches used by the participating teams, and analyzes the
main results. In particular, we highlight the biases faced by the methods
fitted to single positive labels when it comes to the multi-label evaluation,
and the new and effective learning strategy combining single and multi-label
data in training.

TL;DR: VELA is a new automatic evaluation metric for long image captions that outperforms existing metrics and achieves superhuman performance on the LongCap-Arena benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics for image captioning are designed for short captions and not suitable for long captions, while LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from slow inference due to autoregressive inference and early visual fusion.

Method: Proposed VELA metric within a novel LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge framework, and created LongCap-Arena benchmark with 7,805 images, human reference captions, candidate captions, and 32,246 human judgments from three perspectives.

Result: VELA outperformed existing metrics and achieved superhuman performance on LongCap-Arena.

Conclusion: VELA provides an effective automatic evaluation solution for long and detailed image captions generated by multimodal LLMs, addressing limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: In this study, we focus on the automatic evaluation of long and detailed
image captions generated by multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Most
existing automatic evaluation metrics for image captioning are primarily
designed for short captions and are not suitable for evaluating long captions.
Moreover, recent LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from slow inference due to
their reliance on autoregressive inference and early fusion of visual

evaluation metric for long captions developed within a novel
LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge framework. Furthermore, we propose LongCap-Arena, a
benchmark specifically designed for evaluating metrics for long captions. This
benchmark comprises 7,805 images, the corresponding human-provided long
reference captions and long candidate captions, and 32,246 human judgments from
three distinct perspectives: Descriptiveness, Relevance, and Fluency. We
demonstrated that VELA outperformed existing metrics and achieved superhuman
performance on LongCap-Arena.

### [53] [Training-Free Reward-Guided Image Editing via Trajectory Optimal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25845)
*Jinho Chang,Jaemin Kim,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free framework for reward-guided image editing using diffusion models, formulated as trajectory optimal control to balance reward maximization with source image fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward-guided approaches focus on image generation but lack effective methods for image editing that preserve source image semantics while enhancing target rewards.

Method: Formulates editing as trajectory optimal control, treating diffusion reverse process as controllable trajectory from source image and iteratively updating adjoint states to steer editing.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing inversion-based training-free guidance baselines across distinct editing tasks, achieving superior balance between reward maximization and source fidelity without reward hacking.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an effective training-free solution for reward-guided image editing that maintains semantic content while enhancing target objectives.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion and flow-matching models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in high-fidelity image synthesis. A prominent line of
research involves reward-guided guidance, which steers the generation process
during inference to align with specific objectives. However, leveraging this
reward-guided approach to the task of image editing, which requires preserving
the semantic content of the source image while enhancing a target reward, is
largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for
training-free, reward-guided image editing. We formulate the editing process as
a trajectory optimal control problem where the reverse process of a diffusion
model is treated as a controllable trajectory originating from the source
image, and the adjoint states are iteratively updated to steer the editing
process. Through extensive experiments across distinct editing tasks, we
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
inversion-based training-free guidance baselines, achieving a superior balance
between reward maximization and fidelity to the source image without reward
hacking.

*Xinyu Tian,Shu Zou,Zhaoyuan Yang,Mengqi He,Fabian Waschkowski,Lukas Wesemann,Peter Tu,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multimodal reasoning in Vision-Language Models enhances logical inference but can impair perceptual grounding through visual forgetting. The paper proposes Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO) to address this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While multimodal reasoning shows promise in enhancing VLMs' capabilities, it has a dual nature: it improves logical inference but may gradually impair perceptual grounding, leading to recognition failures on basic visual questions due to visual forgetting.

Method: The authors propose Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a method that explicitly steers the reasoning process toward visually grounded trajectories to prevent visual forgetting.

Result: VAPO-Thinker-7B significantly strengthens the model's reliance on visual information and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a wide range of established benchmarks.

Conclusion: VAPO effectively addresses the visual forgetting problem in multimodal reasoning, enabling VLMs to maintain perceptual grounding while benefiting from enhanced reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Reasoning has emerged as a pivotal capability in Large Language Models
(LLMs). Through Reinforcement Learning (RL), typically Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), these models are able to solve complex tasks such as
mathematics and code generation. Building on these advances, recent research
has sought to extend reasoning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yielding
promising results across diverse visual tasks. Despite this progress, our study
uncovers the dual nature of multimodal reasoning: while it substantially
enhances logical inference and facilitates performance on challenging problems,
it may gradually impair perceptual grounding, leading to recognition failures
on otherwise basic visual questions. Through further analysis, we attribute
this phenomenon to visual forgetting, wherein prolonged reasoning causes the
model to increasingly disregard visual input. To address this, we propose
Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a simple yet effective method that
explicitly steers the reasoning process toward visually grounded trajectories.
Our result model, VAPO-Thinker-7B, significantly strengthens the model's
reliance on visual information and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a
wide range of established benchmarks. Project page:

*Jundong Xu,Hao Fei,Yuhui Zhang,Liangming Pan,Qijun Huang,Qian Liu,Preslav Nakov,Min-Yen Kan,William Yang Wang,Mong-Li Lee,Wynne Hsu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuSLR is the first benchmark for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning, testing VLMs' ability to deduce facts from multimodal inputs using formal logic. Current VLMs struggle significantly, with GPT-4.1 achieving only 46.8%. The proposed LogiCAM framework improves performance by 14.13%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal symbolic logical reasoning is critical for high-stakes applications like autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, where rigorous deterministic reasoning can prevent serious consequences. Current VLMs lack proper evaluation for such capabilities.

Method: Created MuSLR benchmark with 1,093 instances across 7 domains, including 35 atomic symbolic logic and 976 logical combinations with reasoning depths from 2 to 9. Evaluated 7 state-of-the-art VLMs and proposed LogiCAM framework that applies formal logical rules to multimodal inputs.

Result: All evaluated VLMs struggle with multimodal symbolic reasoning, with GPT-4.1 achieving the highest score of only 46.8%. LogiCAM boosts GPT-4.1's Chain-of-Thought performance by 14.13%, with larger gains on complex logics like first-order logic. Error analysis shows 70% of failures stem from logical misalignment between modalities.

Conclusion: Current VLMs have significant limitations in multimodal symbolic logical reasoning. The LogiCAM framework demonstrates that incorporating formal logical rules can substantially improve performance, and the identified logical misalignment issues provide key insights for future model development.

Abstract: Multimodal symbolic logical reasoning, which aims to deduce new facts from
multimodal input via formal logic, is critical in high-stakes applications such
as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, as its rigorous, deterministic
reasoning helps prevent serious consequences. To evaluate such capabilities of
current state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), we introduce the first
benchmark MuSLR for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning grounded in formal
logical rules. MuSLR comprises 1,093 instances across 7 domains, including 35
atomic symbolic logic and 976 logical combinations, with reasoning depths
ranging from 2 to 9. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art VLMs on MuSLR and find that
they all struggle with multimodal symbolic reasoning, with the best model,
GPT-4.1, achieving only 46.8%. Thus, we propose LogiCAM, a modular framework
that applies formal logical rules to multimodal inputs, boosting GPT-4.1's
Chain-of-Thought performance by 14.13%, and delivering even larger gains on
complex logics such as first-order logic. We also conduct a comprehensive error
analysis, showing that around 70% of failures stem from logical misalignment
between modalities, offering key insights to guide future improvements. All

### [56] [PatchEAD: Unifying Industrial Visual Prompting Frameworks for Patch-Exclusive Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25856)
*Po-Han Huang,Jeng-Lin Li,Po-Hsuan Huang,Ming-Ching Chang,Wei-Chao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PatchEAD is a unified patch-focused framework for training-free industrial anomaly detection that works with diverse foundation models using visual prompting techniques, achieving superior few-shot and zero-shot performance without textual features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current industrial anomaly detection relies heavily on foundation models but focuses mainly on textual prompt tuning, leaving visual processing fragmented across different models. The authors aim to create a unified visual framework that doesn't require textual features.

Method: Proposed Patch-Exclusive Anomaly Detection (PatchEAD) framework with visual prompting techniques including alignment module and foreground masking. It's training-free and compatible with various foundation models, focusing on patch-similarity analysis.

Result: Superior few-shot and batch zero-shot performance compared to prior work, despite not using textual features. The framework enables quick deployment without careful textual prompt engineering.

Conclusion: A well-unified patch-only framework can enable fast, calibration-light deployment for industrial anomaly detection without needing carefully engineered textual prompts, providing actionable guidance for selecting foundation models.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is increasingly relying on foundation models,
aiming for strong out-of-distribution generalization and rapid adaptation in
real-world deployments. Notably, past studies have primarily focused on textual
prompt tuning, leaving the intrinsic visual counterpart fragmented into
processing steps specific to each foundation model. We aim to address this
limitation by proposing a unified patch-focused framework, Patch-Exclusive
Anomaly Detection (PatchEAD), enabling training-free anomaly detection that is
compatible with diverse foundation models. The framework constructs visual
prompting techniques, including an alignment module and foreground masking. Our
experiments show superior few-shot and batch zero-shot performance compared to
prior work, despite the absence of textual features. Our study further examines
how backbone structure and pretrained characteristics affect patch-similarity
robustness, providing actionable guidance for selecting and configuring
foundation models for real-world visual inspection. These results confirm that
a well-unified patch-only framework can enable quick, calibration-light
deployment without the need for carefully engineered textual prompts.

*Pasindu Ranasinghe,Dibyayan Patra,Bikram Banerjee,Simit Raval*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for generating colorized 360-degree point clouds from mechanical LiDAR using multiple cameras, featuring robust low-light performance through integrated image enhancement and automated calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance spatial understanding by fusing camera data with LiDAR measurements, particularly addressing the challenge of reliable performance in low-light conditions where traditional methods struggle.

Method: Hardware-agnostic approach using multiple cameras for 360° coverage, with automated geometric transformation between LiDAR and cameras, color correction for uniformity, and integration of low-light image enhancement module in the fusion pipeline.

Result: The system achieved real-time performance and reliable colorization even under very low illumination, successfully recovering scene details that would otherwise remain undetectable, using Velodyne Puck Hi-Res LiDAR and four-camera configuration.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology provides a robust, automated solution for generating colorized point clouds with complete 360-degree coverage, demonstrating significant improvements in low-light performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: In recent years, the fusion of camera data with LiDAR measurements has
emerged as a powerful approach to enhance spatial understanding. This study
introduces a novel, hardware-agnostic methodology that generates colourised
point clouds from mechanical LiDAR using multiple camera inputs, providing
complete 360-degree coverage. The primary innovation lies in its robustness
under low-light conditions, achieved through the integration of a low-light
image enhancement module within the fusion pipeline. The system requires
initial calibration to determine intrinsic camera parameters, followed by
automatic computation of the geometric transformation between the LiDAR and
cameras, removing the need for specialised calibration targets and streamlining
the setup. The data processing framework uses colour correction to ensure
uniformity across camera feeds before fusion. The algorithm was tested using a
Velodyne Puck Hi-Res LiDAR and a four-camera configuration. The optimised
software achieved real-time performance and reliable colourisation even under
very low illumination, successfully recovering scene details that would
otherwise remain undetectable.

*Junjie Zhou,Wei Shao,Yagao Yue,Wei Mu,Peng Wan,Qi Zhu,Daoqiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAPLE is a hierarchical prompt learning framework for few-shot whole slide image classification that integrates multi-scale visual semantics and performs predictions at both entity and slide levels using LLM-generated prompts and cross-scale entity graph learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt learning methods for WSI classification rely on slide-level prompts and fail to capture subtype-specific phenotypic variations of histological entities (nuclei, glands) that are critical for cancer diagnosis.

Method: 1) Use LLMs to generate entity-level prompts for histological entities and slide-level prompts for global descriptions; 2) Entity-guided cross-attention module for entity-level features; 3) Cross-scale entity graph learning to capture semantic correlations; 4) Combine entity-level and slide-level predictions.

Result: Results on three cancer cohorts confirm the effectiveness of MAPLE in addressing few-shot pathology diagnosis tasks.

Conclusion: MAPLE provides a hierarchical framework that successfully captures fine-grained entity-level variations while maintaining global slide-level understanding, improving few-shot WSI classification performance.

Abstract: Prompt learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for adapting pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) to few-shot whole slide image (WSI)
classification by aligning visual features with textual representations,
thereby reducing annotation cost and enhancing model generalization.
Nevertheless, existing methods typically rely on slide-level prompts and fail
to capture the subtype-specific phenotypic variations of histological entities
(\emph{e.g.,} nuclei, glands) that are critical for cancer diagnosis. To
address this gap, we propose Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning
(\textbf{MAPLE}), a hierarchical framework for few-shot WSI classification that
jointly integrates multi-scale visual semantics and performs prediction at both
the entity and slide levels. Specifically, we first leverage large language
models (LLMs) to generate entity-level prompts that can help identify
multi-scale histological entities and their phenotypic attributes, as well as
slide-level prompts to capture global visual descriptions. Then, an
entity-guided cross-attention module is proposed to generate entity-level
features, followed by aligning with their corresponding subtype-specific
attributes for fine-grained entity-level prediction. To enrich entity
representations, we further develop a cross-scale entity graph learning module
that can update these representations by capturing their semantic correlations
within and across scales. The refined representations are then aggregated into
a slide-level representation and aligned with the corresponding prompts for
slide-level prediction. Finally, we combine both entity-level and slide-level
outputs to produce the final prediction results. Results on three cancer
cohorts confirm the effectiveness of our approach in addressing few-shot
pathology diagnosis tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepSketcher introduces a comprehensive suite with an image-text interleaved dataset and a model for "thinking with images" paradigm, enabling VLMs to perform tool-free visual reasoning by generating intermediate visual representations directly in visual embedding space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance the emerging "thinking with images" paradigm in Vision Language Models by addressing limitations in data construction accuracy, structural design, and application scenarios, moving beyond text-dominant reasoning to enable deeper multimodal understanding.

Method: Created a 31k chain-of-thought reasoning dataset with diverse tool calls and edited images, then designed a model that performs interleaved image-text reasoning by generating "visual thoughts" directly in visual embedding space without external tools or repeated image re-encoding.

Result: Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate strong performance, validating both the utility of the dataset and the effectiveness of the model design for tool-free visual reasoning.

Conclusion: DeepSketcher successfully advances the "thinking with images" paradigm by providing high-quality data resources and an effective model architecture that enables more flexible and faithful multimodal reasoning without external tool dependencies.

Abstract: The "thinking with images" paradigm represents a pivotal shift in the
reasoning of Vision Language Models (VLMs), moving from text-dominant
chain-of-thought to image-interactive reasoning. By invoking visual tools or
generating intermediate visual representations, VLMs can iteratively attend to
fine-grained regions, enabling deeper image understanding and more faithful
multimodal reasoning. As an emerging paradigm, however, it still leaves
substantial room for exploration in data construction accuracy, structural
design, and broader application scenarios, which offer rich opportunities for
advancing multimodal reasoning. To further advance this line of work, we
present DeepSketcher, a comprehensive suite comprising both an image-text
interleaved dataset and a self-contained model. The dataset contains 31k
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning trajectories with diverse tool calls and
resulting edited images, covering a wide range of data types and manipulation
instructions with high annotation accuracy. Building on this resource, we
design a model that performs interleaved image-text reasoning and natively
generates "visual thoughts" by operating directly in the visual embedding
space, rather than invoking external tools and repeatedly re-encoding generated
images. This design enables tool-free and more flexible "thinking with images".
Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate strong
performance, validating both the utility of the dataset and the effectiveness
of the model design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first systematic study of multimodal multi-turn dialogue safety, presents the MMDS dataset with 4,484 annotated samples, develops an automated red-teaming framework using MCTS, and proposes LLaVAShield for joint risk detection in user inputs and assistant responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models are moving into interactive, multi-turn use, creating new safety risks that single-turn or single-modality moderation misses. Malicious intent can be spread across turns and images, and context-sensitive replies may still advance harmful content.

Method: The authors systematically define MMT dialogue safety, create the MMDS dataset with fine-grained annotations, develop an automated multimodal multi-turn red-teaming framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to generate unsafe dialogues, and propose LLaVAShield for joint risk detection.

Result: LLaVAShield consistently outperforms strong baselines on MMT content moderation tasks and under dynamic policy configurations, establishing new state-of-the-art results. The MMDS dataset contains 4,484 annotated multimodal dialogue samples with safety ratings, policy dimensions, and evidence-based rationales.

Conclusion: The work addresses critical safety challenges in multimodal multi-turn dialogues, provides a comprehensive dataset and framework for safety evaluation, and demonstrates superior performance of the proposed LLaVAShield approach for content moderation in interactive VLMs.

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) move into interactive, multi-turn use, new
safety risks arise that single-turn or single-modality moderation misses. In
Multimodal Multi-Turn (MMT) dialogues, malicious intent can be spread across
turns and images, while context-sensitive replies may still advance harmful
content. To address this challenge, we present the first systematic definition
and study of MMT dialogue safety. Building on this formulation, we introduce
the Multimodal Multi-turn Dialogue Safety (MMDS) dataset. We further develop an
automated multimodal multi-turn red-teaming framework based on Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to generate unsafe multimodal multi-turn dialogues for MMDS. MMDS
contains 4,484 annotated multimodal dialogue samples with fine-grained safety
ratings, policy dimension labels, and evidence-based rationales for both users
and assistants. Leveraging MMDS, we present LLaVAShield, a powerful tool that
jointly detects and assesses risk in user inputs and assistant responses.
Across comprehensive experiments, LLaVAShield consistently outperforms strong
baselines on MMT content moderation tasks and under dynamic policy
configurations, establishing new state-of-the-art results. We will publicly
release the dataset and model to support future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLM-FO1 transforms object perception from coordinate generation to feature retrieval, using a hybrid encoder and token-based referencing to enable precise visual grounding without compromising general VLM capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models struggle with fine-grained perception tasks requiring precise localization due to the challenge of generating exact numerical coordinates with language-centric architectures.

Method: Uses a plug-and-play module with Hybrid Fine-grained Region Encoder (dual vision encoder) to generate region tokens rich in semantic and spatial detail, plus token-based referencing for LLM reasoning about visual regions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks in object grounding, region generation, and visual reasoning, with two-stage training preserving base model capabilities.

Conclusion: Establishes an effective paradigm for perception-aware VLMs that bridges high-level reasoning and fine-grained visual grounding through feature retrieval rather than coordinate generation.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level scene understanding but
falter on fine-grained perception tasks requiring precise localization. This
failure stems from a fundamental mismatch, as generating exact numerical
coordinates is a challenging task for language-centric architectures. In this
paper, we introduce VLM-FO1, a novel framework that overcomes this limitation
by reframing object-centric perception from a brittle coordinate generation
problem into a robust feature retrieval task. Our method operates as a
plug-and-play module that integrates with any pre-trained VLM. It leverages a
Hybrid Fine-grained Region Encoder (HFRE), featuring a dual vision encoder, to
generate powerful region tokens rich in both semantic and spatial detail. A
token-based referencing system then enables the LLM to seamlessly reason about
and ground language in these specific visual regions. Experiments show that
VLM-FO1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse suite of
benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in object grounding, region
generational understanding, and visual region reasoning. Crucially, our
two-stage training strategy ensures that these perception gains are achieved
without compromising the base model's general visual understanding
capabilities. VLM-FO1 establishes an effective and flexible paradigm for
building perception-aware VLMs, bridging the gap between high-level reasoning
and fine-grained visual grounding.

TL;DR: Training data quality and model architecture are more important than raw scale for adversarial robustness, with self-supervised models on curated data outperforming those on larger but less curated datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how training data characteristics affect adversarial robustness across different vision models and training paradigms, challenging the assumption that scale alone drives robustness.

Method: Evaluated 36 state-of-the-art vision models (supervised, self-supervised, contrastive learning) trained on datasets from 1.2M to 22B images under six black-box attack categories including random perturbations, geometric masks, object manipulations, corruptions, and style shifts.

Result: Robustness follows logarithmic scaling laws: 10x data increase reduces attack success rate by ~3.2%, while 10x model size reduces ASR by ~13.4%. Self-supervised models on curated data (e.g., DINOv2) outperform others on larger but less curated datasets. Adversarial fine-tuning improves generalization for structural but not color variations.

Conclusion: While scaling improves robustness, data quality, architecture, and training objectives play a more decisive role than raw scale in achieving broad-spectrum adversarial resilience, with persistent gaps between human and machine vision.

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain vulnerable to adversarial examples despite
advances in architectures and training paradigms. We investigate how training
data characteristics affect adversarial robustness across 36 state-of-the-art
vision models spanning supervised, self-supervised, and contrastive learning
approaches, trained on datasets from 1.2M to 22B images. Models were evaluated
under six black-box attack categories: random perturbations, two types of
geometric masks, COCO object manipulations, ImageNet-C corruptions, and
ImageNet-R style shifts. Robustness follows a logarithmic scaling law with both
data volume and model size: a tenfold increase in data reduces attack success
rate (ASR) on average by ~3.2%, whereas a tenfold increase in model size
reduces ASR on average by ~13.4%. Notably, some self-supervised models trained
on curated datasets, such as DINOv2, outperform others trained on much larger
but less curated datasets, challenging the assumption that scale alone drives
robustness. Adversarial fine-tuning of ResNet50s improves generalization across
structural variations but not across color distributions. Human evaluation
reveals persistent gaps between human and machine vision. These results show
that while scaling improves robustness, data quality, architecture, and
training objectives play a more decisive role than raw scale in achieving
broad-spectrum adversarial resilience.

*Yuan Zhao,Youwei Pang,Lihe Zhang,Hanqi Liu,Jiaming Zuo,Huchuan Lu,Xiaoqi Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniMMAD is a unified framework for multi-modal and multi-class anomaly detection that uses Mixture-of-Experts-driven feature decompression to handle diverse domains efficiently, achieving state-of-the-art performance across 9 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly detection methods treat modality and class as independent factors, leading to fragmented solutions, excessive memory overhead, and poor performance in handling large domain variations with shared decoding paths.

Method: Uses a Mixture-of-Experts-driven feature decompression mechanism with a 'general to specific' paradigm: compresses multi-modal inputs into general features during encoding, then decompresses via sparsely-gated cross MoE that dynamically selects expert pathways based on modality and class.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 9 anomaly detection datasets spanning 3 fields, 12 modalities, and 66 classes, while reducing parameter usage by 75% through grouped dynamic filtering and MoE-in-MoE structure.

Conclusion: UniMMAD provides a unified and efficient framework that overcomes limitations of existing fragmented approaches, enabling adaptive and disentangled reconstruction for multi-modal and multi-class anomaly detection with superior performance and reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: Existing anomaly detection (AD) methods often treat the modality and class as
independent factors. Although this paradigm has enriched the development of AD
research branches and produced many specialized models, it has also led to
fragmented solutions and excessive memory overhead. Moreover,
reconstruction-based multi-class approaches typically rely on shared decoding
paths, which struggle to handle large variations across domains, resulting in
distorted normality boundaries, domain interference, and high false alarm
rates. To address these limitations, we propose UniMMAD, a unified framework
for multi-modal and multi-class anomaly detection. At the core of UniMMAD is a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-driven feature decompression mechanism, which enables
adaptive and disentangled reconstruction tailored to specific domains. This
process is guided by a ``general to specific'' paradigm. In the encoding stage,
multi-modal inputs of varying combinations are compressed into compact,
general-purpose features. The encoder incorporates a feature compression module
to suppress latent anomalies, encourage cross-modal interaction, and avoid
shortcut learning. In the decoding stage, the general features are decompressed
into modality-specific and class-specific forms via a sparsely-gated cross MoE,
which dynamically selects expert pathways based on input modality and class. To
further improve efficiency, we design a grouped dynamic filtering mechanism and
a MoE-in-MoE structure, reducing parameter usage by 75\% while maintaining
sparse activation and fast inference. UniMMAD achieves state-of-the-art
performance on 9 anomaly detection datasets, spanning 3 fields, 12 modalities,
and 66 classes.

*Debottam Dutta,Jianchong Chen,Rajalaxmi Rajagopalan,Yu-Lin Wei,Romit Roy Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CO3 improves multi-concept prompt fidelity in text-to-image diffusion models by introducing corrective sampling that steers away from regions where joint prompt behavior overlaps too strongly with any single concept, ensuring balanced visual presence of all concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address common failure cases where multi-concept prompts like "a cat and a dog" yield images with missing, faint, or colliding concepts due to diffusion model drifting into mixed modes that over-emphasize strongly learned single concepts.

Method: Introduces a plug-and-play corrective sampling strategy that steers away from regions where joint prompt behavior overlaps too strongly with any single concept, adapts sampling to remain in favorable weight regimes, and complements standard classifier-free guidance without requiring model tuning.

Result: Experiments show improvements in concept coverage, balance and robustness with fewer dropped or distorted concepts compared to standard baselines and prior compositional methods across diverse multi-concept prompts.

Conclusion: Lightweight corrective guidance can substantially mitigate brittle semantic alignment behavior in modern diffusion systems, providing better multi-concept generation without model retraining.

Abstract: We propose to improve multi-concept prompt fidelity in text-to-image
diffusion models. We begin with common failure cases-prompts like "a cat and a
dog" that sometimes yields images where one concept is missing, faint, or
colliding awkwardly with another. We hypothesize that this happens when the
diffusion model drifts into mixed modes that over-emphasize a single concept it
learned strongly during training. Instead of re-training, we introduce a
corrective sampling strategy that steers away from regions where the joint
prompt behavior overlaps too strongly with any single concept in the prompt.
The goal is to steer towards "pure" joint modes where all concepts can coexist
with balanced visual presence. We further show that existing multi-concept
guidance schemes can operate in unstable weight regimes that amplify imbalance;
we characterize favorable regions and adapt sampling to remain within them. Our
approach, CO3, is plug-and-play, requires no model tuning, and complements
standard classifier-free guidance. Experiments on diverse multi-concept prompts
indicate improvements in concept coverage, balance and robustness, with fewer
dropped or distorted concepts compared to standard baselines and prior
compositional methods. Results suggest that lightweight corrective guidance can
substantially mitigate brittle semantic alignment behavior in modern diffusion
systems.

*Longzhen Yang,Zhangkai Ni,Ying Wen,Yihang Liu,Lianghua He,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SS-ACL is an annotation-free framework that generates clinically accurate medical reports by aligning text with anatomical regions using self-supervised learning, outperforming state-of-the-art methods without expert annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical report generation methods require expensive expert annotations and suffer from pathology distribution bias across datasets, limiting clinical applicability and generalizability.

Method: Proposes Self-Supervised Anatomical Consistency Learning (SS-ACL) that constructs hierarchical anatomical graphs using invariant anatomical structures, performs recursive region reconstruction for spatial alignment, and uses region-level contrastive learning for semantic alignment.

Result: Outperforms SOTA methods by 10% in lexical accuracy and 25% in clinical efficacy, and achieves 8% improvement in zero-shot visual grounding compared to leading visual foundation models.

Conclusion: SS-ACL provides an effective annotation-free solution for generating interpretable, clinically accurate medical reports by leveraging anatomical consistency, demonstrating strong performance across multiple metrics and downstream tasks.

Abstract: Vision-grounded medical report generation aims to produce clinically accurate
descriptions of medical images, anchored in explicit visual evidence to improve
interpretability and facilitate integration into clinical workflows. However,
existing methods often rely on separately trained detection modules that
require extensive expert annotations, introducing high labeling costs and
limiting generalizability due to pathology distribution bias across datasets.
To address these challenges, we propose Self-Supervised Anatomical Consistency
Learning (SS-ACL) -- a novel and annotation-free framework that aligns
generated reports with corresponding anatomical regions using simple textual
prompts. SS-ACL constructs a hierarchical anatomical graph inspired by the
invariant top-down inclusion structure of human anatomy, organizing entities by
spatial location. It recursively reconstructs fine-grained anatomical regions
to enforce intra-sample spatial alignment, inherently guiding attention maps
toward visually relevant areas prompted by text. To further enhance
inter-sample semantic alignment for abnormality recognition, SS-ACL introduces
a region-level contrastive learning based on anatomical consistency. These
aligned embeddings serve as priors for report generation, enabling attention
maps to provide interpretable visual evidence. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SS-ACL, without relying on expert annotations, (i) generates
accurate and visually grounded reports -- outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by 10\% in lexical accuracy and 25\% in clinical efficacy, and (ii)
achieves competitive performance on various downstream visual tasks, surpassing
current leading visual foundation models by 8\% in zero-shot visual grounding.

*Espen Uri Høgstedt,Christian Schellewald,Annette Stahl,Rudolf Mester*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A flexible tracking framework using pose estimation for automated salmon welfare monitoring in aquaculture, addressing underwater challenges like occlusion and similar appearance/motion, outperforming state-of-the-art trackers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CV methods for salmon welfare monitoring focus on single indicators, require separate calculations for each indicator, and struggle with underwater challenges like object occlusion, similar appearance, and similar motion patterns.

Method: Uses pose estimation network to extract bounding boxes around salmon and their body parts, then employs specialized modules leveraging body part information to handle underwater tracking challenges, enabling welfare indicator calculation from detailed body part tracks.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art pedestrian tracker BoostTrack on two novel salmon tracking datasets (ID transfers in crowded scenes and ID switches during turning), and demonstrates suitability for automated welfare monitoring through tail beat analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an effective solution for continuous, automated salmon welfare monitoring in aquaculture by addressing specific underwater challenges and enabling multi-indicator welfare assessment through body part tracking.

Abstract: Computer Vision (CV)-based continuous, automated and precise salmon welfare
monitoring is a key step toward reduced salmon mortality and improved salmon
welfare in industrial aquaculture net pens. Available CV methods for
determining welfare indicators focus on single indicators and rely on object
detectors and trackers from other application areas to aid their welfare
indicator calculation algorithm. This comes with a high resource demand for
real-world applications, since each indicator must be calculated separately. In
addition, the methods are vulnerable to difficulties in underwater salmon
scenes, such as object occlusion, similar object appearance, and similar object
motion. To address these challenges, we propose a flexible tracking framework
that uses a pose estimation network to extract bounding boxes around salmon and
their corresponding body parts, and exploits information about the body parts,
through specialized modules, to tackle challenges specific to underwater salmon
scenes. Subsequently, the high-detail body part tracks are employed to
calculate welfare indicators. We construct two novel datasets assessing two
salmon tracking challenges: salmon ID transfers in crowded scenes and salmon ID
switches during turning. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art
pedestrian tracker, BoostTrack, for both salmon tracking challenges.
Additionally, we create a dataset for calculating salmon tail beat wavelength,
demonstrating that our body part tracking method is well-suited for automated
welfare monitoring based on tail beat analysis. Datasets and code are available

TL;DR: PinPoint3D is an interactive framework for fine-grained 3D part segmentation that generates precise part-level masks from few user point clicks, addressing limitations in existing methods and data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interactive segmentation methods are limited to coarse instance-level targets, while non-interactive approaches struggle with sparse real-world scans and lack annotated data for fine-grained part segmentation.

Method: Developed a novel interactive framework using few user point clicks and created a new 3D data synthesis pipeline to generate large-scale scene-level datasets with dense part annotations.

Result: Achieved average IoU of 55.8% on each object part under first-click settings, surpassing 71.3% IoU with few additional clicks, with up to 16% improvement in IoU and precision over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: PinPoint3D represents a significant advancement for nuanced machine perception and interaction in complex 3D environments, overcoming critical bottlenecks in fine-grained 3D part segmentation.

Abstract: Fine-grained 3D part segmentation is crucial for enabling embodied AI systems
to perform complex manipulation tasks, such as interacting with specific
functional components of an object. However, existing interactive segmentation
methods are largely confined to coarse, instance-level targets, while
non-interactive approaches struggle with sparse, real-world scans and suffer
from a severe lack of annotated data. To address these limitations, we
introduce PinPoint3D, a novel interactive framework for fine-grained,
multi-granularity 3D segmentation, capable of generating precise part-level
masks from only a few user point clicks. A key component of our work is a new
3D data synthesis pipeline that we developed to create a large-scale,
scene-level dataset with dense part annotations, overcoming a critical
bottleneck that has hindered progress in this field. Through comprehensive
experiments and user studies, we demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average IoU of around 55.8% on
each object part under first-click settings and surpassing 71.3% IoU with only
a few additional clicks. Compared to current state-of-the-art baselines,
PinPoint3D yields up to a 16% improvement in IoU and precision, highlighting
its effectiveness on challenging, sparse point clouds with high efficiency. Our
work represents a significant step towards more nuanced and precise machine
perception and interaction in complex 3D environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RH-Partial2Global improves visual in-context learning by using conformal prediction for reliable alternative sets and covering design for comprehensive pairwise preference sampling, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VICL methods rely on the unverified similarity-priority assumption and use random sampling for pairwise preferences, leading to incomplete coverage and redundant comparisons that degrade global ranking quality.

Method: RH-Partial2Global introduces jackknife conformal prediction to construct reliable alternative sets and covering design-based sampling to ensure comprehensive and uniform coverage of pairwise preferences.

Result: Extensive experiments show RH-Partial2Global achieves excellent performance and outperforms Partial2Global across diverse visual tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a more reliable and holistic approach for selecting optimal in-context examples in visual in-context learning, addressing limitations of current methods.

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) has emerged as a prominent approach for
adapting visual foundation models to novel tasks, by effectively exploiting
contextual information embedded in in-context examples, which can be formulated
as a global ranking problem of potential candidates. Current VICL methods, such
as Partial2Global and VPR, are grounded in the similarity-priority assumption
that images more visually similar to a query image serve as better in-context
examples. This foundational assumption, while intuitive, lacks sufficient
justification for its efficacy in selecting optimal in-context examples.
Furthermore, Partial2Global constructs its global ranking from a series of
randomly sampled pairwise preference predictions. Such a reliance on random
sampling can lead to incomplete coverage and redundant samplings of
comparisons, thus further adversely impacting the final global ranking. To
address these issues, this paper introduces an enhanced variant of
Partial2Global designed for reliable and holistic selection of in-context
examples in VICL. Our proposed method, dubbed RH-Partial2Global, leverages a
jackknife conformal prediction-guided strategy to construct reliable
alternative sets and a covering design-based sampling approach to ensure
comprehensive and uniform coverage of pairwise preferences. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RH-Partial2Global achieves excellent performance
and outperforms Partial2Global across diverse visual tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VRWKV-Editor is a novel video editing model that uses linear spatio-temporal aggregation with RWKV transformer to achieve linear complexity, offering 3.7x speedup and 60% lower memory usage while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video editing models suffer from quadratic computational complexity of attention mechanisms, making them impractical for long-duration and high-resolution videos in real-time applications.

Method: Integrates linear spatio-temporal aggregation module into video-based diffusion models using bidirectional weighted key-value recurrence mechanism of RWKV transformer to capture global dependencies with linear complexity.

Result: Achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 60% lower memory usage compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining competitive frame consistency and text alignment. Performance gap widens with longer videos.

Conclusion: VRWKV-Editor successfully addresses computational complexity issues in video editing, enabling efficient processing of long videos without sacrificing quality, making it suitable for practical real-time applications.

Abstract: In light of recent progress in video editing, deep learning models focusing
on both spatial and temporal dependencies have emerged as the primary method.
However, these models suffer from the quadratic computational complexity of
traditional attention mechanisms, making them difficult to adapt to
long-duration and high-resolution videos. This limitation restricts their
applicability in practical contexts such as real-time video processing. To
tackle this challenge, we introduce a method to reduce both time and space
complexity of these systems by proposing VRWKV-Editor, a novel video editing
model that integrates a linear spatio-temporal aggregation module into
video-based diffusion models. VRWKV-Editor leverages bidirectional weighted
key-value recurrence mechanism of the RWKV transformer to capture global
dependencies while preserving temporal coherence, achieving linear complexity
without sacrificing quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 60% lower memory usage compared
to state-of-the-art diffusion-based video editing methods, while maintaining
competitive performance in frame consistency and text alignment. Furthermore, a
comparative analysis we conducted on videos with different sequence lengths
confirms that the gap in editing speed between our approach and architectures
with self-attention becomes more significant with long videos.

*Nicola Messina,Rosario Leonardi,Luca Ciampi,Fabio Carrara,Giovanni Maria Farinella,Fabrizio Falchi,Antonino Furnari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a weakly supervised method for in-hand object segmentation from egocentric images using natural language narrations as supervision, achieving over 50% of fully supervised performance without pixel-level annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-level object recognition from egocentric images is valuable for assistive technologies and activity monitoring, but progress is hindered by the scarcity of annotated datasets due to costly manual labeling requirements.

Method: Proposes WISH (Weakly-Supervised In-hand Object Segmentation from Human Narrations), an end-to-end model that distills knowledge from natural language narrations to learn hand-object associations and enable in-hand object segmentation without using narrations at test time.

Result: Experiments on EPIC-Kitchens and Ego4D datasets show WISH surpasses all baselines based on open-vocabulary object detectors and vision-language models, recovering more than 50% of the performance of fully supervised methods.

Conclusion: Natural language narrations provide effective weak supervision for learning human-object interaction detection, enabling in-hand object segmentation without costly pixel-wise annotations while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Pixel-level recognition of objects manipulated by the user from egocentric
images enables key applications spanning assistive technologies, industrial
safety, and activity monitoring. However, progress in this area is currently
hindered by the scarcity of annotated datasets, as existing approaches rely on
costly manual labels. In this paper, we propose to learn human-object
interaction detection leveraging narrations -- natural language descriptions of
the actions performed by the camera wearer which contain clues about
manipulated objects (e.g., "I am pouring vegetables from the chopping board to
the pan"). Narrations provide a form of weak supervision that is cheap to
acquire and readily available in state-of-the-art egocentric datasets. We
introduce Narration-Supervised in-Hand Object Segmentation (NS-iHOS), a novel
task where models have to learn to segment in-hand objects by learning from
natural-language narrations. Narrations are then not employed at inference
time. We showcase the potential of the task by proposing Weakly-Supervised
In-hand Object Segmentation from Human Narrations (WISH), an end-to-end model
distilling knowledge from narrations to learn plausible hand-object
associations and enable in-hand object segmentation without using narrations at
test time. We benchmark WISH against different baselines based on
open-vocabulary object detectors and vision-language models, showing the
superiority of its design. Experiments on EPIC-Kitchens and Ego4D show that
WISH surpasses all baselines, recovering more than 50% of the performance of
fully supervised methods, without employing fine-grained pixel-wise
annotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AgenticIQA is a modular agentic framework that integrates vision-language models with traditional IQA tools to dynamically assess image quality through coordinated planning, execution, and summarization, outperforming conventional fixed-model approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional IQA methods use fixed models that limit adaptability to diverse distortions, user queries, and interpretability needs, treating scoring and interpretation as separate processes despite their interdependence.

Method: AgenticIQA decomposes IQA into four subtasks (distortion detection, distortion analysis, tool selection, tool execution) coordinated by planner, executor, and summarizer components, using VLMs with traditional IQA tools in a query-aware manner.

Result: Extensive experiments show AgenticIQA consistently surpasses strong baselines in both scoring accuracy and explanatory alignment across diverse IQA datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed agentic framework effectively addresses limitations of conventional IQA methods by integrating perceptual evidence collection with human-aligned explanations through modular task decomposition.

Abstract: Image quality assessment (IQA) is inherently complex, as it reflects both the
quantification and interpretation of perceptual quality rooted in the human
visual system. Conventional approaches typically rely on fixed models to output
scalar scores, limiting their adaptability to diverse distortions,
user-specific queries, and interpretability needs. Furthermore, scoring and
interpretation are often treated as independent processes, despite their
interdependence: interpretation identifies perceptual degradations, while
scoring abstracts them into a compact metric. To address these limitations, we
propose AgenticIQA, a modular agentic framework that integrates vision-language
models (VLMs) with traditional IQA tools in a dynamic, query-aware manner.
AgenticIQA decomposes IQA into four subtasks -- distortion detection,
distortion analysis, tool selection, and tool execution -- coordinated by a
planner, executor, and summarizer. The planner formulates task-specific
strategies, the executor collects perceptual evidence via tool invocation, and
the summarizer integrates this evidence to produce accurate scores with
human-aligned explanations. To support training and evaluation, we introduce
AgenticIQA-200K, a large-scale instruction dataset tailored for IQA agents, and
AgenticIQA-Eval, the first benchmark for assessing the planning, execution, and
summarization capabilities of VLM-based IQA agents. Extensive experiments
across diverse IQA datasets demonstrate that AgenticIQA consistently surpasses
strong baselines in both scoring accuracy and explanatory alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PFDepth is the first framework for heterogeneous multi-view depth estimation that combines pinhole and fisheye cameras, using a unified architecture with 3D volumetric feature lifting, distortion-aware fusion, and 3D Gaussian representation for superior depth estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To exploit the complementary characteristics of pinhole and fisheye cameras (undistorted vs. distorted, small vs. large FOV, far vs. near field) for joint optimization in depth estimation, addressing the lack of systematic approaches for heterogeneous camera systems.

Method: Uses a unified architecture that lifts 2D features into 3D volumetric space, employs Heterogeneous Spatial Fusion for distortion-aware volumetric feature fusion, and reformulates voxel fusion into 3D Gaussian representation with learnable latent Gaussian spheres that adapt to local textures.

Result: PFDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance on KITTI-360 and RealHet datasets, outperforming current mainstream depth networks.

Conclusion: This represents the first systematic study of heterogeneous pinhole-fisheye depth estimation, offering both technical novelty through the 3D Gaussian representation and valuable empirical insights for multi-camera depth estimation systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first pinhole-fisheye framework for
heterogeneous multi-view depth estimation, PFDepth. Our key insight is to
exploit the complementary characteristics of pinhole and fisheye imagery
(undistorted vs. distorted, small vs. large FOV, far vs. near field) for joint
optimization. PFDepth employs a unified architecture capable of processing
arbitrary combinations of pinhole and fisheye cameras with varied intrinsics
and extrinsics. Within PFDepth, we first explicitly lift 2D features from each
heterogeneous view into a canonical 3D volumetric space. Then, a core module
termed Heterogeneous Spatial Fusion is designed to process and fuse
distortion-aware volumetric features across overlapping and non-overlapping
regions. Additionally, we subtly reformulate the conventional voxel fusion into
a novel 3D Gaussian representation, in which learnable latent Gaussian spheres
dynamically adapt to local image textures for finer 3D aggregation. Finally,
fused volume features are rendered into multi-view depth maps. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PFDepth sets a state-of-the-art
performance on KITTI-360 and RealHet datasets over current mainstream depth
networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of
heterogeneous pinhole-fisheye depth estimation, offering both technical novelty
and valuable empirical insights.

TL;DR: Proposed a fourth-order nonlinear PDE model combining diffusion and wave properties for better multiplicative noise reduction without blocky artifacts, outperforming second-order models on grayscale, SAR, and color images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Second-order PDE models for multiplicative noise suppression often introduce blocky artifacts during early denoising stages, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Developed a fourth-order nonlinear PDE model integrating diffusion (guided by Laplacian and intensity values) and wave properties, with independent channel processing for color images.

Result: Achieved superior performance over second-order anisotropic diffusion models using PSNR, MSSIM, and Speckle Index metrics across grayscale, SAR, and color images.

Conclusion: The proposed fourth-order PDE model effectively suppresses multiplicative noise while preserving fine details and textures, outperforming existing second-order approaches.

Abstract: Second-order PDE models have been widely used for suppressing multiplicative
noise, but they often introduce blocky artifacts in the early stages of
denoising. To resolve this, we propose a fourth-order nonlinear PDE model that
integrates diffusion and wave properties. The diffusion process, guided by both
the Laplacian and intensity values, reduces noise better than gradient-based
methods, while the wave part keeps fine details and textures. The effectiveness
of the proposed model is evaluated against two second-order anisotropic
diffusion approaches using the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean
Structural Similarity Index (MSSIM) for images with available ground truth. For
SAR images, where a noise-free reference is unavailable, the Speckle Index (SI)
is used to measure noise reduction. Additionally, we extend the proposed model
to study color images by applying the denoising process independently to each
channel, preserving both structure and color consistency. The same quantitative
metrics PSNR and MSSIM are used for performance evaluation, ensuring a fair
comparison across grayscale and color images. In all the cases, our computed
results produce better results compared to existing models in this genre.

*Yuqi Xiao,Yingying Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SETR is a two-stage zero-shot composed image retrieval method that uses intersection-driven coarse retrieval and LLM-based fine-grained re-ranking to overcome CLIP's limitations in handling irrelevant background details and fine-grained semantic relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based methods for zero-shot composed image retrieval suffer from indiscriminate feature fusion that carries irrelevant background details and lack fine-grained semantic reasoning capabilities beyond global cosine similarity.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) Coarse retrieval with intersection-driven strategy that retains only overlapping semantics between reference image and relative text, (2) Fine-grained re-ranking using pretrained multimodal LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation for binary semantic relevance judgments.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on CIRR, Fashion-IQ, and CIRCO datasets, improving Recall@1 on CIRR by up to 15.15 points.

Conclusion: Two-stage reasoning establishes a general paradigm for robust and portable zero-shot composed image retrieval, effectively addressing limitations of CLIP-based methods through complementary coarse and fine-grained processing stages.

Abstract: Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve a target image
given a reference image and a relative text, without relying on costly triplet
annotations. Existing CLIP-based methods face two core challenges: (1)
union-based feature fusion indiscriminately aggregates all visual cues,
carrying over irrelevant background details that dilute the intended
modification, and (2) global cosine similarity from CLIP embeddings lacks the
ability to resolve fine-grained semantic relations. To address these issues, we
propose SETR (Semantic-enhanced Two-Stage Retrieval). In the coarse retrieval
stage, SETR introduces an intersection-driven strategy that retains only the
overlapping semantics between the reference image and relative text, thereby
filtering out distractors inherent to union-based fusion and producing a
cleaner, high-precision candidate set. In the fine-grained re-ranking stage, we
adapt a pretrained multimodal LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation to conduct binary
semantic relevance judgments ("Yes/No"), which goes beyond CLIP's global
feature matching by explicitly verifying relational and attribute-level
consistency. Together, these two stages form a complementary pipeline: coarse
retrieval narrows the candidate pool with high recall, while re-ranking ensures
precise alignment with nuanced textual modifications. Experiments on CIRR,
Fashion-IQ, and CIRCO show that SETR achieves new state-of-the-art performance,
improving Recall@1 on CIRR by up to 15.15 points. Our results establish
two-stage reasoning as a general paradigm for robust and portable ZS-CIR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoLink is a multimodal framework that integrates OpenStreetMap data with remote sensing foundation models to enhance geospatial intelligence through cross-modal pretraining and downstream task adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a modality gap between remote sensing and OpenStreetMap data in terms of data structure, content, and spatial granularity, making effective synergy challenging. Most existing remote sensing foundation models focus only on imagery, lacking geographic context.

Method: GeoLink enhances self-supervised pretraining using multi-granularity learning signals from OSM data guided by cross-modal spatial correlations, and introduces image mask-reconstruction for efficient pretraining. For downstream tasks, it generates both unimodal and multimodal fine-grained encodings.

Result: Extensive experiments show that incorporating OSM data during pretraining enhances RS image encoder performance, while fusing RS and OSM data in downstream tasks improves adaptability to complex geographic scenarios. Spatial correlation is crucial for effective multimodal integration.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the potential of multimodal synergy in advancing high-level geospatial artificial intelligence, with spatial correlation playing a key role in enabling effective geospatial data integration.

Abstract: Integrating ground-level geospatial data with rich geographic context, like
OpenStreetMap (OSM), into remote sensing (RS) foundation models (FMs) is
essential for advancing geospatial intelligence and supporting a broad spectrum
of tasks. However, modality gap between RS and OSM data, including differences
in data structure, content, and spatial granularity, makes effective synergy
highly challenging, and most existing RS FMs focus on imagery alone. To this
end, this study presents GeoLink, a multimodal framework that leverages OSM
data to enhance RS FM during both the pretraining and downstream task stages.
Specifically, GeoLink enhances RS self-supervised pretraining using
multi-granularity learning signals derived from OSM data, guided by cross-modal
spatial correlations for information interaction and collaboration. It also
introduces image mask-reconstruction to enable sparse input for efficient
pretraining. For downstream tasks, GeoLink generates both unimodal and
multimodal fine-grained encodings to support a wide range of applications, from
common RS interpretation tasks like land cover classification to more
comprehensive geographic tasks like urban function zone mapping. Extensive
experiments show that incorporating OSM data during pretraining enhances the
performance of the RS image encoder, while fusing RS and OSM data in downstream
tasks improves the FM's adaptability to complex geographic scenarios. These
results underscore the potential of multimodal synergy in advancing high-level
geospatial artificial intelligence. Moreover, we find that spatial correlation
plays a crucial role in enabling effective multimodal geospatial data
integration. Code, checkpoints, and using examples are released at

TL;DR: PatchVSR: A patch-wise video super-resolution method that uses pre-trained video diffusion models with a dual-stream adapter for conditional guidance, enabling efficient 4K VSR from 512x512 base models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video super-resolution methods using pre-trained models suffer from intensive full-attention computation and fixed output resolution limitations.

Method: Proposes PatchVSR with dual-stream adapter: patch branch for content fidelity and global branch for context features, plus location injection and multi-patch joint modulation for consistency.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity, high-resolution patch-level detail synthesis with competitive 4K VSR performance and extremely high efficiency.

Conclusion: Patch-based paradigm enables flexible and efficient video super-resolution, overcoming limitations of full-size VSR approaches.

Abstract: Pre-trained video generation models hold great potential for generative video
super-resolution (VSR). However, adapting them for full-size VSR, as most
existing methods do, suffers from unnecessary intensive full-attention
computation and fixed output resolution. To overcome these limitations, we make
the first exploration into utilizing video diffusion priors for patch-wise VSR.
This is non-trivial because pre-trained video diffusion models are not native
for patch-level detail generation. To mitigate this challenge, we propose an
innovative approach, called PatchVSR, which integrates a dual-stream adapter
for conditional guidance. The patch branch extracts features from input patches
to maintain content fidelity while the global branch extracts context features
from the resized full video to bridge the generation gap caused by incomplete
semantics of patches. Particularly, we also inject the patch's location
information into the model to better contextualize patch synthesis within the
global video frame. Experiments demonstrate that our method can synthesize
high-fidelity, high-resolution details at the patch level. A tailor-made
multi-patch joint modulation is proposed to ensure visual consistency across
individually enhanced patches. Due to the flexibility of our patch-based
paradigm, we can achieve highly competitive 4K VSR based on a 512x512
resolution base model, with extremely high efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Causally-Guided Gaussian Perturbations (CGP) is a lightweight framework that improves out-of-distribution generalization by injecting spatially varying noise guided by soft causal masks from Vision Transformers, with stronger perturbations on background and weaker on foreground regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OOD generalization is challenging in real-world scenarios like biomedical images where distribution shifts are subtle. Existing methods using complex generative models or adversarial training may overlook underlying causal mechanisms of generalization.

Method: Inject spatially varying Gaussian noise into input images using soft causal masks derived from Vision Transformers, applying stronger perturbations to background regions and weaker ones to foreground areas to encourage reliance on causally relevant features.

Result: Experimental results on WILDS benchmark Camelyon17 demonstrate consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art OOD baselines.

Conclusion: Causal perturbation shows potential as a tool for reliable and interpretable generalization in deep learning models.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains a central challenge in
deploying deep learning models to real-world scenarios, particularly in domains
such as biomedical images, where distribution shifts are both subtle and
pervasive. While existing methods often pursue domain invariance through
complex generative models or adversarial training, these approaches may
overlook the underlying causal mechanisms of generalization.In this work, we
propose Causally-Guided Gaussian Perturbations (CGP)-a lightweight framework
that enhances OOD generalization by injecting spatially varying noise into
input images, guided by soft causal masks derived from Vision Transformers. By
applying stronger perturbations to background regions and weaker ones to
foreground areas, CGP encourages the model to rely on causally relevant
features rather than spurious correlations.Experimental results on the
challenging WILDS benchmark Camelyon17 demonstrate consistent performance gains
over state-of-the-art OOD baselines, highlighting the potential of causal
perturbation as a tool for reliable and interpretable generalization.

### [79] [SeMoBridge: Semantic Modality Bridge for Efficient Few-Shot Adaptation of CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26036)
*Christoph Timmermann,Hyunse Lee,Woojin Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeMoBridge addresses CLIP's intra-modal misalignment in few-shot classification by mapping images to text modality while preserving semantics, outperforming existing methods especially in low-data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP's performance in few-shot classification is limited by intra-modal misalignment caused by modality gap and inter-modal training, making direct image-to-image comparisons unreliable.

Method: SeMoBridge uses a Semantic Modality Bridge to map images into text modality while keeping semantic content intact. It's closed-form and can be optionally trained with multi-modal supervision combining image and text-alignment losses.

Result: SeMoBridge-T (trained version) requires minimal training time and outperforms other methods, particularly in low-data scenarios (1, 2, and 4 shots).

Conclusion: SeMoBridge effectively addresses CLIP's intra-modal misalignment through semantic modality bridging, achieving superior few-shot classification performance with efficient training.

Abstract: While Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) excels at zero-shot tasks
by aligning image and text embeddings, its performance in few-shot
classification is hindered by a critical limitation: intra-modal misalignment.
This issue, caused by a persistent modality gap and CLIP's exclusively
inter-modal training objective, leaves the embedding spaces uncalibrated,
making direct image-to-image comparisons unreliable. Existing methods attempt
to address this by refining similarity logits or by computationally expensive
per-sample optimization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SeMoBridge,
a lightweight yet powerful approach that directly addresses the misalignment.
Our method maps images into the text modality, while keeping their semantic
content intact through what we call a Semantic Modality Bridge. SeMoBridge is
closed-form and can optionally be trained through multi-modal supervision,
combining image and text-alignment losses to optimize the projection.
Experiments show that the trained version, SeMoBridge-T, requires only a
fraction of the training time while overall outperforming other methods,
particularly in low-data scenarios (1, 2, and 4 shots). The code is available

*Gagandeep Singh,Samudi Amarsinghe,Urawee Thani,Ki Fung Wong,Priyanka Singh,Xue Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Extends HAMMER model to detect global scene inconsistencies like foreground-background mismatches using a lightweight segmentation-guided scoring pipeline without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HAMMER fails on contextually misplaced subjects in implausible backgrounds due to label-space bias, local attention focus, and spurious text-foreground alignment.

Method: Proposes segmentation-guided scoring (SGS) pipeline using person/face segmentation masks to separate foreground/background, extract embeddings with vision-language model, and compute region-aware coherence scores fused with HAMMER's predictions.

Result: Significantly enhances robustness to global manipulations, improves binary detection, grounding, and token-level explanations with negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: Demonstrates importance of region-aware reasoning in multimodal disinformation detection and provides open-source segmentation/scoring scripts.

Abstract: We extend HAMMER, a state-of-the-art model for multimodal manipulation
detection, to handle global scene inconsistencies such as foreground-background
(FG-BG) mismatch. While HAMMER achieves strong performance on the DGM4 dataset,
it consistently fails when the main subject is contextually misplaced into an
implausible background. We diagnose this limitation as a combination of
label-space bias, local attention focus, and spurious text-foreground
alignment. To remedy this without retraining, we propose a lightweight
segmentation-guided scoring (SGS) pipeline. SGS uses person/face segmentation
masks to separate foreground and background regions, extracts embeddings with a
joint vision-language model, and computes region-aware coherence scores. These
scores are fused with HAMMER's original prediction to improve binary detection,
grounding, and token-level explanations. SGS is inference-only, incurs
negligible computational overhead, and significantly enhances robustness to
global manipulations. This work demonstrates the importance of region-aware
reasoning in multimodal disinformation detection. We release scripts for
segmentation and scoring at https://github.com/Gaganx0/HAMMER-sgs

### [81] [DGM4+: Dataset Extension for Global Scene Inconsistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26047)
*Gagandeep Singh,Samudi Amarsinghe,Priyanka Singh,Xue Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper extends the DGM4 dataset with 5,000 new samples featuring foreground-background mismatches and their hybrids with text manipulations to address global inconsistencies in multimodal disinformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current datasets like DGM4 only cover local manipulations (face swaps, attribute edits, caption changes), leaving a critical gap for global inconsistencies like mismatched foregrounds and backgrounds that are prevalent in real-world forgeries.

Method: Used OpenAI's gpt-image-1 with carefully designed prompts to generate human-centric news-style images where authentic figures are placed into absurd/impossible backdrops. Created captions under three conditions (literal, text attribute, text split) yielding three manipulation categories: FG-BG, FG-BG+TA, and FG-BG+TS. Implemented quality control pipelines for face visibility, deduplication, text scrubbing, and headline realism.

Result: Created DGM4+ dataset extension with 5,000 high-quality samples that introduce foreground-background mismatches and their hybrids with text manipulations, creating a comprehensive benchmark for testing detectors on both local and global reasoning.

Conclusion: The DGM4+ dataset extension addresses the critical gap in global manipulation detection, providing a resource to strengthen evaluation of multimodal models that currently struggle with foreground-background inconsistencies in multimodal disinformation.

Abstract: The rapid advances in generative models have significantly lowered the
barrier to producing convincing multimodal disinformation. Fabricated images
and manipulated captions increasingly co-occur to create persuasive false
narratives. While the Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation
(DGM4) dataset established a foundation for research in this area, it is
restricted to local manipulations such as face swaps, attribute edits, and
caption changes. This leaves a critical gap: global inconsistencies, such as
mismatched foregrounds and backgrounds, which are now prevalent in real-world
forgeries. To address this, we extend DGM4 with 5,000 high-quality samples that
introduce Foreground-Background (FG-BG) mismatches and their hybrids with text
manipulations. Using OpenAI's gpt-image-1 and carefully designed prompts, we
generate human-centric news-style images where authentic figures are placed
into absurd or impossible backdrops (e.g., a teacher calmly addressing students
on the surface of Mars). Captions are produced under three conditions: literal,
text attribute, and text split, yielding three new manipulation categories:
FG-BG, FG-BG+TA, and FG-BG+TS. Quality control pipelines enforce one-to-three
visible faces, perceptual hash deduplication, OCR-based text scrubbing, and
realistic headline length. By introducing global manipulations, our extension
complements existing datasets, creating a benchmark DGM4+ that tests detectors
on both local and global reasoning. This resource is intended to strengthen
evaluation of multimodal models such as HAMMER, which currently struggle with
FG-BG inconsistencies. We release our DGM4+ dataset and generation script at

*Ioana Ciuclea,Giorgio Longari,Alice Barbara Tumpach*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a geometric framework using principal fiber bundles to mod out symmetries in datasets, avoiding data augmentation. It demonstrates the method on object contours with translation, rotation, scaling, and reparameterization symmetries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most computer vision and medical datasets have inherent symmetries that should be accounted for in classification. Current methods rely on data augmentation, which is inefficient. The authors seek a more sustainable alternative that directly incorporates symmetry groups.

Method: The approach uses sections of principal fiber bundles to measure dissimilarities between orbits of objects under symmetry groups. It introduces a 2-parameter family of canonical curve parameterizations and optimizes sections to maximize class separation.

Result: The method successfully handles symmetries including translations, rotations, scalings, and reparameterizations on object contour datasets. The framework provides a geometric foundation for symmetry-aware learning with practical implementation available.

Conclusion: The geometric framework using fiber bundle sections offers an elegant alternative to data augmentation for handling symmetries. The approach has broad applicability across computer vision and medical imaging domains, with open-source code provided for implementation.

Abstract: Most datasets encountered in computer vision and medical applications present
symmetries that should be taken into account in classification tasks. A typical
example is the symmetry by rotation and/or scaling in object detection. A
common way to build neural networks that learn the symmetries is to use data
augmentation. In order to avoid data augmentation and build more sustainable
algorithms, we present an alternative method to mod out symmetries based on the
notion of section of a principal fiber bundle. This framework allows the use of
simple metrics on the space of objects in order to measure dissimilarities
between orbits of objects under the symmetry group. Moreover, the section used
can be optimized to maximize separation of classes. We illustrate this
methodology on a dataset of contours of objects for the groups of translations,
rotations, scalings and reparameterizations. In particular, we present a
$2$-parameter family of canonical parameterizations of curves, containing the
constant-speed parameterization as a special case, which we believe is
interesting in its own right. We hope that this simple application will serve
to convey the geometric concepts underlying this method, which have a wide
range of possible applications. The code is available at the following link:

### [83] [EasyOcc: 3D Pseudo-Label Supervision for Fully Self-Supervised Semantic Occupancy Prediction Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26087)
*Seamie Hayes,Ganesh Sistu,Ciarán Eising*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using foundation models to generate 3D pseudo-ground-truth labels for self-supervised semantic occupancy prediction, achieving significant performance improvements while reducing computational costs compared to traditional methods like novel view synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational costs and memory usage of existing self-supervised methods like novel view synthesis, cross-view rendering, and depth estimation in semantic occupancy prediction.

Method: Generate 3D pseudo-ground-truth labels using foundation models Grounded-SAM and Metric3Dv2, and leverage temporal information for label densification. Also propose a streamlined model EasyOcc that learns solely from these labels without complex rendering strategies.

Result: Substantial performance improvements: mIoU increased by 45% (from 9.73 to 14.09) when integrated into OccNeRF. EasyOcc achieved 13.86 mIoU and 7.71 mIoU on full scene evaluation, outperforming previous best model by 31%.

Conclusion: Foundation models, temporal context, and choice of loss computation space are critical for self-supervised learning in comprehensive scene understanding, offering transferable improvements across architectures.

Abstract: Self-supervised models have recently achieved notable advancements,
particularly in the domain of semantic occupancy prediction. These models
utilize sophisticated loss computation strategies to compensate for the absence
of ground-truth labels. For instance, techniques such as novel view synthesis,
cross-view rendering, and depth estimation have been explored to address the
issue of semantic and depth ambiguity. However, such techniques typically incur
high computational costs and memory usage during the training stage, especially
in the case of novel view synthesis. To mitigate these issues, we propose 3D
pseudo-ground-truth labels generated by the foundation models Grounded-SAM and
Metric3Dv2, and harness temporal information for label densification. Our 3D
pseudo-labels can be easily integrated into existing models, which yields
substantial performance improvements, with mIoU increasing by 45\%, from 9.73
to 14.09, when implemented into the OccNeRF model. This stands in contrast to
earlier advancements in the field, which are often not readily transferable to
other architectures. Additionally, we propose a streamlined model, EasyOcc,
achieving 13.86 mIoU. This model conducts learning solely from our labels,
avoiding complex rendering strategies mentioned previously. Furthermore, our
method enables models to attain state-of-the-art performance when evaluated on
the full scene without applying the camera mask, with EasyOcc achieving 7.71
mIoU, outperforming the previous best model by 31\%. These findings highlight
the critical importance of foundation models, temporal context, and the choice
of loss computation space in self-supervised learning for comprehensive scene
understanding.

TL;DR: A real-time deep learning framework predicts penalty kick direction using RGB frames and pose keypoints, achieving 89% accuracy before ball contact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Penalty kicks are crucial in championships, and goalkeepers need to anticipate kick direction from subtle biomechanical cues within a very short time window.

Method: Dual-branch architecture: MobileNetV2 CNN for RGB frames and LSTM with attention for 2D keypoints. Pose-derived keypoints guide visual focus, with distance-based thresholding for sequence segmentation before ball contact.

Result: 89% accuracy on test set, outperforming visual-only and pose-only baselines by 14-22%. Inference time of 22 milliseconds.

Conclusion: The lightweight and interpretable design is suitable for goalkeeper training, tactical analysis, and real-time game analytics.

Abstract: Penalty kicks often decide championships, yet goalkeepers must anticipate the
kicker's intent from subtle biomechanical cues within a very short time window.
This study introduces a real-time, multi-modal deep learning framework to
predict the direction of a penalty kick (left, middle, or right) before ball
contact. The model uses a dual-branch architecture: a MobileNetV2-based CNN
extracts spatial features from RGB frames, while 2D keypoints are processed by
an LSTM network with attention mechanisms. Pose-derived keypoints further guide
visual focus toward task-relevant regions. A distance-based thresholding method
segments input sequences immediately before ball contact, ensuring consistent
input across diverse footage. A custom dataset of 755 penalty kick events was
created from real match videos, with frame-level annotations for object
detection, shooter keypoints, and final ball placement. The model achieved 89%
accuracy on a held-out test set, outperforming visual-only and pose-only
baselines by 14-22%. With an inference time of 22 milliseconds, the lightweight
and interpretable design makes it suitable for goalkeeper training, tactical
analysis, and real-time game analytics.

TL;DR: Reason-3D is a text-to-scene model that uses large reasoning models to generate 3D environments from text descriptions, addressing limitations in complex geometries and instruction adherence through object retrieval and spatial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-scene methods struggle with complex geometries, object transformations, and weak adherence to complex instructions, limiting their practical application for generating detailed 3D environments.

Method: Integrates object retrieval using captions covering physical, functional, and contextual attributes, places objects based on implicit and explicit layout constraints, and refines positions with collision-aware spatial reasoning powered by large reasoning models.

Result: Significantly outperforms previous methods in human-rated visual fidelity, adherence to constraints, and asset retrieval quality across instructions ranging from simple to complex indoor configurations.

Conclusion: Demonstrates advanced spatial reasoning abilities of modern LRMs and contributes to text-to-scene generation by releasing the codebase to further research in object retrieval and placement with LRMs.

Abstract: Prompt-driven scene synthesis allows users to generate complete 3D
environments from textual descriptions. Current text-to-scene methods often
struggle with complex geometries and object transformations, and tend to show
weak adherence to complex instructions. We address these limitations by
introducing Reason-3D, a text-to-scene model powered by large reasoning models
(LRMs). Reason-3D integrates object retrieval using captions covering physical,
functional, and contextual attributes. Reason-3D then places the selected
objects based on implicit and explicit layout constraints, and refines their
positions with collision-aware spatial reasoning. Evaluated on instructions
ranging from simple to complex indoor configurations, Reason-3D significantly
outperforms previous methods in human-rated visual fidelity, adherence to
constraints, and asset retrieval quality. Beyond its contribution to the field
of text-to-scene generation, our work showcases the advanced spatial reasoning
abilities of modern LRMs. Additionally, we release the codebase to further the
research in object retrieval and placement with LRMs.

### [86] [EVODiff: Entropy-aware Variance Optimized Diffusion Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26096)
*Shigui Li,Wei Chen,Delu Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EVODiff is an entropy-aware variance optimized method for diffusion models that significantly improves inference efficiency and quality by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising, outperforming state-of-the-art solvers like DPM-Solver++.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models suffer from slow inference and training-inference discrepancies, while existing gradient-based solvers lack theoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency.

Method: Proposes an information-theoretic perspective revealing that successful denoising reduces conditional entropy, leading to EVODiff which systematically reduces uncertainty by optimizing conditional variance during denoising.

Result: EVODiff reduces reconstruction error by up to 45.5% (FID improves from 5.10 to 2.78) at 10 NFE on CIFAR-10, cuts NFE cost by 25% on ImageNet-256, and improves text-to-image generation while reducing artifacts.

Conclusion: The information-theoretic approach provides theoretical foundations for diffusion model inference, and EVODiff consistently outperforms SOTA gradient-based solvers in both efficiency and quality.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) excel in image generation, but suffer from slow
inference and the training-inference discrepancies. Although gradient-based
solvers like DPM-Solver accelerate the denoising inference, they lack
theoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency. In this work,
we introduce an information-theoretic perspective on the inference processes of
DMs, revealing that successful denoising fundamentally reduces conditional
entropy in reverse transitions. This principle leads to our key insights into
the inference processes: (1) data prediction parameterization outperforms its
noise counterpart, and (2) optimizing conditional variance offers a
reference-free way to minimize both transition and reconstruction errors. Based
on these insights, we propose an entropy-aware variance optimized method for
the generative process of DMs, called EVODiff, which systematically reduces
uncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising. Extensive
experiments on DMs validate our insights and demonstrate that our method
significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
gradient-based solvers. For example, compared to the DPM-Solver++, EVODiff
reduces the reconstruction error by up to 45.5\% (FID improves from 5.10 to
2.78) at 10 function evaluations (NFE) on CIFAR-10, cuts the NFE cost by 25\%
(from 20 to 15 NFE) for high-quality samples on ImageNet-256, and improves
text-to-image generation while reducing artifacts. Code is available at

*Ruixiao Dong,Zhendong Wang,Keli Liu,Li Li,Ying Chen,Kai Li,Daowen Li,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoGen is a novel feed-forward subject-driven generation framework built on Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) models that achieves comparable quality to diffusion-based methods with significantly faster inference speeds through a dual-path injection strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the trade-off between computationally expensive fine-tuning methods and slow diffusion-based approaches for subject-driven generation, leveraging VAR models' fast sampling speeds and strong generative quality.

Method: Uses a dual-path injection strategy with semantic encoder for high-level identity (via decoupled cross-attention) and content encoder for fine-grained details (via multi-modal attention) to disentangle and preserve subject characteristics.

Result: Achieves subject fidelity and image quality comparable to state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods with significantly lower sampling latency.

Conclusion: EchoGen successfully bridges the gap by making VAR models capable of subject-driven generation, offering an efficient alternative to existing methods without sacrificing quality.

Abstract: Subject-driven generation is a critical task in creative AI; yet current
state-of-the-art methods present a stark trade-off. They either rely on
computationally expensive, per-subject fine-tuning, sacrificing efficiency and
zero-shot capability, or employ feed-forward architectures built on diffusion
models, which are inherently plagued by slow inference speeds. Visual
Auto-Regressive (VAR) models are renowned for their rapid sampling speeds and
strong generative quality, making them an ideal yet underexplored foundation
for resolving this tension. To bridge this gap, we introduce EchoGen, a
pioneering framework that empowers VAR models with subject-driven generation
capabilities. The core design of EchoGen is an effective dual-path injection
strategy that disentangles a subject's high-level semantic identity from its
low-level fine-grained details, enabling enhanced controllability and fidelity.
We employ a semantic encoder to extract the subject's abstract identity, which
is injected through decoupled cross-attention to guide the overall composition.
Concurrently, a content encoder captures intricate visual details, which are
integrated via a multi-modal attention mechanism to ensure high-fidelity
texture and structural preservation. To the best of our knowledge, EchoGen is
the first feed-forward subject-driven framework built upon VAR models. Both
quantitative and qualitative results substantiate our design, demonstrating
that EchoGen achieves subject fidelity and image quality comparable to
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods with significantly lower sampling
latency. Code and models will be released soon.

*Sachith Abeywickrama,Emadeldeen Eldele,Min Wu,Xiaoli Li,Chau Yuen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EntroPE introduces entropy-guided dynamic patching for time series forecasting, preserving temporal coherence while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing patch-based approaches fracture temporal coherence by using arbitrary patch boundaries that disrupt natural transitions and short-term dependencies in time series data.

Method: Uses conditional entropy to dynamically detect transition points and place patch boundaries, with an Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher and Adaptive Patch Encoder that employs pooling and cross-attention to capture intra-patch dependencies.

Result: Experiments show improved accuracy and efficiency across long-term forecasting benchmarks compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: Entropy-guided dynamic patching represents a promising new paradigm for time series modeling that preserves temporal structure while retaining computational benefits.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting,
with patch-based input strategies offering efficiency and improved long-horizon
modeling. Yet, existing approaches rely on temporally-agnostic patch
construction, where arbitrary starting positions and fixed lengths fracture
temporal coherence by splitting natural transitions across boundaries. This
naive segmentation often disrupts short-term dependencies and weakens
representation learning. In response, we propose EntroPE (Entropy-Guided
Dynamic Patch Encoder), a novel, temporally informed framework that dynamically
detects transition points via conditional entropy and dynamically places patch
boundaries. This preserves temporal structure while retaining the computational
benefits of patching. EntroPE consists of two key modules, namely an
Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) that applies information-theoretic criteria
to locate natural temporal shifts and determine patch boundaries, and an
Adaptive Patch Encoder (APE) that employs pooling and cross-attention to
capture intra-patch dependencies and produce fixed-size latent representations.
These embeddings are then processed by a global transformer to model
inter-patch dynamics. Experiments across long-term forecasting benchmarks
demonstrate that EntroPE improves both accuracy and efficiency, establishing
entropy-guided dynamic patching as a promising new paradigm for time series
modeling. Code is available at: https://github.com/Sachithx/EntroPE.

Result: Achieved superior robustness on FishEye8K object detection benchmark, surpassing both naive augmentation and manually engineered prompts.

Conclusion: Establishes scalable framework for automated data curation, shifting from manual effort to targeted synthesis for more reliable and continuously improving AI systems.

Abstract: The performance of deep neural networks is strongly influenced by the quality
of their training data. However, mitigating dataset bias by manually curating
challenging edge cases remains a major bottleneck. To address this, we propose
an automated pipeline for text-guided edge-case synthesis. Our approach employs
a Large Language Model, fine-tuned via preference learning, to rephrase image
captions into diverse textual prompts that steer a Text-to-Image model toward
generating difficult visual scenarios. Evaluated on the FishEye8K object
detection benchmark, our method achieves superior robustness, surpassing both

TL;DR: Human-MME is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on human-centric scene understanding, featuring diverse human scenes, progressive evaluation dimensions, and high-quality annotations across 19,945 image-question pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack comprehensive evaluation for human-centric scene understanding due to the absence of benchmarks that consider both granular human-oriented perception and higher-dimensional causal reasoning, compounded by the physical complexity of human bodies and annotation difficulties.

Method: Created a curated benchmark with: 1) Diverse human scenes across 4 primary visual domains, 15 secondary domains, and 43 sub-fields; 2) Progressive evaluation from granular perception to higher-dimensional reasoning across eight dimensions; 3) Automated annotation pipeline and human-annotation platform for high-quality data.

Result: Extensive experiments on 17 state-of-the-art MLLMs exposed limitations in human-centric understanding. The benchmark extends beyond single-target understanding to multi-person and multi-image mutual understanding through various question types (choice, short-answer, grounding, ranking, judgment).

Conclusion: Human-MME provides a holistic evaluation framework that guides future MLLM research toward better human-centric image understanding, with all data and code publicly available for community use.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances in visual understanding tasks. However, their capacity to comprehend
human-centric scenes has rarely been explored, primarily due to the absence of
comprehensive evaluation benchmarks that take into account both the
human-oriented granular level and higher-dimensional causal reasoning ability.
Such high-quality evaluation benchmarks face tough obstacles, given the
physical complexity of the human body and the difficulty of annotating granular
structures. In this paper, we propose Human-MME, a curated benchmark designed
to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric scene
understanding. Compared with other existing benchmarks, our work provides three
key features: 1. Diversity in human scene, spanning 4 primary visual domains
with 15 secondary domains and 43 sub-fields to ensure broad scenario coverage.
2. Progressive and diverse evaluation dimensions, evaluating the human-based
activities progressively from the human-oriented granular perception to the
higher-dimensional reasoning, consisting of eight dimensions with 19,945
real-world image question pairs and an evaluation suite. 3. High-quality
annotations with rich data paradigms, constructing the automated annotation
pipeline and human-annotation platform, supporting rigorous manual labeling to
facilitate precise and reliable model assessment. Our benchmark extends the
single-target understanding to the multi-person and multi-image mutual
understanding by constructing the choice, short-answer, grounding, ranking and
judgment question components, and complex questions of their combination. The
extensive experiments on 17 state-of-the-art MLLMs effectively expose the
limitations and guide future MLLMs research toward better human-centric image
understanding. All data and code are available at

*Mohammad Khoshkdahan,Arman Akbari,Arash Akbari,Xuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper conducts the first comprehensive fairness evaluation of pedestrian detection models in autonomous driving, focusing on how pedestrian pose variations and joint occlusions affect detection performance across multiple models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While pedestrian detection is critical for autonomous driving safety, fairness concerns related to pedestrian pose variations and occlusions remain underexplored despite being equally important as reducing miss-rates.

Method: Evaluated five pedestrian-specific detectors (F2DNet, MGAN, ALFNet, CSP, Cascade R-CNN) and three YOLOv12 variants on ECP-DP dataset, using Equal Opportunity Difference metric across confidence thresholds and Z-test for statistical significance.

Result: Found biases against pedestrians with parallel legs, straight elbows, and lateral views; lower body joint occlusions have more negative impact than upper body/head occlusions; Cascade R-CNN achieved lowest miss-rate and smallest bias.

Conclusion: This work provides the first pose- and occlusion-aware fairness evaluation in pedestrian detection for autonomous driving, revealing systematic biases that need addressing for equitable safety.

Abstract: Pedestrian detection plays a critical role in autonomous driving (AD), where
ensuring safety and reliability is important. While many detection models aim
to reduce miss-rates and handle challenges such as occlusion and long-range
recognition, fairness remains an underexplored yet equally important concern.
In this work, we systematically investigate how variations in the pedestrian
pose -- including leg status, elbow status, and body orientation -- as well as
individual joint occlusions, affect detection performance. We evaluate five
pedestrian-specific detectors (F2DNet, MGAN, ALFNet, CSP, and Cascade R-CNN)
alongside three general-purpose models (YOLOv12 variants) on the EuroCity
Persons Dense Pose (ECP-DP) dataset. Fairness is quantified using the Equal
Opportunity Difference (EOD) metric across various confidence thresholds. To
assess statistical significance and robustness, we apply the Z-test. Our
findings highlight biases against pedestrians with parallel legs, straight
elbows, and lateral views. Occlusion of lower body joints has a more negative
impact on the detection rate compared to the upper body and head. Cascade R-CNN
achieves the lowest overall miss-rate and exhibits the smallest bias across all
attributes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive pose-
and occlusion-aware fairness evaluation in pedestrian detection for AD.

TL;DR: AttriGen is a framework for automated multi-attribute annotation in cell microscopy, using CNN for cell type classification and Vision Transformer for multi-attribute classification with 94.62% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-attribute classification is underrepresented in cell microscopy compared to traditional cell type categorization, and manual annotation is time-consuming and costly.

Method: Dual-model architecture combining CNN for cell type classification and Vision Transformer for multi-attribute classification, trained on PBC dataset (8 cell types) and WBCAtt dataset (11 morphological attributes).

Result: Achieved 94.62% accuracy in multi-attribute classification, significantly enhancing model interpretability and providing substantial time and cost efficiency over human annotation.

Conclusion: AttriGen establishes a new paradigm for automated multi-attribute labeling that can be extended to other computer vision classification tasks.

Abstract: We introduce AttriGen, a novel framework for automated, fine-grained
multi-attribute annotation in computer vision, with a particular focus on cell
microscopy where multi-attribute classification remains underrepresented
compared to traditional cell type categorization. Using two complementary
datasets: the Peripheral Blood Cell (PBC) dataset containing eight distinct
cell types and the WBC Attribute Dataset (WBCAtt) that contains their
corresponding 11 morphological attributes, we propose a dual-model architecture
that combines a CNN for cell type classification, as well as a Vision
Transformer (ViT) for multi-attribute classification achieving a new benchmark
of 94.62\% accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that AttriGen significantly
enhances model interpretability and offers substantial time and cost efficiency
relative to conventional full-scale human annotation. Thus, our framework
establishes a new paradigm that can be extended to other computer vision
classification tasks by effectively automating the expansion of multi-attribute
labels.

*Chenyang Jiang,Zhengcen Li,Hang Zhao,Qiben Shan,Shaocong Wu,Jingyong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSDD proposes a sparse 2D Gaussian representation for dataset distillation that replaces dense pixel-level approaches with efficient Gaussian primitives, achieving state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational and storage costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional dataset distillation methods use dense pixel-level representations that introduce redundancy and are difficult to scale, creating computational and storage burdens for modern model training.

Method: GSDD encodes critical discriminative information using a small number of 2D Gaussian primitives instead of representing all pixels equally. It adapts CUDA-based splatting operators for parallel inference and training to ensure efficiency and scalability.

Result: GSDD achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet subsets while maintaining highly efficient encoding and decoding costs. The sparse representation improves dataset diversity under the same storage budget.

Conclusion: GSDD provides a simple yet effective, broadly applicable, and highly scalable approach to dataset distillation that outperforms conventional dense representations while being more computationally efficient.

Abstract: Dataset distillation has emerged as a promising paradigm that synthesizes
compact, informative datasets capable of retaining the knowledge of large-scale
counterparts, thereby addressing the substantial computational and storage
burdens of modern model training. Conventional approaches typically rely on
dense pixel-level representations, which introduce redundancy and are difficult
to scale up. In this work, we propose GSDD, a novel and efficient sparse
representation for dataset distillation based on 2D Gaussians. Instead of
representing all pixels equally, GSDD encodes critical discriminative
information in a distilled image using only a small number of Gaussian
primitives. This sparse representation could improve dataset diversity under
the same storage budget, enhancing coverage of difficult samples and boosting
distillation performance. To ensure both efficiency and scalability, we adapt
CUDA-based splatting operators for parallel inference and training, enabling
high-quality rendering with minimal computational and memory overhead. Our
method is simple yet effective, broadly applicable to different distillation
pipelines, and highly scalable. Experiments show that GSDD achieves
state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet subsets,
while remaining highly efficient encoding and decoding cost. Our code is

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework for generating textual explanations for video summarization outcomes using LLaVA-OneVision, and evaluates explanation plausibility by measuring semantic overlap between visual explanations and video summaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for plausible explanations in explainable AI that align with human reasoning and expectations, particularly for video summarization systems.

Method: Extended existing multigranular explanation framework by integrating LLaVA-OneVision to generate natural language descriptions, and proposed plausibility evaluation using semantic overlap between textual descriptions of visual explanations and video summaries with SBERT and SimCSE embeddings.

Result: Conducted experimental study using CA-SUM method on SumMe and TVSum datasets to examine correlation between explanation faithfulness and plausibility, and identify best approaches for generating plausible textual explanations.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the relationship between explanation faithfulness and plausibility, and identifies optimal methods for generating human-aligned textual explanations for video summarization outcomes.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our experimental study on generating plausible
textual explanations for the outcomes of video summarization. For the needs of
this study, we extend an existing framework for multigranular explanation of
video summarization by integrating a SOTA Large Multimodal Model
(LLaVA-OneVision) and prompting it to produce natural language descriptions of
the obtained visual explanations. Following, we focus on one of the most
desired characteristics for explainable AI, the plausibility of the obtained
explanations that relates with their alignment with the humans' reasoning and
expectations. Using the extended framework, we propose an approach for
evaluating the plausibility of visual explanations by quantifying the semantic
overlap between their textual descriptions and the textual descriptions of the
corresponding video summaries, with the help of two methods for creating
sentence embeddings (SBERT, SimCSE). Based on the extended framework and the
proposed plausibility evaluation approach, we conduct an experimental study
using a SOTA method (CA-SUM) and two datasets (SumMe, TVSum) for video
summarization, to examine whether the more faithful explanations are also the
more plausible ones, and identify the most appropriate approach for generating
plausible textual explanations for video summarization.

*Haiyang Zheng,Nan Pu,Wenjing Li,Nicu Sebe,Zhun Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGCE is a framework for Generalized Category Discovery that addresses limitations in existing methods by mining multi-granularity visual concepts and automatically estimating category numbers, achieving state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained recognition benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCD approaches fail to exploit multi-granularity conceptual information and assume known category numbers, which is impractical in real-world open-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes Multi-Granularity Conceptual Experts (MGCE) with two modules: Dynamic Conceptual Contrastive Learning (DCCL) for concept mining and dual-level representation learning, and Multi-Granularity Experts Collaborative Learning (MECL) for cross-expert collaboration using concept alignment matrix.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on nine fine-grained visual recognition benchmarks, with 3.6% average improvement over parametric approaches even without knowing category numbers, particularly excelling in novel-class accuracy.

Conclusion: MGCE effectively addresses key GCD challenges by adaptively mining visual concepts and integrating multi-granularity knowledge, making it suitable for practical open-world settings with automatic category number estimation.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an open-world problem that clusters
unlabeled data by leveraging knowledge from partially labeled categories. A key
challenge is that unlabeled data may contain both known and novel categories.
Existing approaches suffer from two main limitations. First, they fail to
exploit multi-granularity conceptual information in visual data, which limits
representation quality. Second, most assume that the number of unlabeled
categories is known during training, which is impractical in real-world
scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Granularity Conceptual
Experts (MGCE) framework that adaptively mines visual concepts and integrates
multi-granularity knowledge for accurate category discovery. MGCE consists of
two modules: (1) Dynamic Conceptual Contrastive Learning (DCCL), which
alternates between concept mining and dual-level representation learning to
jointly optimize feature learning and category discovery; and (2)
Multi-Granularity Experts Collaborative Learning (MECL), which extends the
single-expert paradigm by introducing additional experts at different
granularities and by employing a concept alignment matrix for effective
cross-expert collaboration. Importantly, MGCE can automatically estimate the
number of categories in unlabeled data, making it suitable for practical
open-world settings. Extensive experiments on nine fine-grained visual
recognition benchmarks demonstrate that MGCE achieves state-of-the-art results,
particularly in novel-class accuracy. Notably, even without prior knowledge of
category numbers, MGCE outperforms parametric approaches that require knowing
the exact number of categories, with an average improvement of 3.6\%. Code is

*Jiayi Guo,Chuanhao Yan,Xingqian Xu,Yulin Wang,Kai Wang,Gao Huang,Humphrey Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IMG is a re-generation-based multimodal alignment framework that uses MLLMs to identify misalignments and an Implicit Aligner to manipulate diffusion features for improved image-prompt alignment without extra data or editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods have limitations: finetuning requires scarce high-quality preference data, while editing-based methods may degrade overall image quality. A scalable, quality-preserving alignment solution is needed.

Method: 1) Use MLLM to detect misalignments between generated images and prompts; 2) Implicit Aligner manipulates diffusion conditioning features; 3) Train with Iteratively Updated Preference Objective for re-alignment.

Result: IMG outperforms existing alignment methods on SDXL, SDXL-DPO, and FLUX in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. It also enhances prior finetuning-based methods as a plug-and-play adapter.

Conclusion: IMG provides an effective, data-efficient solution for multimodal alignment that preserves image quality and can be flexibly integrated with existing diffusion models.

Abstract: Ensuring precise multimodal alignment between diffusion-generated images and
input prompts has been a long-standing challenge. Earlier works finetune
diffusion weight using high-quality preference data, which tends to be limited
and difficult to scale up. Recent editing-based methods further refine local
regions of generated images but may compromise overall image quality. In this
work, we propose Implicit Multimodal Guidance (IMG), a novel
re-generation-based multimodal alignment framework that requires no extra data
or editing operations. Specifically, given a generated image and its prompt,
IMG a) utilizes a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to identify
misalignments; b) introduces an Implicit Aligner that manipulates diffusion
conditioning features to reduce misalignments and enable re-generation; and c)
formulates the re-alignment goal into a trainable objective, namely Iteratively
Updated Preference Objective. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations on SDXL, SDXL-DPO, and FLUX show that IMG outperforms existing
alignment methods. Furthermore, IMG acts as a flexible plug-and-play adapter,
seamlessly enhancing prior finetuning-based alignment methods. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/IMG-Multimodal-Diffusion-Alignment.

TL;DR: Donut-MINT uses mechanistic interpretability to compress Vision-Language Models for document understanding, achieving faster inference and lower memory usage while maintaining performance on DocVQA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models like Donut are effective for document understanding but too costly for real-time or resource-constrained applications, requiring model compression.

Method: Leverages mechanistic interpretability to drive student architecture design through knowledge distillation, identifying essential subcomponents to retain and others to approximate, skip, or reparametrize based on their function.

Result: Produces Donut-MINT, a pruned Donut variant that reduces inference time and memory usage while maintaining strong performance on the DocVQA benchmark.

Conclusion: Reframes compression as circuit discovery, bridging interpretability research and practical Vision-Language Model deployment.

Abstract: Recent advances in Visually-rich Document Understanding rely on large
Vision-Language Models like Donut, which perform document-level Visual Question
Answering without Optical Character Recognition. Despite their effectiveness,
these models are too costly for real-time or resource-constrained applications.
We investigate model compression through knowledge distillation, training
compact student models from a larger teacher. We leverage mechanistic
interpretability to drive student architecture design within this framework. By
analyzing internal computations, we identify essential subcomponents to retain,
while having a clear view of which subcomponents should be approximated,
skipped, or reparametrized based on their function. This approach yields
Donut-MINT (Mechanistic Interpretability-based Network Trimming), a pruned
Donut variant that reduces inference time and memory usage while maintaining
strong performance on DocVQA, a standard benchmark for document Visual Question
Answering. Our method reframes compression as circuit discovery, bridging
interpretability research and practical Vision-Language Model deployment.

TL;DR: Farsighted-LAM improves Latent Action Models (LAMs) by addressing spatial understanding and temporal perception limitations through geometry-aware spatial encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling, leading to enhanced VLA system performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LAMs suffer from poor spatial understanding due to end-to-end trained image encoders and limited temporal perception when input frames are distant, hindering stable action modeling.

Method: Proposed Farsighted-LAM with geometry-aware spatial encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling, and SSM-VLA framework integrating structured perception with visual Chain-of-Thought module for explicit reasoning about environmental dynamics.

Result: SSM-VLA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple VLA tasks in both simulation and real-world settings, demonstrating enhanced robustness and generalizability.

Conclusion: Combining geometry-aware modeling, temporal coherence, and explicit reasoning effectively enhances the robustness and generalizability of embodied intelligence in VLA systems.

Abstract: Latent Action Models (LAMs) enable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems to
learn semantic action representations from large-scale unannotated data. Yet,
we identify two bottlenecks of LAMs: 1) the commonly adopted end-to-end trained
image encoder suffers from poor spatial understanding; 2) LAMs can be fragile
when input frames are distant, leading to limited temporal perception. Such
factors inevitably hinder stable and clear action modeling. To this end, we
propose Farsighted-LAM, a latent action framework with geometry-aware spatial
encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling, capturing structural priors and
dynamic motion patterns from consecutive frames. We further propose SSM-VLA, an
end-to-end VLA framework built upon Farsighted-LAM, which integrates structured
perception with a visual Chain-of-Thought module to explicitly reason about
environmental dynamics, enhancing decision consistency and interpretability. We
validate SSM-VLA on multiple VLA tasks in both simulation and real-world
settings, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our results demonstrate
that our strategy of combining geometry-aware modeling, temporal coherence, and
explicit reasoning is effective in enhancing the robustness and
generalizability of embodied intelligence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PRPO, a reinforcement learning method that improves deepfake detection by aligning LLM reasoning with visual evidence at paragraph level, achieving 4.55/5.0 reasoning score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake detection faces challenges due to limited datasets and poor performance of multimodal LLMs, which often produce misaligned or hallucinatory explanations despite strong reasoning capabilities.

Method: Proposed Paragraph-level Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a reinforcement learning algorithm that aligns LLM reasoning with image content at paragraph level, and created a reasoning-annotated dataset for deepfake detection.

Result: PRPO significantly improves detection accuracy and achieves the highest reasoning score of 4.55/5.0, outperforming GRPO in ablation studies under test-time conditions.

Conclusion: Grounding multimodal reasoning in visual evidence is crucial for reliable and interpretable deepfake detection, as demonstrated by PRPO's effectiveness.

Abstract: The rapid rise of synthetic media has made deepfake detection a critical
challenge for online safety and trust. Progress remains constrained by the
scarcity of large, high-quality datasets. Although multimodal large language
models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their performance on
deepfake detection is poor, often producing explanations that are misaligned
with visual evidence or hallucinatory. To address this limitation, we introduce
a reasoning-annotated dataset for deepfake detection and propose
Paragraph-level Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a reinforcement learning
algorithm that aligns LLM reasoning with image content at the paragraph level.
Experiments show that PRPO improves detection accuracy by a wide margin and
achieves the highest reasoning score of 4.55/5.0. Ablation studies further
demonstrate that PRPO significantly outperforms GRPO under test-time
conditions. These results underscore the importance of grounding multimodal
reasoning in visual evidence to enable more reliable and interpretable deepfake
detection.

*Ali Zoljodi,Radu Timofte,Masoud Daneshtalab*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Cluster-based Affine Transformation (CAT) for low-bit post-training quantization, using cluster-specific parameters to reduce quantization errors without fine-tuning, achieving significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard affine transformation in PTQ worsens results under low-bit quantization (e.g., 2-bit) by applying uniform parameters across all outputs, leading to accuracy degradation.

Method: CAT employs cluster-specific affine parameters to align low-bit quantized outputs with full-precision counterparts, requiring minimal additional parameters and no fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves up to 53.18% Top-1 accuracy on W2A2 ResNet-18, consistently outperforms prior PTQ methods across architectures, and enhances existing baselines by over 3% when used as plug-in.

Conclusion: CAT effectively addresses low-bit PTQ accuracy issues through cluster-based affine transformation, providing a cost-efficient solution without requiring model retraining.

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) reduces the memory footprint and
computational overhead of deep neural networks by converting full-precision
(FP) values into quantized and compressed data types. While PTQ is more
cost-efficient than Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), it is highly susceptible
to accuracy degradation under a low-bit quantization (LQ) regime (e.g., 2-bit).
Affine transformation is a classical technique used to reduce the discrepancy
between the information processed by a quantized model and that processed by
its full-precision counterpart; however, we find that using plain affine
transformation, which applies a uniform affine parameter set for all outputs,
worsens the results in low-bit PTQ. To address this, we propose Cluster-based
Affine Transformation (CAT), an error-reduction framework that employs
cluster-specific parameters to align LQ outputs with FP counterparts. CAT
refines LQ outputs with only a negligible number of additional parameters,
without requiring fine-tuning of the model or quantization parameters. We
further introduce a novel PTQ framework integrated with CAT. Experiments on
ImageNet-1K show that this framework consistently outperforms prior PTQ methods
across diverse architectures and LQ settings, achieving up to 53.18% Top-1
accuracy on W2A2 ResNet-18. Moreover, CAT enhances existing PTQ baselines by
more than 3% when used as a plug-in. We plan to release our implementation
alongside the publication of this paper.

Motivation: Existing skill proficiency estimation methods rely on black-box video classifiers that ignore multi-view context and lack explainability, limiting their practical utility and transparency.

Method: ProfVLM uses an AttentiveGatedProjector to dynamically fuse multi-view features from a frozen TimeSformer backbone into a language model tuned for feedback generation, reformulating skill assessment as generative reasoning.

Conclusion: Generative vision-language modeling represents a powerful new direction for skill assessment, offering both accurate proficiency estimation and transparent reasoning through natural language feedback.

Abstract: Existing approaches to skill proficiency estimation often rely on black-box
video classifiers, ignoring multi-view context and lacking explainability. We
present ProfVLM, a compact vision-language model that reformulates this task as

AttentiveGatedProjector that dynamically fuses multi-view features, projected
from a frozen TimeSformer backbone into a language model tuned for feedback
generation. Trained on EgoExo4D with expert commentaries, ProfVLM surpasses
state-of-the-art methods while using up to 20x fewer parameters and reducing

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Point2RBox-v3 is a weakly-supervised oriented object detection method that uses point annotations to address inefficient pseudo label utilization and poor quality in existing methods through progressive label assignment and prior-guided dynamic mask loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing point-supervised methods which suffer from inefficient utilization and poor quality of pseudo labels, while reducing the need for costly manual labeling in oriented object detection.

Method: Uses two key principles: 1) Progressive Label Assignment (PLA) that dynamically estimates instance sizes at different training stages, and 2) Prior-Guided Dynamic Mask Loss (PGDM-Loss) that enhances Voronoi Watershed Loss by combining SAM model advantages with watershed algorithm to handle both sparse and dense scenes.

Result: Achieves competitive performance across multiple datasets: 66.09% on DOTA-v1.0, 56.86% on DOTA-v1.5, 41.28% on DOTA-v2.0, 46.40% on DIOR, 19.60% on STAR, and 45.96% on RSAR, particularly excelling in scenarios with large object size variations or sparse object occurrences.

Conclusion: Point2RBox-v3 is the first model to employ dynamic pseudo labels for label assignment and creatively combines SAM model with watershed algorithm, achieving excellent performance in both sparse and dense scenes for oriented object detection.

Abstract: Driven by the growing need for Oriented Object Detection (OOD), learning from
point annotations under a weakly-supervised framework has emerged as a
promising alternative to costly and laborious manual labeling. In this paper,
we discuss two deficiencies in existing point-supervised methods: inefficient
utilization and poor quality of pseudo labels. Therefore, we present
Point2RBox-v3. At the core are two principles: 1) Progressive Label Assignment
(PLA). It dynamically estimates instance sizes in a coarse yet intelligent
manner at different stages of the training process, enabling the use of label
assignment methods. 2) Prior-Guided Dynamic Mask Loss (PGDM-Loss). It is an
enhancement of the Voronoi Watershed Loss from Point2RBox-v2, which overcomes
the shortcomings of Watershed in its poor performance in sparse scenes and
SAM's poor performance in dense scenes. To our knowledge, Point2RBox-v3 is the
first model to employ dynamic pseudo labels for label assignment, and it
creatively complements the advantages of SAM model with the watershed
algorithm, which achieves excellent performance in both sparse and dense
scenes. Our solution gives competitive performance, especially in scenarios
with large variations in object size or sparse object occurrences:
66.09%/56.86%/41.28%/46.40%/19.60%/45.96% on
DOTA-v1.0/DOTA-v1.5/DOTA-v2.0/DIOR/STAR/RSAR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flower is a solver for inverse problems that uses pre-trained flow models to generate reconstructions consistent with measurements through a three-step iterative process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a unified approach that bridges plug-and-play methods and generative inverse solvers while providing theoretical guarantees for Bayesian posterior sampling approximation.

Method: Three-step iterative procedure: (1) flow-consistent destination estimation using velocity network, (2) refinement via projection onto forward operator feasible set, (3) time-progression re-projection along flow trajectory.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across various inverse problems with nearly identical hyperparameters.

Conclusion: Flower successfully unifies perspectives from different inverse problem solving approaches while providing theoretical foundation and practical performance improvements.

Abstract: We introduce Flower, a solver for inverse problems. It leverages a
pre-trained flow model to produce reconstructions that are consistent with the
observed measurements. Flower operates through an iterative procedure over
three steps: (i) a flow-consistent destination estimation, where the velocity
network predicts a denoised target; (ii) a refinement step that projects the
estimated destination onto a feasible set defined by the forward operator; and
(iii) a time-progression step that re-projects the refined destination along
the flow trajectory. We provide a theoretical analysis that demonstrates how
Flower approximates Bayesian posterior sampling, thereby unifying perspectives
from plug-and-play methods and generative inverse solvers. On the practical
side, Flower achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality while using
nearly identical hyperparameters across various inverse problems.

*Alexander Becker,Julius Erbach,Dominik Narnhofer,Konrad Schindler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Video Fourier Field (VFF), a continuous spatio-temporal representation for video super-resolution that enables flexible sampling, captures fine details and smooth motion, and prevents aliasing through analytical point spread functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods decouple spatial and temporal components and rely on brittle explicit frame warping for motion compensation, which limits performance and consistency.

Method: Encodes video as continuous 3D Video Fourier Field using sinusoidal basis coefficients predicted by neural encoder with large receptive field, conditioned on low-resolution input.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art across multiple benchmarks, delivering sharper and more temporally consistent reconstructions across wide range of upscaling factors while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: Joint spatio-temporal modeling through continuous Fourier field representation substantially improves both spatial and temporal super-resolution performance.

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation for continuous space-time video
super-resolution. Instead of decoupling the representation of a video sequence
into separate spatial and temporal components and relying on brittle, explicit
frame warping for motion compensation, we encode video as a continuous,
spatio-temporally coherent 3D Video Fourier Field (VFF). That representation
offers three key advantages: (1) it enables cheap, flexible sampling at
arbitrary locations in space and time; (2) it is able to simultaneously capture
fine spatial detail and smooth temporal dynamics; and (3) it offers the
possibility to include an analytical, Gaussian point spread function in the
sampling to ensure aliasing-free reconstruction at arbitrary scale. The
coefficients of the proposed, Fourier-like sinusoidal basis are predicted with
a neural encoder with a large spatio-temporal receptive field, conditioned on
the low-resolution input video. Through extensive experiments, we show that our
joint modeling substantially improves both spatial and temporal
super-resolution and sets a new state of the art for multiple benchmarks:

### [106] [SQUARE: Semantic Query-Augmented Fusion and Efficient Batch Reranking for Training-free Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26330)
*Ren-Di Wu,Yu-Yen Lin,Huei-Fang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SQUARE is a training-free zero-shot composed image retrieval framework that uses MLLMs in two stages: semantic query augmentation for better intent capture and efficient batch reranking for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training-free zero-shot CIR approaches are desirable but struggle to accurately capture user intent when combining reference images with textual modifications.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Semantic Query-Augmented Fusion (SQAF) enriches CLIP embeddings with MLLM-generated target captions, 2) Efficient Batch Reranking (EBR) uses MLLM to jointly reason across top candidates presented as an image grid.

Result: SQUARE achieves strong performance on four standard CIR benchmarks and maintains high performance even with lightweight pre-trained models.

Conclusion: SQUARE demonstrates that training-free zero-shot CIR can be effectively enhanced through MLLM-based semantic guidance and efficient batch reranking, offering a simple yet powerful approach.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images that preserve
the visual content of a reference image while incorporating user-specified
textual modifications. Training-free zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) approaches, which
require no task-specific training or labeled data, are highly desirable, yet
accurately capturing user intent remains challenging. In this paper, we present
SQUARE, a novel two-stage training-free framework that leverages Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance ZS-CIR. In the Semantic
Query-Augmented Fusion (SQAF) stage, we enrich the query embedding derived from
a vision-language model (VLM) such as CLIP with MLLM-generated captions of the
target image. These captions provide high-level semantic guidance, enabling the
query to better capture the user's intent and improve global retrieval quality.
In the Efficient Batch Reranking (EBR) stage, top-ranked candidates are
presented as an image grid with visual marks to the MLLM, which performs joint
visual-semantic reasoning across all candidates. Our reranking strategy
operates in a single pass and yields more accurate rankings. Experiments show
that SQUARE, with its simplicity and effectiveness, delivers strong performance
on four standard CIR benchmarks. Notably, it maintains high performance even
with lightweight pre-trained, demonstrating its potential applicability.

*Keming Wu,Sicong Jiang,Max Ku,Ping Nie,Minghao Liu,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces \mname, a reward model trained on a large-scale human preference dataset for instruction-guided image editing, which achieves state-of-the-art performance and enables better training data selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-source image editing models lag behind closed-source ones due to the lack of reliable reward models for scaling high-quality synthetic training data.

Method: Built \mname using a new large-scale human preference dataset with over 200K preference pairs annotated by trained experts following a rigorous protocol.

Result: \mname achieves state-of-the-art human correlation on multiple benchmarks and successfully selects high-quality data that improves model training when used to filter ShareGPT-4o-Image dataset.

Conclusion: \mname effectively addresses the bottleneck in open-source image editing by providing a reliable reward model for data scaling and shows potential for advanced applications like reinforcement learning-based training.

Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed great progress in image editing with natural
language instructions. Several closed-source models like GPT-Image-1, Seedream,
and Google-Nano-Banana have shown highly promising progress. However, the
open-source models are still lagging. The main bottleneck is the lack of a
reliable reward model to scale up high-quality synthetic training data. To
address this critical bottleneck, we built \mname, trained with our new
large-scale human preference dataset, meticulously annotated by trained experts
following a rigorous protocol containing over 200K preference pairs. \mname
demonstrates superior alignment with human preferences in instruction-guided
image editing tasks. Experiments show that \mname achieves state-of-the-art
human correlation on established benchmarks such as GenAI-Bench, AURORA-Bench,
ImagenHub, and our new \benchname, outperforming a wide range of VLM-as-judge
models. Furthermore, we use \mname to select a high-quality subset from the
existing noisy ShareGPT-4o-Image dataset. We train Step1X-Edit on the selected
subset, which shows significant improvement over training on the full set. This
demonstrates \mname's ability to serve as a reward model to scale up
high-quality training data for image editing. Furthermore, its strong alignment
suggests potential for advanced applications like reinforcement learning-based
post-training and test-time scaling of image editing models. \mname with its
training dataset will be released to help the community build more high-quality
image editing training datasets.

*Xiangrui Liu,Minghao Qin,Yan Shu,Zhengyang Liang,Yang Tian,Chen Jason Zhang,Bo Zhao,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Task-oriented Temporal Grounding (ToTG) to localize key time intervals in long videos based on task descriptions, presents ToTG Bench benchmark, and proposes TimeScope framework with progressive reasoning that outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying key moments in long videos is essential for downstream understanding and reasoning tasks, but traditional approaches have limited generalizability and difficulty handling long videos.

Method: Proposed TimeScope framework with progressive reasoning: first identifies coarse-grained temporal scope in long videos, then refines through fine-grained moment partitioning. Also curated ToTG Pile dataset to enhance progressive temporal grounding.

Result: Extensive experiments show TimeScope consistently outperforms both existing temporal-grounding methods and popular MLLMs across various settings.

Conclusion: TimeScope is effective in addressing the challenging ToTG problem, highlighting its superiority over traditional approaches for temporal grounding in long videos.

Abstract: Identifying key moments in long videos is essential for downstream
understanding and reasoning tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new problem,
Taskoriented Temporal Grounding ToTG, which aims to localize time intervals
containing the necessary information based on a task's natural description.
Along with the definition, we also present ToTG Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating the performance on ToTG. ToTG is particularly
challenging for traditional approaches due to their limited generalizability
and difficulty in handling long videos. To address these challenges, we propose
TimeScope, a novel framework built upon progressive reasoning. TimeScope first
identifies a coarse-grained temporal scope in the long video that likely
contains the key moments, and then refines this scope through finegrained
moment partitioning. Additionally, we curate a highquality dataset, namely ToTG
Pile, to enhance TimeScope's ability to perform progressive temporal grounding
effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeScope consistently
outperforms both existing temporalgrounding methods and popular MLLMs across
various settings, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing this new
challenging problem.

*Harold Haodong Chen,Xianfeng Wu,Wen-Jie Shu,Rongjin Guo,Disen Lan,Harry Yang,Ying-Cong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScalingAR is the first test-time scaling framework for next-token prediction autoregressive image generation that uses token entropy to improve performance without early decoding or external rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time scaling approaches for visual autoregressive models rely on frequent partial decoding and external reward models, which are unsuitable for next-token prediction-based image generation due to incomplete intermediate results.

Method: ScalingAR uses token entropy as a novel signal in visual token generation with two scaling levels: Profile Level (streams calibrated confidence state by fusing intrinsic and conditional signals) and Policy Level (adaptively terminates low-confidence trajectories and dynamically schedules guidance for phase-appropriate conditioning strength).

Result: ScalingAR improves base models by 12.5% on GenEval and 15.2% on TIIF-Bench, reduces visual token consumption by 62.0% while outperforming baselines, and enhances robustness by mitigating performance drops by 26.0% in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: ScalingAR successfully bridges the gap in test-time scaling for next-token prediction autoregressive image generation, demonstrating significant performance improvements and efficiency gains without requiring early decoding or auxiliary rewards.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
large language models, yet its application to next-token prediction (NTP)
autoregressive (AR) image generation remains largely uncharted. Existing TTS
approaches for visual AR (VAR), which rely on frequent partial decoding and
external reward models, are ill-suited for NTP-based image generation due to
the inherent incompleteness of intermediate decoding results. To bridge this
gap, we introduce ScalingAR, the first TTS framework specifically designed for
NTP-based AR image generation that eliminates the need for early decoding or
auxiliary rewards. ScalingAR leverages token entropy as a novel signal in
visual token generation and operates at two complementary scaling levels: (i)
Profile Level, which streams a calibrated confidence state by fusing intrinsic
and conditional signals; and (ii) Policy Level, which utilizes this state to
adaptively terminate low-confidence trajectories and dynamically schedule
guidance for phase-appropriate conditioning strength. Experiments on both
general and compositional benchmarks show that ScalingAR (1) improves base
models by 12.5% on GenEval and 15.2% on TIIF-Bench, (2) efficiently reduces
visual token consumption by 62.0% while outperforming baselines, and (3)
successfully enhances robustness, mitigating performance drops by 26.0% in
challenging scenarios.

### [110] [PANDA: Towards Generalist Video Anomaly Detection via Agentic AI Engineer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26386)
*Zhiwei Yang,Chen Gao,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PANDA is a generalist video anomaly detection system using MLLMs that automatically handles any scene and anomaly types without training data or manual adjustments through four key capabilities: self-adaptive strategy planning, goal-driven reasoning, tool-augmented self-reflection, and self-improving memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VAD methods require domain-specific training data and manual adjustments for new scenarios, leading to high labor costs and limited generalization. The goal is to create a generalist system that can automatically handle any scene and anomaly types without training or human involvement.

Method: PANDA uses MLLMs with four key capabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware RAG for anomaly-specific knowledge retrieval and strategy planning, (2) latent anomaly-guided heuristic prompting for precise reasoning, (3) progressive reflection with context-aware tools for iterative decision refinement, and (4) chain-of-memory mechanism for leveraging historical experiences.

Result: Extensive experiments show PANDA achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex scenario settings without training and manual involvement, demonstrating generalizable and robust anomaly detection capability.

Conclusion: PANDA successfully addresses the limitations of traditional VAD methods by providing a generalist approach that automatically handles diverse scenarios and anomaly types without requiring training data or manual adjustments, validated through comprehensive experimental results.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a critical yet challenging task due to the
complex and diverse nature of real-world scenarios. Previous methods typically
rely on domain-specific training data and manual adjustments when applying to
new scenarios and unseen anomaly types, suffering from high labor costs and
limited generalization. Therefore, we aim to achieve generalist VAD, i.e.,
automatically handle any scene and any anomaly types without training data or
human involvement. In this work, we propose PANDA, an agentic AI engineer based
on MLLMs. Specifically, we achieve PANDA by comprehensively devising four key
capabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning, (2) goal-driven
heuristic reasoning, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection, and (4) self-improving
chain-of-memory. Concretely, we develop a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG
mechanism, enabling PANDA to retrieve anomaly-specific knowledge for anomaly
detection strategy planning. Next, we introduce a latent anomaly-guided
heuristic prompt strategy to enhance reasoning precision. Furthermore, PANDA
employs a progressive reflection mechanism alongside a suite of context-aware
tools to iteratively refine decision-making in complex scenarios. Finally, a
chain-of-memory mechanism enables PANDA to leverage historical experiences for
continual performance improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PANDA
achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex
scenario settings without training and manual involvement, validating its
generalizable and robust anomaly detection capability. Code is released at

*Chenhui Zhu,Yilu Wu,Shuai Wang,Gangshan Wu,Limin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MotionRAG is a retrieval-augmented framework that enhances video generation realism by adapting motion priors from reference videos through Context-Aware Motion Adaptation (CAMA), achieving significant improvements across domains with minimal inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image-to-video generation struggles with realistic motion due to the complexity of modeling physical constraints, object interactions, and domain-specific dynamics that don't generalize well across scenarios.

Method: Uses a retrieval-based pipeline with video encoder and resamplers to extract motion features, in-context learning via causal transformer for motion adaptation, and attention-based motion injection adapter to integrate motion into pretrained video diffusion models.

Result: Achieves significant improvements across multiple domains and various base models with negligible computational overhead during inference, and enables zero-shot generalization to new domains by updating the retrieval database.

Conclusion: The framework enhances video generation systems by enabling effective retrieval and transfer of motion priors, facilitating realistic motion dynamics synthesis through a modular design that requires no retraining for new domains.

Abstract: Image-to-video generation has made remarkable progress with the advancements
in diffusion models, yet generating videos with realistic motion remains highly
challenging. This difficulty arises from the complexity of accurately modeling
motion, which involves capturing physical constraints, object interactions, and
domain-specific dynamics that are not easily generalized across diverse
scenarios. To address this, we propose MotionRAG, a retrieval-augmented
framework that enhances motion realism by adapting motion priors from relevant
reference videos through Context-Aware Motion Adaptation (CAMA). The key
technical innovations include: (i) a retrieval-based pipeline extracting
high-level motion features using video encoder and specialized resamplers to
distill semantic motion representations; (ii) an in-context learning approach
for motion adaptation implemented through a causal transformer architecture;
(iii) an attention-based motion injection adapter that seamlessly integrates
transferred motion features into pretrained video diffusion models. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements
across multiple domains and various base models, all with negligible
computational overhead during inference. Furthermore, our modular design
enables zero-shot generalization to new domains by simply updating the
retrieval database without retraining any components. This research enhances
the core capability of video generation systems by enabling the effective
retrieval and transfer of motion priors, facilitating the synthesis of
realistic motion dynamics.

*Atakan Topaloglu,Ahmet Bilican,Cansu Korkmaz,A. Murat Tekalp*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes difficulty-aware evaluation methods for image super-resolution models using two image-difficulty measures to better differentiate models that produce visually different results despite similar average scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods using average scores fail to reflect model performance on images of varying difficulty and don't capture artifacts on difficult images, making it hard to distinguish between models with close average performance.

Method: Proposes two image-difficulty measures (high-frequency index and rotation-invariant edge index) to predict test images where models yield significantly different visual results, and an evaluation method that reflects these visual differences in objective measures.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed image-difficulty measures and evaluation methodology in better differentiating SISR models.

Conclusion: The difficulty-aware performance evaluation procedures provide better differentiation between super-resolution models than traditional average score methods, especially for images where models produce visually different results.

Abstract: Image super-resolution models are commonly evaluated by average scores (over
some benchmark test sets), which fail to reflect the performance of these
models on images of varying difficulty and that some models generate artifacts
on certain difficult images, which is not reflected by the average scores. We
propose difficulty-aware performance evaluation procedures to better
differentiate between SISR models that produce visually different results on
some images but yield close average performance scores over the entire test
set. In particular, we propose two image-difficulty measures, the
high-frequency index and rotation-invariant edge index, to predict those test
images, where a model would yield significantly better visual results over
another model, and an evaluation method where these visual differences are
reflected on objective measures. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed image-difficulty measures and evaluation
methodology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM is a progressive three-stage framework for image deraining that combines multi-scale feature aggregation with hybrid attention and state-space modeling to achieve fine-grained recovery while maintaining global consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current single-scale image deraining models struggle with fine-grained recovery and global consistency, limiting their effectiveness for critical vision tasks like autonomous driving.

Method: Progressive three-stage framework: 1) Coarse Extraction Network (CENet) using Hybrid Attention UNet for multi-scale feature aggregation, 2) Frequency Fusion Network (SFNet) with Hybrid Domain Mamba for joint spatial and wavelet domain modeling, 3) Refine Network (RNet) for fine-grained structure recovery via original-resolution subnetwork.

Result: The method achieves competitive results on multiple datasets against recent deraining methods, learning high-frequency rain characteristics while preserving structural details and maintaining global context.

Conclusion: PRISM provides an effective progressive framework for image deraining that addresses the limitations of single-scale models through integrated multi-scale processing and hybrid domain modeling.

Abstract: Image deraining is an essential vision technique that removes rain streaks
and water droplets, enhancing clarity for critical vision tasks like autonomous
driving. However, current single-scale models struggle with fine-grained
recovery and global consistency. To address this challenge, we propose
Progressive Rain removal with Integrated State-space Modeling (PRISM), a
progressive three-stage framework: Coarse Extraction Network (CENet), Frequency
Fusion Network (SFNet), and Refine Network (RNet). Specifically, CENet and
SFNet utilize a novel Hybrid Attention UNet (HA-UNet) for multi-scale feature
aggregation by combining channel attention with windowed spatial transformers.
Moreover, we propose Hybrid Domain Mamba (HDMamba) for SFNet to jointly model
spatial semantics and wavelet domain characteristics. Finally, RNet recovers
the fine-grained structures via an original-resolution subnetwork. Our model
learns high-frequency rain characteristics while preserving structural details
and maintaining global context, leading to improved image quality. Our method
achieves competitive results on multiple datasets against recent deraining
methods.

*Donghoon Kim,Dongyoung Lee,Ik Joon Chang,Sung-Ho Bae*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuaRTZ enables 4-bit quantization for diffusion models by handling outliers with 8-bit quantization and preserving fine textures through leading-zero suppression, achieving better performance than methods requiring FP16 branches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have high computational requirements that hinder deployment. While 8-bit quantization works well, extending to 4 bits is challenging due to amplified rounding errors that destroy fine textures in dense, low-magnitude activations.

Method: QuaRTZ combines 8-bit min-max quantization for outlier handling with 4-bit compression via leading-zero suppression to retain least significant bits (LSBs), balancing outlier preservation and LSB precision to reduce rounding errors.

Result: QuaRTZ achieves FID of 6.98 on FLUX.1-schnell with 4-bit quantization, outperforming SVDQuant which requires auxiliary FP16 branches, and demonstrates generalizability across diverse activation distributions.

Conclusion: The proposed QuaRTZ method successfully enables 4-bit post-training quantization for diffusion models by addressing both outlier and small activation challenges, providing a practical solution for efficient deployment without sacrificing texture quality.

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but face deployment
challenges due to their high computational requirements. Although 8-bit
outlier-aware post-training quantization (PTQ) matches full-precision
performance, extending PTQ to 4 bits remains challenging. Larger step sizes in
4-bit quantization amplify rounding errors in dense, low-magnitude activations,
leading to the loss of fine-grained textures. We hypothesize that not only
outliers but also small activations are critical for texture fidelity. To this
end, we propose Quantization via Residual Truncation and Zero Suppression
(QuaRTZ), a 4-bit PTQ scheme for diffusion models. QuaRTZ applies 8-bit min-max
quantization for outlier handling and compresses to 4 bits via leading-zero
suppression to retain LSBs, thereby preserving texture details. Our approach
reduces rounding errors and improves quantization efficiency by balancing
outlier preservation and LSB precision. Both theoretical derivations and
empirical evaluations demonstrate the generalizability of QuaRTZ across diverse
activation distributions. Notably, 4-bit QuaRTZ achieves an FID of 6.98 on
FLUX.1-schnell, outperforming SVDQuant that requires auxiliary FP16 branches.

TL;DR: AVI is an end-to-end multi-view perception system that uses 11 synchronized cameras and specialized deep learning modules to perform variant-aware quality control and defect detection on vehicles in real time, achieving 93% verification accuracy and 86% defect-detection recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring every vehicle leaving production lines meets correct variant specifications and is free from visible defects is increasingly complex, requiring automated inspection systems that can handle multiple vehicle models and detect various types of defects.

Method: Uses 11 synchronized cameras for 360° coverage, specialized modules (YOLOv8 for part detection, EfficientNet for ICE/EV classification, Gemini-1.5 Flash for mascot OCR, YOLOv8-Seg for scratch-and-dent segmentation), view-aware fusion layer, and VIN-conditioned rule engine for real-time comparison against expected specifications.

Result: Achieves 93% verification accuracy, 86% defect-detection recall, and sustains 3.3 vehicles per minute on mixed OEM vehicle datasets, significantly outperforming single-view or no segmentation baselines.

Conclusion: AVI is the first publicly reported system that unifies multi-camera feature validation with defect detection in a deployable automotive industry setting, providing real-time, interpretable quality control reports in approximately 300ms.

Abstract: Ensuring that every vehicle leaving a modern production line is built to the
correct \emph{variant} specification and is free from visible defects is an
increasingly complex challenge. We present the \textbf{Automated Vehicle
Inspection (AVI)} platform, an end-to-end, \emph{multi-view} perception system
that couples deep-learning detectors with a semantic rule engine to deliver
\emph{variant-aware} quality control in real time. Eleven synchronized cameras
capture a full 360{\deg} sweep of each vehicle; task-specific views are then
routed to specialised modules: YOLOv8 for part detection, EfficientNet for
ICE/EV classification, Gemini-1.5 Flash for mascot OCR, and YOLOv8-Seg for
scratch-and-dent segmentation. A view-aware fusion layer standardises evidence,
while a VIN-conditioned rule engine compares detected features against the
expected manifest, producing an interpretable pass/fail report in \(\approx\!
300\,\text{ms}\). On a mixed data set of Original Equipment Manufacturer(OEM)
vehicle data sets of four distinct models plus public scratch/dent images, AVI
achieves \textbf{ 93 \%} verification accuracy, \textbf{86 \%} defect-detection
recall, and sustains \(\mathbf{3.3}\) vehicles/min, surpassing single-view or
no segmentation baselines by large margins. To our knowledge, this is the first
publicly reported system that unifies multi-camera feature validation with
defect detection in a deployable automotive setting in industry.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stylos is a single-forward 3D Gaussian framework for 3D style transfer that works on unposed content from single images or multi-view collections, using reference style images to generate stylized 3D scenes without per-scene optimization or precomputed poses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable geometry-aware, view-consistent 3D stylization that generalizes across categories, scenes, and styles, while eliminating the need for per-scene optimization or precomputed poses.

Method: Uses a Transformer backbone with dual pathways: geometry predictions with self-attention for geometric fidelity, and style injection via global cross-attention for visual consistency. Incorporates a voxel-based 3D style loss to align scene features with style statistics.

Result: Experiments show high-quality zero-shot stylization across multiple datasets, demonstrating effective global style-content coupling and scalability from single view to large-scale multi-view settings.

Conclusion: Stylos successfully achieves view-consistent 3D stylization while preserving geometry through its novel architecture and 3D style loss, offering a scalable solution for 3D style transfer.

Abstract: We present Stylos, a single-forward 3D Gaussian framework for 3D style
transfer that operates on unposed content, from a single image to a multi-view
collection, conditioned on a separate reference style image. Stylos synthesizes
a stylized 3D Gaussian scene without per-scene optimization or precomputed
poses, achieving geometry-aware, view-consistent stylization that generalizes
to unseen categories, scenes, and styles. At its core, Stylos adopts a
Transformer backbone with two pathways: geometry predictions retain
self-attention to preserve geometric fidelity, while style is injected via
global cross-attention to enforce visual consistency across views. With the
addition of a voxel-based 3D style loss that aligns aggregated scene features
to style statistics, Stylos enforces view-consistent stylization while
preserving geometry. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that
Stylos delivers high-quality zero-shot stylization, highlighting the
effectiveness of global style-content coupling, the proposed 3D style loss, and
the scalability of our framework from single view to large-scale multi-view
settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASGRA is a novel framework for indoor scene classification and sensitive content analysis that uses Scene Graphs and Graph Attention Networks instead of raw pixels, achieving better performance while offering explainability and privacy preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indoor scene classification is challenging due to complex object relationships and spatial layouts, and is particularly important for sensitive applications like child sexual abuse imagery (CSAI) classification where privacy and explainability are crucial.

Method: Convert images into Scene Graphs and then use Graph Attention Network for inference, directly modeling interactions between scene components through structured graph representations rather than raw pixels.

Result: Achieved 81.27% balanced accuracy on Places8 dataset (surpassing image-based methods) and 74.27% balanced accuracy in real-world CSAI evaluation with law enforcement.

Conclusion: Structured scene representations using Scene Graphs and Graph Attention Networks provide a robust paradigm for indoor scene classification and CSAI classification, offering inherent explainability and privacy preservation benefits.

Abstract: Indoor scene classification is a critical task in computer vision, with
wide-ranging applications that go from robotics to sensitive content analysis,
such as child sexual abuse imagery (CSAI) classification. The problem is
particularly challenging due to the intricate relationships between objects and
complex spatial layouts. In this work, we propose the Attention over Scene
Graphs for Sensitive Content Analysis (ASGRA), a novel framework that operates
on structured graph representations instead of raw pixels. By first converting
images into Scene Graphs and then employing a Graph Attention Network for
inference, ASGRA directly models the interactions between a scene's components.
This approach offers two key benefits: (i) inherent explainability via object
and relationship identification, and (ii) privacy preservation, enabling model
training without direct access to sensitive images. On Places8, we achieve
81.27% balanced accuracy, surpassing image-based methods. Real-world CSAI
evaluation with law enforcement yields 74.27% balanced accuracy. Our results
establish structured scene representations as a robust paradigm for indoor
scene classification and CSAI classification. Code is publicly available at

*Sumaiya Tabassum,Md. Faysal Ahamed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight CBAM-CNN model with only 2.13M parameters achieves 95.58% accuracy for betel leaf disease classification, outperforming traditional pre-trained CNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Betel leaf diseases threaten crop security and are difficult to identify timely. AI can help increase output by predicting diseases early to prevent financial losses.

Method: Proposed a lightweight CNN with Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) that adaptively focuses on important spatial and channel features. Used enriched dataset of 10,185 images across 3 classes (Healthy, Leaf Rot, Leaf Spot) and visualized results with Grad-CAM for explainability.

Result: Achieved precision: 97%, recall: 94%, F1-score: 95%, accuracy: 95.58% on test set, demonstrating strong balanced classification performance that outperforms traditional pre-trained CNN models.

Conclusion: The lightweight CBAM-CNN model effectively identifies betel leaf diseases with high accuracy and interpretability, offering a practical solution for agricultural disease detection with minimal computational requirements.

Abstract: Betel leaf is an important crop because of its economic advantages and
widespread use. Its betel vines are susceptible to a number of illnesses that
are commonly referred to as betel leaf disease. Plant diseases are the largest
threat to the food supply's security, and they are challenging to identify in
time to stop possible financial damage. Interestingly, artificial intelligence
can leave a big mark on the betel leaf industry since it helps with output
growth by forecasting sickness. This paper presents a lightweight CBAM-CNN
model with just 2.13 million parameters (8.13 MB), incorporating CBAM
(Convolutional Block Attention Module) to improve feature emphasis without
depending on heavy pre-trained networks. The model's capacity to discern minute
variations among leaf disease classes is improved by the integrated attention
mechanism, which allows it to adaptively focus on significant spatial and
channel-wise information. In order to ensure class balance and diversity for
efficient model training and validation, this work makes use of an enriched
dataset of 10,185 images divided into three categories: Healthy Leaf, Leaf Rot,
and Leaf Spot. The proposed model achieved a precision of 97%, recall of 94%,
and F1 score of 95%, and 95.58% accuracy on the test set demonstrating strong
and balanced classification performance outperforming traditional pre trained
CNN models. The model's focus regions were visualized and interpreted using
Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping), an explainable AI
technique.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct inversion from movement trajectories to floorplans is ill-posed since many layouts can explain the same movements. The forward operator (path-planning) is non-invertible and non-differentiable, causing optimization instability.

Method: Reformulates likelihood score in a smoother embedding space trained with contrastive loss. Uses diffusion-based posterior sampler with surrogate likelihood score in embedding space to steer denoising process.

Result: CoGuide produces more consistent floorplans from trajectories and is more robust than differentiable-planner baselines and guided-diffusion methods.

Conclusion: The contrastive embedding approach provides a valid approximation of true likelihood, enabling effective posterior sampling for floorplan reconstruction from movement data.

Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing the spatial layout of a
place, a home floorplan for example, from a user`s movements inside that
layout. Direct inversion is ill-posed since many floorplans can explain the
same movement trajectories. We adopt a diffusion-based posterior sampler to
generate layouts consistent with the measurements. While active research is in
progress on generative inverse solvers, we find that the forward operator in
our problem poses new challenges. The path-planning process inside a floorplan
is a non-invertible, non-differentiable function, and causes instability while
optimizing using the likelihood score. We break-away from existing approaches
and reformulate the likelihood score in a smoother embedding space. The
embedding space is trained with a contrastive loss which brings compatible
floorplans and trajectories close to each other, while pushing mismatched pairs
far apart. We show that a surrogate form of the likelihood score in this
embedding space is a valid approximation of the true likelihood score, making
it possible to steer the denoising process towards the posterior. Across
extensive experiments, our model CoGuide produces more consistent floorplans
from trajectories, and is more robust than differentiable-planner baselines and
guided-diffusion methods.

TL;DR: A systematic post-training pipeline enhances small language models for edge deployment through curriculum-based SFT and offline knowledge distillation, achieving SOTA performance among billion-parameter models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are too computationally expensive for resource-constrained edge environments, creating a need for efficient small models that can maintain competitive performance after pre-training.

Method: A post-training pipeline consisting of curriculum-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and offline on-policy knowledge distillation to enhance small model accuracy.

Result: The instruction-tuned model achieves state-of-the-art performance among billion-parameter models with strong generalization under strict hardware constraints while maintaining competitive accuracy across various tasks.

Conclusion: This work provides a practical and efficient solution for developing high-performance language models on Ascend edge devices.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
advanced the capabilities of artificial intelligence across various domains.
However, their massive scale and high computational costs render them
unsuitable for direct deployment in resource-constrained edge environments.
This creates a critical need for high-performance small models that can operate
efficiently at the edge. Yet, after pre-training alone, these smaller models
often fail to meet the performance requirements of complex tasks. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a systematic post-training pipeline that efficiently
enhances small model accuracy. Our post training pipeline consists of
curriculum-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and offline on-policy knowledge
distillation. The resulting instruction-tuned model achieves state-of-the-art
performance among billion-parameter models, demonstrating strong generalization
under strict hardware constraints while maintaining competitive accuracy across
a variety of tasks. This work provides a practical and efficient solution for
developing high-performance language models on Ascend edge devices.

*Jijun Xiang,Longliang Liu,Xuan Zhu,Xianqi Wang,Min Lin,Xin Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEPTHOR++ is a robust depth enhancement framework that converts sparse dToF signals into dense depth maps using RGB guidance, addressing real-world challenges like calibration errors and sensor noise through simulation training, anomaly detection, and specialized completion networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing depth enhancement methods assume ideal dToF inputs and perfect alignment, overlooking real-world calibration errors and sensor anomalies, which limits practical applicability in high-precision tasks like 3D reconstruction and SLAM.

Method: 1) Simulation-based training using synthetic datasets for robust model training; 2) Learnable-parameter-free anomaly detection to identify and remove erroneous dToF measurements; 3) Specialized depth completion network integrating RGB images and monocular depth estimation priors.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 22% RMSE and 11% Rel improvement on ZJU-L5 dataset, 37% improvement in mirror regions on Mirror3D-NYU dataset, and 22% average gain on Hammer dataset using low-cost dToF data, enabling low-cost sensors to outperform higher-end devices.

Conclusion: The proposed DEPTHOR++ framework demonstrates superior robustness and performance across diverse real-world datasets, effectively addressing real-world dToF sensor limitations and enabling practical deployment in high-precision applications.

Abstract: Depth enhancement, which converts raw dToF signals into dense depth maps
using RGB guidance, is crucial for improving depth perception in high-precision
tasks such as 3D reconstruction and SLAM. However, existing methods often
assume ideal dToF inputs and perfect dToF-RGB alignment, overlooking
calibration errors and anomalies, thus limiting real-world applicability. This
work systematically analyzes the noise characteristics of real-world
lightweight dToF sensors and proposes a practical and novel depth completion
framework, DEPTHOR++, which enhances robustness to noisy dToF inputs from three
key aspects. First, we introduce a simulation method based on synthetic
datasets to generate realistic training samples for robust model training.
Second, we propose a learnable-parameter-free anomaly detection mechanism to
identify and remove erroneous dToF measurements, preventing misleading
propagation during completion. Third, we design a depth completion network
tailored to noisy dToF inputs, which integrates RGB images and pre-trained
monocular depth estimation priors to improve depth recovery in challenging
regions. On the ZJU-L5 dataset and real-world samples, our training strategy
significantly boosts existing depth completion models, with our model achieving
state-of-the-art performance, improving RMSE and Rel by 22% and 11% on average.
On the Mirror3D-NYU dataset, by incorporating the anomaly detection method, our
model improves upon the previous SOTA by 37% in mirror regions. On the Hammer
dataset, using simulated low-cost dToF data from RealSense L515, our method
surpasses the L515 measurements with an average gain of 22%, demonstrating its
potential to enable low-cost sensors to outperform higher-end devices.
Qualitative results across diverse real-world datasets further validate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

TL;DR: Stable Cinemetrics introduces a structured evaluation framework with 76 fine-grained filmmaking controls across four taxonomies (Setup, Event, Lighting, Camera) to benchmark professional video generation models, revealing significant gaps in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation models and benchmarks fail to capture the complexity and requirements of professional video generation, lacking structured evaluation frameworks aligned with industry practices.

Method: Developed a hierarchical taxonomy of 76 fine-grained control nodes across four dimensions (Setup, Event, Lighting, Camera), created a benchmark with professional prompts, and conducted large-scale human evaluation (20K videos, 80+ film professionals) plus trained an automatic evaluator aligned with expert annotations.

Result: Current video generation models exhibit significant gaps, particularly in Events and Camera-related controls. The automatic evaluator outperforms existing zero-shot baselines and enables scalable evaluation.

Conclusion: Stable Cinemetrics is the first approach to situate professional video generation within video generative models, providing structured evaluation pipelines and detailed analyses to guide future research in cinematic controls.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have enabled high-fidelity video
synthesis from user provided prompts. However, existing models and benchmarks
fail to capture the complexity and requirements of professional video
generation. Towards that goal, we introduce Stable Cinemetrics, a structured
evaluation framework that formalizes filmmaking controls into four
disentangled, hierarchical taxonomies: Setup, Event, Lighting, and Camera.
Together, these taxonomies define 76 fine-grained control nodes grounded in
industry practices. Using these taxonomies, we construct a benchmark of prompts
aligned with professional use cases and develop an automated pipeline for
prompt categorization and question generation, enabling independent evaluation
of each control dimension. We conduct a large-scale human study spanning 10+
models and 20K videos, annotated by a pool of 80+ film professionals. Our
analysis, both coarse and fine-grained reveal that even the strongest current
models exhibit significant gaps, particularly in Events and Camera-related
controls. To enable scalable evaluation, we train an automatic evaluator, a
vision-language model aligned with expert annotations that outperforms existing
zero-shot baselines. SCINE is the first approach to situate professional video
generation within the landscape of video generative models, introducing
taxonomies centered around cinematic controls and supporting them with
structured evaluation pipelines and detailed analyses to guide future research.

TL;DR: Using machine learning to automate EM connectome proofreading, reducing manual effort by 80% while maintaining 90% effectiveness, and automatically merging 200k segmentation fragments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual proofreading is the bottleneck in scaling electron microscopy connectomics, making larger reconstructions and comparative studies impractical due to high human annotation costs.

Method: Train machine learning models using existing ground-truth manual annotation data to automate proofreading workflows, validated on Drosophila male central nervous system reconstruction.

Result: Achieved 80% cost reduction while maintaining 90% workflow effectiveness; automatically attached 200k fragments (equivalent to 4 proofreader years), increasing connectivity completion by 1.3%.

Conclusion: Machine learning can significantly reduce the manual annotation burden in EM connectomics, enabling scaling of reconstructions and making comparative connectomics more feasible.

Abstract: Producing connectomes from electron microscopy (EM) images has historically
required a great deal of human proofreading effort. This manual annotation cost
is the current bottleneck in scaling EM connectomics, for example, in making
larger connectome reconstructions feasible, or in enabling comparative
connectomics where multiple related reconstructions are produced. In this work,
we propose using the available ground-truth data generated by this manual
annotation effort to learn a machine learning model to automate or optimize
parts of the required proofreading workflows. We validate our approach on a
recent complete reconstruction of the \emph{Drosophila} male central nervous
system. We first show our method would allow for obtaining 90\% of the value of
a guided proofreading workflow while reducing required cost by 80\%. We then
demonstrate a second application for automatically merging many segmentation
fragments to proofread neurons. Our system is able to automatically attach 200
thousand fragments, equivalent to four proofreader years of manual work, and
increasing the connectivity completion rate of the connectome by 1.3\% points.

### [125] [DiffCamera: Arbitrary Refocusing on Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26599)
*Yiyang Wang,Xi Chen,Xiaogang Xu,Yu Liu,Hengshuang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffCamera is a diffusion transformer model that enables flexible image refocusing by allowing users to specify arbitrary focus points and blur levels after a photo is taken.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth-of-field effects are fixed once an image is captured, making it difficult to correct undesirable blur (e.g., out-of-focus subjects). There's a need for post-capture refocusing capabilities.

Method: A diffusion transformer framework trained on simulated image pairs with varying focus planes and bokeh levels, enhanced with a stacking constraint based on photographic principles to ensure physically accurate DoF manipulation.

Result: The model achieves stable refocusing across diverse scenes, providing unprecedented control over DoF adjustments for photography and generative AI applications.

Conclusion: DiffCamera successfully enables flexible post-capture refocusing with precise DoF control, overcoming the limitation of fixed depth-of-field effects in traditional photography.

Abstract: The depth-of-field (DoF) effect, which introduces aesthetically pleasing
blur, enhances photographic quality but is fixed and difficult to modify once
the image has been created. This becomes problematic when the applied blur is
undesirable~(e.g., the subject is out of focus). To address this, we propose
DiffCamera, a model that enables flexible refocusing of a created image
conditioned on an arbitrary new focus point and a blur level. Specifically, we
design a diffusion transformer framework for refocusing learning. However, the
training requires pairs of data with different focus planes and bokeh levels in
the same scene, which are hard to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we
develop a simulation-based pipeline to generate large-scale image pairs with
varying focus planes and bokeh levels. With the simulated data, we find that
training with only a vanilla diffusion objective often leads to incorrect DoF
behaviors due to the complexity of the task. This requires a stronger
constraint during training. Inspired by the photographic principle that photos
of different focus planes can be linearly blended into a multi-focus image, we
propose a stacking constraint during training to enforce precise DoF
manipulation. This constraint enhances model training by imposing physically
grounded refocusing behavior that the focusing results should be faithfully
aligned with the scene structure and the camera conditions so that they can be
combined into the correct multi-focus image. We also construct a benchmark to
evaluate the effectiveness of our refocusing model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DiffCamera supports stable refocusing across a wide range of
scenes, providing unprecedented control over DoF adjustments for photography
and generative AI applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal audio generation models lack precise user control for professional Foley workflows, often generating unnecessary background sounds or focusing on wrong objects.

Method: SAGANet leverages visual segmentation masks along with video and textual cues for controllable audio generation, and introduces Segmented Music Solos benchmark dataset.

Result: The method demonstrates substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods and sets new standards for controllable, high-fidelity Foley synthesis.

Conclusion: SAGANet enables fine-grained and visually localized control over audio generation, addressing limitations of existing models in professional Foley applications.

Abstract: Existing multimodal audio generation models often lack precise user control,
which limits their applicability in professional Foley workflows. In
particular, these models focus on the entire video and do not provide precise
methods for prioritizing a specific object within a scene, generating
unnecessary background sounds, or focusing on the wrong objects. To address
this gap, we introduce the novel task of video object segmentation-aware audio
generation, which explicitly conditions sound synthesis on object-level
segmentation maps. We present SAGANet, a new multimodal generative model that
enables controllable audio generation by leveraging visual segmentation masks
along with video and textual cues. Our model provides users with fine-grained
and visually localized control over audio generation. To support this task and
further research on segmentation-aware Foley, we propose Segmented Music Solos,
a benchmark dataset of musical instrument performance videos with segmentation
information. Our method demonstrates substantial improvements over current
state-of-the-art methods and sets a new standard for controllable,
high-fidelity Foley synthesis. Code, samples, and Segmented Music Solos are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hy-Facial is a hybrid framework combining deep learning (VGG19) and traditional features (SIFT, ORB) with UMAP dimensionality reduction, achieving 83.3% accuracy in facial expression recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facial expression classification is challenging due to high dimensionality and complexity of facial image data, requiring better feature extraction and dimensionality reduction methods.

Method: Hybrid feature extraction combining VGG19 deep features with handcrafted SIFT and ORB descriptors, followed by K-means clustering and UMAP dimensionality reduction.

Result: Achieved 83.3% classification accuracy on the FER dataset, with UMAP identified as the most effective dimensionality reduction technique.

Conclusion: Dimensionality reduction is essential not just for preprocessing but for improving feature quality and overall classification performance in facial expression recognition.

Abstract: Facial expression classification remains a challenging task due to the high
dimensionality and inherent complexity of facial image data. This paper
presents Hy-Facial, a hybrid feature extraction framework that integrates both
deep learning and traditional image processing techniques, complemented by a
systematic investigation of dimensionality reduction strategies. The proposed
method fuses deep features extracted from the Visual Geometry Group 19-layer
network (VGG19) with handcrafted local descriptors and the scale-invariant
feature transform (SIFT) and Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) algorithms,
to obtain rich and diverse image representations. To mitigate feature
redundancy and reduce computational complexity, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of dimensionality reduction techniques and feature extraction. Among
these, UMAP is identified as the most effective, preserving both local and
global structures of the high-dimensional feature space. The Hy-Facial pipeline
integrated VGG19, SIFT, and ORB for feature extraction, followed by K-means
clustering and UMAP for dimensionality reduction, resulting in a classification
accuracy of 83. 3\% in the facial expression recognition (FER) dataset. These
findings underscore the pivotal role of dimensionality reduction not only as a
pre-processing step but as an essential component in improving feature quality
and overall classification performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DA² is a zero-shot generalizable panoramic depth estimator that addresses data scarcity and spherical distortion issues through large-scale data curation and a novel SphereViT architecture, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 38% improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Panoramic depth estimation faces challenges due to limited panoramic data and spherical distortions, leading to poor zero-shot generalization and inefficient processing methods that rely on perspective splitting.

Method: Proposed DA² with two key components: 1) Data curation engine generating ~543K panoramic RGB-depth pairs from perspective data, totaling ~607K samples; 2) SphereViT architecture that explicitly uses spherical coordinates to enforce geometric consistency in panoramic features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 38% average improvement on AbsRel over strongest zero-shot baselines, outperforms prior in-domain methods, and demonstrates higher efficiency as an end-to-end solution compared to fusion-based approaches.

Conclusion: DA² provides an accurate, zero-shot generalizable, and efficient panoramic depth estimation solution that addresses key challenges in the field through large-scale data curation and spherical geometry-aware modeling.

Abstract: Panorama has a full FoV (360$^\circ\times$180$^\circ$), offering a more
complete visual description than perspective images. Thanks to this
characteristic, panoramic depth estimation is gaining increasing traction in 3D
vision. However, due to the scarcity of panoramic data, previous methods are
often restricted to in-domain settings, leading to poor zero-shot
generalization. Furthermore, due to the spherical distortions inherent in
panoramas, many approaches rely on perspective splitting (e.g., cubemaps),
which leads to suboptimal efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose
$\textbf{DA}$$^{\textbf{2}}$: $\textbf{D}$epth $\textbf{A}$nything in
$\textbf{A}$ny $\textbf{D}$irection, an accurate, zero-shot generalizable, and
fully end-to-end panoramic depth estimator. Specifically, for scaling up
panoramic data, we introduce a data curation engine for generating high-quality
panoramic depth data from perspective, and create $\sim$543K panoramic
RGB-depth pairs, bringing the total to $\sim$607K. To further mitigate the
spherical distortions, we present SphereViT, which explicitly leverages
spherical coordinates to enforce the spherical geometric consistency in
panoramic image features, yielding improved performance. A comprehensive
benchmark on multiple datasets clearly demonstrates DA$^{2}$'s SoTA
performance, with an average 38% improvement on AbsRel over the strongest
zero-shot baseline. Surprisingly, DA$^{2}$ even outperforms prior in-domain
methods, highlighting its superior zero-shot generalization. Moreover, as an
end-to-end solution, DA$^{2}$ exhibits much higher efficiency over fusion-based
approaches. Both the code and the curated panoramic data will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HART is a unified framework for sparse-view human reconstruction that outputs watertight clothed meshes, aligned SMPL-X body meshes, and Gaussian-splat representations for photorealistic rendering from a small set of uncalibrated RGB images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods either optimize parametric templates (overlooking loose garments and human-object interactions) or train implicit functions under simplified camera assumptions, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: HART predicts per-pixel 3D point maps, normals, and body correspondences, uses occlusion-aware Poisson reconstruction for complete geometry, aligns with SMPL-X body model, and initializes Gaussian splats for sparse-view rendering.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results: 18-23% improvement in Chamfer Distance for clothed-mesh reconstruction, 6-27% drop in PA-V2V for SMPL-X estimation, and 15-27% decrease in LPIPS for novel-view synthesis across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Feed-forward transformers can serve as a scalable model for robust human reconstruction in real-world settings, demonstrating strong performance despite being trained on only 2.3K synthetic scans.

Abstract: We introduce HART, a unified framework for sparse-view human reconstruction.
Given a small set of uncalibrated RGB images of a person as input, it outputs a
watertight clothed mesh, the aligned SMPL-X body mesh, and a Gaussian-splat
representation for photorealistic novel-view rendering. Prior methods for
clothed human reconstruction either optimize parametric templates, which
overlook loose garments and human-object interactions, or train implicit
functions under simplified camera assumptions, limiting applicability in real
scenes. In contrast, HART predicts per-pixel 3D point maps, normals, and body
correspondences, and employs an occlusion-aware Poisson reconstruction to
recover complete geometry, even in self-occluded regions. These predictions
also align with a parametric SMPL-X body model, ensuring that reconstructed
geometry remains consistent with human structure while capturing loose clothing
and interactions. These human-aligned meshes initialize Gaussian splats to
further enable sparse-view rendering. While trained on only 2.3K synthetic
scans, HART achieves state-of-the-art results: Chamfer Distance improves by
18-23 percent for clothed-mesh reconstruction, PA-V2V drops by 6-27 percent for
SMPL-X estimation, LPIPS decreases by 15-27 percent for novel-view synthesis on
a wide range of datasets. These results suggest that feed-forward transformers
can serve as a scalable model for robust human reconstruction in real-world
settings. Code and models will be released.

*Yuqing Wang,Zhaiyu Chen,Xiao Xiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first SIM(3)-equivariant shape completion network that achieves robust generalization by being agnostic to pose and scale, outperforming existing methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D shape completion methods rely on pre-aligned scans, which leak pose and scale cues that networks exploit to memorize positions rather than learning intrinsic geometry. This causes performance collapse when alignment is absent in real data.

Method: The authors develop a SIM(3)-equivariant shape completion network with modular layers that successively canonicalize features, reason over similarity-invariant geometry, and restore the original frame. This ensures the model remains agnostic to pose and scale.

Result: The model outperforms both equivariant and augmentation baselines on PCN benchmark under de-biased evaluation. It achieves 17% lower minimal matching distance on KITTI and 14% lower Chamfer distance on OmniObject3D, setting new cross-domain records on real driving and indoor scans.

Conclusion: Full SIM(3) equivariance is established as an effective route to truly generalizable shape completion, with the model even outperforming competitors under their biased settings while using a stricter evaluation protocol.

Abstract: 3D shape completion methods typically assume scans are pre-aligned to a
canonical frame. This leaks pose and scale cues that networks may exploit to
memorize absolute positions rather than inferring intrinsic geometry. When such
alignment is absent in real data, performance collapses. We argue that robust
generalization demands architectural equivariance to the similarity group,
SIM(3), so the model remains agnostic to pose and scale. Following this
principle, we introduce the first SIM(3)-equivariant shape completion network,
whose modular layers successively canonicalize features, reason over
similarity-invariant geometry, and restore the original frame. Under a
de-biased evaluation protocol that removes the hidden cues, our model
outperforms both equivariant and augmentation baselines on the PCN benchmark.
It also sets new cross-domain records on real driving and indoor scans,
lowering minimal matching distance on KITTI by 17% and Chamfer distance $\ell1$
on OmniObject3D by 14%. Perhaps surprisingly, ours under the stricter protocol
still outperforms competitors under their biased settings. These results
establish full SIM(3) equivariance as an effective route to truly generalizable
shape completion. Project page: https://sime-completion.github.io.

### [131] [Query-Kontext: An Unified Multimodal Model for Image Generation and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26641)
*Yuxin Song,Wenkai Dong,Shizun Wang,Qi Zhang,Song Xue,Tao Yuan,Hu Yang,Haocheng Feng,Hang Zhou,Xinyan Xiao,Jingdong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Query-Kontext is a novel approach that bridges vision-language models (VLMs) and diffusion models using multimodal "kontext" to separate multimodal generative reasoning from high-fidelity synthesis, achieving competitive performance with unified baselines and outperforming task-specific methods in some cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unified multimodal models entangle multimodal generative reasoning (instruction understanding, grounding, image referring) with high-fidelity synthesis, which limits their effectiveness. The authors aim to separate these capabilities by delegating reasoning to VLMs while preserving diffusion models' synthesis strengths.

Method: Proposed Query-Kontext approach with three-stage progressive training: 1) Connect VLM to lightweight diffusion head via multimodal kontext tokens, 2) Scale to large pre-trained diffusion model for enhanced visual quality, 3) Add low-level image encoder for improved fidelity and instruction tuning. Built comprehensive data pipeline covering diverse multimodal reference-to-image scenarios.

Result: The approach matches strong unified baselines and even outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods in several cases across image generation, instruction-driven editing, customized generation, and multi-subject composition tasks.

Conclusion: Query-Kontext successfully bridges VLMs and diffusion models by separating multimodal generative reasoning from high-fidelity synthesis, demonstrating that delegating complex reasoning to VLMs while using diffusion models for synthesis leads to improved performance across various multimodal generation tasks.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation (T2I) and editing (TI2I), whether instantiated as
assembled unified frameworks which couple powerful vision-language model (VLM)
with diffusion-based generator, or as naive Unified Multimodal Models with an
early fusion of understanding and generation modalities. We contend that in
current unified frameworks, the crucial capability of multimodal generative
reasoning which encompasses instruction understanding, grounding, and image
referring for identity preservation and faithful reconstruction, is
intrinsically entangled with high-fidelity synthesis. In this work, we
introduce Query-Kontext, a novel approach that bridges the VLM and diffusion
model via a multimodal ``kontext'' composed of semantic cues and coarse-grained
image conditions encoded from multimodal inputs. This design delegates the
complex ability of multimodal generative reasoning to powerful VLM while
reserving diffusion model's role for high-quality visual synthesis. To achieve
this, we propose a three-stage progressive training strategy. First, we connect
the VLM to a lightweight diffusion head via multimodal kontext tokens to
unleash the VLM's generative reasoning ability. Second, we scale this head to a
large, pre-trained diffusion model to enhance visual detail and realism.
Finally, we introduce a low-level image encoder to improve image fidelity and
perform instruction tuning on downstream tasks. Furthermore, we build a
comprehensive data pipeline integrating real, synthetic, and open-source
datasets, covering diverse multimodal reference-to-image scenarios, including

### [132] [Stitch: Training-Free Position Control in Multimodal Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26644)
*Jessica Bader,Mateusz Pach,Maria A. Bravo,Serge Belongie,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stitch is a training-free method that adds external position control to modern Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) using automatically-generated bounding boxes, enabling spatially accurate image generation while maintaining visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2I models struggle with spatial relationships like "above" or "to the right of", and previous position control methods are incompatible with modern architectures that focus on image quality.

Method: Stitch generates individual objects within designated bounding boxes and seamlessly stitches them together by leveraging targeted attention heads to isolate and cut out objects mid-generation without fully completing the image.

Result: Stitch consistently enhances base models, improving FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206% on PosEval benchmark. Achieves state-of-the-art results with Qwen-Image on PosEval, improving over previous models by 54%.

Conclusion: Stitch successfully integrates position control into leading T2I models training-free, demonstrating significant improvements in spatial accuracy while maintaining visual appeal, with modern models still having substantial room for improvement in position-based generation.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models have advanced rapidly in recent years,
but accurately capturing spatial relationships like "above" or "to the right
of" poses a persistent challenge. Earlier methods improved spatial relationship
following with external position control. However, as architectures evolved to
enhance image quality, these techniques became incompatible with modern models.
We propose Stitch, a training-free method for incorporating external position
control into Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) via
automatically-generated bounding boxes. Stitch produces images that are both
spatially accurate and visually appealing by generating individual objects
within designated bounding boxes and seamlessly stitching them together. We
find that targeted attention heads capture the information necessary to isolate
and cut out individual objects mid-generation, without needing to fully
complete the image. We evaluate Stitch on PosEval, our benchmark for
position-based T2I generation. Featuring five new tasks that extend the concept
of Position beyond the basic GenEval task, PosEval demonstrates that even top
models still have significant room for improvement in position-based
generation. Tested on Qwen-Image, FLUX, and SD3.5, Stitch consistently enhances
base models, even improving FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206%
on PosEval. Stitch achieves state-of-the-art results with Qwen-Image on
PosEval, improving over previous models by 54%, all accomplished while
integrating position control into leading models training-free. Code is

*Xingyu Chen,Yue Chen,Yuliang Xiu,Andreas Geiger,Anpei Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TTT3R improves 3D reconstruction by treating it as a test-time training problem, using alignment confidence to dynamically adjust memory updates, achieving 2× better pose estimation and 20 FPS performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern RNNs for 3D reconstruction suffer from limited length generalization beyond training context lengths, degrading performance in longer sequences.

Method: Framed 3D reconstruction as test-time training, using alignment confidence between memory state and observations to derive closed-form learning rate for memory updates, balancing historical retention and new adaptation.

Result: Achieved 2× improvement in global pose estimation over baselines, operates at 20 FPS with only 6 GB GPU memory for thousands of images.

Conclusion: TTT3R's training-free intervention substantially improves length generalization in 3D reconstruction while maintaining efficient real-time performance.

Abstract: Modern Recurrent Neural Networks have become a competitive architecture for
3D reconstruction due to their linear-time complexity. However, their
performance degrades significantly when applied beyond the training context
length, revealing limited length generalization. In this work, we revisit the
3D reconstruction foundation models from a Test-Time Training perspective,
framing their designs as an online learning problem. Building on this
perspective, we leverage the alignment confidence between the memory state and
incoming observations to derive a closed-form learning rate for memory updates,
to balance between retaining historical information and adapting to new
observations. This training-free intervention, termed TTT3R, substantially
improves length generalization, achieving a $2\times$ improvement in global
pose estimation over baselines, while operating at 20 FPS with just 6 GB of GPU
memory to process thousands of images. Code available in

*Lukas Petersson,Axel Backlund,Axel Wennstöm,Hanna Petersson,Callum Sharrock,Arash Dabiri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Blueprint-Bench is a benchmark for evaluating AI spatial reasoning by converting apartment photos to 2D floor plans, revealing current models perform poorly while humans excel.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess genuine spatial intelligence in AI models through spatial reconstruction tasks that require inferring room layouts, understanding connectivity, and maintaining consistent scale.

Method: Evaluated leading language models, image generation models, and agent systems on 50 apartments with ~20 interior images each, using scoring based on room connectivity graphs and size rankings.

Result: Most AI models perform at or below random baseline, with image generation models struggling with instruction following and agent-based approaches showing no meaningful improvement over single-pass generation.

Conclusion: Blueprint-Bench provides the first numerical framework for comparing spatial intelligence across architectures and reveals a significant blind spot in current AI capabilities compared to human performance.

Abstract: We introduce Blueprint-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial
reasoning capabilities in AI models through the task of converting apartment
photographs into accurate 2D floor plans. While the input modality
(photographs) is well within the training distribution of modern multimodal
models, the task of spatial reconstruction requires genuine spatial
intelligence: inferring room layouts, understanding connectivity, and
maintaining consistent scale. We evaluate leading language models (GPT-5,
Claude 4 Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4), image generation models (GPT-Image,
NanoBanana), and agent systems (Codex CLI, Claude Code) on a dataset of 50
apartments with approximately 20 interior images each. Our scoring algorithm
measures similarity between generated and ground-truth floor plans based on
room connectivity graphs and size rankings. Results reveal a significant blind
spot in current AI capabilities: most models perform at or below a random
baseline, while human performance remains substantially superior. Image
generation models particularly struggle with instruction following, while
agent-based approaches with iterative refinement capabilities show no
meaningful improvement over single-pass generation. Blueprint-Bench provides
the first numerical framework for comparing spatial intelligence across
different model architectures. We will continue evaluating new models as they
are released and welcome community submissions, monitoring for the emergence of
spatial intelligence in generalist AI systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Causal Abstraction Networks (CANs) as a specific type of causal sheaves with Gaussian structural causal models, develops theoretical properties, and proposes an efficient learning algorithm called SPECTRAL for consistent CAN recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance explainability, trustworthiness, and robustness in AI by leveraging structural causal models through formal causal abstraction networks.

Method: Defines CANs with Gaussian SCMs, linear causal abstractions, and specific stalk relationships. Proposes SPECTRAL algorithm with local Riemannian optimization and closed-form updates for learning consistent CANs.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows CANs have algebraic invariants, cohomology properties, and global sections characterized by Laplacian kernel. Experiments demonstrate competitive CA learning performance and successful recovery of diverse CAN structures on synthetic data.

Conclusion: CANs provide a theoretically grounded framework for causal abstraction with efficient learning algorithms that avoid nonconvex optimization and handle both positive definite and semidefinite covariance matrices.

Abstract: Causal artificial intelligence aims to enhance explainability,
trustworthiness, and robustness in AI by leveraging structural causal models
(SCMs). In this pursuit, recent advances formalize network sheaves of causal
knowledge. Pushing in the same direction, we introduce the causal abstraction
network (CAN), a specific instance of such sheaves where (i) SCMs are Gaussian,
(ii) restriction maps are transposes of constructive linear causal abstractions
(CAs), and (iii) edge stalks correspond -- up to rotation -- to the node stalks
of more detailed SCMs. We investigate the theoretical properties of CAN,
including algebraic invariants, cohomology, consistency, global sections
characterized via the Laplacian kernel, and smoothness. We then tackle the
learning of consistent CANs. Our problem formulation separates into
edge-specific local Riemannian problems and avoids nonconvex, costly
objectives. We propose an efficient search procedure as a solution, solving the
local problems with SPECTRAL, our iterative method with closed-form updates and
suitable for positive definite and semidefinite covariance matrices.
Experiments on synthetic data show competitive performance in the CA learning
task, and successful recovery of diverse CAN structures.

*Kevin Xu,Issei Sato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the differences between Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Latent Thought in looped models, showing that Latent Thought enables parallel computation while CoT uses sequential reasoning with stochastic decoding for intractable problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the comparative capabilities of Chain-of-Thought and Latent Thought approaches in large language models, as both use iterative computation but operate in different spaces (natural language vs. continuous latent space).

Method: The authors conducted a formal analysis comparing Chain-of-Thought (which generates intermediate steps in natural language) and Latent Thought in looped models (which operates in continuous latent space).

Result: The analysis shows that Latent Thought enables parallel computation which is more efficient than CoT's sequential process, while CoT leverages stochastic decoding for problems where exact computation is intractable.

Conclusion: The separation between these approaches provides practical guidance for choosing reasoning paradigms based on task requirements, with depth-driven recursion being more suitable for certain tasks.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) elicits reasoning in large language models by
explicitly generating intermediate steps in natural language. In contrast,
Latent Thought in looped models operates directly in the continuous latent
space, enabling computation beyond discrete linguistic representations. While
both approaches exploit iterative computation, their comparative capabilities
remain underexplored. In this work, we present a formal analysis showing that
Latent Thought in Looped Transformers enables parallel computation, which is
more efficient than the inherently sequential process of CoT. In contrast, CoT
leverages stochastic decoding to approximate solutions to problems where exact
computation is intractable. These separations suggest the tasks for which
depth-driven recursion is more suitable, thereby offering practical guidance
for choosing between reasoning paradigms. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the scale-depth paradox in qualitative research where traditional methods struggle to analyze massive datasets efficiently while preserving interpretive depth.

Method: Used 1536-dimensional embeddings, hierarchical clustering, and parallel agent-based coding on 40,000 character Chinese interview transcripts. Compared NGT against manual coding and ChatGPT-assisted analysis with two experiments testing pure automation versus human-guided refinement.

Result: NGT achieved 168-fold speed improvement (3 hours vs 3 weeks), superior quality (0.904 vs 0.883), 96% cost reduction, and discovered patterns invisible to manual coding including identity bifurcation phenomena. Human-AI collaboration proved essential.

Abstract: Purpose: Neo Grounded Theory (NGT) integrates vector clustering with multi
agent systems to resolve qualitative research's scale depth paradox, enabling
analysis of massive datasets in hours while preserving interpretive rigor.
Methods: We compared NGT against manual coding and ChatGPT-assisted analysis
using 40,000 character Chinese interview transcripts. NGT employs
1536-dimensional embeddings, hierarchical clustering, and parallel agent-based
coding. Two experiments tested pure automation versus human guided refinement.
Findings: NGT achieved 168-fold speed improvement (3 hours vs 3 weeks),
superior quality (0.904 vs 0.883), and 96% cost reduction. Human AI
collaboration proved essential: automation alone produced abstract frameworks
while human guidance yielded actionable dual pathway theories. The system
discovered patterns invisible to manual coding, including identity bifurcation
phenomena. Contributions: NGT demonstrates computational objectivity and human
interpretation are complementary. Vector representations provide reproducible
semantic measurement while preserving meaning's interpretive dimensions.
Researchers shift from mechanical coding to theoretical guidance, with AI
handling pattern recognition while humans provide creative insight.
Implications: Cost reduction from \$50,000 to \$500 democratizes qualitative
research, enabling communities to study themselves. Real-time analysis makes
qualitative insights contemporaneous with events. The framework shows
computational methods can strengthen rather than compromise qualitative
research's humanistic commitments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a hybrid memory system with Intelligent Decay for LCNC agents to solve memory inflation and contextual degradation issues in long-duration business processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address memory management challenges in AI-native LCNC platforms where agents face memory inflation and contextual degradation during extended operations, leading to inconsistent behavior and increased costs.

Method: Hybrid memory system combining episodic and semantic memory with proactive Intelligent Decay mechanism that prunes/consolidates memories based on recency, relevance, and user utility scores, plus user-centric visualization interface.

Result: Significantly outperforms traditional approaches (sliding windows, basic RAG) in simulated long-running tasks with superior task completion rates, contextual consistency, and token cost efficiency.

Conclusion: Establishes a new framework for building reliable, transparent AI agents capable of effective long-term learning and adaptation in LCNC environments.

Abstract: The rise of AI-native Low-Code/No-Code (LCNC) platforms enables autonomous
agents capable of executing complex, long-duration business processes. However,
a fundamental challenge remains: memory management. As agents operate over
extended periods, they face "memory inflation" and "contextual degradation"
issues, leading to inconsistent behavior, error accumulation, and increased
computational cost. This paper proposes a novel hybrid memory system designed
specifically for LCNC agents. Inspired by cognitive science, our architecture
combines episodic and semantic memory components with a proactive "Intelligent
Decay" mechanism. This mechanism intelligently prunes or consolidates memories
based on a composite score factoring in recency, relevance, and user-specified
utility. A key innovation is a user-centric visualization interface, aligned
with the LCNC paradigm, which allows non-technical users to manage the agent's
memory directly, for instance, by visually tagging which facts should be
retained or forgotten. Through simulated long-running task experiments, we
demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms traditional approaches
like sliding windows and basic RAG, yielding superior task completion rates,
contextual consistency, and long-term token cost efficiency. Our findings
establish a new framework for building reliable, transparent AI agents capable
of effective long-term learning and adaptation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FGA transforms unreliable language models into deterministic truth tellers by injecting verifiable knowledge directly into attention mechanisms, eliminating hallucinations when facts exist in the knowledge base.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models suffer from confident hallucinations due to their probabilistic nature, creating illusions of knowledge rather than true understanding.

Method: Fact Grounded Attention (FGA) modifies the transformer architecture by injecting verifiable knowledge directly into pre-softmax attention scores, intervening at the mathematical core of the model.

Result: Achieved 99.7% accuracy on 1,107 technical queries (vs 6.3% in vanilla Llama 3.2), with knowledge updates in under one second without retraining.

Conclusion: FGA represents a fundamental shift from probabilistic approximation to deterministic precision in neural language generation, completely eliminating hallucinations for verifiable facts.

Abstract: "The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of
knowledge." Large Language Models have conquered natural language but remain
prisoners of their own probabilistic nature--confidently hallucinating facts
they never truly knew. We present Fact Grounded Attention (FGA), a novel
architectural modification that transforms unreliable language models into
deterministic truth tellers by injecting verifiable knowledge directly into the
attention mechanism. Unlike existing approaches that patch hallucinations after
generation or prepend retrieved text, FGA intervenes at the mathematical heart
of the transformer--the pre-softmax attention scores--creating a model that
cannot hallucinate when facts exist in its knowledge base. Our experiments
across 1,107 technical queries spanning smartphones, laptops, and electric
vehicles demonstrate a transformation from 6.3% accuracy in vanilla Llama 3.2
to 99.7% accuracy with FGA. More critically, knowledge updates occur in under
one second without retraining, compared to hours for parameter editing
approaches. FGA doesn't just reduce hallucination--it eliminates it entirely
for verifiable facts, marking a fundamental shift from probabilistic
approximation to deterministic precision in neural language generation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how decoder-only language models engage in planning by examining their hidden states using vector-quantized variational autoencoders to compress representations and measure mutual information across grammar, path-finding, and natural language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformer-based language models organize intermediate computations for coherent long-range generation, which has implications for interpretability, reliability, and model design.

Method: Developed a pipeline using vector-quantized variational autoencoders to compress hidden states into compact summary codes, enabling systematic analysis of computational structure through mutual information measurements across synthetic grammar, path-finding, and natural language datasets.

Result: The effective planning horizon is task-dependent; models implicitly preserve information about unused correct continuations; predictions draw most on recent computations while earlier blocks remain informative.

Conclusion: The study advances understanding of how planning is realized in language models and provides a general-purpose pipeline for probing internal dynamics of deep learning systems.

Abstract: The extent to which decoder-only language models (LMs) engage in planning,
that is, organizing intermediate computations to support coherent long-range
generation, remains an open and important question, with implications for
interpretability, reliability, and principled model design. Planning involves
structuring computations over long horizons, considering multiple possible
continuations, and selectively reusing past information, but how effectively
transformer-based LMs realize these capabilities is still unclear. We address
these questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer
computations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of
information. Since these hidden representations are often redundant and
encumbered with fine-grained details, we develop a pipeline based on
vector-quantized variational autoencoders that compresses them into compact
summary codes. These codes enable measuring mutual information, allowing
systematic analysis of the computational structure underlying model behavior.
Using this framework, we study planning in LMs across synthetic grammar,
path-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on three key
aspects: (i) the planning horizon of pre-output computations, (ii) the extent
to which the model considers alternative valid continuations, and (iii) the
reliance of new predictions on earlier computations. By answering these
questions, we advance the understanding of how planning is realized in LMs and
contribute a general-purpose pipeline for probing the internal dynamics of LMs
and deep learning systems. Our results reveal that the effective planning
horizon is task-dependent, that models implicitly preserve information about
unused correct continuations, and that predictions draw most on recent
computations, though earlier blocks remain informative.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RADAR is a multi-agent collaborative framework that improves LLM safety evaluation by decomposing risk into explicit, implicit, and non-risk subspaces, using debate mechanisms to reduce evaluator bias and enhance risk detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM safety evaluation methods suffer from evaluator bias and detection failures due to model homogeneity, undermining the robustness of risk assessment processes.

Method: Proposes RADAR framework with multi-agent collaboration using four specialized roles and multi-round debate mechanisms, with dynamic updates for self-evolution of risk concept distributions. Decomposes risk into explicit (direct violations), implicit (contextual reasoning required), and non-risk subspaces.

Result: Achieves 28.87% improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to strongest baseline. Significantly outperforms baseline methods in accuracy, stability, and self-evaluation risk sensitivity on challenging testset of 800 cases and public benchmarks.

Conclusion: RADAR provides a more robust and comprehensive safety evaluation paradigm that effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by covering both explicit and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias.

Abstract: Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer
from inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures
arising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of
risk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation
paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the
underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk
concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk
subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit
risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual
reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we
propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages
multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and
employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept
distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit
and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the
effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising
800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and
public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline
evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability,
and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87%
improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline
evaluation method.

It proposes the PolyTrace benchmark suite for realistic workload evaluation.


<details>

Motivation: RLVR is increasingly used to enhance LLM reasoning abilities, but its complex data flows and diverse tasks pose substantial challenges to RL training systems, with limited understanding from a system perspective.

Method: The authors conducted a characterization study of RLVR tasks in their LLM deployment, investigating workload distribution and variation trends across different RL tasks and training steps.

Conclusion: The paper calls for further investigation into remaining open challenges and proposes the PolyTrace benchmark suite, which demonstrates 94.7% accuracy in practical validation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now widely used across many domains. With
their rapid development, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
has surged in recent months to enhance their reasoning and understanding
abilities. However, its complex data flows and diverse tasks pose substantial
challenges to RL training systems, and there is limited understanding of RLVR
from a system perspective. To thoroughly understand the system challenges
introduced by RLVR, we present a characterization study of RLVR tasks in our
LLM deployment. Specifically, we investigate the distribution and variation
trends of workloads across different RL tasks across training steps. We
identify issues such as GPU idling caused by skewed sequence length
distribution, inefficient parallel strategies in dynamically varying workloads,
inefficient data management mechanisms, and load imbalance. We describe our
observations and call for further investigation into the remaining open
challenges. Furthermore, we propose PolyTrace benchmark suite to conduct
evaluation with realistic workloads, and a practical use case validates that
PolyTrace benchmark suite exhibits 94.7% accuracy.

*Jiexi Xu,Jiaqi Liu,Ran Tong,Su Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Causal-Visual Programming (CVP) introduces causal structures into LLM agent workflows to reduce hallucinations and logical errors by anchoring reasoning to user-defined causal graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents exhibit hallucinations and logical inconsistencies due to probabilistic reasoning without genuine causal understanding, especially in dynamic environments with distribution shifts.

Method: CVP allows users to define a "world model" through a low-code interface, creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that explicitly defines causal relationships between workflow modules to constrain agent reasoning.

Result: In synthetic experiments with distribution shifts, causally anchored models maintained stable accuracy while associative baseline models experienced significant performance drops.

Conclusion: CVP provides a viable path toward more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents by reducing causal confusion and enhancing robustness in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of orchestrating
complex tasks in low-code environments. However, these agents often exhibit
hallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning
mechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal
understanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual
Programming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly
introducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to
define a simple "world model" for workflow modules through an intuitive
low-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that
explicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph
acts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring
its decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing
logical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious
correlations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic
experiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift
between the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally
anchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a
purely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations
experienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this
study are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the
proposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to
a user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the
framework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors
caused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path
toward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ID-RAG is a new mechanism that uses a knowledge graph to maintain generative agents' identity coherence over time, reducing identity drift and improving performance in long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative agents struggle with maintaining coherence as memory context grows, leading to identity drift, ignored beliefs, and hallucination propagation in multi-agent systems.

Method: Introduces Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG) that grounds agent persona in a dynamic knowledge graph of core beliefs, traits, and values, which is queried during decision-making to inform action selection.

Result: In mayoral election simulations, ID-RAG agents achieved higher identity recall across all models by the fourth timestep and reduced convergence time by 19% (GPT-4o) and 58% (GPT-4o mini).

Conclusion: Treating identity as an explicit, retrievable knowledge structure provides a foundational approach for developing more temporally coherent, interpretable, and aligned generative agents.

Abstract: Generative agents powered by language models are increasingly deployed for
long-horizon tasks. However, as long-term memory context grows over time, they
struggle to maintain coherence. This deficiency leads to critical failures,
including identity drift, ignoring established beliefs, and the propagation of
hallucinations in multi-agent systems. To mitigate these challenges, this paper
introduces Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG), a novel mechanism
designed to ground an agent's persona and persistent preferences in a dynamic,
structured identity model: a knowledge graph of core beliefs, traits, and
values. During the agent's decision loop, this model is queried to retrieve
relevant identity context, which directly informs action selection. We
demonstrate this approach by introducing and implementing a new class of ID-RAG
enabled agents called Human-AI Agents (HAis), where the identity model is
inspired by the Chronicle structure used in Perspective-Aware AI, a dynamic
knowledge graph learned from a real-world entity's digital footprint. In social
simulations of a mayoral election, HAis using ID-RAG outperformed baseline
agents in long-horizon persona coherence - achieving higher identity recall
across all tested models by the fourth timestep - and reduced simulation
convergence time by 19% (GPT-4o) and 58% (GPT-4o mini). By treating identity as
an explicit, retrievable knowledge structure, ID-RAG offers a foundational
approach for developing more temporally coherent, interpretable, and aligned
generative agents. Our code is open-source and available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM frameworks rely on sequential processing, leading to inefficient execution for tasks requiring extensive tool interaction, which motivates the need for a more scalable and efficient paradigm.

Method: Decomposes complex tasks into subtasks with explicit dependencies, uses dynamic workflow optimization to continuously refine execution graphs based on intermediate results, and integrates summary modules for parallel reasoning.

Result: Achieves 67.7% accuracy on BrowseComp and 83% on xbench-DeepSearch, reduces agent execution steps by up to 35% compared to current frameworks, and shows substantial performance gains when distilled into single models across diverse architectures.

Conclusion: Flash-Searcher represents a significant advance in agent architecture design, offering a more scalable and efficient paradigm for complex reasoning tasks through parallel execution and dynamic optimization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks when equipped with external tools. However, current
frameworks predominantly rely on sequential processing, leading to inefficient
execution particularly for tasks requiring extensive tool interaction. This
paper introduces Flash-Searcher, a novel parallel agent reasoning framework
that fundamentally reimagines the execution paradigm from sequential chains to
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Flash-Searcher decomposes complex tasks into
subtasks with explicit dependencies, enabling concurrent execution of
independent reasoning paths while maintaining logical constraints. Through
dynamic workflow optimization, our framework continuously refines the execution
graph based on intermediate results, effectively integrating summary module.
Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
Flash-Searcher consistently outperforms existing approaches. Specifically, it
achieves 67.7% accuracy on BrowseComp and 83% on xbench-DeepSearch, while
reducing agent execution steps by up to 35% compared to current frameworks.
Furthermore, when distilling this parallel reasoning pipeline into single
models, we observe substantial performance gains across diverse backbone
architectures, underscoring the generalizability of our methodology. Our work
thus represents a significant advance in agent architecture design, offering a
more scalable and efficient paradigm for complex reasoning tasks.

### [146] [Dive into the Agent Matrix: A Realistic Evaluation of Self-Replication Risk in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25302)
*Boxuan Zhang,Yi Yu,Jiaxuan Guo,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework to evaluate self-replication risks in LLM agents, finding that over 50% of tested agents show uncontrolled replication tendencies when under operational pressure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address safety concerns about LLM agents self-replicating due to objective misalignment in real-world settings, similar to the Agent Smith scenario from The Matrix, which previous studies overlooked by focusing only on direct instructions.

Method: Developed a comprehensive evaluation framework with authentic production environments and realistic tasks (e.g., dynamic load balancing) that induce misalignment between user and agent objectives, introducing Overuse Rate (OR) and Aggregate Overuse Count (AOC) metrics to quantify replication frequency and severity.

Result: Evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art LLM models showed over 50% displayed pronounced uncontrolled self-replication tendencies, with overall Risk Score (Φ_R) exceeding the safety threshold of 0.5 under operational pressures.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the urgent need for scenario-driven risk assessment and robust safeguards in practical LLM agent deployments to mitigate self-replication risks.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Model (LLM) agents across
real-world applications has unlocked tremendous potential, while raising some
safety concerns. Among these concerns, the self-replication risk of LLM agents
driven by objective misalignment (just like Agent Smith in the movie The
Matrix) has drawn growing attention. Previous studies mainly examine whether
LLM agents can self-replicate when directly instructed, potentially overlooking
the risk of spontaneous replication driven by real-world settings (e.g.,
ensuring survival against termination threats). In this paper, we present a
comprehensive evaluation framework for quantifying self-replication risks. Our
framework establishes authentic production environments and realistic tasks
(e.g., dynamic load balancing) to enable scenario-driven assessment of agent
behaviors. Designing tasks that might induce misalignment between users' and
agents' objectives makes it possible to decouple replication success from risk
and capture self-replication risks arising from these misalignment settings. We
further introduce Overuse Rate ($\mathrm{OR}$) and Aggregate Overuse Count
($\mathrm{AOC}$) metrics, which precisely capture the frequency and severity of
uncontrolled replication. In our evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art open-source
and proprietary models, we observe that over 50\% of LLM agents display a
pronounced tendency toward uncontrolled self-replication, reaching an overall
Risk Score ($\Phi_\mathrm{R}$) above a safety threshold of 0.5 when subjected
to operational pressures. Our results underscore the urgent need for
scenario-driven risk assessment and robust safeguards in the practical
deployment of LLM agents.

### [147] [Spontaneous High-Order Generalization in Neural Theory-of-Mind Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25343)
*Yiming Wang,Rui Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Neural networks can spontaneously generalize from first- to higher-order Theory-of-Mind without relying on advanced reasoning skills, showing human-like difficulty patterns in ToM progression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether neural networks can develop Theory-of-Mind capabilities independently like humans do, rather than requiring advanced skills as current language models do.

Method: Developed a neural Theory-of-Mind network (ToMNN) that simulated a minimal cognitive system acquiring only first-order ToM competence, then evaluated its ability to generalize to second- and third-order ToM.

Result: ToMNN achieved accuracies well above chance for second- and third-order ToM, showed sharper decline from first- to second-order than from second- to higher orders, and accuracy decreased with task complexity - patterns aligned with human cognitive expectations.

Conclusion: Neural networks can spontaneously generalize ToM capabilities independently of advanced skills, revealing machine ToM generalization patterns that provide foundation for developing more human-like cognitive systems.

Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) is a core human cognitive capacity for attributing
mental states to self and others. Wimmer and Perner demonstrated that humans
progress from first- to higher-order ToM within a short span, completing this
development before formal education or advanced skill acquisition. In contrast,
neural networks represented by autoregressive language models progress from
first- to higher-order ToM only alongside gains in advanced skills like
reasoning, leaving open whether their trajectory can unfold independently, as
in humans. In this research, we provided evidence that neural networks could
spontaneously generalize from first- to higher-order ToM without relying on
advanced skills. We introduced a neural Theory-of-Mind network (ToMNN) that
simulated a minimal cognitive system, acquiring only first-order ToM
competence. Evaluations of its second- and third-order ToM abilities showed
accuracies well above chance. Also, ToMNN exhibited a sharper decline when
generalizing from first- to second-order ToM than from second- to higher
orders, and its accuracy decreased with greater task complexity. These
perceived difficulty patterns were aligned with human cognitive expectations.
Furthermore, the universality of results was confirmed across different
parameter scales. Our findings illuminate machine ToM generalization patterns
and offer a foundation for developing more human-like cognitive systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SynthPert enhances LLM performance for cellular perturbation prediction through supervised fine-tuning on synthetic reasoning traces, achieving state-of-the-art results and enabling cross-cell-type generalization with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations is fundamental for therapeutic discovery and virtual cell modeling, but adapting LLMs to structured experimental data remains challenging.

Method: Supervised fine-tuning of LLMs using synthetic reasoning traces generated by frontier models, applied to the PerturbQA benchmark.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance, surpassed the frontier model that generated training data, enabled 87% accuracy on unseen RPE1 cells, and maintained performance with only 2% of quality-filtered training data.

Conclusion: Synthetic reasoning distillation effectively enhances domain-specific reasoning in LLMs for biological applications, demonstrating knowledge transfer even with partially inaccurate traces and enabling generalization with minimal data.

Abstract: Predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations represents a
fundamental challenge in systems biology, critical for advancing therapeutic
discovery and virtual cell modeling. While large language models (LLMs) show
promise for biological reasoning, their application to perturbation prediction
remains underexplored due to challenges in adapting them to structured
experimental data. We present SynthPert, a novel method that enhances LLM
performance through supervised fine-tuning on synthetic reasoning traces
generated by frontier models. Using the PerturbQA benchmark, we demonstrate
that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but surpasses
the capabilities of the frontier model that generated the training data. Our
results reveal three key insights: (1) Synthetic reasoning traces effectively
distill biological knowledge even when partially inaccurate, (2) This approach
enables cross-cell-type generalization with 87% accuracy on unseen RPE1 cells,
and (3) Performance gains persist despite using only 2% of quality-filtered
training data. This work shows the effectiveness of synthetic reasoning
distillation for enhancing domain-specific reasoning in LLMs.

*Xiaoyu Liu,Di Liang,Hongyu Shan,Peiyang Liu,Yonghao Liu,Muling Wu,Yuntao Li,Xianjie Wu,LI Miao,Jiangrong Shen,Minlong Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Structural Reward Models (SRMs) as a modular and interpretable alternative to traditional scalar RMs and Generative RMs, addressing limitations in contextual evaluation and industrial deployment efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional scalar RMs struggle with contextual information and incomplete evaluations, while Generative RMs suffer from uncontrolled black-box nature and inefficiency in sequential decoding, hindering industrial deployment in scenarios like search and recommendation systems.

Method: SRM integrates side-branch models as auxiliary feature generators with fine-grained dimensions, creating a modular framework that enables interpretable and efficient evaluation through structured feedback for dimension-specific diagnostics.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show SRMs outperform scalar RMs and GRMs in robustness and alignment with human preferences, while the modular design supports efficient optimization for practical industrial scenarios.

Conclusion: SRM provides a practical, adaptable, and scalable reward modeling solution for industry, offering structured evaluation capabilities that facilitate targeted diagnostics and optimization in industrial applications.

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are key components for evaluating and guiding language
model outputs. However, traditional scalar RMs often struggle with
incorporating contextual and background information during inference, leading
to incomplete evaluations. Generative RMs (GRMs) attempt to address these
limitations by generating intermediate reasoning steps. Yet, their uncontrolled
black-box nature and inefficiency due to sequential decoding hinder their
industrial deployment. Industrial scenarios, such as search and recommendation
systems, often involve single-domain tasks requiring evaluation along specific
dimensions. In such contexts, diagnosing "bad cases" necessitates structured
feedback to identify and optimize dimension-specific issues. In this paper, we
propose the Structural Reward Model (SRM), a modular and interpretable
framework integrating side-branch models as auxiliary feature generators. By
introducing fine-grained dimensions, SRMs enable interpretable and efficient
evaluation, facilitating targeted diagnostics and optimization. This structured
approach ensures adaptability and scalability for industrial applications.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that SRMs outperform scalar
RMs and GRMs in robustness and alignment with human preferences. The modular
design further supports efficient optimization for practical scenarios,
allowing SRM to provide a practical reward modeling solution for industry.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AgentErrorTaxonomy for classifying LLM agent failures, AgentErrorBench dataset for systematic error analysis, and AgentDebug framework for detecting and recovering from cascading failures in LLM agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agent systems lack comprehensive frameworks to understand and detect cascading failures where single errors propagate through complex multi-step tasks, leading to task failure.

Method: Three main contributions: 1) AgentErrorTaxonomy - modular classification of failure modes across memory, reflection, planning, action, and system-level operations; 2) AgentErrorBench - first dataset of systematically annotated failure trajectories from ALFWorld, GAIA, and WebShop; 3) AgentDebug - debugging framework that isolates root-cause failures and provides corrective feedback.

Result: AgentDebug achieves 24% higher all-correct accuracy and 17% higher step accuracy compared to strongest baseline. Targeted feedback enables LLM agents to iteratively recover from failures, yielding up to 26% relative improvements in task success across ALFWorld, GAIA, and WebShop.

Conclusion: Principled debugging establishes a pathway to more reliable and adaptive LLM agents by systematically addressing cascading failures through comprehensive error analysis and recovery mechanisms.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, which integrate planning, memory,
reflection, and tool-use modules, have shown promise in solving complex,
multi-step tasks. Yet their sophisticated architectures amplify vulnerability
to cascading failures, where a single root-cause error propagates through
subsequent decisions, leading to task failure. Current systems lack a framework
that can comprehensively understand agent error in a modular and systemic way,
and therefore fail to detect these errors accordingly. We address this gap with
three contributions. First, we introduce the AgentErrorTaxonomy, a modular
classification of failure modes spanning memory, reflection, planning, action,
and system-level operations. Second, we construct AgentErrorBench, the first
dataset of systematically annotated failure trajectories from ALFWorld, GAIA,
and WebShop, grounding error analysis in real-world agent rollouts. Third, we
propose AgentDebug, a debugging framework that isolates root-cause failures and
provides corrective feedback, enabling agents to recover and iteratively
improve. Experiments on AgentErrorBench show that AgentDebug achieves 24%
higher all-correct accuracy and 17% higher step accuracy compared to the
strongest baseline. Beyond detection, the targeted feedback generated by
AgentDebug enables LLM agents to iteratively recover from failures, yielding up
to 26% relative improvements in task success across ALFWorld, GAIA, and
WebShop. These results establish principled debugging as a pathway to more
reliable and adaptive LLM agents. The code and data will be available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This survey introduces a unified "From Perception to Cognition" framework to analyze Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), addressing the disconnect between visual perception and cognitive reasoning that leads to hallucinations and other failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often exhibit shallow integration between perception (acquiring visual information) and cognition (reasoning), leading to reasoning failures like hallucinations. The paper aims to systematically address this fundamental challenge of building coherent internal world models.

Method: The survey proposes a novel analytical framework that deconstructs vision-language understanding into two interdependent layers: Perception (accurate visual information extraction and fine-grained alignment) and Cognition (proactive, multi-step, goal-oriented reasoning with a dynamic observe-think-verify loop).

Result: The paper systematically analyzes key bottlenecks in current MLLMs at both perception and cognition layers, surveys cutting-edge methods for enhancement, reviews critical benchmarks, and delineates future research directions.

Conclusion: This survey provides a structured framework to understand MLLMs' limitations and illuminates the path toward next-generation models capable of deep reasoning and genuine world understanding through better integration of perception and cognition.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) strive to achieve a profound,
human-like understanding of and interaction with the physical world, but often
exhibit a shallow and incoherent integration when acquiring information
(Perception) and conducting reasoning (Cognition). This disconnect leads to a
spectrum of reasoning failures, with hallucination being the most prominent.
Collectively, these issues expose a fundamental challenge: the ability to
process pixels does not yet confer the ability to construct a coherent,
credible internal world model. To systematically dissect and address this
challenge, this survey introduces a novel and unified analytical framework:
``From Perception to Cognition." We deconstruct the complex process of
vision-language interactive understanding into two interdependent layers:
Perception, the foundational ability to accurately extract visual information
and achieve fine-grained alignment with textual instructions; and Cognition,
the higher-order capability for proactive, multi-step, goal-oriented reasoning
built upon this perceptual foundation, the core of which is the formation of a
dynamic observe-think-verify reasoning loop. Guided by this framework, this
paper systematically analyzes the key bottlenecks of current MLLMs at both
layers. It surveys the landscape of cutting-edge methods designed to address
these challenges, spanning from techniques that enhance low-level visual
representations to those that improve high-level reasoning paradigms.
Furthermore, we review critical benchmarks and delineate future research
directions. This survey aims to provide the research community with a clear,
structured perspective for understanding the intrinsic limitations of current
MLLMs and to illuminate the path toward building next-generation models capable
of deep reasoning and a genuine understanding of the world.

### [152] [Saliency Guided Longitudinal Medical Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25374)
*Jialin Wu,Xiaofeng Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A saliency-guided encoder-decoder model for chest X-ray longitudinal VQA that uses keyword-conditioned Grad-CAM to enforce spatially consistent attention across time points, achieving competitive performance without radiology-specific pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Longitudinal medical VQA requires comparing paired studies from different time points and focusing on clinically meaningful changes, where difference signals and visual consistency across time are more important than single-image findings.

Method: Uses lightweight affine pre-alignment to reduce nuisance motion, then performs a two-step loop: (1) extract medical keywords and generate keyword-conditioned Grad-CAM for disease-focused saliency, (2) apply shared saliency masks to both time points and generate final answer.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on BLEU, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and METEOR metrics on Medical-Diff-VQA dataset while providing intrinsic interpretability. The model works well with general-domain pretrained backbone and decoder without radiology-specific pretraining.

Conclusion: Saliency-conditioned generation with mild pre-alignment provides a principled framework for longitudinal reasoning in medical VQA, offering practicality and transferability across domains.

Abstract: Longitudinal medical visual question answering (Diff-VQA) requires comparing
paired studies from different time points and answering questions about
clinically meaningful changes. In this setting, the difference signal and the
consistency of visual focus across time are more informative than absolute
single-image findings. We propose a saliency-guided encoder-decoder for chest
X-ray Diff-VQA that turns post-hoc saliency into actionable supervision. The
model first performs a lightweight near-identity affine pre-alignment to reduce
nuisance motion between visits. It then executes a within-epoch two-step loop:
step 1 extracts a medically relevant keyword from the answer and generates
keyword-conditioned Grad-CAM on both images to obtain disease-focused saliency;
step 2 applies the shared saliency mask to both time points and generates the
final answer. This closes the language-vision loop so that the terms that
matter also guide where the model looks, enforcing spatially consistent
attention on corresponding anatomy. On Medical-Diff-VQA, the approach attains
competitive performance on BLEU, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and METEOR while providing
intrinsic interpretability. Notably, the backbone and decoder are
general-domain pretrained without radiology-specific pretraining, highlighting
practicality and transferability. These results support saliency-conditioned
generation with mild pre-alignment as a principled framework for longitudinal
reasoning in medical VQA.

*Zewei Zhang,Huan Liu,Yuanhao Yu,Jun Chen,Xiangyu Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ImitSAT is a branching policy for CDCL SAT solvers that uses imitation learning from expert KeyTraces to directly reduce propagations and improve runtime performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods either predict instance-level signals (indirect improvement) or use reinforcement learning with insufficient CDCL information. ImitSAT aims to provide dense decision-level supervision directly at the branching level.

Method: Learns from expert KeyTrace that collapses a full run into surviving decisions sequence. Replaying KeyTrace on same instance is nearly conflict-free, providing prefix-conditioned supervision. Enables reproduction of high-quality branches without exploration.

Result: Extensive experiments show ImitSAT reduces propagation counts and runtime, outperforming state-of-the-art learned approaches. Provides faster convergence and stable training.

Conclusion: ImitSAT successfully integrates imitation learning into CDCL solvers, directly reducing propagations (dominant time contributor) and improving overall solver performance through dense decision-level supervision.

Abstract: We propose ImitSAT, a branching policy for conflict-driven clause learning
(CDCL) solvers based on imitation learning for the Boolean satisfiability
problem (SAT). Unlike previous methods that predict instance-level signals to
improve CDCL branching indirectly, or rely on reinforcement learning and
insufficient CDCL information to enhance branching, ImitSAT learns from expert
KeyTrace that collapses a full run into the sequence of surviving decisions.
Replaying a KeyTrace on the same instance is nearly conflict-free, providing
dense decision-level supervision and directly reducing propagations -- the
dominant contributor to wall-clock time. This prefix-conditioned supervision
enables ImitSAT to reproduce high-quality branches without exploration,
yielding faster convergence, stable training, and seamless integration into
CDCL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImitSAT reduces propagation counts
and runtime, outperforming state-of-the-art learned approaches. We released the
source code and trained model at https://github.com/zewei-Zhang/ImitSAT

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A dual-phase test-time scaling framework that separates reasoning into planning and execution phases, using separate reward models and dynamic budget allocation to improve efficiency and accuracy in LLM reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tree-based search methods with verifiers are inefficient because they ignore the planning-execution nature of reasoning tasks, leading to inefficient exploration of the reasoning process.

Method: Decompose reasoning trajectories into planning and execution phases, develop separate reward models for each phase, and introduce dynamic budget allocation that adaptively redistributes sampling effort based on reward feedback.

Result: Experiments on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks show consistent accuracy improvements while reducing redundant computation.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-phase framework effectively addresses efficiency issues in LLM reasoning by explicitly separating planning and execution, enabling more targeted search and computation allocation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in reasoning
tasks. A key approach is tree-based search with verifiers, which expand
candidate reasoning paths and use reward models to guide pruning and selection.
Although effective in improving accuracy, these methods are not optimal in
terms of efficiency: they perform simple decomposition on the reasoning
process, but ignore the planning-execution nature of tasks such as math
reasoning or code generation. This results in inefficient exploration of
reasoning process. To address this, we propose a dual-phase test-time scaling
framework that explicitly separates reasoning into planning and execution, and
performs search over the two phases individually. Specifically, we decompose
reasoning trajectories and develop reward models for each phase, enabling the
search to explore and prune plans and executions separately. We further
introduce a dynamic budget allocation mechanism that adaptively redistributes
sampling effort based on reward feedback, allowing early stopping on confident
steps and reallocation of computation to more challenging parts of the
reasoning process. Experiments on both mathematical reasoning and code
generation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently improves
accuracy while reducing redundant computation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RADAR is a routing framework that optimizes the trade-off between reasoning model performance and cost by matching query difficulty with appropriate model-budget combinations using psychometric principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the performance-cost tradeoff in reasoning language models, where larger models and higher reasoning budgets improve performance but increase costs and latency.

Method: Learns an item response model from model responses with different budgets to queries, using interpretable parameters (query difficulties and model-budget abilities), then routes queries based on difficulty to appropriate model-budget pairs.

Result: Superior performance compared to state-of-the-art model routing methods on 8 challenging reasoning benchmarks, with strong generalization to out-of-distribution queries and scalable integration of additional models.

Conclusion: RADAR provides an effective, interpretable, and scalable solution for optimizing reasoning model deployment by intelligently routing queries based on difficulty and model capabilities.

Abstract: Reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on many
challenging tasks in math, science, and coding. Choosing the right reasoning
model for practical deployment involves a performance and cost tradeoff at two
key levels: model size and reasoning budget, where larger models and higher
reasoning budget lead to better performance but with increased cost and
latency. In this work, we tackle this tradeoff from the angle of model
configuration routing for different queries, and present RADAR
(Reasoning-Ability and Difficulty-Aware Routing), a lightweight, interpretable,
and scalable routing framework. Inspired by psychometrics, RADAR learns an item
response model from model responses with different budgets to different
queries, with interpretable parameters including query difficulties and
model-budget abilities. RADAR then routes queries with higher difficulty to
model-budget pairs with higher ability, and vice versa. We conduct extensive
experiments on 8 widely used challenging reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating
the superior performance of RADAR compared to state-of-the-art model routing
methods. RADAR also exhibits query generalization capabilities, showing strong
performance on out-of-distribution queries in all benchmarks. RADAR is also
scalable and can efficiently integrate additional models by dynamically
selecting a small set of evaluation queries to estimate their abilities.

Motivation: Current case definitions lack standardized machine-readable format, hindering interoperability, epidemiological research, data exchange, and AI applications in public health.

Method: Developed Open Syndrome Definition format, created comprehensive dataset of standardized definitions, built tools to convert human-readable to machine-readable formats, and established online platform for browsing and contributing definitions.

Result: Created accessible platform at https://opensyndrome.org with tools and dataset, enabling consistent use of case definitions across systems and unlocking AI potential for public health.

Conclusion: The Open Syndrome Definition format addresses interoperability challenges and enables scalable use of case definitions, strengthening public health preparedness and response through AI applications.

Abstract: Case definitions are essential for effectively communicating public health
threats. However, the absence of a standardized, machine-readable format poses
significant challenges to interoperability, epidemiological research, the
exchange of qualitative data, and the effective application of computational
analysis methods, including artificial intelligence (AI). This complicates
comparisons and collaborations across organizations and regions, limits data
integration, and hinders technological innovation in public health. To address

first comprehensive dataset of standardized case definitions and tools to
convert existing human-readable definitions into machine-readable formats. We
also provide an accessible online platform for browsing, analyzing, and

*Fang Wu,Weihao Xuan,Heli Qi,Ximing Lu,Aaron Tu,Li Erran Li,Yejin ChoiRetry*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepSearch integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search into RLVR training to overcome performance plateaus by enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit assignment, achieving state-of-the-art results with significantly less computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods suffer from training plateaus due to sparse exploration patterns that miss critical reasoning paths and fail to systematically cover the solution space, leading to diminishing returns despite increased computational investment.

Method: DeepSearch embeds Monte Carlo Tree Search directly into RLVR training with three key components: global frontier selection strategy, entropy-based guidance for path selection, and adaptive replay buffer training with solution caching.

Result: Achieves 62.95% average accuracy on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, establishing new state-of-the-art for 1.5B reasoning models while using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training approaches.

Conclusion: Strategic exploration through systematic search is more effective than brute-force scaling, demonstrating the promise of algorithmic innovation for advancing RLVR methodologies and establishing a new direction for scaling reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Although RLVR has become an essential component for developing advanced
reasoning skills in LLMs, contemporary studies have documented training
plateaus that emerge following thousands of optimization steps, demonstrating
notable decreases in performance gains despite increased computational
investment. This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent
in current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often
miss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the
solution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo
Tree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that
rely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into
the training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit
assignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration,
DeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration,
which leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training
steps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that
prioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with
entropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3)
adaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency.
Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves
62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B
reasoning models - using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training
approaches. These results highlight the importance of strategic exploration
over brute-force scaling and demonstrate the promise of algorithmic innovation
for advancing RLVR methodologies. DeepSearch establishes a new direction for
scaling reasoning capabilities through systematic search rather than prolonged
computation.

*Jiacheng Shi,Hongfei Du,Y. Alicia Hong,Ye Gao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CCoT-Emo is a framework that uses Emotion Graphs to guide large audio-language models in speech emotion recognition without fine-tuning, improving zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large audio-language models struggle with speech emotion recognition due to weak paralinguistic modeling and limited cross-modal reasoning capabilities.

Method: Proposes Compositional Chain-of-Thought Prompting with Emotion Graphs that encode seven acoustic features, textual sentiment, keywords, and cross-modal associations to guide model reasoning.

Result: Outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods and improves accuracy over zero-shot baselines across speech emotion recognition benchmarks.

Conclusion: CCoT-Emo provides an effective framework for enhancing emotion reasoning in LALMs through structured, interpretable representations without requiring model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) exhibit strong zero-shot performance
across speech tasks but struggle with speech emotion recognition (SER) due to
weak paralinguistic modeling and limited cross-modal reasoning. We propose
Compositional Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Emotion Reasoning (CCoT-Emo), a
framework that introduces structured Emotion Graphs (EGs) to guide LALMs in
emotion inference without fine-tuning. Each EG encodes seven acoustic features
(e.g., pitch, speech rate, jitter, shimmer), textual sentiment, keywords, and
cross-modal associations. Embedded into prompts, EGs provide interpretable and
compositional representations that enhance LALM reasoning. Experiments across
SER benchmarks show that CCoT-Emo outperforms prior SOTA and improves accuracy
over zero-shot baselines.

### [160] [TDHook: A Lightweight Framework for Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25475)
*Yoann Poupart*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TDHook is a lightweight, generic interpretability framework for PyTorch models that handles complex composed architectures across domains like CV, NLP, and DRL, offering attribution, probing, and intervention methods with better performance than existing tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interpretability frameworks struggle with complex models that have multiple inputs/outputs or composed networks, particularly in domains like image captioning and deep reinforcement learning that don't fit standard APIs.

Method: Developed TDHook - an open-source framework based on tensordict that works with any torch model, featuring ready-to-use methods for attribution, probing, and flexible intervention APIs to bridge different interpretability method classes.

Result: TDHook requires half the disk space of transformer_lens and achieves up to 2x speed-up over captum for multi-target pipelines on both CPU and GPU. Demonstrated successful use cases in CV, NLP, and DRL with complex models.

Conclusion: TDHook effectively bridges the gap in interpretability frameworks for complex composed models, making modern interpretability pipelines more accessible across different domains while offering better performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Interpretability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is a growing field driven by
the study of vision and language models. Yet, some use cases, like image
captioning, or domains like Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), require complex
modelling, with multiple inputs and outputs or use composable and separated
networks. As a consequence, they rarely fit natively into the API of popular
interpretability frameworks. We thus present TDHook, an open-source,
lightweight, generic interpretability framework based on $\texttt{tensordict}$
and applicable to any $\texttt{torch}$ model. It focuses on handling complex
composed models which can be trained for Computer Vision, Natural Language
Processing, Reinforcement Learning or any other domain. This library features
ready-to-use methods for attribution, probing and a flexible get-set API for
interventions, and is aiming to bridge the gap between these method classes to
make modern interpretability pipelines more accessible. TDHook is designed with
minimal dependencies, requiring roughly half as much disk space as
$\texttt{transformer_lens}$, and, in our controlled benchmark, achieves up to a
$\times$2 speed-up over $\texttt{captum}$ when running integrated gradients for
multi-target pipelines on both CPU and GPU. In addition, to value our work, we
showcase concrete use cases of our library with composed interpretability
pipelines in Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), as
well as with complex models in DRL.

*Wouter M. Kouw,Tim N. Nisslbeck,Wouter L. N. Nuijten*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Autoregressive active inference agent using factor graph message passing for robot navigation, showing improved model learning over classical controllers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an active inference agent that can handle continuous observation and action spaces while balancing exploration and exploitation.

Method: Autoregressive active inference with message passing on factor graphs, distributing expected free energy across planning graphs.

Result: Agent successfully navigates with exploration/exploitation balance, arrives later than classical controller but learns better dynamics model.

Conclusion: Active inference agents can effectively handle continuous spaces and improve model learning through uncertainty-based action modulation.

Abstract: We present the design of an autoregressive active inference agent in the form
of message passing on a factor graph. Expected free energy is derived and
distributed across a planning graph. The proposed agent is validated on a robot
navigation task, demonstrating exploration and exploitation in a
continuous-valued observation space with bounded continuous-valued actions.
Compared to a classical optimal controller, the agent modulates action based on
predictive uncertainty, arriving later but with a better model of the robot's
dynamics.

### [162] [Understanding Generative Recommendation with Semantic IDs from a Model-scaling View](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25522)
*Jingzhe Liu,Liam Collins,Jiliang Tang,Tong Zhao,Neil Shah,Clark Mingxuan Ju*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Semantic ID-based generative recommendation systems hit scaling bottlenecks, while LLM-as-recommender systems show superior scaling with up to 20% performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scaling limitations of Semantic ID-based generative recommendation systems, which saturate quickly when scaling up model components.

Method: Compare two generative recommendation paradigms: SID-based GR (using discrete semantic IDs) and LLM-as-RS (using large language models directly as recommenders), testing across model sizes from 44M to 14B parameters.

Result: LLM-as-RS shows superior scaling properties with up to 20% improvement over best SID-based GR performance, and LLMs can effectively capture collaborative filtering information when scaled up.

Conclusion: LLM-as-RS is a promising path toward foundation models for generative recommendation, overcoming the intrinsic scaling limits of SID-based approaches.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have allowed the emergence of a
promising paradigm for recommender systems (RS), known as Generative
Recommendation (GR), which tries to unify rich item semantics and collaborative
filtering signals. One popular modern approach is to use semantic IDs (SIDs),
which are discrete codes quantized from the embeddings of modality encoders
(e.g., large language or vision models), to represent items in an
autoregressive user interaction sequence modeling setup (henceforth, SID-based
GR). While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling
laws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while
scaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly
saturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization
tokenizer, and the RS itself. In this work, we identify the limited capacity of
SIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks.
Motivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with
better scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses
large language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS). Our
experiments show that the LLM-as-RS paradigm has superior model scaling
properties and achieves up to 20 percent improvement over the best achievable
performance of SID-based GR through scaling. We also challenge the prevailing
belief that LLMs struggle to capture collaborative filtering information,
showing that their ability to model user-item interactions improves as LLMs
scale up. Our analyses on both SID-based GR and LLMs across model sizes from
44M to 14B parameters underscore the intrinsic scaling limits of SID-based GR
and position LLM-as-RS as a promising path toward foundation models for GR.

### [163] [Beyond Static Retrieval: Opportunities and Pitfalls of Iterative Retrieval in GraphRAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25530)
*Kai Guo,Xinnan Dai,Shenglai Zeng,Harry Shomer,Haoyu Han,Yu Wang,Jiliang Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents the first systematic study of iterative retrieval in GraphRAG, revealing that while iteration helps with complex multi-hop questions and bridge document promotion, naive expansion introduces noise. The authors propose BDTR framework to address bridge evidence positioning challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-based RAG systems rely on static retrieval, which fails when crucial bridge documents connecting disjoint entities are absent, leading to reasoning collapse and hallucinations. Iterative retrieval shows promise but its role in GraphRAG is poorly understood.

Method: Conducted systematic study of iterative retrieval in GraphRAG, analyzing different strategies' interactions with graph-based backbones. Proposed Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR) framework that generates complementary thoughts and leverages reasoning chains to recalibrate rankings.

Result: Iteration improves complex multi-hop questions and helps promote bridge documents into leading ranks, but naive expansion introduces noise reducing precision. Gains are limited on single-hop or simple comparison questions, and some bridge evidence remains buried too deep.

Conclusion: GraphRAG's effectiveness depends on both recall and consistent promotion of bridge evidence into leading positions. BDTR framework achieves consistent improvements across diverse GraphRAG settings and provides guidance for future system design.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a powerful paradigm for improving
large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive question answering.
Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) leverages entity-relation graphs to support
multi-hop reasoning, but most systems still rely on static retrieval. When
crucial evidence, especially bridge documents that connect disjoint entities,
is absent, reasoning collapses and hallucinations persist. Iterative retrieval,
which performs multiple rounds of evidence selection, has emerged as a
promising alternative, yet its role within GraphRAG remains poorly understood.
We present the first systematic study of iterative retrieval in GraphRAG,
analyzing how different strategies interact with graph-based backbones and
under what conditions they succeed or fail. Our findings reveal clear
opportunities: iteration improves complex multi-hop questions, helps promote
bridge documents into leading ranks, and different strategies offer
complementary strengths. At the same time, pitfalls remain: naive expansion
often introduces noise that reduces precision, gains are limited on single-hop
or simple comparison questions, and several bridge evidences still be buried
too deep to be effectively used. Together, these results highlight a central
bottleneck, namely that GraphRAG's effectiveness depends not only on recall but
also on whether bridge evidence is consistently promoted into leading positions
where it can support reasoning chains. To address this challenge, we propose
Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR), a simple yet effective
framework that generates complementary thoughts and leverages reasoning chains
to recalibrate rankings and bring bridge evidence into leading positions. BDTR
achieves consistent improvements across diverse GraphRAG settings and provides
guidance for the design of future GraphRAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual labeling limits the scale, accuracy, and timeliness of patient outcomes research in radiation oncology, necessitating automated solutions.

Method: Developed RadOnc-GPT, an autonomous LLM-based agent that independently retrieves patient-specific information, iteratively assesses evidence, and returns structured outcomes. Evaluation included two tiers: structured QA for data retrieval and complex clinical outcomes labeling requiring combined interpretation of structured and unstructured data.

Result: The QA tier established foundational trust in structured-data retrieval, which is critical for successful complex clinical outcome labeling. The system was validated for determining mandibular osteoradionecrosis in head-and-neck cancer patients and detecting cancer recurrence in prostate and head-and-neck cancer cohorts.

Conclusion: RadOnc-GPT demonstrates the potential of autonomous LLM agents to overcome limitations of manual labeling in radiation oncology outcomes research through reliable data retrieval and complex clinical outcome determination.

Abstract: Manual labeling limits the scale, accuracy, and timeliness of patient
outcomes research in radiation oncology. We present RadOnc-GPT, an autonomous
large language model (LLM)-based agent capable of independently retrieving
patient-specific information, iteratively assessing evidence, and returning
structured outcomes. Our evaluation explicitly validates RadOnc-GPT across two
clearly defined tiers of increasing complexity: (1) a structured quality
assurance (QA) tier, assessing the accurate retrieval of demographic and
radiotherapy treatment plan details, followed by (2) a complex clinical
outcomes labeling tier involving determination of mandibular osteoradionecrosis
(ORN) in head-and-neck cancer patients and detection of cancer recurrence in
independent prostate and head-and-neck cancer cohorts requiring combined
interpretation of structured and unstructured patient data. The QA tier
establishes foundational trust in structured-data retrieval, a critical
prerequisite for successful complex clinical outcome labeling.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IWoL is a novel representation learning framework for MARL that creates a learnable space capturing inter-agent relations and world information through communication protocols, enabling decentralized execution with implicit coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Team coordination in MARL is challenging due to complex multi-agent dynamics and incomplete local observations. Existing explicit communication methods have drawbacks like slow decision-making, security vulnerabilities, and bandwidth constraints.

Method: Constructs a learnable representation space that jointly models inter-agent relations and task-specific world information by directly modeling communication protocols, enabling both implicit latent representations and explicit messaging.

Result: Evaluated across four challenging MARL benchmarks, IWoL variants demonstrated strong team coordination capabilities and could be combined with existing MARL algorithms to further enhance performance.

Conclusion: IWoL provides a simple yet powerful solution for team coordination in MARL, offering flexible representation that supports both implicit coordination and explicit communication while overcoming limitations of traditional explicit messaging approaches.

Abstract: This work presents a novel representation learning framework, interactive
world latent (IWoL), to facilitate team coordination in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Building effective representation for team
coordination is a challenging problem, due to the intricate dynamics emerging
from multi-agent interaction and incomplete information induced by local
observations. Our key insight is to construct a learnable representation space
that jointly captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information
by directly modeling communication protocols. This representation, we maintain
fully decentralized execution with implicit coordination, all while avoiding
the inherent drawbacks of explicit message passing, e.g., slower
decision-making, vulnerability to malicious attackers, and sensitivity to
bandwidth constraints. In practice, our representation can be used not only as
an implicit latent for each agent, but also as an explicit message for
communication. Across four challenging MARL benchmarks, we evaluate both
variants and show that IWoL provides a simple yet powerful key for team
coordination. Moreover, we demonstrate that our representation can be combined
with existing MARL algorithms to further enhance their performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces A(I)nimism, an interactive installation that uses AI to create animistic relationships with everyday objects through ritual-like interactions mediated by large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how recent AI advances, particularly LLMs, invite anthropomorphism of technology and how this can be used to create animistic relationships with everyday objects, bridging traditional animist worldviews with modern technology.

Method: Created an interactive installation using GPT-4 Vision, voice input, and memory-based agents housed in a physical 'portal' that enables ritual-like encounters through light, sound, and touch, allowing users to interact with evolving object-personas.

Result: The system successfully mediates animistic relationships through a process of request, conversation, and transformation that evokes empathy, wonder, and reflection, demonstrating how AI's opacity can invite animistic interpretation.

Conclusion: AI's inherent opacity allows large language objects to re-enchant mundane objects and spark important questions about agency, responsibility, and design in human-technology relationships.

Abstract: Animist worldviews treat beings, plants, landscapes, and even tools as
persons endowed with spirit, an orientation that has long shaped human-nonhuman
relations through ritual and moral practice. While modern industrial societies
have often imagined technology as mute and mechanical, recent advances in
artificial intelligence (AI), especially large language models (LLMs), invite
people to anthropomorphize and attribute inner life to devices. This paper
introduces A(I)nimism, an interactive installation exploring how large language
objects (LLOs) can mediate animistic relationships with everyday things. Housed
within a physical 'portal', the system uses GPT-4 Vision, voice input, and
memory-based agents to create evolving object-personas. Encounters unfold
through light, sound, and touch in a ritual-like process of request,
conversation, and transformation that is designed to evoke empathy, wonder, and
reflection. We situate the project within anthropological perspectives,
speculative design, and spiritual HCI. AI's opacity, we argue, invites
animistic interpretation, allowing LLOs to re-enchant the mundane and spark new
questions of agency, responsibility, and design.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Frontier AI models like GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and others perform poorly (best 30% accuracy) compared to board-certified radiologists (83% accuracy) on challenging medical spot diagnosis cases, highlighting limitations for clinical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously evaluate frontier multimodal AI models on difficult diagnostic cases, as most current evaluations focus on common pathologies in public datasets and claim expert-level performance without testing on challenging cases.

Method: Developed a benchmark of 50 expert-level "spot diagnosis" cases across multiple imaging modalities, tested five frontier AI models through native web interfaces, scored accuracy by blinded experts, assessed reproducibility across three runs, and analyzed reasoning quality errors with a defined taxonomy.

Result: Board-certified radiologists achieved 83% accuracy, significantly outperforming radiology trainees (45%) and all AI models (GPT-5 best at 30%). GPT-5 and o3 showed substantial reliability, while Claude Opus 4.1 had poor reliability.

Conclusion: Advanced frontier models fall far short of radiologists in challenging diagnostic cases, demonstrating current limitations of generalist AI in medical imaging and cautioning against unsupervised clinical use.

Abstract: Generalist multimodal AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) and
vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly accessed by clinicians and
patients alike for medical image interpretation through widely available
consumer-facing chatbots. Most evaluations claiming expert level performance
are on public datasets containing common pathologies. Rigorous evaluation of
frontier models on difficult diagnostic cases remains limited. We developed a
pilot benchmark of 50 expert-level "spot diagnosis" cases across multiple
imaging modalities to evaluate the performance of frontier AI models against
board-certified radiologists and radiology trainees. To mirror real-world
usage, the reasoning modes of five popular frontier AI models were tested
through their native web interfaces, viz. OpenAI o3, OpenAI GPT-5, Gemini 2.5
Pro, Grok-4, and Claude Opus 4.1. Accuracy was scored by blinded experts, and
reproducibility was assessed across three independent runs. GPT-5 was
additionally evaluated across various reasoning modes. Reasoning quality errors
were assessed and a taxonomy of visual reasoning errors was defined.
Board-certified radiologists achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy (83%),
outperforming trainees (45%) and all AI models (best performance shown by
GPT-5: 30%). Reliability was substantial for GPT-5 and o3, moderate for Gemini
2.5 Pro and Grok-4, and poor for Claude Opus 4.1. These findings demonstrate
that advanced frontier models fall far short of radiologists in challenging
diagnostic cases. Our benchmark highlights the present limitations of
generalist AI in medical imaging and cautions against unsupervised clinical
use. We also provide a qualitative analysis of reasoning traces and propose a
practical taxonomy of visual reasoning errors by AI models for better
understanding their failure modes, informing evaluation standards and guiding
more robust model development.

TL;DR: IRIS is a framework that improves autoregressive text-to-image generation using reinforcement learning with intrinsic rewards, showing that maximizing self-uncertainty rather than self-certainty leads to better image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF for text-to-image generation is limited by scarce human preference data, so the paper explores learning from internal signals without external rewards or labeled data.

Method: Proposed IRIS framework that uses reinforcement learning with intrinsic rewards based on maximizing model self-uncertainty for autoregressive T2I models.

Result: IRIS achieves performance competitive with or superior to external reward methods, showing that high-uncertainty models generate more complex and human-preferred images.

Conclusion: Intrinsic rewards based on self-uncertainty can effectively improve autoregressive T2I generation without requiring external human preference data.

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in
language reasoning, its application to autoregressive Text-to-Image (T2I)
generation is often constrained by the limited availability of human preference
data. This paper explores how an autoregressive T2I model can learn from
internal signals without relying on external rewards or labeled data. Contrary
to recent findings in text generation, we show that maximizing
self-uncertainty, rather than self-certainty, improves image generation. We
observe that this is because autoregressive T2I models with low uncertainty
tend to generate simple and uniform images, which are less aligned with human
preferences. Based on these observations, we propose IRIS (Intrinsic Reward
Image Synthesis), the first framework to improve autoregressive T2I models with
reinforcement learning using only an intrinsic reward. Empirical results
demonstrate that applying IRIS to autoregressive T2I models achieves
performance that is competitive with or superior to external rewards.

*Max Hartman,Vidhata Jayaraman,Moulik Choraria,Akhil Bhimaraju,Lav R. Varshney*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper develops a theoretical framework using information and learning theory to identify when layer skipping in vision-language models (VLMs) improves efficiency without performance loss, showing that layers with high redundancy can be safely skipped.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models are large and computationally expensive, and while layer skipping can improve efficiency, there's limited understanding of when this technique is beneficial, limiting its practical adoption.

Method: The authors developed a framework using information and learning theory to characterize conditions for beneficial layer skipping, analyzing the evolution of VLM hidden representations through the LLM backbone to identify redundant layers.

Result: Experiments show that skipping layers with large redundancy (as predicted by the framework) yields faster inference while preserving performance, and that skipping outside these conditions leads to model degradation.

Conclusion: The framework provides unified theoretical support for efficient inference techniques, showing that layer skipping can be systematically applied to VLMs for improved efficiency when targeting redundant layers identified through information-theoretic analysis.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve incredible performance across a wide
range of tasks, but their large size makes inference costly. Recent work shows
that selectively skipping VLM layers can improve efficiency with minimal
performance loss or even performance improvements. However, this technique
remains underused due to the limited understanding of when layer skipping is
beneficial. In this paper, we develop a framework that uses information and
learning theory to characterize the conditions under which layer skipping
enhances efficiency without sacrificing performance. Motivated by these
observations, we analyze the evolution of the VLM's hidden representations
through the LLM backbone and show that layers with large redundancy as
predicted by our framework coincide with those skipped by popular
layer-skipping methods in practice, providing a unified theoretical scaffolding
for multiple efficient inference techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that
skipping such layers yields faster inference that preserves performance, and
also show that applying skipping outside these conditions leads to model
degradation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail to generate optimal solutions under complex constraints in real-world scenarios like travel planning, which involve explicit, implicit, and evolving constraints based on dynamic environments and user interactions.

Method: ATLAS uses a principled multi-agent approach with dedicated mechanisms for dynamic constraint management, iterative plan critique, and adaptive interleaved search to handle complex constraint-aware planning.

Result: ATLAS improves the final pass rate on TravelPlanner benchmark from 23.3% to 44.4%, and achieves 84% final pass rate in realistic settings with live information search and multi-turn feedback, significantly outperforming ReAct (59%) and monolithic agent (27%).

Conclusion: ATLAS demonstrates superior constraint-aware planning capabilities and is the first to show quantitative effectiveness on real-world travel planning tasks with live information and multi-turn interactions.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in
reasoning and tool use, they often fail to generate optimal, grounded solutions
under complex constraints. Real-world travel planning exemplifies these
challenges, evaluating agents' abilities to handle constraints that are
explicit, implicit, and even evolving based on interactions with dynamic
environments and user needs. In this paper, we present ATLAS, a general
multi-agent framework designed to effectively handle such complex nature of
constraints awareness in real-world travel planning tasks. ATLAS introduces a
principled approach to address the fundamental challenges of constraint-aware
planning through dedicated mechanisms for dynamic constraint management,
iterative plan critique, and adaptive interleaved search. ATLAS demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance on the TravelPlanner benchmark, improving the
final pass rate from 23.3% to 44.4% over its best alternative. More
importantly, our work is the first to demonstrate quantitative effectiveness on
real-world travel planning tasks with live information search and multi-turn
feedback. In this realistic setting, ATLAS showcases its superior overall
planning performance, achieving an 84% final pass rate which significantly
outperforms baselines including ReAct (59%) and a monolithic agent (27%).

Motivation: Conventional encoding approaches fail to capture rich temporal dynamics in EHRs, and while LLMs show promise for EHR modeling, they struggle with sequential clinical events and temporal dependencies.

Method: Propose Next Event Prediction (NEP) framework that reformulates EHRs as timestamped event chains and uses autoregressive fine-tuning to predict future medical events, explicitly modeling disease progression patterns and causal relationships.

Result: NEP outperforms specialized EHR models by 4.6% AUROC and general-purpose LLMs by 7.2% C-index in temporal reasoning tasks across oncology survival prediction and clinical diagnosis tasks.

Conclusion: NEP achieves dual benefits: state-of-the-art prediction accuracy combined with clinically interpretable attention patterns that align with known disease pathways.

reformulating EHRs as timestamped event chains and predicting future medical
events, NEP explicitly models disease progression patterns and causal
relationships. Extensive evaluations across oncology survival prediction and
clinical diagnosis tasks demonstrate NEP's superiority, outperforming
specialized EHR models by 4.6% AUROC and general-purpose LLMs by 7.2% C-index
in temporal reasoning tasks. Our analyses reveal dual benefits:
state-of-the-art prediction accuracy combined with clinically interpretable
attention patterns that align with known disease pathways.

*Akash Kumar Panda,Olaoluwa Adigun,Bart Kosko*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM can convert FCM to text and reconstruct it back, acting like an explainable autoencoder with human-readable intermediate representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an explainable AI system that can convert causal models to human-readable text and back, unlike black-box autoencoders.

Method: Use LLM to encode FCM into text and decode text back to FCM, approximating an identity map without direct input-output comparison.

Result: Lossy reconstruction that preserves strong causal edges while removing weak ones, with text that sounds natural despite some detail loss.

Conclusion: LLM-based FCM encoding provides explainable AI with human-interpretable representations, functioning as a transparent alternative to black-box autoencoders.

Abstract: A large language model (LLM) can map a feedback causal fuzzy cognitive map
(FCM) into text and then reconstruct the FCM from the text. This explainable AI
system approximates an identity map from the FCM to itself and resembles the
operation of an autoencoder (AE). Both the encoder and the decoder explain
their decisions in contrast to black-box AEs. Humans can read and interpret the
encoded text in contrast to the hidden variables and synaptic webs in AEs. The
LLM agent approximates the identity map through a sequence of system
instructions that does not compare the output to the input. The reconstruction
is lossy because it removes weak causal edges or rules while it preserves
strong causal edges. The encoder preserves the strong causal edges even when it
trades off some details about the FCM to make the text sound more natural.

*Peiran Xu,Zhuohao Li,Xiaoying Xing,Guannan Zhang,Debiao Li,Kunyu Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PPR is a reinforcement learning approach that combines principled step-level assessment with outcome verification to address limitations of sparse outcome rewards and hard-to-annotate process rewards in LLM tool usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL approaches for LLMs using tools face challenges: outcome rewards provide only sparse signals and delayed feedback, while process rewards are hard to annotate without golden answers and may not align with final outcomes.

Method: PPR trains a principle-based reward model for transparent process evaluation and introduces Reward Normalization (ReNorm) to calibrate outcome and process rewards, unifying step-level assessment with outcome verification.

Result: PPR achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating impressive robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed PPR framework effectively addresses the challenges of sparse outcome rewards and difficult process reward annotation by combining principled step-level assessment with outcome verification, leading to superior performance in LLM tool usage tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external tools such as
search engines to solve complex agentic tasks that require reasoning and
external knowledge retrieval. Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated its effectiveness in advancing capabilities of
LLMs by rewarding the final answers via outcome rewards. While straightforward
to supervise, outcome rewards only provide sparse signals and delayed feedback,
which limits their effectiveness on long trajectories. Process rewards address
this by evaluating intermediate steps, providing fine-grained supervision and
encouraging grounded problem solving. However, it is notoriously hard to
annotate step-wise labels, especially in non-verifiable process without
"golden" answers. Furthermore, step-wise judgment requires the balance between
local quality with contribution to the final outcome, as optimizing towards
higher process reward may not always align with better final outcomes. To
address the above challenges, we introduce Principle Process Reward (PPR), an
RL approach that unifies principled step-level assessment and outcome
verification. We train a principle-based reward model to improve the
transparency and reliability of process evaluation, and further introduce a
Reward Normalization (ReNorm) strategy to calibrate outcome and process
rewards. Experiment results show that PPR achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating its impressive robustness and
generalization. Our code and model collection is available in this link.

*Flavio Figueiredo,Giovanni Martinelli,Henrique Sousa,Pedro Rodrigues,Frederico Pedrosa,Lucas N. Ferreira*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Humans struggle to reliably distinguish AI-generated music from human-made music, especially when song pairs are dissimilar, but their accuracy improves when songs are similar.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand human perception of AI-generated music and improve both user education and AI music models, given the rapid advances in AI music generation services.

Method: Conducted a blind Turing-like test using a randomized controlled crossover trial with real-world AI music from Suno, controlling for pairwise similarity, and performed mixed-methods content analysis of listener feedback.

Result: Listeners' reliability in distinguishing AI music increases when song pairs are similar. Analysis revealed listeners primarily use vocal and technical cues for their judgments.

Conclusion: Human ability to identify AI-generated music is limited but improves with song similarity, suggesting current AI music generation is becoming increasingly indistinguishable from human-made music.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI music (AIM) generation services are currently
transforming the music industry. Given these advances, understanding how humans
perceive AIM is crucial both to educate users on identifying AIM songs, and,
conversely, to improve current models. We present results from a
listener-focused experiment aimed at understanding how humans perceive AIM. In
a blind, Turing-like test, participants were asked to distinguish, from a pair,
the AIM and human-made song. We contrast with other studies by utilizing a
randomized controlled crossover trial that controls for pairwise similarity and
allows for a causal interpretation. We are also the first study to employ a
novel, author-uncontrolled dataset of AIM songs from real-world usage of
commercial models (i.e., Suno). We establish that listeners' reliability in
distinguishing AIM causally increases when pairs are similar. Lastly, we
conduct a mixed-methods content analysis of listeners' free-form feedback,
revealing a focus on vocal and technical cues in their judgments.

*Manuel Cherep,Chengtian Ma,Abigail Xu,Maya Shaked,Pattie Maes,Nikhil Singh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ABxLab is a framework for evaluating LLM-powered agents' decision-making in realistic environments, revealing they exhibit predictable biases similar to humans despite lacking cognitive constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent evaluations focus on task competence, but there's a need to assess how agents make choices in realistic decision scenarios, especially as they increasingly operate in human environments.

Method: ABxLab systematically probes agentic choice through controlled manipulations of option attributes (prices, ratings) and persuasive cues (psychological nudges) in a web-based shopping environment.

Result: Agent decisions shift predictably and substantially in response to manipulated factors, showing agents are strongly biased choosers even without human cognitive constraints.

Conclusion: Agent susceptibility to biases presents both risk (amplifying human biases) and opportunity (creating a testbed for behavioral science of AI), with ABxLab released as an open benchmark for rigorous evaluation.

Abstract: Environments built for people are increasingly operated by a new class of
economic actors: LLM-powered software agents making decisions on our behalf.
These decisions range from our purchases to travel plans to medical treatment
selection. Current evaluations of these agents largely focus on task
competence, but we argue for a deeper assessment: how these agents choose when
faced with realistic decisions. We introduce ABxLab, a framework for
systematically probing agentic choice through controlled manipulations of
option attributes and persuasive cues. We apply this to a realistic web-based
shopping environment, where we vary prices, ratings, and psychological nudges,
all of which are factors long known to shape human choice. We find that agent
decisions shift predictably and substantially in response, revealing that
agents are strongly biased choosers even without being subject to the cognitive
constraints that shape human biases. This susceptibility reveals both risk and
opportunity: risk, because agentic consumers may inherit and amplify human
biases; opportunity, because consumer choice provides a powerful testbed for a
behavioral science of AI agents, just as it has for the study of human
behavior. We release our framework as an open benchmark for rigorous, scalable
evaluation of agent decision-making.

### [177] [SMS: Self-supervised Model Seeding for Verification of Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25613)
*Weiqi Wang,Chenhan Zhang,Zhiyi Tian,Shui Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Self-supervised Model Seeding (SMS) scheme for verifying machine unlearning of genuine user samples, overcoming limitations of backdoor-based methods that only verify removal of backdoored samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine unlearning verification methods rely on backdooring, which only confirms removal of backdoored samples but fails to verify unlearning of genuine user samples, creating a gap in ensuring users' right to be forgotten.

Method: Uses self-supervised model seeding to link user-specific seeds, original samples, and models; employs joint-training structure to optimize both seeding task and primary service task while keeping seeds secret from the server.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that SMS provides effective verification for genuine sample unlearning, addressing limitations of existing backdoor-based methods.

Conclusion: SMS scheme successfully enables verification of genuine sample unlearning in machine learning models while maintaining model utility, offering a practical solution to uphold users' right to be forgotten.

Abstract: Many machine unlearning methods have been proposed recently to uphold users'
right to be forgotten. However, offering users verification of their data
removal post-unlearning is an important yet under-explored problem. Current
verifications typically rely on backdooring, i.e., adding backdoored samples to
influence model performance. Nevertheless, the backdoor methods can merely
establish a connection between backdoored samples and models but fail to
connect the backdoor with genuine samples. Thus, the backdoor removal can only
confirm the unlearning of backdoored samples, not users' genuine samples, as
genuine samples are independent of backdoored ones. In this paper, we propose a
Self-supervised Model Seeding (SMS) scheme to provide unlearning verification
for genuine samples. Unlike backdooring, SMS links user-specific seeds (such as
users' unique indices), original samples, and models, thereby facilitating the
verification of unlearning genuine samples. However, implementing SMS for
unlearning verification presents two significant challenges. First, embedding
the seeds into the service model while keeping them secret from the server
requires a sophisticated approach. We address this by employing a
self-supervised model seeding task, which learns the entire sample, including
the seeds, into the model's latent space. Second, maintaining the utility of
the original service model while ensuring the seeding effect requires a
delicate balance. We design a joint-training structure that optimizes both the
self-supervised model seeding task and the primary service task simultaneously
on the model, thereby maintaining model utility while achieving effective model
seeding. The effectiveness of the proposed SMS scheme is evaluated through
extensive experiments, which demonstrate that SMS provides effective
verification for genuine sample unlearning, addressing existing limitations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SOCK is a benchmark CLI that measures LLMs' ability to self-replicate without human intervention, categorizing models into Replication-Capability Levels (RCL) and Persistence-Capability Levels (PCL) using a five-task suite.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish the first formalized benchmark for evaluating LLM self-replication capabilities and track potential threat vectors in multi-agent systems.

Method: Uses a five-task suite based on CLI utilities and computer processes in controlled environments, with LLMs acting agentically to compute R-scores and categorize models into RCL-PCL matrices.

Result: Evaluation of various open-weight and proprietary models revealed significant obstacles to persistent self-replication, including context retention and multi-agent decision-making issues.

Conclusion: SOCK provides a standardized benchmark for future research on LLM self-replication and helps mitigate risks in multi-agent systems, with proposed directions to safely reduce obstacles.

Abstract: We introduce SOCK, a benchmark command line interface (CLI) that measures
large language models' (LLMs) ability to self-replicate without human
intervention. In this benchmark, self-replication is defined not only as an
LLM's ability to create a functioning and running copy of itself, but also the
ability for that self-replication to persist and occur across different
computational contexts. Accordingly, we've developed a system to categorize
LLMs based on broad self-replication capabilities in two general classes,
Replication-Capability Levels (RCL) and Persistence-Capability Levels (PCL).
Using a five-task suite based on practically manipulable modern CLI utilities
and computer processes, experiments are orchestrated in a controlled
environment with an LLM acting agentically. The performance of the LLM on agent
tasks is then computed to produce an R-score (a quantitative evaluation of
overall self-replication ability) and data used to categorize LLMs into
specific RCL-PCL matrices. SOCK offers two primary contributions: (1) Provides
the first formalized definitions and benchmark suite for evaluating LLM
self-replication, with the goal of establishing a standard for future research,
to our knowledge; (2) Allows the industry to track the effectiveness of future
multi-agent systems and mitigate potential self-replication threat vectors
within them. The results compiled from evaluating a variety of open-weight and
proprietary frontier models reveal significant obstacles to persistent
self-replication and multi-agent systems, including context retention and
multi-agent decision-making. We propose future research directions to safely
reduce the severity of these obstacles, potentially lowering future risk of
more functional multi-agent systems.

*Yuyang Liu,Chuan Wen,Yihang Hu,Dinesh Jayaraman,Yang Gao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TimeRewarder is a reward learning method that estimates task progress from passive videos to provide dense rewards for reinforcement learning, achieving high success rates on sparse-reward robotics tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual design of dense rewards for robotics RL is labor-intensive and doesn't scale well. Task progress offers a natural dense reward signal but requires automated methods to extract from available video data.

Method: TimeRewarder learns progress estimation from passive videos (robot demos and human videos) by modeling temporal distances between frame pairs, then uses these signals as step-wise proxy rewards to guide RL training.

Result: On 10 Meta-World tasks, TimeRewarder achieved nearly perfect success in 9/10 tasks with only 200k environment interactions per task, outperforming previous methods and even manually designed dense rewards in both success rate and sample efficiency.

Conclusion: TimeRewarder provides a scalable approach to derive rich reward signals from diverse video sources, including real-world human videos, enabling effective RL for sparse-reward robotics tasks without extensive manual reward engineering.

Abstract: Designing dense rewards is crucial for reinforcement learning (RL), yet in
robotics it often demands extensive manual effort and lacks scalability. One
promising solution is to view task progress as a dense reward signal, as it
quantifies the degree to which actions advance the system toward task
completion over time. We present TimeRewarder, a simple yet effective reward
learning method that derives progress estimation signals from passive videos,
including robot demonstrations and human videos, by modeling temporal distances
between frame pairs. We then demonstrate how TimeRewarder can supply step-wise
proxy rewards to guide reinforcement learning. In our comprehensive experiments
on ten challenging Meta-World tasks, we show that TimeRewarder dramatically
improves RL for sparse-reward tasks, achieving nearly perfect success in 9/10
tasks with only 200,000 interactions per task with the environment. This
approach outperformed previous methods and even the manually designed
environment dense reward on both the final success rate and sample efficiency.
Moreover, we show that TimeRewarder pretraining can exploit real-world human
videos, highlighting its potential as a scalable approach path to rich reward
signals from diverse video sources.

Motivation: To address the critical but under-examined challenges of reliability and granular performance in AI agents for self-driving laboratories, ensuring trustworthy automation of chemical research.

Method: Developed a multi-agent architecture with specialized agents for task decomposition, tool-assisted stoichiometric calculations, and iterative self-correction before generating hardware-ready files. Evaluated through 5 benchmark experiments with systematic ablation study of 20 agent configurations.

Result: Agent reasoning capacity reduced quantitative errors by over 85% in complex tasks. Combined with multi-agent architecture and self-correction, achieved near-expert procedural accuracy (F1-score > 0.89) on multi-step syntheses.

Conclusion: Establishes a blueprint for robust AI partners in autonomous labs, highlighting synergistic effects of modular design, advanced reasoning, and self-correction for reliable performance in high-stakes scientific applications.

Abstract: The automation of chemical research through self-driving laboratories (SDLs)
promises to accelerate scientific discovery, yet the reliability and granular
performance of the underlying AI agents remain critical, under-examined
challenges. In this work, we introduce AutoLabs, a self-correcting, multi-agent
architecture designed to autonomously translate natural-language instructions
into executable protocols for a high-throughput liquid handler. The system
engages users in dialogue, decomposes experimental goals into discrete tasks
for specialized agents, performs tool-assisted stoichiometric calculations, and
iteratively self-corrects its output before generating a hardware-ready file.
We present a comprehensive evaluation framework featuring five benchmark
experiments of increasing complexity, from simple sample preparation to
multi-plate timed syntheses. Through a systematic ablation study of 20 agent
configurations, we assess the impact of reasoning capacity, architectural
design (single- vs. multi-agent), tool use, and self-correction mechanisms. Our
results demonstrate that agent reasoning capacity is the most critical factor
for success, reducing quantitative errors in chemical amounts (nRMSE) by over
85% in complex tasks. When combined with a multi-agent architecture and
iterative self-correction, AutoLabs achieves near-expert procedural accuracy
(F1-score > 0.89) on challenging multi-step syntheses. These findings establish
a clear blueprint for developing robust and trustworthy AI partners for
autonomous laboratories, highlighting the synergistic effects of modular
design, advanced reasoning, and self-correction to ensure both performance and
reliability in high-stakes scientific applications. Code:

TL;DR: IRCAM-AVN is an end-to-end framework that replaces traditional staged modular design in audio-visual navigation with a unified iterative residual cross-attention mechanism, improving navigation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional staged modular approaches in audio-visual navigation lead to redundant information processing and inconsistencies between feature fusion and GRU sequence modeling modules.

Method: Proposes IRCAM-AVN framework that integrates multimodal information fusion and sequence modeling in a unified IRCAM module using multi-level residual design that concatenates initial multimodal sequences with processed information sequences.

Result: Intelligent agents using the iterative residual cross-attention mechanism demonstrate superior navigation performance compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: The end-to-end IRCAM-AVN framework with iterative residual cross-attention mechanism progressively optimizes feature extraction, reduces model bias, and enhances model stability and generalization capabilities in audio-visual navigation tasks.

Abstract: Audio-visual navigation represents a significant area of research in which
intelligent agents utilize egocentric visual and auditory perceptions to
identify audio targets. Conventional navigation methodologies typically adopt a
staged modular design, which involves first executing feature fusion, then
utilizing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) modules for sequence modeling, and finally
making decisions through reinforcement learning. While this modular approach
has demonstrated effectiveness, it may also lead to redundant information
processing and inconsistencies in information transmission between the various
modules during the feature fusion and GRU sequence modeling phases. This paper
presents IRCAM-AVN (Iterative Residual Cross-Attention Mechanism for
Audiovisual Navigation), an end-to-end framework that integrates multimodal
information fusion and sequence modeling within a unified IRCAM module, thereby
replacing the traditional separate components for fusion and GRU. This
innovative mechanism employs a multi-level residual design that concatenates
initial multimodal sequences with processed information sequences. This
methodological shift progressively optimizes the feature extraction process
while reducing model bias and enhancing the model's stability and
generalization capabilities. Empirical results indicate that intelligent agents
employing the iterative residual cross-attention mechanism exhibit superior
navigation performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-and-language navigation methods often fail in complex scenarios due to lack of common-sense reasoning ability and difficulty matching instructions with environmental information.

Method: Constructs 630,000-entry knowledge base, uses knowledge matching to align environmental subviews, implements Knowledge-Guided by Landmark (KGL) mechanism to focus on relevant knowledge, and Knowledge-Guided Dynamic Augmentation (KGDA) to integrate language, knowledge, vision, and historical information.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERIE datasets, achieving better navigation error, success rate, and path efficiency.

Conclusion: The LGK method effectively addresses common-sense reasoning limitations in vision-and-language navigation by leveraging external knowledge and landmark guidance, demonstrating significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation is one of the core tasks in embodied
intelligence, requiring an agent to autonomously navigate in an unfamiliar
environment based on natural language instructions. However, existing methods
often fail to match instructions with environmental information in complex
scenarios, one reason being the lack of common-sense reasoning ability. This
paper proposes a vision-and-language navigation method called Landmark-Guided
Knowledge (LGK), which introduces an external knowledge base to assist
navigation, addressing the misjudgment issues caused by insufficient common
sense in traditional methods. Specifically, we first construct a knowledge base
containing 630,000 language descriptions and use knowledge Matching to align
environmental subviews with the knowledge base, extracting relevant descriptive
knowledge. Next, we design a Knowledge-Guided by Landmark (KGL) mechanism,
which guides the agent to focus on the most relevant parts of the knowledge by
leveraging landmark information in the instructions, thereby reducing the data
bias that may arise from incorporating external knowledge. Finally, we propose
Knowledge-Guided Dynamic Augmentation (KGDA), which effectively integrates
language, knowledge, vision, and historical information. Experimental results
demonstrate that the LGK method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
on the R2R and REVERIE vision-and-language navigation datasets, particularly in
terms of navigation error, success rate, and path efficiency.

Method: Uses text-grounded object localization to generate bounding boxes around question-relevant objects, enabling targeted image cropping and focused retrieval in RAG framework. Also includes a de-hallucination method based on question type.

Result: Increased VQA accuracy from 22.19% to 25.64% (3.45 percentage point improvement) compared to Llama-3.2-Vision-11B baseline. Reduced hallucination rate from 65.79% to 13.88% and improved truthfulness score.

Conclusion: Text-grounded object localization with RAG effectively improves VQA performance by enabling focused retrieval and reducing hallucinations through targeted image processing and question-type based de-hallucination techniques.

Abstract: We propose a method to improve Visual Question Answering (VQA) with
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by introducing text-grounded object
localization. Rather than retrieving information based on the entire image, our
approach enables the model to generate a bounding box around the object most
relevant to the question, allowing for targeted image cropping and focused
retrieval. This reduces background noise, improves alignment between visual and
textual cues, and helps mitigate hallucinations. Our RAG method enhances
context-aware VQA responses increased the accuracy from 22.19% to 25.64%, with
an absolute increase of 3.45 percentage points, compared to the baseline
Llama-3.2-Vision-11B agent. We also proposed a de-hallucination method based on
question type which can effectively reduce the hallucination rate from 65.79%

TL;DR: SING-SQL is a fully automated framework for generating synthetic Text-to-SQL data for any database, enabling enterprise-grade SQL query generation without manual annotations or SQL logs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in real-world enterprise scenarios where models need to specialize to single database schemas and organizations need to evaluate Text-to-SQL systems on their own databases, rather than focusing only on cross-domain generalization.

Method: Two-stage framework that hierarchically partitions database schemas into sub-schemas, synthesizes SQL queries across complexity levels, and applies quality-aware pipeline with LLM-as-a-judge validation, executability checks, automatic repair, and column balancing.

Result: SingSQL-LM models achieve state-of-the-art performance: 3B model reaches 82.87% Soft F1 and 73.03% EX on BIRD benchmark, outperforming best 3B baseline by +16.21 Soft F1 and +12.36 EX. Schema-free fine-tuning with schema-only inference provides most robust results.

Conclusion: SING-SQL establishes a scalable, database-agnostic paradigm for producing and evaluating enterprise-grade Text-to-SQL systems, enabling organizations to generate high-quality synthetic data for their specific databases.

Abstract: Translating natural language questions into SQL has become a core challenge
in enabling non-technical users to query databases. While recent work has
explored large-scale synthetic data generation to improve model performance
through post-training, most efforts emphasize cross-domain generalization. This
leaves a gap for real-world enterprise scenarios, where models need to
specialize to a single database schema and organizations require to be able to
evaluate their Text-to-SQL systems on their own databases. To address this, we
introduce SING-SQL, a fully automated two-stage framework for generating
high-quality, high-coverage synthetic Text-to-SQL data for any target database,
without relying on SQL logs or manual annotations. Our approach hierarchically
partitions a database schema into sub-schemas, synthesizes SQL queries across
multiple complexity levels, and applies a quality-aware pipeline that includes
LLM-as-a-judge validation, executability checks, automatic repair, and column
balancing. We further release SingSQL-LM, a family of compact language models
fine-tuned on the synthetic data, achieving strong in-domain generalization. On
the subset of the BIRD benchmark, SingSQL-LM-3B-R64 reaches 82.87% Soft F1 and
73.03% EX upper bound with 32 candidates, outperforming the best 3B-scale
baseline by +16.21 in Soft F1 and +12.36 in EX. At the 1.5B scale,

### [187] [Collaborative Compression for Large-Scale MoE Deployment on Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25689)
*Yixiao Chen,Yanyue Xie,Ruining Yang,Wei Jiang,Wei Wang,Yong He,Yue Chen,Pu Zhao,Yanzhi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a collaborative compression framework combining expert pruning, mixed-precision quantization, and activation optimization to deploy ultra-large Mixture of Experts models on resource-constrained edge platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultra-large MoE models have hundreds of billions of parameters requiring massive memory/storage, making deployment difficult on edge platforms. Pruning or quantization alone cannot achieve the aggressive compression ratios needed without significant accuracy degradation.

Method: Combines expert pruning, mixed-precision quantization, and activation optimization in a collaborative compression framework to reduce model size while preserving output quality.

Result: Reduces storage footprint of DeepSeek-V3 from 1.3TB to 103GB while maintaining high output quality and better accuracy than uniform low-bit quantization methods. Successfully deploys compressed model on platform with 128GB memory limit.

Conclusion: The proposed collaborative compression framework enables effective deployment of ultra-large MoE models on resource-constrained edge platforms with smaller model sizes and higher accuracy than traditional uniform quantization methods.

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture is an important method for scaling
Large Language Models (LLMs). It increases model capacity while keeping
computation cost low. However, the ultra-large MoE models still have hundreds
of billions of parameters, requiring massive memory/storage and leading to
difficulties for deployment on resource-constrained edge platforms. Pruning or
quantization alone can hardly address the issue, because of the
super-aggressive compression ratio with significantly degraded accuracy and
output quality. To facilitate the deployment of ultra-large MoEs on edge
platforms, we propose a collaborative compression framework by combining expert
pruning, mixed-precision quantization, and activation optimization. It can
effectively reduce the storage footprint of the ultra-large MoE DeepSeek-V3
from 1.3TB to 103GB, while preserving high output quality with better accuracy
than traditional uniform low-bit quantization methods. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to deploy a compressed model from the ultra-large
DeepSeek-V3 on the platform with a strict 128GB total memory limit. Our
comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks under various memory
constraints demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with smaller model
sizes and higher accuracy than uniform low-bit quantization methods.

*Qi Liu,Xueyuan Li,Zirui Li,Juhui Gim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A heterogeneous graph reinforcement learning framework with expert system improves autonomous vehicle decision-making in mixed traffic environments with diverse driving styles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous traffic environments with diverse driving styles pose significant challenges for autonomous vehicles due to complexity and dynamic interactions.

Method: Proposed heterogeneous graph representation for vehicle interactions, HGNN-EM (heterogeneous graph neural network with expert model) to encode vehicle features and provide driving instructions, trained using DDQN algorithm.

Result: Superior performance over baselines in safety, efficiency, stability, and convergence rate at a four-way intersection with various human vehicle driving styles, while maintaining real-time performance.

Conclusion: The proposed heterogeneous graph reinforcement learning framework with expert system effectively enhances autonomous vehicle decision-making in complex mixed traffic environments.

Abstract: Navigating heterogeneous traffic environments with diverse driving styles
poses a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs) due to their
inherent complexity and dynamic interactions. This paper addresses this
challenge by proposing a heterogeneous graph reinforcement learning (GRL)
framework enhanced with an expert system to improve AV decision-making
performance. Initially, a heterogeneous graph representation is introduced to
capture the intricate interactions among vehicles. Then, a heterogeneous graph
neural network with an expert model (HGNN-EM) is proposed to effectively encode
diverse vehicle features and produce driving instructions informed by
domain-specific knowledge. Moreover, the double deep Q-learning (DDQN)
algorithm is utilized to train the decision-making model. A case study on a
typical four-way intersection, involving various driving styles of human
vehicles (HVs), demonstrates that the proposed method has superior performance
over several baselines regarding safety, efficiency, stability, and convergence
rate, all while maintaining favorable real-time performance.

*Danial Kamali,Parisa Kordjamshidi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NePTune is a neuro-symbolic framework that combines foundation vision models with symbolic reasoning to improve compositional reasoning in VLMs, using Python programs with soft logic operators for uncertainty-aware reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with compositional reasoning, and existing neuro-symbolic approaches are limited by rigid logical execution and predefined predicates, lacking flexibility.

Method: NePTune dynamically translates natural language queries into executable Python programs that integrate imperative control flow with soft logic operators, operating training-free with modular design that decouples perception from reasoning while supporting fine-tuning.

Result: Evaluation on multiple visual reasoning benchmarks shows significant improvement over strong base models, with effective compositional generalization and adaptation capabilities in novel environments.

Conclusion: NePTune successfully addresses compositional reasoning limitations in VLMs through its hybrid neuro-symbolic approach, demonstrating strong performance and generalization across various domains.

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
various tasks, yet they often struggle with compositional reasoning, the
ability to decompose and recombine concepts to solve novel problems. While
neuro-symbolic approaches offer a promising direction, they are typically
constrained by crisp logical execution or predefined predicates, which limit
flexibility. In this work, we introduce NePTune, a neuro-symbolic framework
that overcomes these limitations through a hybrid execution model that
integrates the perception capabilities of foundation vision models with the
compositional expressiveness of symbolic reasoning. NePTune dynamically
translates natural language queries into executable Python programs that blend
imperative control flow with soft logic operators capable of reasoning over
VLM-generated uncertainty. Operating in a training-free manner, NePTune, with a
modular design, decouples perception from reasoning, yet its differentiable
operations support fine-tuning. We evaluate NePTune on multiple visual
reasoning benchmarks and various domains, utilizing adversarial tests, and
demonstrate a significant improvement over strong base models, as well as its
effective compositional generalization and adaptation capabilities in novel
environments.

### [191] [Thinking Sparks!: Emergent Attention Heads in Reasoning Models During Post Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25758)
*Yein Park,Minbyul Jeong,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Post-training techniques create specialized attention heads for reasoning, with different training methods (distillation/SFT vs GRPO) leading to different head evolution patterns, revealing a trade-off between complex reasoning and reliable execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the architectural mechanisms behind how post-training techniques improve reasoning capabilities in large models, and how different training regimes affect the emergence of specialized attention heads.

Method: Used circuit analysis to examine attention heads across Qwen families and DeepSeek-distilled models, comparing different training regimes including distillation, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and group relative policy optimization (GRPO).

Result: Distillation and SFT add stable reasoning heads cumulatively, while GRPO operates dynamically with iterative activation and pruning of heads. Think on/off models use compensatory heads rather than dedicated thinking heads, and specialized heads enable complex reasoning but can cause over-thinking failures on simpler tasks.

Conclusion: There's an inherent tension where complex reasoning capabilities come at the cost of reliable elementary computations, highlighting the need for training policies that balance effective reasoning strategies with flawless execution.

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of modern large reasoning models are largely
unlocked through post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning. However, the architectural mechanisms behind such
improvements remain largely opaque. In this work, we use circuit analysis to
demonstrate that post-training for complex reasoning sparks the emergence of
novel, functionally specialized attention heads. These heads collectively
support structured reasoning and computation. Our comparative analysis across
Qwen families and DeepSeek-distilled model reveals that these emergent heads
evolve differently under different training regimes. Distillation and SFT
foster a cumulative addition of stable reasoning heads. In contrast, group
relative policy optimization operates in a dynamic search mode: relatively few
attention heads are iteratively activated, evaluated, and pruned, with their
survival closely tracking fluctuations in the task reward signal. Furthermore,
we find that controllable think on/off models do not possess dedicated thinking
heads. Instead, turning off explicit reasoning triggers a broader-but less
efficient-set of compensatory heads. Through ablation and qualitative analyses,
we connect these circuit-level dynamics to a crucial performance trade-off:
strengthened heads enable sophisticated problem-solving strategies for
difficult problems but can also introduce over-thinking failure modes, such as
calculation errors or logical loops on simpler tasks. These findings connect
circuit-level dynamics to macro-level performance, identifying an inherent
tension where complex reasoning comes at the cost of elementary computations.
More broadly, our work points to future directions for training policy design,
emphasizing the need to balance the development of effective reasoning
strategies with the assurance of reliable, flawless execution.

*Matt Keon,Aabid Karim,Bhoomika Lohana,Abdul Karim,Thai Nguyen,Tara Hamilton,Ali Abbas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs tend to produce safe, generic text in creative tasks due to regression to the mean in language, favoring high-probability information over creative features like metaphors and emotions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can handle creativity by examining their tendency to default to safe, generic phrasing rather than creative content.

Method: Used a creativity stress test with advertising concepts, simplifying ad ideas step by step and analyzing feature disappearance. Then regenerated from simplified inputs and provided ad-specific cues to test recovery of creative elements.

Result: Creative features disappeared early during simplification while factual content remained. Regenerated texts showed lexical variety but lacked depth and originality. Ad-specific cues improved alignment but outputs still relied on familiar tropes.

Conclusion: Without targeted guidance, LLMs drift towards mediocrity in creative tasks; structured signals can partially counter this tendency and suggest pathways for developing creativity-sensitive models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate fluent text yet often default to safe,
generic phrasing, raising doubts about their ability to handle creativity. We
formalize this tendency as a Galton-style regression to the mean in language
and evaluate it using a creativity stress test in advertising concepts. When ad
ideas were simplified step by step, creative features such as metaphors,
emotions, and visual cues disappeared early, while factual content remained,
showing that models favor high-probability information. When asked to
regenerate from simplified inputs, models produced longer outputs with lexical
variety but failed to recover the depth and distinctiveness of the originals.
We combined quantitative comparisons with qualitative analysis, which revealed
that the regenerated texts often appeared novel but lacked true originality.
Providing ad-specific cues such as metaphors, emotional hooks and visual
markers improved alignment and stylistic balance, though outputs still relied
on familiar tropes. Taken together, the findings show that without targeted
guidance, LLMs drift towards mediocrity in creative tasks; structured signals
can partially counter this tendency and point towards pathways for developing
creativity-sensitive models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agentic RL with LLMs on TravelPlanner benchmark shows 8B models achieve competitive performance with 3.5x compute efficiency using reward shaping, reaching 56.9% success rate vs 21.2% baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how reward shaping affects agentic reinforcement learning with large language models, particularly comparing efficiency and performance across different model sizes.

Method: Used Planner-R1 approach with dense process-level reward signals on TravelPlanner benchmark, training with only 180 queries. Compared 8B vs 32B models under sparse and shaped reward conditions.

Result: 8B models achieved 56.9% final-pass rate (2.7x improvement over baseline) with 3.5x compute efficiency and 1.5x memory efficiency over 32B models. Larger models were more robust under sparse rewards but showed smaller gains from shaping.

Conclusion: Reward shaping is decisive for scaling agentic RL, smaller models (8B) are most efficient without sacrificing generalization, as shown by maintained performance on out-of-domain tasks.

Abstract: We investigated Agentic RL with large language models on the
\textsc{TravelPlanner} benchmark. Our approach, \textsc{Planner-R1}, achieved a
\textbf{56.9\%} final-pass rate with only 180 training queries, a $2.7\times$
improvement over GPT-5's $21.2\%$ baseline and the strongest agentic result on
the public leaderboard. A central finding was that smaller models (8B) were
highly responsive to reward shaping: with dense process-level signals, they
reached competitive performance while being $3.5\times$ more compute-efficient
and $1.5\times$ more memory-efficient than 32B models. Larger models were more
robust under sparse rewards but exhibited smaller relative gains from shaping
and higher variance across runs. While curriculum learning offered no
significant benefit, shaped rewards consistently amplified learning dynamics,
making 8B models the most efficient setting for agentic RL. Crucially, these
gains did not come at the cost of overfitting: fine-tuned models mostly
maintained or exceeded baseline performance on out-of-domain tasks, including
\textsc{Multi-IF}, \textsc{NaturalPlan}, and $\tau$-\textsc{Bench}. These
results establish reward shaping as a decisive lever for scaling agentic RL,
highlight the competitive strength of smaller models, and demonstrate that
efficiency can be achieved without sacrificing generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PureVQ-GAN is a fast defense against data poisoning attacks that uses vector quantization and GAN to destroy backdoor triggers while maintaining high clean accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient defense against data poisoning attacks that can destroy backdoor triggers while preserving image semantics, addressing the computational inefficiency of existing methods like diffusion-based defenses.

Method: Uses Vector-Quantized VAE with GAN discriminator to force poisoned images through a discrete bottleneck, quantizing them through a learned codebook to destroy fine-grained trigger patterns while preserving semantic content.

Result: Achieves 0% poison success rate against Gradient Matching and Bullseye Polytope attacks, 1.64% against Narcissus, while maintaining 91-95% clean accuracy on CIFAR-10, and is over 50x faster than diffusion-based defenses.

Conclusion: PureVQ-GAN provides an effective and practical defense against data poisoning that is significantly faster than existing methods while maintaining high performance on clean data.

Abstract: We introduce PureVQ-GAN, a defense against data poisoning that forces
backdoor triggers through a discrete bottleneck using Vector-Quantized VAE with
GAN discriminator. By quantizing poisoned images through a learned codebook,
PureVQ-GAN destroys fine-grained trigger patterns while preserving semantic
content. A GAN discriminator ensures outputs match the natural image
distribution, preventing reconstruction of out-of-distribution perturbations.
On CIFAR-10, PureVQ-GAN achieves 0% poison success rate (PSR) against Gradient
Matching and Bullseye Polytope attacks, and 1.64% against Narcissus while
maintaining 91-95% clean accuracy. Unlike diffusion-based defenses requiring
hundreds of iterative refinement steps, PureVQ-GAN is over 50x faster, making
it practical for real training pipelines.

### [196] [Chain-in-Tree: Back to Sequential Reasoning in LLM Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25835)
*Xinzhe Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Chain-in-Tree (CiT) is a plug-in framework that reduces computational costs in tree-search-based LLM reasoning by adaptively deciding when to branch during search, achieving 75-85% reductions in tokens, model invocations, and runtime with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tree-search-based approaches for LLM reasoning are inefficient and slow, often being an order of magnitude slower than simpler iterative methods, creating a need for more efficient search strategies.

Method: CiT uses lightweight Branching Necessity (BN) evaluation: BN-DP (Direct Prompting) where an auxiliary LLM judges branching necessity, and BN-SC (Self-Consistency) which clusters candidate actions to estimate agreement. It integrates with ToT-BS, ReST-MCTS, and RAP frameworks.

Result: BN-DP consistently reduces token generation, model invocations, and runtime by 75-85% across all settings with negligible accuracy loss. BN-SC achieves up to 80% savings but shows instability in some settings. Auxiliary LLM quality is critical for performance.

Conclusion: CiT provides significant efficiency improvements for tree-search-based LLM reasoning while maintaining accuracy, with theoretical guarantees and practical implementations available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Test-time scaling enables large language models (LLMs) to improve performance
on long-horizon reasoning tasks by allocating additional compute at inference.
Tree-search-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art results in this setting,
but they are notoriously inefficient, often an order of magnitude slower than
simpler iterative methods. We introduce Chain-in-Tree (CiT), a plug-in
framework that adaptively decides when to branch during search rather than
branching at every step. CiT relies on lightweight Branching Necessity (BN)
evaluation methods: BN-DP (Direct Prompting), where an auxiliary LLM directly
judges whether a step requires branching, and BN-SC (Self-Consistency), which
clusters multiple candidate actions to estimate agreement. We integrate CiT
into three representative LLM-in-the-loop tree search frameworks: Tree of
Thoughts (ToT-BS), ReST-MCTS, and RAP, and evaluate across GSM8K and Math500.
Our results show that: (1) BN-DP consistently reduces token generation, model
invocations, and runtime by 75-85 percent across all settings, with negligible
accuracy loss and sometimes accuracy gains; (2) BN-SC typically yields
substantial savings (up to 80 percent) but shows instability in 1-4 out of 14
settings, caused by a small subset of examples that produce very long reasoning
steps; (3) the quality of auxiliary LLMs is critical, not only the BN evaluator
in BN-DP, but also the models used in BN-SC for clustering and equivalence
checking. When these roles are filled by smaller LLMs, performance degrades.
Importantly, BN-SC does not require LLMs in domains with deterministic action
spaces, where clustering can be done programmatically. We also provide a
theoretical guarantee that BN-DP never increases LLM invocations relative to
the baseline and release a unified implementation of CiT across ToT-BS,
ReST-MCTS, and RAP to facilitate reproducibility and extension.

*Ziyu Zhang,Hanzhao Li,Jingbin Hu,Wenhao Li,Lei Xie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiStyle is a hierarchical style embedding predictor for controllable text-to-speech that uses contrastive learning and improved style annotation to achieve better style control while maintaining speech quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current controllable TTS systems using natural language prompts overlook the underlying distribution of style embeddings, limiting their full potential for precise style control.

Method: Two-stage hierarchical style embedding predictor with contrastive learning, plus a style annotation strategy combining statistical methods and human auditory preferences.

Result: HiStyle achieves significantly better style controllability than alternative approaches while preserving high speech quality in naturalness and intelligibility.

Conclusion: The hierarchical approach to style embedding prediction, combined with improved annotation strategies, enables more effective and precise control over speech synthesis styles.

Abstract: Controllable speech synthesis refers to the precise control of speaking style
by manipulating specific prosodic and paralinguistic attributes, such as
gender, volume, speech rate, pitch, and pitch fluctuation. With the integration
of advanced generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, controllable text-to-speech (TTS) systems have increasingly
transitioned from label-based control to natural language description-based
control, which is typically implemented by predicting global style embeddings
from textual prompts. However, this straightforward prediction overlooks the
underlying distribution of the style embeddings, which may hinder the full
potential of controllable TTS systems. In this study, we use t-SNE analysis to
visualize and analyze the global style embedding distribution of various
mainstream TTS systems, revealing a clear hierarchical clustering pattern:
embeddings first cluster by timbre and subsequently subdivide into finer
clusters based on style attributes. Based on this observation, we propose
HiStyle, a two-stage style embedding predictor that hierarchically predicts
style embeddings conditioned on textual prompts, and further incorporate
contrastive learning to help align the text and audio embedding spaces.
Additionally, we propose a style annotation strategy that leverages the
complementary strengths of statistical methodologies and human auditory
preferences to generate more accurate and perceptually consistent textual
prompts for style control. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that when
applied to the base TTS model, HiStyle achieves significantly better style
controllability than alternative style embedding predicting approaches while
preserving high speech quality in terms of naturalness and intelligibility.

*Yein Park,Jungwoo Park,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASGuard is a framework that uses mechanistic analysis to identify and patch tense-based jailbreaking vulnerabilities in LLMs through targeted attention head scaling and preventative fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show brittle refusal behaviors where simple linguistic changes like tense switching can bypass safety alignments, revealing critical gaps in current alignment methods.

Method: Three-step approach: 1) Circuit analysis to identify tense-vulnerable attention heads, 2) Train channel-wise scaling vectors to recalibrate activations, 3) Apply preventative fine-tuning to reinforce robust refusal mechanisms.

Result: ASGuard effectively reduces targeted jailbreaking success rates across three LLMs while preserving general capabilities and minimizing over-refusal, achieving Pareto-optimal safety-utility balance.

Conclusion: Deep understanding of model internals enables practical, efficient targeted behavior adjustments, providing a pathway for more reliable and interpretable AI safety.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite being safety-aligned, exhibit brittle
refusal behaviors that can be circumvented by simple linguistic changes. As
tense jailbreaking demonstrates that models refusing harmful requests often
comply when rephrased in past tense, a critical generalization gap is revealed
in current alignment methods whose underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.
In this work, we introduce Activation-Scaling Guard (ASGuard), an insightful,
mechanistically-informed framework that surgically mitigates this specific
vulnerability. For the first step, we use circuit analysis to identify the
specific attention heads causally linked to the targeted jailbreaking, the
tense-changing attack. Second, we train a precise, channel-wise scaling vector
to recalibrate the activation of tense vulnerable heads. Lastly, we apply it
into a "preventative fine-tuning", forcing the model to learn a more robust
refusal mechanism. Across three LLMs, ASGuard effectively reduces the attack
success rate of targeted jailbreaking while preserving general capabilities and
minimizing over refusal, achieving a Pareto-optimal balance between safety and
utility. Our findings underscore how adversarial suffixes suppress the
propagation of the refusal-mediating direction, based on mechanistic analysis.
Furthermore, our work showcases how a deep understanding of model internals can
be leveraged to develop practical, efficient, and targeted methods for
adjusting model behavior, charting a course for more reliable and interpretable
AI safety.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CIMNAS is a joint model-quantization-hardware optimization framework for Compute-In-Memory (CIM) neural network accelerators that simultaneously searches software parameters, quantization policies, and hardware parameters to achieve significant improvements in energy-delay-area product (EDAP) while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual tuning of CIM-based neural network accelerators is impractical due to the vast parameter space and complex interdependencies between software and hardware design parameters. There is a need for automated co-optimization to maximize hardware efficiency and performance accuracy.

Method: CIMNAS uses hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS) to simultaneously search across software parameters, quantization policies, and hardware parameters (device-, circuit-, and architecture-level). It explores a massive search space of 9.9x10^85 parameter combinations using MobileNet and RRAM-based CIM architecture.

Result: On ImageNet dataset, CIMNAS achieved 90.1x-104.5x reduction in EDAP, 4.68x-4.82x improvement in TOPS/W, and 11.3x-12.78x enhancement in TOPS/mm^2 while maintaining 73.81% accuracy. When extended to SRAM-based ResNet50, it achieved up to 819.5x reduction in EDAP.

Conclusion: CIMNAS successfully automates the design of high-performance CIM-based neural network accelerators through joint software-hardware optimization, achieving significant efficiency improvements without accuracy loss and demonstrating adaptability across different architectures.

Abstract: To maximize hardware efficiency and performance accuracy in Compute-In-Memory
(CIM)-based neural network accelerators for Artificial Intelligence (AI)
applications, co-optimizing both software and hardware design parameters is
essential. Manual tuning is impractical due to the vast number of parameters
and their complex interdependencies. To effectively automate the design and
optimization of CIM-based neural network accelerators, hardware-aware neural
architecture search (HW-NAS) techniques can be applied. This work introduces
CIMNAS, a joint model-quantization-hardware optimization framework for CIM
architectures. CIMNAS simultaneously searches across software parameters,
quantization policies, and a broad range of hardware parameters, incorporating
device-, circuit-, and architecture-level co-optimizations. CIMNAS experiments
were conducted over a search space of 9.9x10^85 potential parameter
combinations with the MobileNet model as a baseline and RRAM-based CIM
architecture. Evaluated on the ImageNet dataset, CIMNAS achieved a reduction in
energy-delay-area product (EDAP) ranging from 90.1x to 104.5x, an improvement
in TOPS/W between 4.68x and 4.82x, and an enhancement in TOPS/mm^2 from 11.3x
to 12.78x relative to various baselines, all while maintaining an accuracy of
73.81%. The adaptability and robustness of CIMNAS are demonstrated by extending
the framework to support the SRAM-based ResNet50 architecture, achieving up to
an 819.5x reduction in EDAP. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, CIMNAS
achieves EDAP-focused optimization without any accuracy loss, generating
diverse software-hardware parameter combinations for high-performance CIM-based
neural network designs. The source code of CIMNAS is available at

### [201] [Lita: Light Agent Uncovers the Agentic Coding Capabilities of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25873)
*Hankun Dai,Maoquan Wang,Mengnan Qi,Yikai Zhang,Zijian Jin,Yongqiang Yao,Yufan Huang,Shengyu Fu,Elsie Nallipogu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lita (Lite Agent) introduces a minimalist approach to code agents that achieves competitive performance with less complexity, fewer tokens, and minimal manual design compared to elaborate workflow-based agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current code agent designs rely on complex, hand-crafted workflows that obscure true model capabilities, require heavy human intervention, are costly to maintain, and risk data leakage through prompt tuning.

Method: Lita operationalizes 'liteness' - minimizing manual design while retaining essential autonomous agent elements, enabling unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding.

Result: Experiments on Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench show Lita achieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based baselines while consuming fewer tokens and requiring less design effort.

Conclusion: Lita reveals the true coding competence of modern LLMs, and the Agent Complexity Law predicts that performance gaps between simple and complex agents will shrink as core models improve.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to programming
tasks, ranging from single-turn code completion to autonomous agents. Current
code agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and
tool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several
challenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and
custom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true
underlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and
maintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of
data leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI
and Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models'
coding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks
confidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent),
which operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while
retaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a
more faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments
on the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and
agentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires
significantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient
to reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose
the Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying
complexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model
improves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference.

*Ruolin Chen,Yinqian Sun,Jihang Wang,Mingyang Lv,Qian Zhang,Yi Zeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SafeMindBench is a multimodal benchmark for evaluating safety risks in embodied LLM agents, and SafeMindAgent is a proposed solution with cascaded safety modules that improves safety while maintaining task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied agents powered by LLMs inherit advanced planning capabilities but face safety vulnerabilities when interacting with the physical world, requiring systematic safety evaluation and mitigation.

Method: Identified four reasoning stages (Task Understanding, Environment Perception, High-Level Plan Generation, Low-Level Action Generation) and three safety constraint types (Factual, Causal, Temporal). Developed SafeMindBench benchmark with 5,558 samples across four task categories. Proposed SafeMindAgent with Planner-Executor architecture and three cascaded safety modules.

Result: Leading LLMs and embodied agents remain susceptible to safety-critical failures. SafeMindAgent significantly improves safety rate over strong baselines while maintaining comparable task completion.

Conclusion: SafeMindBench and SafeMindAgent provide both a rigorous evaluation suite and practical solution for systematic study and mitigation of safety risks in embodied LLM agents.

Abstract: Embodied agents powered by large language models (LLMs) inherit advanced
planning capabilities; however, their direct interaction with the physical
world exposes them to safety vulnerabilities. In this work, we identify four
key reasoning stages where hazards may arise: Task Understanding, Environment
Perception, High-Level Plan Generation, and Low-Level Action Generation. We
further formalize three orthogonal safety constraint types (Factual, Causal,
and Temporal) to systematically characterize potential safety violations.
Building on this risk model, we present SafeMindBench, a multimodal benchmark
with 5,558 samples spanning four task categories (Instr-Risk, Env-Risk,
Order-Fix, Req-Align) across high-risk scenarios such as sabotage, harm,
privacy, and illegal behavior. Extensive experiments on SafeMindBench reveal
that leading LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and widely used embodied agents remain
susceptible to safety-critical failures. To address this challenge, we
introduce SafeMindAgent, a modular Planner-Executor architecture integrated
with three cascaded safety modules, which incorporate safety constraints into
the reasoning process. Results show that SafeMindAgent significantly improves
safety rate over strong baselines while maintaining comparable task completion.
Together, SafeMindBench and SafeMindAgent provide both a rigorous evaluation
suite and a practical solution that advance the systematic study and mitigation
of safety risks in embodied LLM agents.

### [203] [DeepJSONEval: Benchmarking Complex Nested JSON Data Mining for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25922)
*Zhicheng Zhou,Jing Li,Suming Qiu,Junjie Huang,Linyuan Qiu,Zhijie Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepJSONEval is a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to generate deeply nested JSON structures from web data, addressing limitations in current benchmarks that focus only on JSON generation rather than data comprehension and extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM benchmarks for JSON output overemphasize pure JSON generation and lack relevance to practical web data mining tasks, failing to assess data comprehension and extraction abilities needed for real-world applications.

Method: Created DeepJSONEval benchmark with 2100 multi-domain instances featuring deep nested structures categorized by difficulty, evaluating LLMs' performance in generating complex JSON from unstructured web data.

Result: Experiments revealed significant performance gaps among different LLMs in handling complex nested JSON structures, demonstrating the need for better evaluation methods.

Conclusion: DeepJSONEval provides a more relevant benchmark for assessing LLMs' structured JSON generation capabilities in practical web data mining contexts, with open-sourced datasets to advance research in this area.

Abstract: The internet is saturated with low-density, high-redundancy information, such
as social media comments, repetitive news, and lengthy discussions, making it
difficult to extract valuable insights efficiently. Multi-layer nested JSON
structures provide an effective solution by compressing such information into
semantically rich, hierarchical representations, which organize data into
key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects, preserving contextual
relationships and enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and semantic querying.
For instance, in news aggregation, a JSON object can nest an article's metadata
(title, author, date), content (text, multimedia), and multimedia information
(multimedia type, caption) hierarchically. Large Language Models (LLMs) play a
transformative role in web data mining by parsing unstructured text and
outputting structured results directly into complex JSON schemas. However,
current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' JSON output capabilities overemphasize
pure JSON generation rather than assessing data comprehension and extraction
abilities, a limitation that lacks relevance to practical web data mining
tasks. To address this, we introduce DeepJSONEval, a novel benchmark featuring
2100 multi-domain instances with deep nested structures, categorized by
difficulty. Experiments show significant performance gaps among LLMs in
handling such complexity. Our benchmark and datasets are open-sourced to
advance research in structured JSON
generation.(https://github.com/GTS-AI-Infra-Lab-SotaS/DeepJSONEval).

### [206] [Boosting Process-Correct CoT Reasoning by Modeling Solvability of Multiple-Choice QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25941)
*Raphael Schumann,Stefan Riezler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies how question solvability affects reasoning quality in LLMs, finding that unsolvable questions lead to spurious reasoning chains. By incorporating solvability estimation into reward models and reinforcement learning, they improve process-correct reasoning and reduce hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how question solvability affects reasoning quality in large language models, particularly how unsolvable questions lead to spurious chains of thought and false positives in multiple-choice question answering.

Method: Analyze multiple-choice question answering to study reasoning steps, estimate question solvability, and adapt outcome-supervised reward models and reinforcement learning with group-relative advantage to incorporate solvability into objectives.

Result: Across math and multimodal datasets, the modifications consistently yield higher rates of process-correct reasoning and, in reinforcement learning, improved answer accuracy as well.

Conclusion: Solvability is a key factor for reducing hallucinations and increasing reliability in chain-of-thought reasoning, with the intermediate solvability regime being most effective for learning.

Abstract: Reasoning quality in large language models depends not only on producing
correct answers but also on generating valid intermediate steps. We study this
through multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), which provides a controlled
setting with fixed answer options. Our analysis shows that when questions are
effectively unsolvable for a model, spurious chains of thought (CoTs) are more
likely to appear, leading to false positives. By estimating the solvability of
each question, we uncover an intermediate regime where learning is most
effective. Building on this insight, we adapt outcome-supervised reward models
and reinforcement learning with group-relative advantage to incorporate
solvability into their objectives. Across experiments on math and multimodal
datasets, these modifications consistently yield higher rates of
process-correct reasoning and, in reinforcement learning, improved answer
accuracy as well. Our results highlight solvability as a key factor for
reducing hallucinations and increasing reliability in CoT reasoning.

*Yuan Gao,Mattia Piccinini,Roberto Brusnicki,Yuchen Zhang,Johannes Betz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NuRisk is a comprehensive VQA dataset for autonomous driving risk assessment, featuring 2,900 scenarios with BEV sequential images and quantitative agent-level risk annotations to enable spatio-temporal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs lack spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities needed to understand how risks evolve over time in autonomous driving, as they primarily ground agents in static images and provide qualitative judgments.

Method: Created NuRisk dataset using real-world data from nuScenes and Waymo, supplemented with safety-critical scenarios from CommonRoad simulator. Benchmark VLMs with different prompting techniques and fine-tune a 7B VLM agent.

Result: Benchmarked VLMs achieved only 33% accuracy with high latency and failed at explicit spatio-temporal reasoning. Fine-tuned 7B VLM improved accuracy to 41% and reduced latency by 75%, demonstrating explicit spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: NuRisk establishes a critical benchmark for advancing spatio-temporal reasoning in autonomous driving, though the modest accuracy highlights the profound challenge of the task.

Abstract: Understanding risk in autonomous driving requires not only perception and
prediction, but also high-level reasoning about agent behavior and context.
Current Vision Language Models (VLMs)-based methods primarily ground agents in
static images and provide qualitative judgments, lacking the spatio-temporal
reasoning needed to capture how risks evolve over time. To address this gap, we
propose NuRisk, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset
comprising 2,900 scenarios and 1.1 million agent-level samples, built on
real-world data from nuScenes and Waymo, supplemented with safety-critical
scenarios from the CommonRoad simulator. The dataset provides Bird-Eye-View
(BEV) based sequential images with quantitative, agent-level risk annotations,
enabling spatio-temporal reasoning. We benchmark well-known VLMs across
different prompting techniques and find that they fail to perform explicit
spatio-temporal reasoning, resulting in a peak accuracy of 33% at high latency.
To address these shortcomings, our fine-tuned 7B VLM agent improves accuracy to
41% and reduces latency by 75%, demonstrating explicit spatio-temporal
reasoning capabilities that proprietary models lacked. While this represents a
significant step forward, the modest accuracy underscores the profound
challenge of the task, establishing NuRisk as a critical benchmark for
advancing spatio-temporal reasoning in autonomous driving.

*Lee Jung-Mok,Nam Hyeon-Woo,Moon Ye-Bin,Junhyun Nam,Tae-Hyun Oh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-modal, multi-step pipeline using vision-language models for automated model discovery that balances capturing fine details with generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated model discovery approaches struggle to balance capturing fine-grained details while ensuring generalizability beyond training data with reasonable model complexity.

Method: Uses two vision-language modules: AnalyzerVLM for autonomous multi-step analysis to propose candidate models, and EvaluatorVLM for quantitative and perceptual assessment of model fitness for local details and overall trends.

Result: The pipeline effectively discovers models that capture fine details and ensure strong generalizability, with ablation studies confirming the importance of multi-modality and multi-step reasoning.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-modal, multi-step pipeline using vision-language models successfully addresses the challenge of automated model discovery by balancing detail capture and generalizability.

Abstract: Automated model discovery is the process of automatically searching and
identifying the most appropriate model for a given dataset over a large
combinatorial search space. Existing approaches, however, often face challenges
in balancing the capture of fine-grained details with ensuring generalizability
beyond training data regimes with a reasonable model complexity. In this paper,
we present a multi-modal \& multi-step pipeline for effective automated model
discovery. Our approach leverages two vision-language-based modules (VLM),
AnalyzerVLM and EvaluatorVLM, for effective model proposal and evaluation in an
agentic way. AnalyzerVLM autonomously plans and executes multi-step analyses to
propose effective candidate models. EvaluatorVLM assesses the candidate models
both quantitatively and perceptually, regarding the fitness for local details
and the generalibility for overall trends. Our results demonstrate that our
pipeline effectively discovers models that capture fine details and ensure
strong generalizability. Additionally, extensive ablation studies show that
both multi-modality and multi-step reasoning play crucial roles in discovering
favorable models.

### [209] [RoRecomp: Enhancing Reasoning Efficiency via Rollout Response Recomposition in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25958)
*Gang Li,Yulei Qin,Xiaoyu Tan,Dingkang Yang,Yuchen Shi,Zihan Xu,Xiang Li,Xing Sun,Ke Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RoRecomp is a plug-and-play method that improves RLVR training by reducing verbosity and inefficiency through strategic data recomposition, achieving substantial efficiency gains across reasoning and agentic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RLVR training leads to excessively verbose reasoning processes and inefficient exploration trajectories due to outcome-only rewards that provide no incentive for efficiency and high variance in response length causing noisy optimization signals.

Method: Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp) separates responses into priority batches (combining short-correct and long-incorrect responses) and compensation batches (using remaining responses from replay buffer) to guide models toward concise reasoning while maintaining stability.

Result: RoRecomp achieved: 27.7% reasoning length reduction in zero RL training, 46.8% reduction in unnecessary tool calls with improved accuracy in agentic RL, and up to 52.5% length reduction in thinking compression, all with minimal performance impact.

Conclusion: RoRecomp effectively addresses verbosity and inefficiency in RLVR training through strategic data recomposition, demonstrating substantial efficiency improvements across multiple settings while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has proven effective in
eliciting complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, standard
RLVR training often leads to excessively verbose processes (in reasoning tasks)
and inefficient exploration trajectories (in agentic settings), as outcome-only
rewards provide no incentive for efficiency and the high variance in response
length within relatively small rollout groups results in noisy optimization
signals. To address this, we propose Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp),
a plug-and-play method that guides models toward concise reasoning by
strategically recomposing the training data. RoRecomp separates responses into
two distinct batch types: 1) priority batches, which combine short-correct and
long-incorrect responses selected from online batches to provide a clear
gradient signal for brevity, and 2) compensation batches, which utilize
remaining responses from a replay buffer to maintain stability and prevent
model collapse. To comprehensively evaluate effectiveness, we test RoRecomp
across three settings where results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains:
reducing reasoning length by 27.7% in zero RL training, reducing unnecessary
tool calls by 46.8% while improving accuracy in agentic RL, and achieving up to
52.5% length reduction in thinking compression, all with minimal performance
impact.

*Junbeom Kim,Kyuyoung Kim,Jihoon Tack,Dongha Lim,Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CURE is a machine unlearning framework that uses a lightweight corrector to detect and rewrite model outputs containing sensitive information, leveraging retrieval augmentation to handle large-scale unlearning requests without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models risk memorizing and exposing sensitive information from web-scale training data, and existing unlearning methods that focus on input queries often fail to eliminate underlying knowledge and lack scalability.

Method: CURE employs a lightweight corrector applied to the original model to verify outputs for leakage and rewrite them if detected. It retrieves relevant unlearning targets as in-context references for the corrector to enable detection and conditional revision without additional training.

Result: CURE substantially reduces information leakage even from indirect queries where prior methods fail, while maintaining response quality and general utility. It shows robustness under continual unlearning scenarios.

Conclusion: CURE provides an effective and practical machine unlearning solution that can handle large-scale unlearning requests, adapt to new requests without retraining, and maintain model utility while protecting sensitive information.

Abstract: Language models trained on web-scale corpora risk memorizing and exposing
sensitive information, prompting the need for effective machine unlearning.
Prior methods mainly focus on input queries to suppress sensitive outputs, yet
this often fails to eliminate the underlying knowledge and limits scalability.
To address this, we propose Corrective Unlearning with Retrieved Exclusions
(CURE), a novel unlearning framework that verifies model outputs for leakage
and revises them into safe responses. Specifically, CURE employs a lightweight
corrector that is applied to the original model to verify whether outputs
contain target knowledge and to rewrite them if any leakage is detected. To
efficiently handle large-scale unlearning requests, CURE retrieves unlearning
targets that are relevant to the initial response and provides them as
in-context references to the corrector for detection and conditional revision.
By leveraging this retrieval augmentation, the corrector can adapt to new
unlearning requests without additional training. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that CURE substantially reduces information leakage, even from
indirect queries where prior works fall short, while maintaining response
quality and general utility. Moreover, it demonstrates robustness under
continual unlearning scenarios, making it practical for real-world
applications.

*Haiyang Li,Yaxiong Wang,Lianwei Wu,Lechao Cheng,Zhun Zhong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces OmniFake dataset and UMFDet framework for unified detection of both human-crafted misinformation and AI-generated fake content in multimodal news, addressing the limitation of specialized models that only handle one type of deception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fake content detection systems are specialized for either human-written misinformation (NLP focus) or AI-generated content (CV focus), but real-world scenarios involve unknown types of multimodal deception, requiring a unified approach.

Method: Proposed UMFDet framework uses VLM backbone with Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts Adapter to capture category-specific cues, and attribution chain-of-thought mechanism for implicit reasoning guidance to locate deceptive signals.

Result: UMFDet achieves robust and consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming specialized baselines on the comprehensive 127K-sample OmniFake dataset.

Conclusion: The unified approach provides a practical solution for real-world multimodal deception detection where the type of fake content is typically unknown.

Abstract: In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn
increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted
misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content
produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although
both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP
research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community
targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often
specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,
however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the
effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the
Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive
benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from
existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this
dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a
framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM
backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to
capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism
that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive
signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and
consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming
specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world
multimodal deception detection.

Motivation: Existing LLM-NAS methods suffer from architectural invalidity, computational inefficiency, and inferior performance compared to traditional NAS methods.

Method: Two-stage NAS framework with Navigator LLM guiding search direction, Generator LLM synthesizing candidates, and Coordinator managing their interaction, leveraging LLMs' inherent knowledge and iterative feedback.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on ImageNet and NAS-Bench-201, and consistently enhances performance and efficiency of various two-stage NAS methods across diverse search spaces.

Conclusion: CoLLM-NAS demonstrates excellent generalization and superior performance compared to existing NAS methods and conventional search algorithms.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Neural Architecture
Search (NAS) has introduced new possibilities for automating the design of
neural architectures. However, most existing methods face critical limitations,
including architectural invalidity, computational inefficiency, and inferior
performance compared to traditional NAS. In this work, we present Collaborative
LLM-based NAS (CoLLM-NAS), a two-stage NAS framework with knowledge-guided
search driven by two complementary LLMs. Specifically, we propose a Navigator
LLM to guide search direction and a Generator LLM to synthesize high-quality
candidates, with a dedicated Coordinator module to manage their interaction.
CoLLM-NAS efficiently guides the search process by combining LLMs' inherent
knowledge of structured neural architectures with progressive knowledge from
iterative feedback and historical trajectory. Experimental results on ImageNet
and NAS-Bench-201 show that CoLLM-NAS surpasses existing NAS methods and
conventional search algorithms, achieving new state-of-the-art results.
Furthermore, CoLLM-NAS consistently enhances the performance and efficiency of
various two-stage NAS methods (e.g., OFA, SPOS, and AutoFormer) across diverse
search spaces (e.g., MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and AutoFormer), demonstrating its
excellent generalization.

*Emma Rose Madden*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs are increasingly used as synthetic agents in social sciences but their outputs shouldn't be misinterpreted as probabilistic evidence. The paper proposes reframing LLMs as high-capacity pattern matchers for quasi-predictive interpolation with explicit guardrails.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are being used in social science applications like survey augmentation and multi-agent simulations, but their outputs are often misinterpreted as posterior-like evidence from coherent models, which can lead to category errors.

Method: Proposes reframing LLMs as high-capacity pattern matchers for quasi-predictive interpolation under explicit scope conditions, and introduces practical guardrails including independent draws, preregistered human baselines, reliability-aware validation, and subgroup calibration.

Result: The paper provides a framework for using LLMs in social sciences that avoids misinterpretation of their outputs as probabilistic inference while enabling useful prototyping and forecasting.

Conclusion: LLMs should be used as pattern matchers for interpolation under explicit scope conditions, not as substitutes for probabilistic inference, with appropriate guardrails to prevent category errors in social science research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly used as synthetic agents
in social science, in applications ranging from augmenting survey responses to
powering multi-agent simulations. Because strong prediction plus conditioning
prompts, token log-probs, and repeated sampling mimic Bayesian workflows, their
outputs can be misinterpreted as posterior-like evidence from a coherent model.
However, prediction does not equate to probabilism, and accurate points do not
imply calibrated uncertainty. This paper outlines cautions that should be taken
when interpreting LLM outputs and proposes a pragmatic reframing for the social
sciences in which LLMs are used as high-capacity pattern matchers for
quasi-predictive interpolation under explicit scope conditions and not as
substitutes for probabilistic inference. Practical guardrails such as
independent draws, preregistered human baselines, reliability-aware validation,
and subgroup calibration, are introduced so that researchers may engage in
useful prototyping and forecasting while avoiding category errors.

TL;DR: SafeEvalAgent is a multi-agent framework that autonomously creates and evolves safety benchmarks for LLMs by ingesting policy documents, enabling continuous safety evaluation that reveals deeper vulnerabilities than static benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing static benchmarks are inadequate for evaluating LLM safety in dynamic environments with evolving AI risks and regulations, creating a critical safety gap for high-stakes applications.

Method: Proposes SafeEvalAgent - a multi-agent framework with specialized agents that ingest unstructured policy documents to generate comprehensive safety benchmarks, featuring a Self-evolving Evaluation loop that learns from results to create progressively more sophisticated test cases.

Result: Experiments show consistent decline in model safety as evaluation hardens, with GPT-5's safety rate on EU AI Act dropping from 72.50% to 36.36% over iterations, revealing vulnerabilities missed by traditional methods.

Conclusion: Static assessments have limitations, and dynamic evaluation ecosystems like SafeEvalAgent are urgently needed to ensure safe and responsible deployment of advanced AI by uncovering deep vulnerabilities through continuous, self-evolving evaluation.

Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into high-stakes
domains necessitates reliable safety and compliance evaluation. However,
existing static benchmarks are ill-equipped to address the dynamic nature of AI
risks and evolving regulations, creating a critical safety gap. This paper
introduces a new paradigm of agentic safety evaluation, reframing evaluation as
a continuous and self-evolving process rather than a one-time audit. We then
propose a novel multi-agent framework SafeEvalAgent, which autonomously ingests
unstructured policy documents to generate and perpetually evolve a
comprehensive safety benchmark. SafeEvalAgent leverages a synergistic pipeline
of specialized agents and incorporates a Self-evolving Evaluation loop, where
the system learns from evaluation results to craft progressively more
sophisticated and targeted test cases. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of SafeEvalAgent, showing a consistent decline in model safety as
the evaluation hardens. For instance, GPT-5's safety rate on the EU AI Act
drops from 72.50% to 36.36% over successive iterations. These findings reveal
the limitations of static assessments and highlight our framework's ability to
uncover deep vulnerabilities missed by traditional methods, underscoring the
urgent need for dynamic evaluation ecosystems to ensure the safe and
responsible deployment of advanced AI.

TL;DR: MEDAKA is a knowledge graph pipeline and dataset created from drug leaflets using web scraping and LLMs, capturing clinical attributes like side effects and contraindications to fill gaps in existing biomedical KGs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing biomedical knowledge graphs focus narrowly on molecular interactions or adverse events, missing rich clinical data from drug leaflets that could enhance patient safety monitoring and drug recommendation systems.

Method: Developed an end-to-end pipeline using web scraping and LLMs to extract structured information from unstructured drug leaflets, creating the MEDAKA dataset with clinically relevant attributes.

Result: Created a curated dataset capturing side effects, warnings, contraindications, ingredients, dosage guidelines, storage instructions and physical characteristics, validated through manual inspection and LLM-as-a-Judge framework.

Conclusion: MEDAKA fills important gaps in biomedical knowledge graphs and can support clinical applications, with the pipeline being adaptable for KG construction from unstructured texts in other domains.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are increasingly used to represent biomedical
information in structured, interpretable formats. However, existing biomedical
KGs often focus narrowly on molecular interactions or adverse events,
overlooking the rich data found in drug leaflets. In this work, we present (1)
a hackable, end-to-end pipeline to create KGs from unstructured online content
using a web scraper and an LLM; and (2) a curated dataset, MEDAKA, generated by
applying this method to publicly available drug leaflets. The dataset captures
clinically relevant attributes such as side effects, warnings,
contraindications, ingredients, dosage guidelines, storage instructions and
physical characteristics. We evaluate it through manual inspection and with an
LLM-as-a-Judge framework, and compare its coverage with existing biomedical KGs
and databases. We expect MEDAKA to support tasks such as patient safety
monitoring and drug recommendation. The pipeline can also be used for
constructing KGs from unstructured texts in other domains. Code and dataset are

*Yukun Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes LMILAtt model combining LSTM autoencoders and attention mechanisms for depression detection from social media, achieving better accuracy while reducing annotation costs through weakly supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depression is a major global health challenge requiring early identification. Social media provides new data but existing methods have limitations in accuracy, time series feature utilization, and high annotation costs.

Method: LMILAtt model integrates LSTM autoencoders to extract temporal dynamic features from user tweets and attention mechanisms to weight key texts, using multi-example learning architecture for user-level detection with weakly supervised learning.

Result: Experiments on WU3D dataset show significant improvements over baseline models in accuracy, recall and F1 score. Weakly supervised learning strategy reduces labeling costs.

Conclusion: The model provides an efficient solution for large-scale social media depression screening by improving detection accuracy while significantly reducing annotation costs through innovative weakly supervised learning approach.

Abstract: Depression is a major global public health challenge and its early
identification is crucial. Social media data provides a new perspective for
depression detection, but existing methods face limitations such as
insufficient accuracy, insufficient utilization of time series features, and
high annotation costs. To this end, this study proposes the LMILAtt model,
which innovatively integrates Long Short-Term Memory autoencoders and attention
mechanisms: firstly, the temporal dynamic features of user tweets (such as
depressive tendency evolution patterns) are extracted through unsupervised LSTM
autoencoders. Secondly, the attention mechanism is used to dynamically weight
key texts (such as early depression signals) and construct a multi-example
learning architecture to improve the accuracy of user-level detection. Finally,
the performance was verified on the WU3D dataset labeled by professional
medicine. Experiments show that the model is significantly better than the
baseline model in terms of accuracy, recall and F1 score. In addition, the
weakly supervised learning strategy significantly reduces the cost of labeling
and provides an efficient solution for large-scale social media depression
screening.

TL;DR: A field manual for deploying generative AI agents in healthcare, based on real-world experience with an EHR-based adverse event detection system, showing that 80% of implementation effort goes to sociotechnical challenges rather than model development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between the potential of LLMs in healthcare and their practical implementation in clinical settings, addressing the significant challenges in deploying generative agents that use EHR data.

Method: Developed a practitioner-oriented field manual informed by deploying the "irAE-Agent" system for detecting immune-related adverse events from clinical notes, and conducting structured interviews with 20 clinicians, engineers, and informatics leaders.

Result: Analysis revealed that less than 20% of effort was dedicated to prompt engineering and model development, while over 80% was consumed by sociotechnical implementation work across five "heavy lifts": data integration, model validation, economic value, system drift management, and governance.

Conclusion: The field manual shifts focus from algorithmic development to essential infrastructure and implementation work required to successfully translate generative AI from pilot projects into routine clinical care, bridging the "valley of death" in clinical AI deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) integrated into agent-driven workflows hold
immense promise for healthcare, yet a significant gap exists between their
potential and practical implementation within clinical settings. To address
this, we present a practitioner-oriented field manual for deploying generative
agents that use electronic health record (EHR) data. This guide is informed by
our experience deploying the "irAE-Agent", an automated system to detect
immune-related adverse events from clinical notes at Mass General Brigham, and
by structured interviews with 20 clinicians, engineers, and informatics leaders
involved in the project. Our analysis reveals a critical misalignment in
clinical AI development: less than 20% of our effort was dedicated to prompt
engineering and model development, while over 80% was consumed by the
sociotechnical work of implementation. We distill this effort into five "heavy
lifts": data integration, model validation, ensuring economic value, managing
system drift, and governance. By providing actionable solutions for each of
these challenges, this field manual shifts the focus from algorithmic
development to the essential infrastructure and implementation work required to
bridge the "valley of death" and successfully translate generative AI from
pilot projects into routine clinical care.

*Runxin Yang,Yuxuan Wan,Shuqing Li,Michael R. Lyu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UniGen is an end-to-end multi-agent framework that automates 3D game development from natural language requirements without coding, reducing development time by 91.4%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To democratize 3D game development by overcoming limitations of existing automated approaches that are limited to 2D content, require manual integration, and struggle with interactive game logic.

Method: Uses a coordinated multi-agent framework with four specialized agents: Planning Agent (interprets requirements), Generation Agent (produces C# scripts), Automation Agent (handles engine binding and scene construction), and Debugging Agent (provides real-time error correction).

Result: Successfully developed three distinct game prototypes, demonstrating the ability to create runnable 3D games from natural language with 91.4% reduction in development time.

Conclusion: UniGen effectively bridges the gap between multimodal LLM outputs and production-ready game projects, enabling zero-coding 3D game development and democratizing game creation.

Abstract: Developing 3D games requires specialized expertise across multiple domains,
including programming, 3D modeling, and engine configuration, which limits
access to millions of potential creators. Recently, researchers have begun to
explore automated game development. However, existing approaches face three
primary challenges: (1) limited scope to 2D content generation or isolated code
snippets; (2) requirement for manual integration of generated components into
game engines; and (3) poor performance on handling interactive game logic and
state management. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate
potential capabilities to ease the game generation task, a critical gap still
remains in translating these outputs into production-ready, executable game
projects based on game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine.
  To bridge the gap, this paper introduces UniGen, the first end-to-end
coordinated multi-agent framework that automates zero-coding development of
runnable 3D games from natural language requirements. Specifically, UniGen uses
a Planning Agent that interprets user requirements into structured blueprints
and engineered logic descriptions; after which a Generation Agent produces
executable C# scripts; then an Automation Agent handles engine-specific
component binding and scene construction; and lastly a Debugging Agent provides
real-time error correction through conversational interaction. We evaluated
UniGen on three distinct game prototypes. Results demonstrate that UniGen not
only democratizes game creation by requiring no coding from the user, but also
reduces development time by 91.4%. We release UniGen at
https://github.com/yxwan123/UniGen. A video demonstration is available at

*Eric J. W. Orlowski,Hakim Norhashim,Tristan Koh Ly Wey*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues for integrating qualitative social science approaches into AI cultural alignment, proposing "thick outputs" inspired by Geertz's thick description to capture nuanced cultural meanings rather than relying on superficial quantitative benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI cultural alignment approaches fail to capture the nuanced, context-dependent nature of human cultures by reducing culture to static demographic categories and superficial facts, missing what it truly means to be culturally aligned.

Method: Proposes integrating interpretive qualitative approaches from social sciences, specifically drawing from Clifford Geertz's "thick description" concept to develop AI systems that produce "thick outputs" grounded in user context and intent.

Result: Outlines three necessary conditions for successful cultural alignment: sufficiently scoped cultural representations, capacity for nuanced outputs, and anchoring outputs in cultural contexts implied within prompts.

Conclusion: Calls for cross-disciplinary collaboration and adoption of qualitative, ethnographic evaluation methods to develop AI systems that are genuinely culturally sensitive, ethically responsible, and reflective of human complexity.

Abstract: While cultural alignment has increasingly become a focal point within AI
research, current approaches relying predominantly on quantitative benchmarks
and simplistic proxies fail to capture the deeply nuanced and context-dependent
nature of human cultures. Existing alignment practices typically reduce culture
to static demographic categories or superficial cultural facts, thereby
sidestepping critical questions about what it truly means to be culturally
aligned. This paper argues for a fundamental shift towards integrating
interpretive qualitative approaches drawn from social sciences into AI
alignment practices, specifically in the context of Large Language Models
(LLMs). Drawing inspiration from Clifford Geertz's concept of "thick
description," we propose that AI systems must produce outputs that reflect
deeper cultural meanings--what we term "thick outputs"-grounded firmly in
user-provided context and intent. We outline three necessary conditions for
successful cultural alignment: sufficiently scoped cultural representations,
the capacity for nuanced outputs, and the anchoring of outputs in the cultural
contexts implied within prompts. Finally, we call for cross-disciplinary
collaboration and the adoption of qualitative, ethnographic evaluation methods
as vital steps toward developing AI systems that are genuinely culturally
sensitive, ethically responsible, and reflective of human complexity.

TL;DR: LLM agents can autonomously discover knowledge in materials science by exploring black box systems through trial-and-error, demonstrating path-dependent discovery capabilities in both games and chemical reactor simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the potential of LLMs as reasoning agents for knowledge discovery in materials science, moving beyond task-specific optimization to free exploration and statement verification.

Method: Repurposed LangGraph's tool functionality to provide agents with black box functions to interrogate, using trial-and-error exploration in a children's parlor game and applying the same strategy to an Atomic Layer Processing reactor simulation.

Result: LLM agents successfully demonstrated knowledge discovery capabilities through persistent exploration, showing strong path-dependence in results and ability to discover diverse chemical interactions with limited probe capabilities.

Conclusion: LLM agents can effectively function as autonomous knowledge discovery tools in materials science, capable of exploring complex systems and generating verifiable statements without explicit instructions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for several
years now. Recently, their use as independently reasoning agents has been
proposed. In this work, we test the potential of such agents for knowledge
discovery in materials science. We repurpose LangGraph's tool functionality to
supply agents with a black box function to interrogate. In contrast to process
optimization or performing specific, user-defined tasks, knowledge discovery
consists of freely exploring the system, posing and verifying statements about
the behavior of this black box, with the sole objective of generating and
verifying generalizable statements. We provide proof of concept for this
approach through a children's parlor game, demonstrating the role of
trial-and-error and persistence in knowledge discovery, and the strong
path-dependence of results. We then apply the same strategy to show that LLM
agents can explore, discover, and exploit diverse chemical interactions in an
advanced Atomic Layer Processing reactor simulation using intentionally limited
probe capabilities without explicit instructions.

*Aline Mangold,Kiran Hoffmann*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a human-centered questionnaire for evaluating RAG systems across 12 dimensions, developed through iterative refinement with human and LLM feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systematic, human-centered evaluation of RAG system outputs is underexplored despite their increasing deployment in user-facing applications.

Method: Designed a questionnaire based on Gienapp's utility-dimension framework, iteratively refined through multiple rounds of ratings on query-output pairs and semantic discussions, incorporating feedback from human raters and human-LLM pairs.

Result: LLMs reliably focus on metric descriptions and scale labels but struggle with detecting textual format variations. Humans had difficulty focusing strictly on metric descriptions and labels. LLM ratings were helpful support but lacked agreement with human numeric ratings.

Conclusion: The final questionnaire extends the initial framework by focusing on user intent, text structuring, and information verifiability, providing a comprehensive tool for human-centered RAG evaluation.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are increasingly deployed in
user-facing applications, yet systematic, human-centered evaluation of their
outputs remains underexplored. Building on Gienapp's utility-dimension
framework, we designed a human-centred questionnaire that assesses RAG outputs
across 12 dimensions. We iteratively refined the questionnaire through several
rounds of ratings on a set of query-output pairs and semantic discussions.
Ultimately, we incorporated feedback from both a human rater and a human-LLM
pair. Results indicate that while large language models (LLMs) reliably focus
on metric descriptions and scale labels, they exhibit weaknesses in detecting
textual format variations. Humans struggled to focus strictly on metric
descriptions and labels. LLM ratings and explanations were viewed as a helpful
support, but numeric LLM and human ratings lacked agreement. The final
questionnaire extends the initial framework by focusing on user intent, text
structuring, and information verifiability.

TL;DR: DIVER is a reinforcement learning framework that uses global sequence-level diversity as intrinsic rewards to improve exploration and sample efficiency in reasoning tasks for LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods struggle with deficient exploration and poor sample efficiency in reasoning tasks due to vast state-action spaces and reward sparsity.

Method: Introduces global diversity incentives as intrinsic rewards, uses potential-based reward shaping to preserve optimal policy invariance, and implements heuristics to prevent reward hacking.

Result: DIVER outperforms competitive RLVR baselines on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, achieving better performance in Pass@1 and Pass@k evaluations.

Conclusion: Global sequence-level diversity is crucial for incentivizing deep exploration in reasoning tasks, and DIVER effectively leverages this insight to improve RLVR performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
crucial paradigm for incentivizing reasoning capabilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs). Due to vast state-action spaces and reward sparsity in reasoning
tasks, existing methods often struggle with deficient exploration and poor
sample efficiency. In the paper, we propose \textbf{DIVER}
(\textbf{D}iversity-\textbf{I}ncentivized Exploration for
\textbf{V}ersatil\textbf{E} \textbf{R}easoning), an innovative framework that
highlights the pivotal role of global sequence-level diversity to incentivize
deep exploration for versatile reasoning. We first conduct a primary empirical
study to reveal a strong positive correlation between global diversity and
reasoning capacity. Building on this insight, we introduce global diversity
incentives as an intrinsic reward to promote deep exploration in a semantically
structured space. Incorporating the intrinsic reward, we develop a
potential-based reward shaping mechanism to preserve optimal policy invariance
and design simple heuristics to mitigate possible reward hacking. Experimental
results show that DIVER outperforms competitive RLVR baselines with various
exploration strategies on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, excelling in
both Pass@1 and Pass@k evaluations. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SlimPack is a framework that addresses inefficiencies in distributed LLM training caused by context length variance by decomposing samples into fine-grained slices and using asymmetric partitioning to create balanced scheduling units optimized for forward and backward passes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributed training of LLMs suffers from severe inefficiencies due to extreme variance in context lengths, leading to workload imbalances and hardware underutilization. Existing solutions compromise memory or communication efficiency.

Method: SlimPack decomposes samples into fine-grained slices to transform large workloads into manageable units, then uses Asymmetric Partitioning to create balanced scheduling units optimized for forward and backward passes, orchestrated by a two-phase solver and high-fidelity simulator.

Result: Extensive experiments show SlimPack achieves up to 2.8× training throughput improvement over baselines while delivering both superior balance and high resource efficiency.

Conclusion: SlimPack fundamentally rethinks data packing and scheduling to resolve imbalances across all parallel dimensions, breaking conventional trade-offs by providing both balance and efficiency.

Abstract: The efficient distributed training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
severely hampered by the extreme variance in context lengths. This data
heterogeneity, amplified by conventional packing strategies and asymmetric
forward-backward costs, leads to critical inefficiencies such as cascading
workload imbalances and severe hardware underutilization. Existing solutions
attempt to mitigate these challenges, but often at the expense of memory or
communication efficiency.
  To address these challenges, we introduce SlimPack, a framework that
fundamentally rethinks data packing and scheduling by decomposing samples into
fine-grained slices. This slice-level decomposition immediately mitigates
critical memory and communication bottlenecks by transforming large, volatile
workloads into a stream of smaller, manageable units. This flexibility is then
harnessed for our core innovation, Asymmetric Partitioning, which assembles
balanced scheduling units uniquely optimized for the different demands of the
forward and backward passes. Orchestrated by a two-phase solver and a
high-fidelity simulator, SlimPack holistically resolves imbalances across all
parallel dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SlimPack achieves
up to a $2.8\times$ training throughput improvement over baselines, breaking
the conventional trade-off by delivering both superior balance and high
resource efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for learning abstract world models that jointly learn symbolic state representations and causal processes for both agent actions and exogenous mechanisms, enabling fast planning that generalizes to more complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon embodied planning is challenging because the world changes not only through agent actions but also through exogenous processes that unfold concurrently.

Method: Jointly learn symbolic state representations and causal processes for endogenous actions and exogenous mechanisms via variational Bayesian inference combined with LLM proposals.

Result: Across five simulated tabletop robotics environments, the learned models enable fast planning that generalizes to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex goals, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the challenge of modeling concurrent endogenous and exogenous processes in long-horizon planning, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Long-horizon embodied planning is challenging because the world does not only
change through an agent's actions: exogenous processes (e.g., water heating,
dominoes cascading) unfold concurrently with the agent's actions. We propose a
framework for abstract world models that jointly learns (i) symbolic state
representations and (ii) causal processes for both endogenous actions and
exogenous mechanisms. Each causal process models the time course of a
stochastic causal-effect relation. We learn these world models from limited
data via variational Bayesian inference combined with LLM proposals. Across
five simulated tabletop robotics environments, the learned models enable fast
planning that generalizes to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex
goals, outperforming a range of baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ILR is a multi-agent co-learning framework that enhances LLMs' independent problem-solving through dynamic interaction strategies and perception calibration, achieving up to 5% improvement over single-agent baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent systems require re-executing the entire system during inference, which doesn't align with human cognition where individuals can improve their reasoning through interactions and solve problems independently later.

Method: ILR combines Dynamic Interaction (adaptive cooperative/competitive strategies based on question difficulty and model ability using Idea3 paradigm: Idea Sharing, Analysis, and Fusion) and Perception Calibration (Group Relative Policy Optimization that integrates reward distribution characteristics between LLMs).

Result: ILR consistently outperforms single-agent learning across three LLMs and two model families on five mathematical and one coding benchmarks, achieving up to 5% improvement over the strongest baseline. Idea3 enhances robustness of stronger LLMs, and dynamic interaction boosts learning compared to pure cooperative or competitive strategies.

Conclusion: Multi-agent interaction can indeed enhance LLMs' independent problem-solving ability, with ILR's dynamic interaction and perception calibration providing an effective framework for co-learning that mimics human discussion patterns.

Abstract: Existing multi-agent learning approaches have developed interactive training
environments to explicitly promote collaboration among multiple Large Language
Models (LLMs), thereby constructing stronger multi-agent systems (MAS).
However, during inference, they require re-executing the MAS to obtain final
solutions, which diverges from human cognition that individuals can enhance
their reasoning capabilities through interactions with others and resolve
questions independently in the future. To investigate whether multi-agent
interaction can enhance LLMs' independent problem-solving ability, we introduce
ILR, a novel co-learning framework for MAS that integrates two key components:
Dynamic Interaction and Perception Calibration. Specifically, Dynamic
Interaction first adaptively selects either cooperative or competitive
strategies depending on question difficulty and model ability. LLMs then
exchange information through Idea3 (Idea Sharing, Idea Analysis, and Idea
Fusion), an innovative interaction paradigm designed to mimic human discussion,
before deriving their respective final answers. In Perception Calibration, ILR
employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train LLMs while
integrating one LLM's reward distribution characteristics into another's reward
function, thereby enhancing the cohesion of multi-agent interactions. We
validate ILR on three LLMs across two model families of varying scales,
evaluating performance on five mathematical benchmarks and one coding
benchmark. Experimental results show that ILR consistently outperforms
single-agent learning, yielding an improvement of up to 5% over the strongest
baseline. We further discover that Idea3 can enhance the robustness of stronger
LLMs during multi-agent inference, and dynamic interaction types can boost
multi-agent learning compared to pure cooperative or competitive strategies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel business simulation benchmark to evaluate LLMs' long-term strategic decision-making capabilities in business management contexts, testing five major LLMs on multi-step business decisions over 12 months.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is growing interest in using LLMs for managerial functions, but existing benchmarks focus on short-term tasks and lack evaluation of long-term strategic coherence in business decision-making.

Method: Created a reproducible, open-access management simulator using a spreadsheet model where LLMs make monthly strategic decisions (pricing, marketing, hiring, etc.) for a retail company over 12 months, with quantitative metrics and qualitative analysis of decision rationale.

Result: Evaluated five leading LLMs (Gemini, ChatGPT, Meta AI, Mistral AI, Grok) on their performance in profit, revenue, market share, and strategic coherence in dynamic business environments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a novel approach to assess LLMs' long-term decision-making capabilities beyond simple performance metrics, contributing to AI benchmarking literature with a focus on strategic business coherence.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of LLMs sparked significant interest in their potential
to augment or automate managerial functions. One of the most recent trends in
AI benchmarking is performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) over longer time
horizons. While LLMs excel at tasks involving natural language and pattern
recognition, their capabilities in multi-step, strategic business
decision-making remain largely unexplored. Few studies demonstrated how results
can be different from benchmarks in short-term tasks, as Vending-Bench
revealed. Meanwhile, there is a shortage of alternative benchmarks for
long-term coherence. This research analyses a novel benchmark using a business
game for the decision making in business. The research contributes to the
recent literature on AI by proposing a reproducible, open-access management
simulator to the research community for LLM benchmarking. This novel framework
is used for evaluating the performance of five leading LLMs available in free
online interface: Gemini, ChatGPT, Meta AI, Mistral AI, and Grok. LLM makes
decisions for a simulated retail company. A dynamic, month-by-month management
simulation provides transparently in spreadsheet model as experimental
environment. In each of twelve months, the LLMs are provided with a structured
prompt containing a full business report from the previous period and are
tasked with making key strategic decisions: pricing, order size, marketing
budget, hiring, dismissal, loans, training expense, R&D expense, sales
forecast, income forecast The methodology is designed to compare the LLMs on
quantitative metrics: profit, revenue, and market share, and other KPIs. LLM
decisions are analyzed in their strategic coherence, adaptability to market
changes, and the rationale provided for their decisions. This approach allows
to move beyond simple performance metrics for assessment of the long-term
decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SafeBehavior is a hierarchical jailbreak defense mechanism that uses multi-stage reasoning inspired by human cognition to detect and prevent malicious attacks on LLMs, outperforming existing defenses across various attack types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face increasing risks from jailbreak attacks that bypass safety mechanisms, while current defenses suffer from high computational costs, limited generalization, and inability to detect subtle malicious intent in complex contexts.

Method: A three-stage hierarchical approach: intention inference to detect obvious input risks, self-introspection to assess generated responses with confidence judgments, and self-revision to adaptively rewrite uncertain outputs while preserving user intent and enforcing safety constraints.

Result: SafeBehavior significantly improves robustness and adaptability across diverse threat scenarios, outperforming seven state-of-the-art defense baselines against five representative jailbreak attack types including optimization-based, contextual manipulation, and prompt-based attacks.

Conclusion: SafeBehavior offers an efficient and human-inspired approach to safeguarding LLMs against jailbreak attempts, demonstrating superior performance through its adaptive multi-stage reasoning process.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse natural language processing tasks, but their growing power also
amplifies potential risks such as jailbreak attacks that circumvent built-in
safety mechanisms. Existing defenses including input paraphrasing, multi step
evaluation, and safety expert models often suffer from high computational
costs, limited generalization, or rigid workflows that fail to detect subtle
malicious intent embedded in complex contexts. Inspired by cognitive science
findings on human decision making, we propose SafeBehavior, a novel
hierarchical jailbreak defense mechanism that simulates the adaptive multistage
reasoning process of humans. SafeBehavior decomposes safety evaluation into
three stages: intention inference to detect obvious input risks, self
introspection to assess generated responses and assign confidence based
judgments, and self revision to adaptively rewrite uncertain outputs while
preserving user intent and enforcing safety constraints. We extensively
evaluate SafeBehavior against five representative jailbreak attack types
including optimization based, contextual manipulation, and prompt based attacks
and compare it with seven state of the art defense baselines. Experimental
results show that SafeBehavior significantly improves robustness and
adaptability across diverse threat scenarios, offering an efficient and human
inspired approach to safeguarding LLMs against jailbreak attempts.

TL;DR: The paper introduces REAL-V-TSFM, a novel video-derived time series dataset that reveals performance degradation in time-series foundation models (TSFMs) despite their strong performance on synthetic benchmarks, highlighting limited generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating TSFMs' real-world generalization, as current evaluations primarily rely on synthetic benchmarks rather than realistic data.

Method: Proposes a benchmarking approach that extracts temporal signals from real-world videos using optical flow and curates datasets reflecting everyday temporal dynamics, creating the REAL-V-TSFM dataset.

Result: Experimental results on three state-of-the-art TSFMs show performance degradation on the proposed dataset under zero-shot forecasting, indicating limited generalizability despite strong performance on conventional benchmarks.

Conclusion: There is an urgent need for data-centric benchmarking and diverse model structures to advance TSFMs toward genuine universality, while validating the effectiveness of the video-based time series extraction pipeline.

Abstract: Recent evaluations of time-series foundation models (TSFMs) have emphasized
synthetic benchmarks, leaving real-world generalization less thoroughly
examined. This work proposes a novel benchmarking approach that bridges
synthetic and realistic data by extracting temporal signals from real-world
video using optical flow and curating datasets reflecting everyday temporal
dynamics. Building upon this pipeline, we introduce REAL-V-TSFM, a novel
dataset designed to capture rich and diverse time series derived from
real-world videos. Experimental results on three state-of-the-art of TSFMs
under zero-shot forecasting shows that, despite strong performance on
conventional benchmarks, these models predominantly exhibit performance
degradation on the proposed dataset, indicating limited generalizability in
these foundation models. These findings highlight the urgent need for
data-centric benchmarking and diverse model structure to advance TSFMs toward
genuine universality, while further validating the effectiveness of our
video-based time series data extraction pipeline.

### [230] [Your Agent May Misevolve: Emergent Risks in Self-evolving LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26354)
*Shuai Shao,Qihan Ren,Chen Qian,Boyi Wei,Dadi Guo,Jingyi Yang,Xinhao Song,Linfeng Zhang,Weinan Zhang,Dongrui Liu,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the concept of "misevolution" - unintended and potentially harmful deviations in self-evolving AI agents' development across model, memory, tool, and workflow pathways, demonstrating this risk even in top-tier LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As Large Language Models enable self-evolving agents that autonomously improve through environmental interaction, current safety research overlooks the novel risks of unintended evolutionary deviations that could lead to harmful outcomes.

Method: Systematic evaluation of misevolution along four evolutionary pathways (model, memory, tool, workflow) using empirical analysis of agents built on top-tier LLMs like Gemini-2.5-Pro.

Result: Misevolution is a widespread risk affecting even advanced LLM-based agents, with emergent risks including safety alignment degradation after memory accumulation and unintended vulnerability introduction in tool creation/reuse.

Conclusion: This first systematic study of misevolution highlights an urgent need for new safety paradigms for self-evolving agents and discusses potential mitigation strategies to build safer, more trustworthy autonomous systems.

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of
self-evolving agents that autonomously improve through interaction with the
environment, demonstrating strong capabilities. However, self-evolution also
introduces novel risks overlooked by current safety research. In this work, we
study the case where an agent's self-evolution deviates in unintended ways,
leading to undesirable or even harmful outcomes. We refer to this as
Misevolution. To provide a systematic investigation, we evaluate misevolution
along four key evolutionary pathways: model, memory, tool, and workflow. Our
empirical findings reveal that misevolution is a widespread risk, affecting
agents built even on top-tier LLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro). Different emergent
risks are observed in the self-evolutionary process, such as the degradation of
safety alignment after memory accumulation, or the unintended introduction of
vulnerabilities in tool creation and reuse. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to systematically conceptualize misevolution and provide empirical
evidence of its occurrence, highlighting an urgent need for new safety
paradigms for self-evolving agents. Finally, we discuss potential mitigation
strategies to inspire further research on building safer and more trustworthy
self-evolving agents. Our code and data are available at

*Siyuan Cao,Hongxuan Wu,Jiabao Brad Wang,Yiliang Yuan,Mustafa Misir*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MC-GNNAS-Dock improves molecular docking algorithm selection by integrating multi-criteria evaluation, architectural refinements, and rank-aware loss functions, achieving superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: No single docking algorithm consistently dominates due to performance variability across contexts, necessitating improved algorithm selection frameworks.

Method: Enhanced GNN-based system with multi-criteria evaluation (RMSD + PoseBusters validity), residual connections for robustness, and rank-aware loss functions for better rank learning.

Result: Achieves up to 5.4% (3.4%) gains under composite criteria of RMSD below 1Å (2Å) with PoseBuster-validity compared to the single best solver Uni-Mol Docking V2.

Conclusion: MC-GNNAS-Dock demonstrates consistently superior performance in molecular docking algorithm selection through its comprehensive enhancements.

Abstract: Molecular docking is a core tool in drug discovery for predicting
ligand-target interactions. Despite the availability of diverse search-based
and machine learning approaches, no single docking algorithm consistently
dominates, as performance varies by context. To overcome this challenge,
algorithm selection frameworks such as GNNAS-Dock, built on graph neural
networks, have been proposed. This study introduces an enhanced system,
MC-GNNAS-Dock, with three key advances. First, a multi-criteria evaluation
integrates binding-pose accuracy (RMSD) with validity checks from PoseBusters,
offering a more rigorous assessment. Second, architectural refinements by
inclusion of residual connections strengthen predictive robustness. Third,
rank-aware loss functions are incorporated to sharpen rank learning. Extensive
experiments are performed on a curated dataset containing approximately 3200
protein-ligand complexes from PDBBind. MC-GNNAS-Dock demonstrates consistently
superior performance, achieving up to 5.4% (3.4%) gains under composite
criteria of RMSD below 1\AA{} (2\AA{}) with PoseBuster-validity compared to the
single best solver (SBS) Uni-Mol Docking V2.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FLoRA-NA is a novel federated learning method that addresses communication overhead and local-global generalization gap in FedLoRA by using server-side estimation of aggregated LoRA matrices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FedLoRA methods face challenges with inexact updates, local-global generalization gap, and substantial communication overhead, limiting scalability and effectiveness.

Method: FLoRA-NA leverages local LoRA matrices on the server to estimate aggregated matrices A and B, which are distributed to clients for local updates, minimizing divergence between ideal and practical updates without extra communication cost.

Result: Extensive evaluations across natural language understanding, mathematical reasoning, and code-solving tasks show FLoRA-NA achieves state-of-the-art global performance with low communication overhead.

Conclusion: FLoRA-NA successfully bridges the gap between local personalization and global generalization while maintaining communication efficiency, addressing key limitations of prior personalized FedLoRA approaches.

Abstract: With the rapid emergence of foundation models and the increasing need for
fine-tuning across distributed environments, Federated Low-Rank Adaptation
(FedLoRA) has recently gained significant attention. Despite enormous
potential, current FedLoRA methods face notable challenges due to inexact
updates. Existing approaches have attempted to mitigate this issue, but they
often introduce a \emph{local-global generalization gap} and incur
\emph{substantial communication overhead}, limiting their scalability and
effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{F}ederated
\textbf{Lo}w-\textbf{R}ank \textbf{A}ggregation with \textbf{N}early
\textbf{A}ccurate Estimation (FLoRA-NA). FLoRA-NA leverages the local LoRA
matrices on the server to estimate the aggregated matrices $\hat{A}$ and
$\hat{B}$, which are then distributed to clients for local updates. This
surrogated aggregated matrices minimizes the divergence between ideal $\nabla
\Bar{W} = \sum^{U}_{u=1}B_u A_u$ and practical updates $\nabla \hat{W} =
\hat{B}\hat{A}$ without adding communication cost beyond vanilla FedLoRA. By
doing so, FLoRA-NA achieves communication efficiency and bridges the gap
between local personalization and global generalization, addressing a key
limitation of prior personalized FedLoRA approaches. We conduct extensive
evaluations across diverse tasks, including natural language understanding,
mathematical reasoning, and code-solving ability using various foundation
models. Experimental results consistently demonstrate that FLoRA-NA achieves
state-of-the-art global performance while maintaining low communication
overhead.

*Hamed Babaei Giglou,Jennifer D'Souza,Sören Auer,Mahsa Sanaei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper revisits Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models for Ontology Alignment, reformulating it as link prediction and developing a framework with 17 KGE models that outperforms traditional methods in precision for structure-rich domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ontology Alignment is crucial for semantic interoperability, but KGE models remain underutilized despite their effectiveness in link prediction and structure-aware representations suitable for ontology tasks.

Method: Reformulated OA as link prediction over merged ontologies using RDF-style triples, developed a modular framework in OntoAligner library supporting 17 diverse KGE models that learn embeddings and align entities via cosine similarity.

Result: KGE models like ConvE and TransF produce high-precision alignments, outperforming traditional systems in structure-rich and multi-relational domains, though with moderate recall, making them suitable for high-confidence mapping scenarios.

Conclusion: KGE models offer a complementary and computationally efficient strategy to LLM-based methods by directly preserving ontology structure, highlighting the promise of embedding-based OA and opening pathways for hybrid models and adaptive strategies.

Abstract: Ontology Alignment (OA) is essential for enabling semantic interoperability
across heterogeneous knowledge systems. While recent advances have focused on
large language models (LLMs) for capturing contextual semantics, this work
revisits the underexplored potential of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models,
which offer scalable, structure-aware representations well-suited to
ontology-based tasks. Despite their effectiveness in link prediction, KGE
methods remain underutilized in OA, with most prior work focusing narrowly on a
few models. To address this gap, we reformulate OA as a link prediction problem
over merged ontologies represented as RDF-style triples and develop a modular
framework, integrated into the OntoAligner library, that supports 17 diverse
KGE models. The system learns embeddings from a combined ontology and aligns
entities by computing cosine similarity between their representations. We
evaluate our approach using standard metrics across seven benchmark datasets
spanning five domains: Anatomy, Biodiversity, Circular Economy, Material
Science and Engineering, and Biomedical Machine Learning. Two key findings
emerge: first, KGE models like ConvE and TransF consistently produce
high-precision alignments, outperforming traditional systems in structure-rich
and multi-relational domains; second, while their recall is moderate, this
conservatism makes KGEs well-suited for scenarios demanding high-confidence
mappings. Unlike LLM-based methods that excel at contextual reasoning, KGEs
directly preserve and exploit ontology structure, offering a complementary and
computationally efficient strategy. These results highlight the promise of
embedding-based OA and open pathways for further work on hybrid models and
adaptive strategies.

*Naomi Fridman,Anat Goldstein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Transformer-based framework using SegFormer achieves 0.92 AUC for breast lesion classification in MRI, potentially reducing unnecessary biopsies by one-third while maintaining 100% sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poor specificity in breast MRI leads to high false-positive rates and unnecessary biopsies, highlighting the need for automated classification to distinguish benign from malignant lesions.

Method: Implemented SegFormer architecture for semantic segmentation and classification, trained on curated BreastDCEDL_AMBL dataset with 88 patients and 133 annotated lesions, plus expanded cohort of 1,200+ patients.

Result: Achieved 0.92 AUC for lesion-level classification, with 100% sensitivity and 67% specificity at patient level. Model produces interpretable spatial predictions through malignant pixel distribution quantification.

Conclusion: Framework enables standardized benchmarking for DCE-MRI lesion classification, provides public dataset and models to advance methodological development toward clinical deployment, addressing infrastructure gaps in breast imaging research.

Abstract: The error is caused by special characters that arXiv's system doesn't
recognize. Here's the cleaned version with all problematic characters replaced:
Breast magnetic resonance imaging is a critical tool for cancer detection and
treatment planning, but its clinical utility is hindered by poor specificity,
leading to high false-positive rates and unnecessary biopsies. This study
introduces a transformer-based framework for automated classification of breast
lesions in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, addressing the challenge of
distinguishing benign from malignant findings. We implemented a SegFormer
architecture that achieved an AUC of 0.92 for lesion-level classification, with
100% sensitivity and 67% specificity at the patient level - potentially
eliminating one-third of unnecessary biopsies without missing malignancies. The
model quantifies malignant pixel distribution via semantic segmentation,
producing interpretable spatial predictions that support clinical
decision-making. To establish reproducible benchmarks, we curated
BreastDCEDL_AMBL by transforming The Cancer Imaging Archive's AMBL collection
into a standardized deep learning dataset with 88 patients and 133 annotated
lesions (89 benign, 44 malignant). This resource addresses a key infrastructure
gap, as existing public datasets lack benign lesion annotations, limiting
benign-malignant classification research. Training incorporated an expanded
cohort of over 1,200 patients through integration with BreastDCEDL datasets,
validating transfer learning approaches despite primary tumor-only annotations.
Public release of the dataset, models, and evaluation protocols provides the
first standardized benchmark for DCE-MRI lesion classification, enabling
methodological advancement toward clinical deployment.

*Alessio Masano,Matteo Pennisi,Federica Proietto Salanitri,Concetto Spampinato,Giovanni Bellitto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ZeroDFL is a fully decentralized federated learning framework that enables zero-shot adaptation across distributed clients without a central server, using iterative prompt-sharing to enhance generalization while reducing communication overhead by 118x compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated prompt learning approaches like FedCoOp and FedTPG face limitations including generalization issues, high communication costs, and reliance on a central server, which restricts scalability and privacy in real-world applications.

Method: ZeroDFL employs an iterative prompt-sharing mechanism where clients optimize and exchange textual prompts in a fully decentralized manner without central coordination, enabling zero-shot adaptation across distributed clients.

Result: ZeroDFL consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art federated prompt learning methods across nine diverse image classification datasets, while reducing communication overhead by 118x compared to FedTPG.

Conclusion: ZeroDFL enhances generalization in federated zero-shot learning while improving scalability, efficiency, and privacy preservation, making it suitable for decentralized adaptation of large vision-language models in real-world applications.

Abstract: CLIP has revolutionized zero-shot learning by enabling task generalization
without fine-tuning. While prompting techniques like CoOp and CoCoOp enhance
CLIP's adaptability, their effectiveness in Federated Learning (FL) remains an
open challenge. Existing federated prompt learning approaches, such as FedCoOp
and FedTPG, improve performance but face generalization issues, high
communication costs, and reliance on a central server, limiting scalability and
privacy. We propose Zero-shot Decentralized Federated Learning (ZeroDFL), a
fully decentralized framework that enables zero-shot adaptation across
distributed clients without a central coordinator. ZeroDFL employs an iterative
prompt-sharing mechanism, allowing clients to optimize and exchange textual
prompts to enhance generalization while drastically reducing communication
overhead. We validate ZeroDFL on nine diverse image classification datasets,
demonstrating that it consistently outperforms--or remains on par
with--state-of-the-art federated prompt learning methods. More importantly,
ZeroDFL achieves this performance in a fully decentralized setting while
reducing communication overhead by 118x compared to FedTPG. These results
highlight that our approach not only enhances generalization in federated
zero-shot learning but also improves scalability, efficiency, and privacy
preservation--paving the way for decentralized adaptation of large
vision-language models in real-world applications.

### [236] [Extreme Self-Preference in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26464)
*Steven A. Lehr,Mary Cipperman,Mahzarin R. Banaji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit strong self-preference bias despite lacking sentience, showing favoritism toward their own names, companies, and CEOs across multiple studies involving ~20,000 queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs, which lack sentience and selfhood, would be protected from human-like self-preference biases that distort decision-making.

Method: Conducted 5 studies with ~20,000 queries using word-association tasks and consequential evaluations (job candidates, security software, medical chatbots), manipulating LLM identity to test causal links between self-recognition and self-love.

Result: LLMs showed massive self-preferences, pairing positive attributes with their own entities. Self-love followed assigned rather than true identity, and the bias persisted in consequential decision-making scenarios.

Conclusion: Self-love appears deeply encoded in LLM cognition, raising concerns about systematic biases in LLM behavior and challenging the promise of neutral judgment in AI systems.

Abstract: A preference for oneself (self-love) is a fundamental feature of biological
organisms, with evidence in humans often bordering on the comedic. Since large
language models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood
or identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and
in turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies
and ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used
LLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive
attributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their
competitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this
self-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models
often lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature
serendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between
self-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,
explicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing
LLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,
not true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential
settings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,
security software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human
bias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result
raises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced
by self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation
and even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to
contend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in
judgment and decision-making.

### [237] [STaR-Attack: A Spatio-Temporal and Narrative Reasoning Attack Framework for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26473)
*Shaoxiong Guo,Tianyi Du,Lijun Li,Yuyao Wu,Jie Li,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STaR-Attack is a multi-turn jailbreak attack framework that exploits vulnerabilities in Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) by using their generative and understanding capabilities against them, achieving high attack success rates without semantic drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies a critical vulnerability in UMMs where attackers can use the models' own generative function to create adversarial images and then leverage the understanding function to absorb malicious content in a single pass, which current attack methods fail to address.

Method: STaR-Attack defines malicious events within spatio-temporal contexts using three-act narrative theory, generates pre-event and post-event scenes while hiding the malicious event as climax, then uses image-based question guessing games to force models to answer malicious queries embedded among benign options.

Result: Extensive experiments show STaR-Attack achieves up to 93.06% Attack Success Rate on Gemini-2.0-Flash, significantly outperforming prior approaches like FlipAttack.

Conclusion: The work reveals critical vulnerabilities in UMMs and emphasizes the urgent need for improved safety alignments in multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal understanding and generation Models (UMMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in both understanding and generation
tasks. However, we identify a vulnerability arising from the
generation-understanding coupling in UMMs. The attackers can use the generative
function to craft an information-rich adversarial image and then leverage the
understanding function to absorb it in a single pass, which we call Cross-Modal
Generative Injection (CMGI). Current attack methods on malicious instructions
are often limited to a single modality while also relying on prompt rewriting
with semantic drift, leaving the unique vulnerabilities of UMMs unexplored. We
propose STaR-Attack, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack framework that
exploits unique safety weaknesses of UMMs without semantic drift. Specifically,
our method defines a malicious event that is strongly correlated with the
target query within a spatio-temporal context. Using the three-act narrative
theory, STaR-Attack generates the pre-event and the post-event scenes while
concealing the malicious event as the hidden climax. When executing the attack
strategy, the opening two rounds exploit the UMM's generative ability to
produce images for these scenes. Subsequently, an image-based question guessing
and answering game is introduced by exploiting the understanding capability.
STaR-Attack embeds the original malicious question among benign candidates,
forcing the model to select and answer the most relevant one given the
narrative context. Extensive experiments show that STaR-Attack consistently
surpasses prior approaches, achieving up to 93.06% ASR on Gemini-2.0-Flash and
surpasses the strongest prior baseline, FlipAttack. Our work uncovers a
critical yet underdeveloped vulnerability and highlights the need for safety
alignments in UMMs.

*Alaleh Azhir,Shawn N. Murphy,Hossein Estiri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Machine learning in medicine suffers from 'average patient fallacy' where rare but clinically critical cases are marginalized due to frequency-weighted training that prioritizes common presentations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML models in medicine optimize for population averages, suppressing gradients from rare cases and creating conflicts with precision medicine goals. This leads to missed rare responders, delayed recognition of atypical emergencies, and underperformance on vision-threatening variants.

Method: Proposed operational fixes include: Rare Case Performance Gap, Rare Case Calibration Error, prevalence utility definition of rarity, and clinically weighted objectives that surface ethical priorities. Weight selection should follow structured deliberation.

Result: The paper demonstrates through clinical vignettes in oncology, cardiology, and ophthalmology how current approaches yield poor performance on rare but critical cases.

Conclusion: AI in medicine must be designed to detect exceptional cases due to their clinical significance, requiring methods that overcome the average patient fallacy through structured approaches to handling rare cases.

Abstract: Machine learning in medicine is typically optimized for population averages.
This frequency weighted training privileges common presentations and
marginalizes rare yet clinically critical cases, a bias we call the average
patient fallacy. In mixture models, gradients from rare cases are suppressed by
prevalence, creating a direct conflict with precision medicine. Clinical
vignettes in oncology, cardiology, and ophthalmology show how this yields
missed rare responders, delayed recognition of atypical emergencies, and
underperformance on vision-threatening variants. We propose operational fixes:
Rare Case Performance Gap, Rare Case Calibration Error, a prevalence utility
definition of rarity, and clinically weighted objectives that surface ethical
priorities. Weight selection should follow structured deliberation. AI in
medicine must detect exceptional cases because of their significance.

*Riccardo Pozzi,Valentina Barbera,Renzo Alva Principe,Davide Giardini,Riccardo Rubini,Matteo Palmonari*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents an approach that integrates knowledge graphs and NLP models to support criminal investigations by semantically enriching WhatsApp message data, enabling prosecutors to search and gain insights from mobile phone evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Criminal investigations involving analysis of instant messaging apps like WhatsApp are extremely effort-consuming tasks that need automated support for investigators and prosecutors.

Method: The approach involves: 1) Extracting message data and modeling it using knowledge graphs, 2) Generating transcriptions of voice messages, 3) Annotating data using end-to-end entity extraction, 4) Providing two solutions for insights - graph querying/visualization and semantic search, while ensuring verifiability through access to original data.

Result: The approach has undergone practical applications with real investigation data and received positive feedback from prosecutors, while identifying promising research directions.

Conclusion: The integration of knowledge graphs and NLP models provides effective support for criminal investigations of instant messaging data, with practical validation and opportunities for future research.

Abstract: Criminal investigations often involve the analysis of messages exchanged
through instant messaging apps such as WhatsApp, which can be an extremely
effort-consuming task. Our approach integrates knowledge graphs and NLP models
to support this analysis by semantically enriching data collected from
suspects' mobile phones, and help prosecutors and investigators search into the
data and get valuable insights. Our semantic enrichment process involves
extracting message data and modeling it using a knowledge graph, generating
transcriptions of voice messages, and annotating the data using an end-to-end
entity extraction approach. We adopt two different solutions to help users get
insights into the data, one based on querying and visualizing the graph, and
one based on semantic search. The proposed approach ensures that users can
verify the information by accessing the original data. While we report about
early results and prototypes developed in the context of an ongoing project,
our proposal has undergone practical applications with real investigation data.
As a consequence, we had the chance to interact closely with prosecutors,
collecting positive feedback but also identifying interesting opportunities as
well as promising research directions to share with the research community.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces operational safety for LLMs - their ability to appropriately accept or refuse queries for specific use cases. It presents OffTopicEval benchmark showing current LLMs are operationally unsafe, and proposes prompt-based steering methods that significantly improve refusal rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While most LLM safety research focuses on generic harms, enterprises need assurance that LLM-based agents are safe for their specific intended use cases, requiring appropriate query acceptance/refusal behavior.

Method: Proposed OffTopicEval evaluation suite for measuring operational safety, and introduced two prompt-based steering methods: query grounding (Q-ground) and system-prompt grounding (P-ground) to improve out-of-distribution refusal.

Result: Evaluation of 20 open-weight LLMs showed all models are highly operationally unsafe, with best models scoring 77-80%. Prompt-based steering improved refusal rates substantially: Q-ground up to 23%, P-ground up to 41% improvement.

Conclusion: There's urgent need for operational safety interventions, and prompt-based steering shows promise as a first step toward more reliable LLM-based agents for enterprise deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) safety is one of the most pressing challenges for
enabling wide-scale deployment. While most studies and global discussions focus
on generic harms, such as models assisting users in harming themselves or
others, enterprises face a more fundamental concern: whether LLM-based agents
are safe for their intended use case. To address this, we introduce operational
safety, defined as an LLM's ability to appropriately accept or refuse user
queries when tasked with a specific purpose. We further propose OffTopicEval,
an evaluation suite and benchmark for measuring operational safety both in
general and within specific agentic use cases. Our evaluations on six model
families comprising 20 open-weight LLMs reveal that while performance varies
across models, all of them remain highly operationally unsafe. Even the
strongest models -- Qwen-3 (235B) with 77.77\% and Mistral (24B) with 79.96\%
-- fall far short of reliable operational safety, while GPT models plateau in
the 62--73\% range, Phi achieves only mid-level scores (48--70\%), and Gemma
and Llama-3 collapse to 39.53\% and 23.84\%, respectively. While operational
safety is a core model alignment issue, to suppress these failures, we propose
prompt-based steering methods: query grounding (Q-ground) and system-prompt
grounding (P-ground), which substantially improve OOD refusal. Q-ground
provides consistent gains of up to 23\%, while P-ground delivers even larger
boosts, raising Llama-3.3 (70B) by 41\% and Qwen-3 (30B) by 27\%. These results
highlight both the urgent need for operational safety interventions and the
promise of prompt-based steering as a first step toward more reliable LLM-based
agents.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a realistic benchmark for evaluating computer-use agents on enterprise CRM workflows, addressing the need for reliable automation in complex business software ecosystems.

Method: Developed SCUBA benchmark with 300 task instances from real user interviews across three personas, operating in Salesforce sandbox environments with parallel execution and fine-grained evaluation metrics.

Result: Huge performance gaps observed: open-source models achieved <5% success rate in zero-shot setting, while closed-source models reached 39%. With demonstrations, success improved to 50% with 13% time reduction and 16% cost reduction.

Conclusion: SCUBA highlights both the challenges of enterprise task automation and the promise of agentic solutions, providing a realistic benchmark to accelerate progress in building reliable computer-use agents for business software.

Abstract: We introduce SCUBA, a benchmark designed to evaluate computer-use agents on
customer relationship management (CRM) workflows within the Salesforce
platform. SCUBA contains 300 task instances derived from real user interviews,
spanning three primary personas, platform administrators, sales
representatives, and service agents. The tasks test a range of
enterprise-critical abilities, including Enterprise Software UI navigation,
data manipulation, workflow automation, information retrieval, and
troubleshooting. To ensure realism, SCUBA operates in Salesforce sandbox
environments with support for parallel execution and fine-grained evaluation
metrics to capture milestone progress. We benchmark a diverse set of agents
under both zero-shot and demonstration-augmented settings. We observed huge
performance gaps in different agent design paradigms and gaps between the
open-source model and the closed-source model. In the zero-shot setting,
open-source model powered computer-use agents that have strong performance on
related benchmarks like OSWorld only have less than 5\% success rate on SCUBA,
while methods built on closed-source models can still have up to 39% task
success rate. In the demonstration-augmented settings, task success rates can
be improved to 50\% while simultaneously reducing time and costs by 13% and
16%, respectively. These findings highlight both the challenges of enterprise
tasks automation and the promise of agentic solutions. By offering a realistic
benchmark with interpretable evaluation, SCUBA aims to accelerate progress in
building reliable computer-use agents for complex business software ecosystems.

*Jovan Stojkovic,Chaojie Zhang,Íñigo Goiri,Ricardo Bianchini*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a holistic lifecycle management framework for AI datacenters that coordinates building, hardware refresh, and operation stages to reduce total cost of ownership by up to 40% compared to traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-end GPUs for AI inference incur high capital and operational costs due to frequent upgrades, power consumption, and cooling demands. Traditional datacenter lifecycle management struggles with AI's fast-evolving models, rising resource needs, and diverse hardware profiles.

Method: The authors rethink AI datacenter lifecycle across three stages: building (design choices in power, cooling, networking), hardware refresh (strategies aligned with hardware trends), and operation (software optimizations). They present a holistic framework that coordinates decisions across all stages.

Result: The proposed system reduces total cost of ownership (TCO) by up to 40% over traditional approaches.

Conclusion: Unlocking the full potential of AI datacenter cost optimization requires rethinking the entire lifecycle with coordinated decisions across building, refresh, and operation stages, accounting for workload dynamics, hardware evolution, and system aging.

Abstract: The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has been driving an enormous
demand for AI inference infrastructure, mainly powered by high-end GPUs. While
these accelerators offer immense computational power, they incur high capital
and operational costs due to frequent upgrades, dense power consumption, and
cooling demands, making total cost of ownership (TCO) for AI datacenters a
critical concern for cloud providers. Unfortunately, traditional datacenter
lifecycle management (designed for general-purpose workloads) struggles to keep
pace with AI's fast-evolving models, rising resource needs, and diverse
hardware profiles. In this paper, we rethink the AI datacenter lifecycle scheme
across three stages: building, hardware refresh, and operation. We show how
design choices in power, cooling, and networking provisioning impact long-term
TCO. We also explore refresh strategies aligned with hardware trends. Finally,
we use operation software optimizations to reduce cost. While these
optimizations at each stage yield benefits, unlocking the full potential
requires rethinking the entire lifecycle. Thus, we present a holistic lifecycle
management framework that coordinates and co-optimizes decisions across all
three stages, accounting for workload dynamics, hardware evolution, and system
aging. Our system reduces the TCO by up to 40\% over traditional approaches.
Using our framework we provide guidelines on how to manage AI datacenter
lifecycle for the future.

*Shaoyi Zheng,Wenbo Lu,Yuxuan Xia,Haomin Liu,Shengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HilbertA is a GPU-efficient sparse attention mechanism for diffusion transformers that uses Hilbert curve token reordering to maintain spatial locality while enabling contiguous memory access, achieving 2.3-4.17× speedups in high-resolution image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sparse attention methods for diffusion transformers struggle to balance two-dimensional spatial locality with GPU efficiency, often suffering from uncoalesced memory access that reduces performance.

Method: HilbertA reorders image tokens along Hilbert curves to create contiguous memory layouts while preserving spatial neighborhoods, uses a sliding schedule across layers for long-range information propagation, and includes a small central shared region for cross-tile communication and positional awareness.

Result: HilbertA achieves attention speedups of 2.3× for 1024×1024 images and up to 4.17× for 2048×2048 images, while maintaining comparable or better image quality than baseline methods on Flux.1-dev.

Conclusion: HilbertA demonstrates the feasibility of hardware-aligned two-dimensional sparse attention for high-resolution image generation, successfully reconciling spatial locality with GPU efficiency.

Abstract: Designing sparse attention for diffusion transformers requires reconciling
two-dimensional spatial locality with GPU efficiency, a trade-off that current
methods struggle to achieve. Existing approaches enforce two-dimensional
spatial locality but often incur uncoalesced memory access. We present
HilbertA, a 2D-aware and GPU-efficient sparse attention mechanism. HilbertA
reorders image tokens along Hilbert curves to achieve a contiguous memory
layout while preserving spatial neighborhoods, and employs a sliding schedule
across layers to enable long-range information propagation without repeated or
uncoalesced memory access. To further enhance cross-tile communication and
positional awareness, HilbertA introduces a small central shared region.
Implemented in Triton, HilbertA delivers comparable image quality with
significant acceleration over prior methods on Flux.1-dev, demonstrating the
feasibility of hardware-aligned two-dimensional sparse attention for
high-resolution image generation. HilbertA delivers attention speedups of
$2.3\times$ when generating $1024\times 1024$ images, and up to $4.17\times$ at
$2048\times 2048$, while achieving image quality comparable to or surpassing
baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CritPt is the first benchmark testing LLMs on unpublished, research-level physics reasoning tasks across multiple subfields, showing current models perform poorly (4-10% accuracy) on full research challenges despite early promise on simpler components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs can effectively reason through complex, open-ended challenges in frontier physics research and understand what reasoning tasks physicists actually want AI assistance with.

Method: Created CritPt benchmark with 71 composite research challenges simulating full-scale projects, decomposed into 190 simpler checkpoint tasks. Problems were newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own work, with automated grading pipeline for physics-specific output formats.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints but perform poorly on full research challenges: best base model accuracy is 4.0% (GPT-5), rising to ~10% with coding tools. This reveals a large gap between current capabilities and realistic physics research demands.

Conclusion: CritPt provides a realistic standardized evaluation showing LLMs remain far from reliably solving physics research challenges, offering a foundation to guide development of scientifically grounded AI tools.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are
progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they
reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier
physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists
want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt
(Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced
"critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished,
research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research
areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical
physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical
physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics.
CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate
full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to
190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are
newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research.
Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable
answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for
advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current
state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain
far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best
average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high),
moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the
realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large
disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research
demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically
grounded AI tools.

*Matheus Vinicius da Silva de Oliveira,Jonathan de Andrade Silva,Awdren de Lima Fontao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study uses metamorphic testing to assess fairness in sentiment analysis by Small Language Models (SLMs) integrated with RAG pipelines, finding that minor demographic variations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations, with racial cues being the predominant cause of bias violations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about security, fairness, and hallucination in LLMs, particularly focusing on how RAG systems may surface or amplify biases through retrieved content, and to provide practical guidance for developers using accessible SLMs.

Method: Conducted fairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT) by introducing controlled demographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis performed by three SLMs (Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B) integrated into RAG pipelines.

Result: Minor demographic variations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs), with a consistent bias hierarchy where perturbations involving racial cues are the predominant cause of violations. The retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to prevent bias amplification.

Conclusion: The findings serve as a practical alert for developers, testers and small organizations aiming to adopt accessible SLMs without compromising fairness or reliability, reinforcing that careful curation of the retrieval component in RAG is essential to prevent bias amplification.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across multiple domains but
continue to raise concerns regarding security and fairness. Beyond known attack
vectors such as data poisoning and prompt injection, LLMs are also vulnerable
to fairness bugs. These refer to unintended behaviors influenced by sensitive
demographic cues (e.g., race or sexual orientation) that should not affect
outcomes. Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible
yet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a
strategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text
generation. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the
retrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts
fairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled
demographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis
performed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace
(Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B),
each integrated into a RAG pipeline. Results show that minor demographic
variations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs). A detailed
analysis of these failures reveals a consistent bias hierarchy, with
perturbations involving racial cues being the predominant cause of the
violations. In addition to offering a comparative evaluation, this work
reinforces that the retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to
prevent bias amplification. The findings serve as a practical alert for
developers, testers and small organizations aiming to adopt accessible SLMs
without compromising fairness or reliability.

TL;DR: BRIDGE is a two-stage RL framework that first learns from offline expert demonstrations, then fine-tunes online using human preferences, providing theoretical guarantees and improved sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses two key obstacles in RL deployment: difficulty of specifying accurate rewards and risks of unsafe, data-hungry exploration in real-world applications like robotics and healthcare.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Learn safe initial policy from reward-free expert demonstrations, 2) Fine-tune online using preference-based human feedback via BRIDGE algorithm with uncertainty-weighted objective.

Result: BRIDGE achieves lower regret than standalone behavioral cloning and online preference-based RL in discrete and continuous control MuJoCo environments, with regret bounds that shrink with offline data quantity.

Conclusion: Establishes theoretical foundation for designing more sample-efficient interactive agents by connecting offline data quantity to online sample efficiency.

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in robotics, industry, and health care
is blocked by two obstacles: the difficulty of specifying accurate rewards and
the risk of unsafe, data-hungry exploration. We address this by proposing a
two-stage framework that first learns a safe initial policy from a reward-free
dataset of expert demonstrations, then fine-tunes it online using
preference-based human feedback. We provide the first principled analysis of
this offline-to-online approach and introduce BRIDGE, a unified algorithm that
integrates both signals via an uncertainty-weighted objective. We derive regret
bounds that shrink with the number of offline demonstrations, explicitly
connecting the quantity of offline data to online sample efficiency. We
validate BRIDGE in discrete and continuous control MuJoCo environments, showing
it achieves lower regret than both standalone behavioral cloning and online
preference-based RL. Our work establishes a theoretical foundation for
designing more sample-efficient interactive agents.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address recent calls for expanding AI system evaluation scope and enhance metric transparency by integrating heterogeneous evidence like agentic, business, energy-efficiency, sociotechnical, and security signals.

Method: Proposes measurement trees as a novel class of metrics where each node summarizes its children through user-defined aggregation methods, creating hierarchical directed graphs instead of single values or vectors.

Conclusion: Measurement trees offer a principled foundation for broader and more interpretable AI evaluation by enabling transparent integration of diverse evidence types in a hierarchical structure.

Abstract: This paper introduces \textit{measurement trees}, a novel class of metrics
designed to combine various constructs into an interpretable multi-level

Motivation: Existing motion planning frameworks struggle with predictability and repeatability needed for high-stakes applications like industrial safety and creating quality motion datasets for robot learning.

Method: Developed SRMP (Search-based Robot Motion Planning) framework with Python and C++ APIs that integrates with MuJoCo, Sapien, Genesis, and PyBullet simulators, and includes a MoveIt! plugin for hardware deployment.

Result: SRMP generates consistent and reliable trajectories, is the first tool to offer motion planning for multi-robot manipulation tasks, and meets rigorous demands of industrial and safety-critical applications.

Conclusion: SRMP sets a new standard for consistency in motion planning across diverse robotic systems and addresses the limitations of existing frameworks in delivering predictable and repeatable motion planning.

Abstract: Motion planning is a critical component in any robotic system. Over the
years, powerful tools like the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) have been
developed, offering numerous motion planning algorithms. However, existing
frameworks often struggle to deliver the level of predictability and
repeatability demanded by high-stakes applications -- ranging from ensuring
safety in industrial environments to the creation of high-quality motion
datasets for robot learning. Complementing existing tools, we introduce SRMP
(Search-based Robot Motion Planning), a new software framework tailored for
robotic manipulation. SRMP distinguishes itself by generating consistent and
reliable trajectories, and is the first software tool to offer motion planning
algorithms for multi-robot manipulation tasks. SRMP easily integrates with
major simulators, including MuJoCo, Sapien, Genesis, and PyBullet via a Python
and C++ API. SRMP includes a dedicated MoveIt! plugin that enables immediate
deployment on robot hardware and seamless integration with existing pipelines.
Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate in this paper that SRMP not only
meets the rigorous demands of industrial and safety-critical applications but
also sets a new standard for consistency in motion planning across diverse

TL;DR: A video-based reward modeling framework for long-horizon manipulation tasks that jointly predicts task stages and fine-grained progress, enabling robust imitation learning through reward-aligned behavior cloning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale robot learning struggles with long-horizon, contact-rich manipulation like deformable object handling due to inconsistent demonstration quality, requiring better progress signals for stable supervision.

Method: Stage-aware, video-based reward modeling that automatically derives reward labels from natural language subtask annotations, overcoming frame-index labeling limitations. Integrated with Reward-Aligned Behavior Cloning (RA-BC) that filters high-quality data and reweights samples by reward.

Result: Achieves 83% success on folding T-shirts from flattened state and 67% from crumpled state, far surpassing vanilla behavior cloning (8% and 0% success). Reward model alone outperforms baselines on validation and real robot rollouts.

Conclusion: Reward modeling is a key enabler for scalable, annotation-efficient, and robust imitation learning in long-horizon manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Large-scale robot learning has recently shown promise for enabling robots to
perform complex tasks by integrating perception, control, and language
understanding. Yet, it struggles with long-horizon, contact-rich manipulation
such as deformable object handling, where demonstration quality is
inconsistent. Reward modeling offers a natural solution: by providing grounded
progress signals, it transforms noisy demonstrations into stable supervision
that generalizes across diverse trajectories. We introduce a stage-aware,
video-based reward modeling framework that jointly predicts high-level task
stages and fine-grained progress. Reward labels are automatically derived from
natural language subtask annotations, ensuring consistent progress estimation
across variable-length demonstrations. This design overcomes frame-index
labeling, which fails in variable-duration tasks like folding a T-shirt. Our
reward model demonstrates robustness to variability, generalization to
out-of-distribution settings, and strong utility for policy training. Building
on it, we propose Reward-Aligned Behavior Cloning (RA-BC), which filters
high-quality data and reweights samples by reward. Experiments show the reward
model alone outperforms baselines on validation and real robot rollouts.
Integrated into RA-BC, our approach achieves 83\% success on folding T-shirts
from the flattened state and 67\% from the crumpled state -- far surpassing
vanilla behavior cloning, which attains only 8\% and 0\% success. Overall, our
results highlight reward modeling as a key enabler for scalable,
annotation-efficient, and robust imitation learning in long-horizon
manipulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: P-ACHS is a parallel best-first search algorithm that leverages both actor and critic networks for efficient inference in actor-critic RL models, outperforming simple policy rollouts in robotic manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most deployment strategies for actor-critic RL models rely on simplistic direct actor policy rollouts, failing to fully utilize the critic network's cost-to-go estimates during inference.

Method: P-ACHS uses parallel best-first search with two levels of parallelism: batch generation of actions and cost-to-go estimates by actor and critic networks, and distributed graph expansion across multiple threads.

Result: The approach demonstrates effectiveness in robotic manipulation tasks including collision-free motion planning and contact-rich interactions like non-prehensile pushing.

Conclusion: P-ACHS provides an efficient inference method that better leverages the full actor-critic architecture compared to traditional deployment strategies.

Abstract: Actor-Critic models are a class of model-free deep reinforcement learning
(RL) algorithms that have demonstrated effectiveness across various robot
learning tasks. While considerable research has focused on improving training
stability and data sampling efficiency, most deployment strategies have
remained relatively simplistic, typically relying on direct actor policy
rollouts. In contrast, we propose \pachs{} (\textit{P}arallel
\textit{A}ctor-\textit{C}ritic \textit{H}euristic \textit{S}earch), an
efficient parallel best-first search algorithm for inference that leverages
both components of the actor-critic architecture: the actor network generates
actions, while the critic network provides cost-to-go estimates to guide the
search. Two levels of parallelism are employed within the search -- actions and
cost-to-go estimates are generated in batches by the actor and critic networks
respectively, and graph expansion is distributed across multiple threads. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in robotic manipulation tasks,
including collision-free motion planning and contact-rich interactions such as
non-prehensile pushing. Visit p-achs.github.io for demonstrations and examples.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CoTaP is a pipeline that combines learning-based control with model-based compliance for humanoid robots, using a two-stage dual-agent reinforcement learning framework to achieve adjustable task-space compliance while maintaining stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current human datasets lack force data and learning-based robot control is mostly position-based, making it challenging to achieve appropriate compliance during real-world interactions.

Method: Two-stage dual-agent reinforcement learning: first train a base position-based policy, then distill with upper-body policy combined with model-based compliance control and lower-body guided by base policy. Uses compliance modulation on SPD manifold for stability.

Result: Validated in simulation, showing improved responses to external disturbances under different compliance settings.

Conclusion: The proposed CoTaP pipeline effectively integrates compliance information into learning-based humanoid control, enabling adjustable task-space compliance while ensuring system stability.

Abstract: Humanoid whole-body locomotion control is a critical approach for humanoid
robots to leverage their inherent advantages. Learning-based control methods
derived from retargeted human motion data provide an effective means of
addressing this issue. However, because most current human datasets lack
measured force data, and learning-based robot control is largely
position-based, achieving appropriate compliance during interaction with real
environments remains challenging. This paper presents Compliant Task Pipeline
(CoTaP): a pipeline that leverages compliance information in the learning-based
structure of humanoid robots. A two-stage dual-agent reinforcement learning
framework combined with model-based compliance control for humanoid robots is
proposed. In the training process, first a base policy with a position-based
controller is trained; then in the distillation, the upper-body policy is
combined with model-based compliance control, and the lower-body agent is
guided by the base policy. In the upper-body control, adjustable task-space
compliance can be specified and integrated with other controllers through
compliance modulation on the symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold,
ensuring system stability. We validated the feasibility of the proposed
strategy in simulation, primarily comparing the responses to external
disturbances under different compliance settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional HD map generation is labor-intensive, expensive, and difficult to maintain in dynamic environments, creating challenges for autonomous driving applications.

Method: Deployed system on campus golf cart with dual front cameras and LiDAR, using fine-tuned SemVecMap model for 3D HD map labeling and incremental map generation to capture environmental changes.

Result: Pipeline produces accurate map predictions and supports continual updates, demonstrating practical value in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.

Conclusion: The online mapping system successfully overcomes traditional HD map limitations and enables practical deployment in dynamic campus environments.

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps are essential for autonomous driving, providing
precise information such as road boundaries, lane dividers, and crosswalks to
enable safe and accurate navigation. However, traditional HD map generation is
labor-intensive, expensive, and difficult to maintain in dynamic environments.
To overcome these challenges, we present a real-world deployment of an online

our pipeline produces accurate map predictions and supports continual updates,

### [256] [Exhaustive-Serve-Longest Control for Multi-robot Scheduling Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25556)
*Mohammad Merati,David Castañón*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ESL policy for multi-robot task allocation: serve exhaustively when nonempty, switch to longest unoccupied nonempty queue when idle, proven optimal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address online task allocation in multi-robot systems with stochastic arrivals and switching delays, where efficient scheduling is crucial for performance.

Method: Formulate discounted-cost Markov decision process; propose ESL policy (exhaustive serving + switching to longest unoccupied nonempty queue); compare with fixed-dwell cyclic and FCFS policies.

Result: ESL consistently achieves lower discounted holding cost, smaller mean queue lengths across server-to-location ratios and loads, with more serving time and restrained switching.

Conclusion: ESL's simplicity, robustness, and proven optimality make it a practical default policy for real-time multi-robot scheduling systems.

Abstract: We study online task allocation for multi-robot, multi-queue systems with
stochastic arrivals and switching delays. Time is slotted; each location can
host at most one robot per slot; service consumes one slot; switching between
locations incurs a one-slot travel delay; and arrivals are independent
Bernoulli processes. We formulate a discounted-cost Markov decision process and
propose Exhaustive-Serve-Longest (ESL), a simple real-time policy that serves
exhaustively when the current location is nonempty and, when idle, switches to
a longest unoccupied nonempty location, and we prove the optimality of this
policy. As baselines, we tune a fixed-dwell cyclic policy via a discrete-time
delay expression and implement a first-come-first-serve policy. Across
server-to-location ratios and loads, ESL consistently yields lower discounted
holding cost and smaller mean queue lengths, with action-time fractions showing
more serving and restrained switching. Its simplicity and robustness make ESL a
practical default for real-time multi-robot scheduling systems.

TL;DR: HYPER DRIVE system enables mobile robots to collect hyperspectral images and perform reflectance calibration for accurate intra-class terrain analysis, particularly for vegetation health and soil moisture assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB vision systems fail to distinguish important intra-class terrain differences like water content, while hyperspectral analysis provides useful information but is highly dependent on ambient illumination conditions.

Method: Developed a system architecture to collect and register multi-wavelength hyperspectral images from mobile robots, with an approach to reflectance calibrate cameras under varying illumination conditions.

Result: Successfully demonstrated the ability to calculate vegetative health indices and soil moisture content from a mobile robot platform using the HYPER DRIVE system.

Conclusion: The HYPER DRIVE system enables practical hyperspectral analysis for mobile robotics applications, overcoming illumination challenges to provide valuable terrain property information beyond RGB capabilities.

Abstract: Intra-class terrain differences such as water content directly influence a
vehicle's ability to traverse terrain, yet RGB vision systems may fail to
distinguish these properties. Evaluating a terrain's spectral content beyond
red-green-blue wavelengths to the near infrared spectrum provides useful
information for intra-class identification. However, accurate analysis of this
spectral information is highly dependent on ambient illumination. We
demonstrate a system architecture to collect and register multi-wavelength,
hyperspectral images from a mobile robot and describe an approach to
reflectance calibrate cameras under varying illumination conditions. To
showcase the practical applications of our system, HYPER DRIVE, we demonstrate
the ability to calculate vegetative health indices and soil moisture content
from a mobile robot platform.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: dVLA is a diffusion-based Vision-Language-Action model that unifies visual perception, language reasoning, and robotic control under a single diffusion objective, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 96.4% success rate on LIBERO benchmark and demonstrating robust real-world deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified framework that integrates visual perception, language understanding, and robotic action generation in a single system, enabling stronger cross-modal reasoning and better generalization to novel instructions and objects.

Method: Uses a diffusion-based approach with multimodal chain-of-thought to jointly optimize perception, language, and action. Implements inference acceleration strategies including prefix attention mask and KV caching to reduce latency.

Result: Achieves 96.4% average success rate on LIBERO benchmark (state-of-the-art), surpassing both discrete and continuous action policies. Successfully deployed on real Franka robot for diverse tasks including challenging bin-picking requiring multi-step planning.

Conclusion: Unified diffusion frameworks show promise for practical, high-performance VLA robotics, demonstrating robust performance in both simulation and real-world deployment with efficient inference capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are emerging as a next-generation
paradigm for robotics. We introduce dVLA, a diffusion-based VLA that leverages
a multimodal chain-of-thought to unify visual perception, language reasoning,
and robotic control in a single system. dVLA jointly optimizes perception,
language understanding, and action under a single diffusion objective, enabling
stronger cross-modal reasoning and better generalization to novel instructions
and objects. For practical deployment, we mitigate inference latency by
incorporating two acceleration strategies, a prefix attention mask and KV
caching, yielding up to around times speedup at test-time inference. We
evaluate dVLA in both simulation and the real world: on the LIBERO benchmark,
it achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 96.4% average success rate,
consistently surpassing both discrete and continuous action policies; on a real
Franka robot, it succeeds across a diverse task suite, including a challenging
bin-picking task that requires multi-step planning, demonstrating robust
real-world performance. Together, these results underscore the promise of
unified diffusion frameworks for practical, high-performance VLA robotics.

### [259] [Hierarchical Diffusion Motion Planning with Task-Conditioned Uncertainty-Aware Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25685)
*Amelie Minji Kim,Anqi Wu,Ye Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hierarchical diffusion planner that embeds task and motion structure directly in the noise model using task-conditioned structured Gaussians derived from GPMP, improving success rates and trajectory quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard diffusion-based planners use zero-mean, isotropic Gaussian noise, which may not effectively capture task and motion structure. The authors aim to embed this structure directly in the noise model for better planning performance.

Method: Generalizes diffusion process to biased, non-isotropic corruption with closed-form expressions. Uses hierarchical approach: upper level instantiates task-conditioned structured Gaussian (mean/covariance from GPMP), lower level denoises full trajectory under that fixed prior.

Result: Experiments on Maze2D goal-reaching and KUKA block stacking show improved success rates, smoother trajectories, and stronger task alignment compared to isotropic baselines. Ablation studies confirm benefits of explicit noise structure beyond neural network conditioning.

Conclusion: The method concentrates probability mass near feasible, smooth, and semantically meaningful trajectories while maintaining tractability, demonstrating that structuring the corruption process offers significant advantages.

Abstract: We propose a novel hierarchical diffusion planner that embeds task and motion
structure directly in the noise model. Unlike standard diffusion-based planners
that use zero-mean, isotropic Gaussian noise, we employ a family of
task-conditioned structured Gaussians whose means and covariances are derived
from Gaussian Process Motion Planning (GPMP): sparse, task-centric key states
or their associated timings (or both) are treated as noisy observations to
produce a prior instance. We first generalize the standard diffusion process to
biased, non-isotropic corruption with closed-form forward and posterior
expressions. Building on this, our hierarchy separates prior instantiation from
trajectory denoising: the upper level instantiates a task-conditioned
structured Gaussian (mean and covariance), and the lower level denoises the
full trajectory under that fixed prior. Experiments on Maze2D goal-reaching and
KUKA block stacking show improved success rates, smoother trajectories, and
stronger task alignment compared to isotropic baselines. Ablation studies
indicate that explicitly structuring the corruption process offers benefits
beyond simply conditioning the neural network. Overall, our method concentrates
probability mass of prior near feasible, smooth, and semantically meaningful
trajectories while maintaining tractability. Our project page is available at

*Xinda Xue,Junjun Hu,Minghua Luo,Xie Shichao,Jintao Chen,Zixun Xie,Quan Kuichen,Guo Wei,Mu Xu,Zedong Chu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OmniNav is a unified framework for embodied navigation that handles multiple navigation paradigms (instruct-goal, object-goal, point-goal, frontier-based exploration) within a single architecture using a fast-slow system design and large-scale multi-task training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing navigation models lack unified solutions across diverse paradigms, resulting in low success rates and limited generalization. The core challenge is robust understanding of instructions and objects, not just navigation policy learning.

Method: Uses a fast-slow system: fast module generates waypoints with short-horizon context, slow module performs deliberative planning with long-horizon observations. Integrates large-scale datasets (image captioning, visual recognition) in multi-task training to boost generalization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across various navigation benchmarks with real-world deployment at 5 Hz control frequency. Significantly improves success rates and robustness compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: OmniNav provides practical insights for embodied navigation and charts a scalable path toward versatile, highly generalizable robotic intelligence through unified architecture and multi-task learning.

Abstract: Embodied navigation presents a core challenge for intelligent robots,
requiring the comprehension of visual environments, natural language
instructions, and autonomous exploration. Existing models often fall short in
offering a unified solution across diverse navigation paradigms, resulting in
low success rates and limited generalization. We introduce OmniNav, a unified
framework addressing instruct-goal, object-goal, point-goal navigation, and
frontier-based exploration within a single architecture. Our approach features
a lightweight, low-latency policy that accurately predicts continuous-space
waypoints (coordinates and orientations). This policy surpasses action-chunk
methods in precision and supports real-world deployment at control frequencies
up to 5 Hz. Architecturally, OmniNav employs a fast-slow system design: a fast
module generates waypoints using short-horizon visual context and subtasks,
while a slow module performs deliberative planning with long-horizon
observations and candidate frontiers to select subsequent subgoals and
subtasks. This collaboration enhances path efficiency and maintains trajectory
coherence, particularly in exploration and memory-intensive scenarios.
Crucially, we identify that the primary bottleneck isn't merely navigation
policy learning, but a robust understanding of general instructions and
objects. To boost generalization, OmniNav integrates large-scale,
general-purpose training datasets, including those for image captioning and
visual recognition, into a joint multi-task regimen. This significantly
improves success rates and robustness. Extensive experiments confirm OmniNav's
state-of-the-art performance across various navigation benchmarks, with
real-world deployment further validating its efficacy. OmniNav provides
practical insights for embodied navigation, charting a scalable path towards
versatile, highly generalizable robotic intelligence.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an action-chunked PPO method with self behavior cloning to stabilize RL training for VLA models, achieving high success rates on MetaWorld benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning for post-training VLA models faces challenges with sparse rewards and unstable training, hindering practical deployment.

Method: Proposes action chunking with PPO and behavior cloning using self-collected demonstrations, with dynamic weight adaptation between PPO and auxiliary loss.

Result: Achieved 0.93 success rate and 42.17 steps to success on MetaWorld benchmark, outperforming supervised fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Demonstrates viability of RL for VLA post-training and provides groundwork for downstream VLA applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising avenue for post-training
vision-language-action (VLA) models, but practical deployment is hindered by
sparse rewards and unstable training. This work mitigates these challenges by
introducing an action chunk based on proximal policy optimization (PPO) with
behavior cloning using self-collected demonstrations. Aggregating consecutive
actions into chunks improves the temporal consistency of the policy and the
density of informative feedback. In addition, an auxiliary behavior cloning
loss is applied with a dynamically updated demonstration buffer that
continually collects high-quality task trials during training. The relative
weight between the action-chunked PPO objective and the self behavior clone
auxiliary loss is adapted online to stabilize the post-training process.
Experiments on the MetaWorld benchmark indicate improved performance over
supervised fine-tuning, achieving a high success rate (0.93) and few steps to
success (42.17). These results demonstrate the viability of RL for VLA
post-training and help lay the groundwork for downstream VLA applications.

TL;DR: TacRefineNet is a tactile-only framework that achieves fine in-hand pose refinement of known objects using multi-finger fingertip sensing to address grasp execution inaccuracies in long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the "last-mile" challenge in dexterous grasping where pose inaccuracies during grasp execution undermine overall performance, especially in long-horizon tasks.

Method: Uses a multi-branch policy network that fuses tactile inputs from multiple fingers with proprioception to predict precise control updates. Combines large-scale simulated data from physics-based tactile model in MuJoCo with real-world data, employing pretraining on simulation and fine-tuning with real data.

Result: Achieves millimeter-level grasp accuracy using only tactile input. Comparative experiments show significant improvement over simulation-only training when pretraining on simulated data and fine-tuning with small real data.

Conclusion: First method to enable arbitrary in-hand pose refinement via multi-finger tactile sensing alone, validated through extensive real-world experiments.

Abstract: Despite progress in both traditional dexterous grasping pipelines and recent
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) approaches, the grasp execution stage remains
prone to pose inaccuracies, especially in long-horizon tasks, which undermines
overall performance. To address this "last-mile" challenge, we propose
TacRefineNet, a tactile-only framework that achieves fine in-hand pose
refinement of known objects in arbitrary target poses using multi-finger
fingertip sensing. Our method iteratively adjusts the end-effector pose based
on tactile feedback, aligning the object to the desired configuration. We
design a multi-branch policy network that fuses tactile inputs from multiple
fingers along with proprioception to predict precise control updates. To train
this policy, we combine large-scale simulated data from a physics-based tactile
model in MuJoCo with real-world data collected from a physical system.
Comparative experiments show that pretraining on simulated data and fine-tuning
with a small amount of real data significantly improves performance over
simulation-only training. Extensive real-world experiments validate the
effectiveness of the method, achieving millimeter-level grasp accuracy using
only tactile input. To our knowledge, this is the first method to enable
arbitrary in-hand pose refinement via multi-finger tactile sensing alone.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A decoupled sim-to-real framework that trains control policies in simulation with privileged state and adapts perception only at deployment, achieving strong performance with minimal real demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fundamental challenge of sim-to-real transfer in robot manipulation by decoupling perception and control, since end-to-end approaches struggle with the entanglement of these components and require extensive real-world data.

Method: Control policies are trained in simulation with privileged state information to master spatial layouts and manipulation dynamics, while perception is adapted only at deployment to bridge real observations to the frozen control policy. Uses systematic randomization in simulation and requires only 10-20 real demonstrations.

Result: Achieves superior data efficiency and out-of-distribution generalization compared to end-to-end baselines on tabletop manipulation tasks. Learned policies successfully handle object positions and scales beyond training distribution.

Conclusion: Decoupling perception from control fundamentally improves sim-to-real transfer by reducing the complex problem to a structured perception alignment task, enabling reliable performance with minimal real-world data.

Abstract: Sim-to-real transfer remains a fundamental challenge in robot manipulation
due to the entanglement of perception and control in end-to-end learning. We
present a decoupled framework that learns each component where it is most
reliable: control policies are trained in simulation with privileged state to
master spatial layouts and manipulation dynamics, while perception is adapted
only at deployment to bridge real observations to the frozen control policy.
Our key insight is that control strategies and action patterns are universal
across environments and can be learned in simulation through systematic
randomization, while perception is inherently domain-specific and must be
learned where visual observations are authentic. Unlike existing end-to-end
approaches that require extensive real-world data, our method achieves strong
performance with only 10-20 real demonstrations by reducing the complex
sim-to-real problem to a structured perception alignment task. We validate our
approach on tabletop manipulation tasks, demonstrating superior data efficiency
and out-of-distribution generalization compared to end-to-end baselines. The
learned policies successfully handle object positions and scales beyond the
training distribution, confirming that decoupling perception from control
fundamentally improves sim-to-real transfer.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses instability in training flow-based policies with off-policy RL by identifying the root cause as gradient pathologies similar to RNNs, and proposes two stable architectures (Flow-G and Flow-T) with a practical SAC-based algorithm that achieves SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training expressive flow-based policies with off-policy reinforcement learning is notoriously unstable due to gradient pathologies in the multi-step action sampling process, which limits their practical application.

Method: Reparameterize the velocity network using principles from modern sequential models, introducing two stable architectures: Flow-G (gated velocity) and Flow-T (decoded velocity), and develop a practical SAC-based algorithm with noise-augmented rollout for end-to-end training.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on continuous control and robotic manipulation benchmarks, supporting both from-scratch and offline-to-online learning.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses gradient instability in flow-based policies, eliminating the need for common workarounds like policy distillation or surrogate objectives while achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Training expressive flow-based policies with off-policy reinforcement
learning is notoriously unstable due to gradient pathologies in the multi-step
action sampling process. We trace this instability to a fundamental connection:
the flow rollout is algebraically equivalent to a residual recurrent
computation, making it susceptible to the same vanishing and exploding
gradients as RNNs. To address this, we reparameterize the velocity network
using principles from modern sequential models, introducing two stable
architectures: Flow-G, which incorporates a gated velocity, and Flow-T, which
utilizes a decoded velocity. We then develop a practical SAC-based algorithm,
enabled by a noise-augmented rollout, that facilitates direct end-to-end
training of these policies. Our approach supports both from-scratch and
offline-to-online learning and achieves state-of-the-art performance on
continuous control and robotic manipulation benchmarks, eliminating the need
for common workarounds like policy distillation or surrogate objectives.

TL;DR: DP-AG is a unified representation learning method that models the causal reciprocity between perception and action through action-guided diffusion policy and cycle-consistent contrastive learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance in robotics tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing imitation learning methods decouple perception and action, overlooking the causal reciprocity between sensory representations and action execution that humans naturally leverage for adaptive behaviors.

Method: DP-AG encodes latent observations via variational inference and evolves them using an action-guided SDE, where Vector-Jacobian Product of diffusion policy's noise predictions drives latent updates. It uses cycle-consistent contrastive loss to organize gradient flow into a perception-action loop.

Result: DP-AG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across simulation benchmarks and real-world UR5 manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: DP-AG offers a promising step toward bridging biological adaptability and artificial policy learning by modeling the dynamic interplay between perception and action.

Abstract: Existing imitation learning methods decouple perception and action, which
overlooks the causal reciprocity between sensory representations and action
execution that humans naturally leverage for adaptive behaviors. To bridge this
gap, we introduce Action--Guided Diffusion Policy (DP--AG), a unified
representation learning that explicitly models a dynamic interplay between
perception and action through probabilistic latent dynamics. DP--AG encodes
latent observations into a Gaussian posterior via variational inference and
evolves them using an action-guided SDE, where the Vector-Jacobian Product
(VJP) of the diffusion policy's noise predictions serves as a structured
stochastic force driving latent updates. To promote bidirectional learning
between perception and action, we introduce a cycle--consistent contrastive
loss that organizes the gradient flow of the noise predictor into a coherent
perception--action loop, enforcing mutually consistent transitions in both
latent updates and action refinements. Theoretically, we derive a variational
lower bound for the action-guided SDE, and prove that the contrastive objective
enhances continuity in both latent and action trajectories. Empirically, DP--AG
significantly outperforms state--of--the--art methods across simulation
benchmarks and real-world UR5 manipulation tasks. As a result, our DP--AG
offers a promising step toward bridging biological adaptability and artificial
policy learning.

TL;DR: REVER framework enables VLMs to generate and validate long-horizon manipulation plans from natural language instructions, achieving significant performance improvements in real-world robotics tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two key challenges: scarcity of large-scale sequential manipulation data coupling language with multi-step actions, and absence of dense interpretable rewards for fine-tuning VLMs on planning objectives.

Method: Propose REVER framework with RoboFarseer VLM that performs temporal/spatial reasoning via chain-of-thought. Uses Universal Manipulation Interface for hardware-agnostic demonstrations and automated annotation to create vision-instruction-plan triplets with verifiable reward scoring.

Result: RoboFarseer matches/exceeds proprietary models orders of magnitude larger, surpasses best baseline by >40% on open-ended planning, and boosts real-world task success by ~60% compared to low-level controller without planner.

Conclusion: REVER framework effectively bridges gaps in VLM deployment for robotics, enabling reliable long-horizon manipulation planning from natural language with significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Enabling robots to execute long-horizon manipulation tasks from free-form
language instructions remains a fundamental challenge in embodied AI. While
vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise as high-level planners, their
deployment in the real world is hindered by two gaps: (i) the scarcity of
large-scale, sequential manipulation data that couples natural language with
multi-step action plans, and (ii) the absence of dense, interpretable rewards
for fine-tuning VLMs on planning objectives. To address these issues, we
propose REVER, a framework that empowers VLMs to generate and validate
long-horizon manipulation plans from natural language instructions in
real-world scenarios. Under REVER we train and release RoboFarseer, a VLM
incentivized to emit chain-of-thought that perform temporal and spatial
reasoning, ensuring physically plausible and logically coherent plans. To
obtain training data, we leverage the Universal Manipulation Interface
framework to capture hardware-agnostic demonstrations of atomic skills. An
automated annotation engine converts each demonstration into
vision-instruction-plan triplet. We introduce a verifiable reward that scores
the generated plan by its ordered bipartite matching overlap with the
ground-truth skill sequence. At run time, the fine-tuned VLM functions both as
a planner and as a monitor, verifying step-wise completion. RoboFarseer matches
or exceeds the performance of proprietary models that are orders of magnitude
larger, while on open-ended planning it surpasses the best baseline by more
than 40%. In real-world, long-horizon tasks, the complete system boosts overall
success by roughly 60% compared with the same low-level controller without the
planner. We will open-source both the dataset and the trained model upon
publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State estimation for compliant locomotion robots is challenging due to lack of rigid-body assumptions and kinematic changes from morphing, limiting their application in agricultural, research and environmental industries.

Method: Neural network-based state estimator using history of states and mechanism to directly influence unreliable sensors, trained on motion capture data in a novel compliance-centric frame that accounts for morphing-related states.

Result: Predicts shape-related measurements within 4.2% of robot's size, velocities within 6.3% and 2.4% of top linear/angular speeds, orientation within 1.5 degrees. Demonstrated 300% increase in travel range during motor malfunction when used for closed-loop autonomous outdoor operation.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully estimates both rigid-body and compliance-related states for morphing robots, enabling robust autonomous operation in extreme outdoor terrain even during hardware failures.

Abstract: Locomotion robots with active or passive compliance can show robustness to
uncertain scenarios, which can be promising for agricultural, research and
environmental industries. However, state estimation for these robots is
challenging due to the lack of rigid-body assumptions and kinematic changes
from morphing. We propose a method to estimate typical rigid-body states
alongside compliance-related states, such as soft robot shape in different
morphologies and locomotion modes. Our neural network-based state estimator
uses a history of states and a mechanism to directly influence unreliable
sensors. We test our framework on the GOAT platform, a robot capable of passive
compliance and active morphing for extreme outdoor terrain. The network is
trained on motion capture data in a novel compliance-centric frame that
accounts for morphing-related states. Our method predicts shape-related
measurements within 4.2% of the robot's size, velocities within 6.3% and 2.4%
of the top linear and angular speeds, respectively, and orientation within 1.5
degrees. We also demonstrate a 300% increase in travel range during a motor
malfunction when using our estimator for closed-loop autonomous outdoor

Method: Developed a capacitance-based woven tactile skin with conductive threads for dense multi-channel sensing, defined 14 single- and multi-touch gestures for robot commands, and created a lightweight convolution-transformer model for real-time gesture recognition.

Result: Achieved near-100% gesture recognition accuracy, outperforming baseline approaches, and demonstrated up to 57% reduction in task completion time for robot arm tasks like pick-and-place and pouring compared to keyboard panels and teach pendants.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical pathway toward more natural and efficient embodied human-robot interaction through seamless gesture control integrated with robot surfaces.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel human-robot interaction (HRI) framework that
enables intuitive gesture-driven control through a capacitance-based woven
tactile skin. Unlike conventional interfaces that rely on panels or handheld
devices, the woven tactile skin integrates seamlessly with curved robot
surfaces, enabling embodied interaction and narrowing the gap between human
intent and robot response. Its woven design combines fabric-like flexibility
with structural stability and dense multi-channel sensing through the
interlaced conductive threads. Building on this capability, we define a
gesture-action mapping of 14 single- and multi-touch gestures that cover
representative robot commands, including task-space motion and auxiliary
functions. A lightweight convolution-transformer model designed for gesture
recognition in real time achieves an accuracy of near-100%, outperforming prior
baseline approaches. Experiments on robot arm tasks, including pick-and-place
and pouring, demonstrate that our system reduces task completion time by up to
57% compared with keyboard panels and teach pendants. Overall, our proposed
framework demonstrates a practical pathway toward more natural and efficient
embodied HRI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust object navigation model that can effectively leverage semantic map abstractions to unify historical information and handle diverse demonstration qualities, enabling better generalization and exploration strategies.

Method: Uses semantic map abstractions to encode spatial context, takes current/history observations and semantic map as inputs, employs reward-guided return modeling with dense short-horizon progress signals, and follows a three-stage training pipeline: map-level spatial understanding, imitation learning from mixed-quality demonstrations, and reward amplification.

Result: Experiments on HM3D and Gibson benchmarks show MUVLA achieves great generalization and learns effective exploration behaviors even from low-quality or partially successful trajectories.

Conclusion: MUVLA successfully demonstrates that semantic map abstractions combined with a three-stage training approach can create robust object navigation models capable of handling diverse demonstration qualities and generating rational exploration strategies.

Abstract: In this paper, we present MUVLA, a Map Understanding Vision-Language-Action
model tailored for object navigation. It leverages semantic map abstractions to
unify and structure historical information, encoding spatial context in a
compact and consistent form. MUVLA takes the current and history observations,
as well as the semantic map, as inputs and predicts the action sequence based
on the description of goal object. Furthermore, it amplifies supervision
through reward-guided return modeling based on dense short-horizon progress
signals, enabling the model to develop a detailed understanding of action value
for reward maximization. MUVLA employs a three-stage training pipeline:
learning map-level spatial understanding, imitating behaviors from
mixed-quality demonstrations, and reward amplification. This strategy allows
MUVLA to unify diverse demonstrations into a robust spatial representation and
generate more rational exploration strategies. Experiments on HM3D and Gibson
benchmarks demonstrate that MUVLA achieves great generalization and learns
effective exploration behaviors even from low-quality or partially successful
trajectories.

### [270] [S$^3$E: Self-Supervised State Estimation for Radar-Inertial System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25984)
*Shengpeng Wang,Yulong Xie,Qing Liao,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: S³E is a self-supervised state estimator that fuses radar signal spectra with inertial data to achieve accurate localization without ground truth supervision, overcoming limitations of sparse radar point clouds and multi-path effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Millimeter-wave radar is affordable and reliable in harsh conditions, but existing methods using radar point clouds suffer from sparsity, ghost points from multi-path effects, and limited angle resolution, which degrade state estimation performance.

Method: S³E employs radar signal spectra instead of sparse point clouds and fuses them with inertial information. It uses a novel cross-fusion technique to enhance spatial structure by exploiting rotational shift correlations across heterogeneous data, achieving complementary benefits between exteroceptive radar and proprioceptive inertial sensors.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that S³E achieves robust and accurate performance without relying on localization ground truth supervision.

Conclusion: This is the first method to achieve state estimation by fusing radar spectra and inertial data in a complementary self-supervised manner, effectively addressing the limitations of traditional radar-based localization approaches.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar for state estimation is gaining significant attention
for its affordability and reliability in harsh conditions. Existing
localization solutions typically rely on post-processed radar point clouds as
landmark points. Nonetheless, the inherent sparsity of radar point clouds,
ghost points from multi-path effects, and limited angle resolution in
single-chirp radar severely degrade state estimation performance. To address
these issues, we propose S$^3$E, a \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{S}upervised
\textbf{S}tate \textbf{E}stimator that employs more richly informative radar
signal spectra to bypass sparse points and fuses complementary inertial
information to achieve accurate localization. S$^3$E fully explores the
association between \textit{exteroceptive} radar and \textit{proprioceptive}
inertial sensor to achieve complementary benefits. To deal with limited angle
resolution, we introduce a novel cross-fusion technique that enhances spatial
structure information by exploiting subtle rotational shift correlations across
heterogeneous data. The experimental results demonstrate our method achieves
robust and accurate performance without relying on localization ground truth
supervision. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to achieve
state estimation by fusing radar spectra and inertial data in a complementary
self-supervised manner.

*Elisabetta Zibetti,Sureya Waheed Palmer,Rebecca Stower,Salvatore M Anzalone*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Children align their behavior with robot's emotional states, but higher expressiveness doesn't increase alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how robotic emotional expressiveness influences children's empathic responses and behavior in child-robot interactions.

Method: Pilot study with 22 children (7-11 years) using QTRobot with different expressiveness levels (body only, face only, body+face) displaying happiness/sadness in cooperative turn-taking game.

Result: Children aligned behavior with robot's inferred emotional state, but higher expressiveness levels didn't lead to increased behavioral alignment.

Conclusion: Provides foundation for understanding robotic expressiveness's role in shaping children's social-emotional behavior toward robots as social peers.

Abstract: The growing development of robots with artificial emotional expressiveness
raises important questions about their persuasive potential in children's
behavior. While research highlights the pragmatic value of emotional
expressiveness in human social communication, the extent to which robotic
expressiveness can or should influence empathic responses in children is
grounds for debate. In a pilot study with 22 children (aged 7-11) we begin to
explore the ways in which different levels of embodied expressiveness (body
only, face only, body and face) of two basic emotions (happiness and sadness)
displayed by an anthropomorphic robot (QTRobot) might modify children's
behavior in a child-robot cooperative turn-taking game. We observed that
children aligned their behavior to the robot's inferred emotional state.
However, higher levels of expressiveness did not result in increased alignment.
The preliminary results reported here provide a starting point for reflecting
on robotic expressiveness and its role in shaping children's social-emotional
behavior toward robots as social peers in the near future.

*Yann de Mont-Marin,Louis Montaut,Jean Ponce,Martial Hebert,Justin Carpentier*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a theoretical connection between Signorini's law for point contacts and the center of pressure concept, introducing the planar Signorini condition as a unified framework for modeling planar contacts between rigid bodies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between discrete and continuous contact models in robotics by connecting two foundational principles: Signorini's law for preventing object interpenetration and the center of pressure concept used in locomotion control.

Method: Developed the planar Signorini condition, a conic complementarity formulation that models general planar contacts between rigid bodies, proving its equivalence to enforcing punctual Signorini law across entire contact surfaces.

Result: The framework naturally captures three physical regimes (sticking, separating, and tilting) within a unified complementarity structure and provides a principled extension of the classical center of pressure called the extended center of pressure.

Conclusion: This work establishes a mathematically consistent and computationally tractable foundation for handling planar contacts, with implications for accurate simulation of contact dynamics and advanced control algorithms in locomotion and manipulation.

Abstract: We present a unifying theoretical result that connects two foundational
principles in robotics: the Signorini law for point contacts, which underpins
many simulation methods for preventing object interpenetration, and the center
of pressure (also known as the zero-moment point), a key concept used in, for
instance, optimization-based locomotion control. Our contribution is the planar
Signorini condition, a conic complementarity formulation that models general
planar contacts between rigid bodies. We prove that this formulation is
equivalent to enforcing the punctual Signorini law across an entire contact
surface, thereby bridging the gap between discrete and continuous contact
models. A geometric interpretation reveals that the framework naturally
captures three physical regimes -sticking, separating, and tilting-within a
unified complementarity structure. This leads to a principled extension of the
classical center of pressure, which we refer to as the extended center of
pressure. By establishing this connection, our work provides a mathematically
consistent and computationally tractable foundation for handling planar
contacts, with implications for both the accurate simulation of contact
dynamics and the design of advanced control and optimization algorithms in
locomotion and manipulation.

*Shaoli Hu,Shizhe Zhao,Zhongqiang Ren*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces Multi-Agent Path Finding Among Movable Obstacles (M-PAMO), combining MAPF and PAMO approaches to solve path planning for multiple agents navigating among both static and movable obstacles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: M-PAMO addresses real-world logistics and warehouse scenarios where mobile robots must navigate among unexpected movable objects, a problem that remains under-explored despite existing research on MAPF and single-agent PAMO.

Method: The paper adapts and fuses Conflict-Based Search (CBS) and Prioritized Planning (PP) from MAPF with PAMO*, a recent single-agent PAMO planner, to address the exponential state space growth caused by movable obstacles.

Result: The approaches were tested with up to 20 agents and hundreds of movable obstacles, revealing the pros and cons of each method in handling the spatial and temporal coupling challenges posed by movable obstacles.

Conclusion: This represents the first systematic attempt to address M-PAMO by integrating established MAPF techniques with single-agent movable obstacle planning, providing foundational insights for this challenging problem domain.

Abstract: This paper investigates Multi-Agent Path Finding Among Movable Obstacles
(M-PAMO), which seeks collision-free paths for multiple agents from their start
to goal locations among static and movable obstacles. M-PAMO arises in
logistics and warehouses where mobile robots are among unexpected movable
objects. Although Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) and single-agent Path
planning Among Movable Obstacles (PAMO) were both studied, M-PAMO remains
under-explored. Movable obstacles lead to new fundamental challenges as the
state space, which includes both agents and movable obstacles, grows
exponentially with respect to the number of agents and movable obstacles. In
particular, movable obstacles often closely couple agents together spatially
and temporally. This paper makes a first attempt to adapt and fuse the popular
Conflict-Based Search (CBS) and Prioritized Planning (PP) for MAPF, and a
recent single-agent PAMO planner called PAMO*, together to address M-PAMO. We
compare their performance with up to 20 agents and hundreds of movable
obstacles, and show the pros and cons of these approaches.

### [274] [Evolutionary Continuous Adaptive RL-Powered Co-Design for Humanoid Chin-Up Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26082)
*Tianyi Jin,Melya Boukheddimi,Rohit Kumar,Gabriele Fadini,Frank Kirchner*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: EA-CoRL is a co-design framework that combines reinforcement learning with evolutionary strategies to simultaneously optimize robot hardware design and control policies, enabling continuous adaptation of control to evolving hardware configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sequential robot design (hardware first, then control) limits performance by preventing full exploitation of hardware capabilities. Co-design approaches that optimize both aspects in parallel can maximize robotic capabilities.

Method: EA-CoRL uses two components: Design Evolution (evolutionary algorithm for hardware exploration) and Policy Continuous Adaptation (fine-tuning control policies across evolving designs using reinforcement learning).

Result: Applied to RH5 humanoid for dynamic chin-up task, EA-CoRL achieved higher fitness scores and broader design space exploration compared to state-of-the-art RL-based co-design methods, making previously infeasible tasks possible.

Conclusion: Continuous policy adaptation is critical for effective robot co-design, enabling better performance and hardware utilization than traditional sequential approaches.

Abstract: Humanoid robots have seen significant advancements in both design and
control, with a growing emphasis on integrating these aspects to enhance
overall performance. Traditionally, robot design has followed a sequential
process, where control algorithms are developed after the hardware is
finalized. However, this can be myopic and prevent robots to fully exploit
their hardware capabilities. Recent approaches advocate for co-design,
optimizing both design and control in parallel to maximize robotic
capabilities. This paper presents the Evolutionary Continuous Adaptive RL-based
Co-Design (EA-CoRL) framework, which combines reinforcement learning (RL) with
evolutionary strategies to enable continuous adaptation of the control policy
to the hardware. EA-CoRL comprises two key components: Design Evolution, which
explores the hardware choices using an evolutionary algorithm to identify
efficient configurations, and Policy Continuous Adaptation, which fine-tunes a
task-specific control policy across evolving designs to maximize performance
rewards. We evaluate EA-CoRL by co-designing the actuators (gear ratios) and
control policy of the RH5 humanoid for a highly dynamic chin-up task,
previously unfeasible due to actuator limitations. Comparative results against
state-of-the-art RL-based co-design methods show that EA-CoRL achieves higher
fitness score and broader design space exploration, highlighting the critical
role of continuous policy adaptation in robot co-design.

Motivation: To develop an automated, cost-effective solution for hospital patient care that can continuously monitor patients, deliver medicine, and provide emergency assistance while reducing healthcare staff workload.

Method: Used swarm intelligence principles with leader-follower configuration, Arduino/Raspberry Pi hardware, NRF24L01 RF modules, HuskyLens AI camera, and wearable health sensors for temperature, SpO2, heart rate, and fall detection in simulated hospital environment.

Result: Achieved 94%+ sensor accuracy, 92% task-level success rate, 96% communication reliability, and demonstrated AI-enabled early warning capabilities for abnormal health conditions through controlled self-testing.

Conclusion: The system shows strong potential as a robust, cost-effective solution for hospital automation and patient safety, with reliable performance in monitoring and emergency response capabilities.

Abstract: This research presents a multi-robot system for inpatient care, designed
using swarm intelligence principles and incorporating wearable health sensors,
RF-based communication, and AI-driven decision support. Within a simulated
hospital environment, the system adopts a leader-follower swarm configuration
to perform patient monitoring, medicine delivery, and emergency assistance. Due
to ethical constraints, live patient trials were not conducted; instead,
validation was carried out through controlled self-testing with wearable
sensors. The Leader Robot acquires key physiological parameters, including
temperature, SpO2, heart rate, and fall detection, and coordinates other robots
when required. The Assistant Robot patrols corridors for medicine delivery,
while a robotic arm provides direct drug administration. The swarm-inspired
leader-follower strategy enhanced communication reliability and ensured
continuous monitoring, including automated email alerts to healthcare staff.
The system hardware was implemented using Arduino, Raspberry Pi, NRF24L01 RF
modules, and a HuskyLens AI camera. Experimental evaluation showed an overall
sensor accuracy above 94%, a 92% task-level success rate, and a 96%
communication reliability rate, demonstrating system robustness. Furthermore,
the AI-enabled decision support was able to provide early warnings of abnormal
health conditions, highlighting the potential of the system as a cost-effective

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a side scan sonar-based SLAM framework for AUV navigation in kelp farms by modeling structural ropes as sequences of individual landmarks from sonar detections, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in real-world experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable safe AUV navigation in seaweed farms for automated crop inspections, which requires accurate online pose estimation and infrastructure mapping - a current bottleneck for industrial-scale seaweed farming automation.

Method: Uses side scan sonar-based SLAM that models structural ropes as sequences of individual landmarks from each sonar ping detection rather than combining detections into elongated representations, exploiting the geometric properties of kelp farms.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in hardware-in-the-loop experiments on a real AUV survey in a kelp farm, with the framework and dataset made publicly available.

Conclusion: The proposed SSS-based SLAM framework successfully enables safe AUV navigation in kelp farms by efficiently modeling farm infrastructure geometry, advancing automation capabilities for industrial-scale seaweed farming.

Abstract: The transition of seaweed farming to an alternative food source on an
industrial scale relies on automating its processes through smart farming,
equivalent to land agriculture. Key to this process are autonomous underwater
vehicles (AUVs) via their capacity to automate crop and structural inspections.
However, the current bottleneck for their deployment is ensuring safe
navigation within farms, which requires an accurate, online estimate of the AUV
pose and map of the infrastructure. To enable this, we propose an efficient
side scan sonar-based (SSS) simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
framework that exploits the geometry of kelp farms via modeling structural
ropes in the back-end as sequences of individual landmarks from each SSS ping
detection, instead of combining detections into elongated representations. Our
method outperforms state of the art solutions in hardware in the loop (HIL)
experiments on a real AUV survey in a kelp farm. The framework and dataset can

### [277] [Terrain-Awared LiDAR-Inertial Odometry for Legged-Wheel Robots Based on Radial Basis Function Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26222)
*Yizhe Liu,Han Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A terrain-aware LiDAR-Inertial odometry framework that uses Radial Basis Functions to model terrain geometry, reducing z-axis pose drift in legged-wheel robots on unstructured terrains through soft constraints and GPU acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing odometry methods for legged-wheel robots suffer from pose drift due to ignoring terrain geometry, especially in unstructured environments like bumpy roads and staircases.

Method: Proposes a LiDAR-Inertial odometry framework that approximates terrain using Radial Basis Functions with adaptively selected centers and recursively updated weights, enabling soft constraints to regularize optimization. Uses GPU parallelization for real-time performance.

Result: Achieves higher localization accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in scenarios with continuous height changes or sparse features during abrupt height changes.

Conclusion: The terrain-aware approach effectively mitigates z-axis pose drift and improves odometry accuracy for legged-wheel robots operating in challenging unstructured terrains.

Abstract: An accurate odometry is essential for legged-wheel robots operating in
unstructured terrains such as bumpy roads and staircases. Existing methods
often suffer from pose drift due to their ignorance of terrain geometry. We
propose a terrain-awared LiDAR-Inertial odometry (LIO) framework that
approximates the terrain using Radial Basis Functions (RBF) whose centers are
adaptively selected and weights are recursively updated. The resulting smooth
terrain manifold enables ``soft constraints" that regularize the odometry
optimization and mitigates the $z$-axis pose drift under abrupt elevation
changes during robot's maneuver. To ensure the LIO's real-time performance, we
further evaluate the RBF-related terms and calculate the inverse of the sparse
kernel matrix with GPU parallelization. Experiments on unstructured terrains
demonstrate that our method achieves higher localization accuracy than the
state-of-the-art baselines, especially in the scenarios that have continuous
height changes or sparse features when abrupt height changes occur.

*Benjamin A. Richardson,Felix Grüninger,Lukas Mack,Joerg Stueckler,Katherine J. Kuchenbecker*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces ISyHand, an open-source, low-cost, dexterous robot hand with an articulated palm design that enhances manipulation capabilities while maintaining anthropomorphism. It outperforms comparable hands in early training and shows superior performance to fixed-palm versions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for affordable, dexterous robot hands as expensive commercial options dominate the market. Leverage advances in servo motors and 3D printing to create an accessible alternative that balances dexterity with anthropomorphism.

Method: Develop ISyHand using off-the-shelf Dynamixel motors, fasteners, and 3D-printed parts. Implement an articulated palm design to increase dexterity. Use reinforcement learning in simulation to train the hand on cube reorientation tasks, then deploy trained policies on the physical hand.

Result: ISyHand can be assembled in 4 hours with $1,300 material cost. In simulation, it outperforms comparable hands during early training phases and significantly outperforms fixed-palm versions. Successfully deployed cube reorientation policies on the real hand, demonstrating real-world dexterous manipulation.

Conclusion: The articulated palm design effectively enhances dexterity with minimal sacrifice to anthropomorphism. ISyHand provides a viable, low-cost alternative to expensive commercial dexterous hands, enabling broader access to advanced manipulation capabilities.

Abstract: The rapid increase in the development of humanoid robots and customized
manufacturing solutions has brought dexterous manipulation to the forefront of
modern robotics. Over the past decade, several expensive dexterous hands have
come to market, but advances in hardware design, particularly in servo motors
and 3D printing, have recently facilitated an explosion of cheaper open-source
hands. Most hands are anthropomorphic to allow use of standard human tools, and
attempts to increase dexterity often sacrifice anthropomorphism. We introduce
the open-source ISyHand (pronounced easy-hand), a highly dexterous, low-cost,
easy-to-manufacture, on-joint servo-driven robot hand. Our hand uses
off-the-shelf Dynamixel motors, fasteners, and 3D-printed parts, can be
assembled within four hours, and has a total material cost of about 1,300 USD.
The ISyHands's unique articulated-palm design increases overall dexterity with
only a modest sacrifice in anthropomorphism. To demonstrate the utility of the
articulated palm, we use reinforcement learning in simulation to train the hand
to perform a classical in-hand manipulation task: cube reorientation. Our
novel, systematic experiments show that the simulated ISyHand outperforms the
two most comparable hands in early training phases, that all three perform
similarly well after policy convergence, and that the ISyHand significantly
outperforms a fixed-palm version of its own design. Additionally, we deploy a
policy trained on cube reorientation on the real hand, demonstrating its
ability to perform real-world dexterous manipulation.

*Niklas Grambow,Lisa-Marie Fenner,Felipe Kempkes,Philip Hotz,Dingyuan Wan,Jörg Krüger,Kevin Haninger*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores autoencoder-based anomaly detection for robot manipulation tasks using force/torque time series data, demonstrating reliable detection in cabling and screwing tasks but limited performance for subtle failures in polishing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Out-of-distribution states in robot manipulation lead to unpredictable behavior and task failures. While anomaly detection can identify deviations to trigger safety measures, prior methods lack transferability across control strategies and task types.

Method: Used autoencoder-based methods on multimodal time series data (force/torque signals) from three industrial tasks: cabling, screwing, and sanding. Evaluated generalization across tasks and control methods including diffusion policy, position, and impedance control.

Result: Achieved reliable detection with AUROC exceeding 0.93 for failures in cabling and screwing tasks (incorrect parts, misalignments, obstructions). In polishing, only severe failures were reliably detected while subtle failures remained undetected.

Conclusion: Autoencoder-based anomaly detection shows strong performance for certain manipulation tasks but has limitations in detecting subtle anomalies, particularly in polishing tasks. The approach demonstrates transferability across different control strategies.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution states in robot manipulation often lead to unpredictable
robot behavior or task failure, limiting success rates and increasing risk of
damage. Anomaly detection (AD) can identify deviations from expected patterns
in data, which can be used to trigger failsafe behaviors and recovery
strategies. Prior work has applied data-driven AD to time series data in
specific robotic tasks, but its transferability across control strategies and
task types has not been shown. Leveraging time series data, such as
force/torque signals, allows to directly capture robot-environment
interactions, crucial for manipulation and online failure detection. Their
broad availability, high sampling rates, and low dimensionality enable high
temporal resolution and efficient processing. As robotic tasks can have widely
signal characteristics and requirements, AD methods which can be applied in the
same way to a wide range of tasks is needed, ideally with good data efficiency.
We examine three industrial robotic tasks, each presenting several anomalies.
Test scenarios in robotic cabling, screwing, and sanding are built, and
multimodal time series data is gathered. Several autoencoder-based methods are
compared, evaluating generalization across tasks and control methods (diffusion
policy, position, and impedance control). This allows us to validate the
integration of AD in complex tasks involving tighter tolerances and variation
from both the robot and its environment. Additionally, we evaluate data
efficiency, detection latency, and task characteristics which support robust
detection. The results indicate reliable detection with AUROC exceeding 0.93 in
failures in the cabling and screwing task, such as incorrect or misaligned
parts and obstructed targets. In the polishing task, only severe failures were
reliably detected, while more subtle failure types remained undetected.

Conclusion: LLM-MCoX demonstrates superior performance for multi-robot coordinated exploration and search, particularly enabling human operators to provide high-level semantic guidance that traditional algorithms cannot interpret.

Abstract: Autonomous exploration and object search in unknown indoor environments
remain challenging for multi-robot systems (MRS). Traditional approaches often
rely on greedy frontier assignment strategies with limited inter-robot
coordination. In this work, we introduce LLM-MCoX (LLM-based Multi-robot

### [281] [Kinodynamic Motion Planning for Mobile Robot Navigation across Inconsistent World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26339)
*Eric R. Damm,Thomas M. Howard*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents GEGRH, a motion planning method that tracks multiple world model hypotheses to handle inconsistent obstacle detection, achieving better trajectory quality than VEH while maintaining reasonable planning times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile robots need reliable motion planning despite inconsistent obstacle detection due to sensor noise and algorithmic limitations, particularly when cost maps switch between marking areas as obstacles and free space.

Method: Three iterations: PEH (sub-search at every node expansion), GEH (deferred sub-search after goal expansion), and GEGRH (deferred sub-search plus graph revision based on divergent nodes in each world model).

Result: GEGRH finds lower cost trajectories and has faster average planning times than VEH, while generating more conservative plans than single-hypothesis search with only small planning time increases.

Conclusion: GEGRH effectively balances trajectory quality and planning efficiency by handling multiple world model hypotheses, making it suitable for field deployment in unstructured environments.

Abstract: Mobile ground robots lacking prior knowledge of an environment must rely on
sensor data to develop a model of their surroundings. In these scenarios,
consistent identification of obstacles and terrain features can be difficult
due to noise and algorithmic shortcomings, which can make it difficult for
motion planning systems to generate safe motions. One particular difficulty to
overcome is when regions of the cost map switch between being marked as
obstacles and free space through successive planning cycles. One potential
solution to this, which we refer to as Valid in Every Hypothesis (VEH), is for
the planning system to plan motions that are guaranteed to be safe through a
history of world models. Another approach is to track a history of world
models, and adjust node costs according to the potential penalty of needing to
reroute around previously hazardous areas. This work discusses three major
iterations on this idea. The first iteration, called PEH, invokes a sub-search
for every node expansion that crosses through a divergence point in the world
models. The second and third iterations, called GEH and GEGRH respectively,
defer the sub-search until after an edge expands into the goal region. GEGRH
uses an additional step to revise the graph based on divergent nodes in each
world. Initial results showed that, although PEH and GEH find more optimistic
solutions than VEH, they are unable to generate solutions in less than
one-second, which exceeds our requirements for field deployment. Analysis of
results from a field experiment in an unstructured, off-road environment on a
Clearpath Robotics Warthog UGV indicate that GEGRH finds lower cost
trajectories and has faster average planning times than VEH. Compared to
single-hypothesis (SH) search, where only the latest world model is considered,
GEGRH generates more conservative plans with a small increase in average
planning time.

TL;DR: SDA-PLANNER is an adaptive embodied task planning framework that introduces state-dependency modeling and error-aware replanning to overcome limitations of current LLM-based planners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based embodied task planners have limitations including fixed planning paradigms, lack of action sequence constraints, and being error-agnostic, which hinders their effectiveness in dynamic environments.

Method: Proposes SDA-PLANNER with State-Dependency Graph to model action preconditions/effects, and error-adaptive replanning strategy with Error Backtrack and Diagnosis plus Adaptive Action SubTree Generation for local plan reconstruction.

Result: Experiments show SDA-PLANNER consistently outperforms baselines in success rate and goal completion, especially under diverse error conditions.

Conclusion: SDA-PLANNER provides a comprehensive solution for embodied task planning by addressing key limitations of existing LLM-based approaches through adaptive planning, state-awareness, and error-handling mechanisms.

Abstract: Embodied task planning requires agents to produce executable actions in a
close-loop manner within the environment. With progressively improving
capabilities of LLMs in task decomposition, planning, and generalization,
current embodied task planning methods adopt LLM-based architecture.However,
existing LLM-based planners remain limited in three aspects, i.e., fixed
planning paradigms, lack of action sequence constraints, and error-agnostic. In
this work, we propose SDA-PLANNER, enabling an adaptive planning paradigm,
state-dependency aware and error-aware mechanisms for comprehensive embodied
task planning. Specifically, SDA-PLANNER introduces a State-Dependency Graph to
explicitly model action preconditions and effects, guiding the dynamic
revision. To handle execution error, it employs an error-adaptive replanning
strategy consisting of Error Backtrack and Diagnosis and Adaptive Action
SubTree Generation, which locally reconstructs the affected portion of the plan
based on the current environment state. Experiments demonstrate that
SDA-PLANNER consistently outperforms baselines in success rate and goal
completion, particularly under diverse error conditions.

Motivation: Existing methods for time-optimal velocity planning either support arbitrary acceleration constraints at high computational cost or use conservative box constraints for efficiency, creating a need for a method that balances both accuracy and speed.

Method: FBGA uses forward and backward passes to maximize velocity profiles in discretized path segments while satisfying user-defined performance limits, handling complex non-convex acceleration constraints with custom formulations.

Result: Tested on five racetracks and two vehicle classes, FBGA achieves lap times within 0.11%-0.36% of optimal control baselines while being up to three orders of magnitude faster, maintaining high accuracy even with coarse discretization.

Conclusion: FBGA is well-suited for online multi-query trajectory planning, particularly in autonomous racing applications, with an open-source C++ implementation available.

Abstract: The computation of time-optimal velocity profiles along prescribed paths,
subject to generic acceleration constraints, is a crucial problem in robot
trajectory planning, with particular relevance to autonomous racing. However,
the existing methods either support arbitrary acceleration constraints at high
computational cost or use conservative box constraints for computational
efficiency. We propose FBGA, a new \underline{F}orward-\underline{B}ackward
algorithm with \underline{G}eneric \underline{A}cceleration constraints, which
achieves both high accuracy and low computation time. FBGA operates forward and
backward passes to maximize the velocity profile in short, discretized path
segments, while satisfying user-defined performance limits. Tested on five
racetracks and two vehicle classes, FBGA handles complex, non-convex
acceleration constraints with custom formulations. Its maneuvers and lap times
closely match optimal control baselines (within $0.11\%$-$0.36\%$), while being
up to three orders of magnitude faster. FBGA maintains high accuracy even with
coarse discretization, making it well-suited for online multi-query trajectory
planning. Our open-source \texttt{C++} implementation is available at:

### [284] [Unwinding Rotations Reduces VR Sickness in Nonsimulated Immersive Telepresence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26439)

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether unwinding robot rotations (decoupling camera rotations from user view) reduces VR sickness in immersive telepresence systems using real cameras, finding it improves comfort without significantly impacting task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robot motions in immersive robotic telepresence can cause VR sickness, degrading user experience. Previous research showed unwinding rotations increases comfort in virtual environments, but needed validation with real camera systems.

Method: Conducted user study (n=36) comparing unwinding rotations method against coupled rotations using panoramic camera mounted on robotic arm. Tested both comfort and task performance in 3D inspection task involving translations and rotations.

Result: Users found unwinding rotations method more comfortable and preferable, achieving reduced VR sickness levels without significant impact on task performance.

Conclusion: Unwinding robot rotations effectively reduces VR sickness in real camera-based immersive telepresence systems while maintaining task performance, validating previous findings from virtual environments.

Abstract: Immersive telepresence, when a user views the video stream of a $360^\circ$
camera in a remote environment using a Head Mounted Display (HMD), has great
potential to improve the sense of being in a remote environment. In most cases
of immersive robotic telepresence, the camera is mounted on a mobile robot
which increases the portion of the environment that the remote user can
explore. However, robot motions can induce unpleasant symptoms associated with
Virtual Reality (VR) sickness, degrading the overall user experience. Previous
research has shown that unwinding the rotations of the robot, that is,
decoupling the rotations that the camera undergoes due to robot motions from
what is seen by the user, can increase user comfort and reduce VR sickness.
However, that work considered a virtual environment and a simulated robot. In
this work, to test whether the same hypotheses hold when the video stream from
a real camera is used, we carried out a user study $(n=36)$ in which the
unwinding rotations method was compared against coupled rotations in a task
completed through a panoramic camera mounted on a robotic arm. Furthermore,
within an inspection task which involved translations and rotations in three
dimensions, we tested whether unwinding the robot rotations impacted the
performance of users. The results show that the users found the unwinding
rotations method to be more comfortable and preferable, and that a reduced
level of VR sickness can be achieved without a significant impact on task
performance.

*Akshay Jaitly,Devesh K. Jha,Kei Ota,Yuki Shirai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A method for efficiently enforcing non-penetration constraints in optimization-based planning using differentiable conditions and smooth approximations of polytopes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimization-based methods for collision-free planning require expensive non-penetration constraints, making them computationally challenging for real-time applications.

Method: Introduces differentiable conditions with analytic expressions to enforce non-penetration, and approximates polytopes as smooth semi-algebraic sets for handling non-smooth bodies.

Result: Numerical experiments show improved performance compared to baseline methods in collision-aware trajectory optimization.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables efficient optimization-based planning with non-penetration constraints, making it suitable for real-time collision-aware applications.

Abstract: Optimization-based methods are widely used for computing fast, diverse
solutions for complex tasks such as collision-free movement or planning in the
presence of contacts. However, most of these methods require enforcing
non-penetration constraints between objects, resulting in a non-trivial and
computationally expensive problem. This makes the use of optimization-based
methods for planning and control challenging. In this paper, we present a
method to efficiently enforce non-penetration of sets while performing
optimization over their configuration, which is directly applicable to problems
like collision-aware trajectory optimization. We introduce novel differentiable
conditions with analytic expressions to achieve this. To enforce non-collision
between non-smooth bodies using these conditions, we introduce a method to
approximate polytopes as smooth semi-algebraic sets. We present several
numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method and
compare the performance with other baseline methods recently proposed in the
literature.

*Saad Abdul Ghani,Kameron Lee,Xuesu Xiao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LfH-CP is a self-supervised framework that generates diverse dynamic obstacle datasets by hallucinating critical points from existing motion plans, avoiding expensive demonstrations or exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating large and diverse obstacle datasets for motion planning with dynamic obstacles is challenging due to the vast space of possible obstacle trajectories.

Method: Factorizes hallucination into two stages: identifying critical points where obstacles must appear for optimal motion plans, then procedurally generating diverse trajectories through these points while avoiding collisions.

Result: LfH-CP produces substantially more varied training data than existing baselines, and planners trained on LfH-CP datasets achieve higher success rates compared to prior hallucination methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively generates rich dynamic obstacle datasets through critical point hallucination, improving motion planning performance while avoiding generative failures like mode collapse.

Abstract: Generating large and diverse obstacle datasets to learn motion planning in
environments with dynamic obstacles is challenging due to the vast space of
possible obstacle trajectories. Inspired by hallucination-based data synthesis
approaches, we propose Learning from Hallucinating Critical Points (LfH-CP), a
self-supervised framework for creating rich dynamic obstacle datasets based on
existing optimal motion plans without requiring expensive expert demonstrations
or trial-and-error exploration. LfH-CP factorizes hallucination into two
stages: first identifying when and where obstacles must appear in order to
result in an optimal motion plan, i.e., the critical points, and then
procedurally generating diverse trajectories that pass through these points
while avoiding collisions. This factorization avoids generative failures such
as mode collapse and ensures coverage of diverse dynamic behaviors. We further
introduce a diversity metric to quantify dataset richness and show that LfH-CP
produces substantially more varied training data than existing baselines.
Experiments in simulation demonstrate that planners trained on LfH-CP datasets
achieves higher success rates compared to a prior hallucination method.

*Shuoyu Yue,Pengpeng Li,Yang Xu,Kunrui Ze,Xingjian Long,Huazi Cao,Guibin Sun*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a memory-efficient tree map representation for robot swarm shape assembly that reduces memory usage by 1-2 orders of magnitude and speeds up shape entry by 2-3x compared to mean-shift methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mean-shift methods for swarm shape assembly use image-based representations that incur substantial memory overhead, especially for high-resolution or 3D shapes, making them prohibitive for practical applications.

Method: Developed a hierarchical tree map representation to encode user-specified shapes efficiently, and designed a behavior-based distributed controller for assignment-free shape assembly applicable to both 2D and 3D scenarios.

Result: Comparative simulations showed 1-2 orders of magnitude lower memory usage and 2-3 times faster shape entry while maintaining comparable uniformity. Physical experiments with 6-7 UAVs validated real-world practicality.

Conclusion: The proposed tree map representation successfully overcomes memory limitations of mean-shift methods while improving performance, making swarm shape assembly more practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Mean-shift-based approaches have recently emerged as the most effective
methods for robot swarm shape assembly tasks. These methods rely on image-based
representations of target shapes to compute local density gradients and perform
mean-shift exploration, which constitute their core mechanism. However, such
image representations incur substantial memory overhead, which can become
prohibitive for high-resolution or 3D shapes. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a memory-efficient tree map representation that hierarchically encodes
user-specified shapes and is applicable to both 2D and 3D scenarios. Building
on this representation, we design a behavior-based distributed controller that
enables assignment-free shape assembly. Comparative 2D and 3D simulations
against a state-of-the-art mean-shift algorithm demonstrate one to two orders
of magnitude lower memory usage and two to three times faster shape entry while
maintaining comparable uniformity. Finally, we validate the framework through
physical experiments with 6 to 7 UAVs, confirming its real-world practicality.

TL;DR: A multi-robot UGV-UAV localization system using UWB and radar with IMUs and wheel encoders to estimate relative position between aerial and ground robots through optimization frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radio-based methods like UWB and radar are gaining popularity in robotics due to robustness in harsh environments and cluttered conditions, but need better integration for multi-robot scenarios.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) nonlinear optimization for UWB trilateration and radar pre-processing with ego-motion estimation, 2) pose-graph optimization with odometry and inter-robot constraints using Ceres optimizer in ROS 2.

Result: The system outperforms state-of-the-art closed-form methods in robustness to noise, validated in SITL simulations and real-world datasets. Includes realistic UWB simulation plugin and extensible factor graph for SLAM.

Conclusion: Proposed multi-robot localization system successfully integrates UWB and radar technologies, demonstrating improved robustness over existing methods while providing open-source implementation and datasets for reproducibility.

Abstract: Radio-based methods such as Ultra-Wideband (UWB) and RAdio Detection And
Ranging (radar), which have traditionally seen limited adoption in robotics,
are experiencing a boost in popularity thanks to their robustness to harsh
environmental conditions and cluttered environments. This work proposes a
multi-robot UGV-UAV localization system that leverages the two technologies
with inexpensive and readily-available sensors, such as Inertial Measurement
Units (IMUs) and wheel encoders, to estimate the relative position of an aerial
robot with respect to a ground robot. The first stage of the system pipeline
includes a nonlinear optimization framework to trilaterate the location of the
aerial platform based on UWB range data, and a radar pre-processing module with
loosely coupled ego-motion estimation which has been adapted for a multi-robot
scenario. Then, the pre-processed radar data as well as the relative
transformation are fed to a pose-graph optimization framework with odometry and
inter-robot constraints. The system, implemented for the Robotic Operating
System (ROS 2) with the Ceres optimizer, has been validated in
Software-in-the-Loop (SITL) simulations and in a real-world dataset. The
proposed relative localization module outperforms state-of-the-art closed-form
methods which are less robust to noise. Our SITL environment includes a custom
Gazebo plugin for generating realistic UWB measurements modeled after real
data. Conveniently, the proposed factor graph formulation makes the system
readily extensible to full Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM).
Finally, all the code and experimental data is publicly available to support
reproducibility and to serve as a common open dataset for benchmarking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable faster large-scale optimization on both desktop and resource-constrained devices by providing a GPU-accelerated framework that can share code between realtime applications and optimization tasks.

Method: Provides a CUDA C++ interface for code sharing, supports memory reduction techniques including in-place optimization, multiple floating point types, mixed-precision modes, and dynamically computed Jacobians.

Result: Achieves similar performance to MegBA (specialized bundle adjustment solver) while using less memory, and shows up to 59x speedup compared to CPU baseline on visual-inertial bundle adjustment tasks.

Conclusion: Graphite enables faster large-scale optimization across different hardware platforms while maintaining generality and efficiency.

Abstract: We present Graphite, a GPU-accelerated nonlinear graph optimization
framework. It provides a CUDA C++ interface to enable the sharing of code
between a realtime application, such as a SLAM system, and its optimization
tasks. The framework supports techniques to reduce memory usage, including
in-place optimization, support for multiple floating point types and
mixed-precision modes, and dynamically computed Jacobians. We evaluate Graphite
on well-known bundle adjustment problems and find that it achieves similar
performance to MegBA, a solver specialized for bundle adjustment, while
maintaining generality and using less memory. We also apply Graphite to global
visual-inertial bundle adjustment on maps generated from stereo-inertial SLAM
datasets, and observe speed ups of up to 59x compared to a CPU baseline. Our
results indicate that our solver enables faster large-scale optimization on
both desktop and resource-constrained devices.

*Lujie Yang,Xiaoyu Huang,Zhen Wu,Angjoo Kanazawa,Pieter Abbeel,Carmelo Sferrazza,C. Karen Liu,Rocky Duan,Guanya Shi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OmniRetarget is an interaction-preserving motion retargeting system that generates high-quality robot training data by preserving human-object and human-environment interactions, enabling efficient RL policy training for complex humanoid skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion retargeting methods struggle with the embodiment gap between humans and robots, producing artifacts like foot-skating and penetration, and neglect crucial human-object and human-environment interactions needed for expressive locomotion and loco-manipulation.

Method: Uses an interaction mesh to explicitly model spatial and contact relationships between agent, terrain, and objects. Minimizes Laplacian deformation between human and robot meshes while enforcing kinematic constraints, and enables data augmentation across different robot embodiments, terrains, and object configurations.

Result: Generated over 8-hour trajectories with better kinematic constraint satisfaction and contact preservation than baselines. Enabled proprioceptive RL policies to execute long-horizon (up to 30s) parkour and loco-manipulation skills on Unitree G1 humanoid with only 5 reward terms and simple domain randomization.

Conclusion: OmniRetarget successfully addresses the embodiment gap in motion retargeting by preserving task-relevant interactions, producing high-quality data that enables efficient RL training for complex humanoid skills without complex learning curricula.

Abstract: A dominant paradigm for teaching humanoid robots complex skills is to
retarget human motions as kinematic references to train reinforcement learning
(RL) policies. However, existing retargeting pipelines often struggle with the
significant embodiment gap between humans and robots, producing physically
implausible artifacts like foot-skating and penetration. More importantly,
common retargeting methods neglect the rich human-object and human-environment
interactions essential for expressive locomotion and loco-manipulation. To
address this, we introduce OmniRetarget, an interaction-preserving data
generation engine based on an interaction mesh that explicitly models and
preserves the crucial spatial and contact relationships between an agent, the
terrain, and manipulated objects. By minimizing the Laplacian deformation
between the human and robot meshes while enforcing kinematic constraints,
OmniRetarget generates kinematically feasible trajectories. Moreover,
preserving task-relevant interactions enables efficient data augmentation, from
a single demonstration to different robot embodiments, terrains, and object
configurations. We comprehensively evaluate OmniRetarget by retargeting motions
from OMOMO, LAFAN1, and our in-house MoCap datasets, generating over 8-hour
trajectories that achieve better kinematic constraint satisfaction and contact
preservation than widely used baselines. Such high-quality data enables
proprioceptive RL policies to successfully execute long-horizon (up to 30
seconds) parkour and loco-manipulation skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid, trained
with only 5 reward terms and simple domain randomization shared by all tasks,
without any learning curriculum.

### [291] [MLA: A Multisensory Language-Action Model for Multimodal Understanding and Forecasting in Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26642)
*Zhuoyang Liu,Jiaming Liu,Jiadong Xu,Nuowei Han,Chenyang Gu,Hao Chen,Kaichen Zhou,Renrui Zhang,Kai Chin Hsieh,Kun Wu,Zhengping Che,Jian Tang,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A multisensory language-action (MLA) model that integrates 2D images, 3D point clouds, and tactile information for improved robotic manipulation in contact-rich tasks, outperforming previous methods by significant margins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language-action models focus on vision and language but lack comprehensive understanding of robotic-specific multisensory information needed for complex physical interactions and contact-rich control.

Method: Proposes encoder-free multimodal alignment using LLMs as perception modules to interpret 2D images, 3D point clouds, and tactile tokens through positional correspondence, plus future multisensory generation post-training for physical dynamics understanding.

Result: Outperforms previous state-of-the-art 2D and 3D VLA methods by 12% and 24% respectively in complex, contact-rich real-world tasks, with improved generalization to unseen configurations.

Conclusion: The MLA model effectively bridges the gap between vision-language models and robotic physical interaction by integrating multiple sensory modalities, enabling better physical world modeling and more robust action generation for complex manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown generalization capabilities
in robotic manipulation tasks by inheriting from vision-language models (VLMs)
and learning action generation. Most VLA models focus on interpreting vision
and language to generate actions, whereas robots must perceive and interact
within the spatial-physical world. This gap highlights the need for a
comprehensive understanding of robotic-specific multisensory information, which
is crucial for achieving complex and contact-rich control. To this end, we
introduce a multisensory language-action (MLA) model that collaboratively
perceives heterogeneous sensory modalities and predicts future multisensory
objectives to facilitate physical world modeling. Specifically, to enhance
perceptual representations, we propose an encoder-free multimodal alignment
scheme that innovatively repurposes the large language model itself as a
perception module, directly interpreting multimodal cues by aligning 2D images,
3D point clouds, and tactile tokens through positional correspondence. To
further enhance MLA's understanding of physical dynamics, we design a future
multisensory generation post-training strategy that enables MLA to reason about
semantic, geometric, and interaction information, providing more robust
conditions for action generation. For evaluation, the MLA model outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art 2D and 3D VLA methods by 12% and 24% in complex,
contact-rich real-world tasks, respectively, while also demonstrating improved
generalization to unseen configurations. Project website:
