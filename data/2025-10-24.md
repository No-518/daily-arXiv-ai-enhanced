*Sai Teja Erukude,Viswa Chaitanya Marella,Suhasnadh Reddy Veluru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using frequency-domain analysis with 2D DFT and ResNet50 to detect StyleGAN-generated images, achieving 92.8% accuracy and 0.95 AUC by identifying unique frequency signatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid rise of photorealistic GAN-generated images poses serious challenges for image forensics and industrial systems requiring reliable content authenticity.

Method: Apply 2D Discrete Fourier Transform to convert images to frequency domain where periodic artifacts become detectable, then train ResNet50 neural network on these transformed images to differentiate real vs synthetic images.

Result: The frequency-domain model achieves 92.8% accuracy and 0.95 AUC, significantly outperforming equivalent spatial-domain models, indicating GAN-generated images have unique frequency-domain fingerprints.

Conclusion: Combining signal processing techniques with deep learning has industrial potential to enhance digital forensics and strengthen trustworthiness of industrial AI systems by detecting GAN-generated content.

Abstract: The rapid rise of photorealistic images produced from Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) poses a serious challenge for image forensics and industrial
systems requiring reliable content authenticity. This paper uses
frequency-domain analysis combined with deep learning to solve the problem of
distinguishing StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Specifically, a
two-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (2D DFT) was applied to transform
images into the Fourier domain, where subtle periodic artifacts become
detectable. A ResNet50 neural network is trained on these transformed images to
differentiate between real and synthetic ones. The experiments demonstrate that
the frequency-domain model achieves a 92.8 percent and an AUC of 0.95,
significantly outperforming the equivalent model trained on raw spatial-domain
images. These results indicate that the GAN-generated images have unique
frequency-domain signatures or "fingerprints". The method proposed highlights
the industrial potential of combining signal processing techniques and deep
learning to enhance digital forensics and strengthen the trustworthiness of
industrial AI systems.

### [2] [Transformed Multi-view 3D Shape Features with Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19955)
*Márcus Vinícius Lobo Costa,Sherlon Almeida da Silva,Bárbara Caroline Benato,Leo Sampaio Ferraz Ribeiro,Moacir Antonelli Ponti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Transformers (ViTs) with contrastive learning achieve ~90.6% accuracy on ModelNet10 for 3D shape analysis, overcoming CNN limitations and reducing need for labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in 3D shape representation learning where CNNs struggle with shape relationships and require extensive labeled data for 2D image-based 3D object recognition.

Method: Combine Vision Transformers (ViTs) with contrastive learning objectives (both supervised and self-supervised) for multi-view 3D analysis, leveraging ViTs' global shape understanding and contrastive learning's feature refinement.

Result: Achieved 90.6% accuracy on ModelNet10, demonstrating that ViTs with contrastive learning effectively capture global shape semantics and local discriminative features for 3D representation.

Conclusion: ViTs paired with contrastive learning provide an effective approach for 3D shape understanding, overcoming CNN limitations and reducing dependency on extensive labeled data through empirical validation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges in representation learning of 3D shape
features by investigating state-of-the-art backbones paired with both
contrastive supervised and self-supervised learning objectives. Computer vision
methods struggle with recognizing 3D objects from 2D images, often requiring
extensive labeled data and relying on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that
may overlook crucial shape relationships. Our work demonstrates that Vision
Transformers (ViTs) based architectures, when paired with modern contrastive
objectives, achieve promising results in multi-view 3D analysis on our
downstream tasks, unifying contrastive and 3D shape understanding pipelines.
For example, supervised contrastive losses reached about 90.6% accuracy on
ModelNet10. The use of ViTs and contrastive learning, leveraging ViTs' ability
to understand overall shapes and contrastive learning's effectiveness,
overcomes the need for extensive labeled data and the limitations of CNNs in
capturing crucial shape relationships. The success stems from capturing global
shape semantics via ViTs and refining local discriminative features through
contrastive optimization. Importantly, our approach is empirical, as it is
grounded on extensive experimental evaluation to validate the effectiveness of
combining ViTs with contrastive objectives for 3D representation learning.

### [3] [FutrTrack: A Camera-LiDAR Fusion Transformer for 3D Multiple Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19981)
*Martha Teiko Teye,Ori Maoz,Matthias Rottmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FutrTrack is a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework that uses transformer-based refinement and fusion tracking to improve 3D MOT performance without explicit motion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance query-based transformer tracking methods by leveraging multimodal sensor features from cameras and LiDAR, addressing limitations of previous single-sensor approaches and improving robustness under occlusion and viewpoint changes.

Method: Uses a two-stage transformer pipeline with temporal smoothing over moving windows for trajectory refinement, and fusion-driven tracking that integrates bounding boxes with multimodal BEV features from cameras and LiDAR without explicit motion models.

Result: Achieves 74.7 aMOTA on nuScenes test set, reduces identity switches while maintaining competitive accuracy, and demonstrates significant benefits from multimodal sensor features compared to single-sensor approaches.

Conclusion: FutrTrack provides an efficient framework that enables transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network methods even with limited data and without pretraining, showing the value of multimodal sensor fusion in 3D MOT.

Abstract: We propose FutrTrack, a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework
that builds on existing 3D detectors by introducing a transformer-based
smoother and a fusion-driven tracker. Inspired by query-based tracking
frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and
tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal
bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without
the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates
identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for
robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to
tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a
moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial
consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that
query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal
sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA
of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D
MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive
accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving
transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods
even with limited data and without pretraining.

### [4] [Improving Predictive Confidence in Medical Imaging via Online Label Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20011)
*Kushan Choudhury,Shubhrodeep Roy,Ankur Chanda,Shubhajit Biswas,Somenath Kuiry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Online Label Smoothing (OLS) dynamically adjusts soft labels during training to reduce overconfidence in medical image classification, improving accuracy and feature learning compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in medical imaging often produce overconfident predictions that undermine reliability. Traditional label smoothing treats all non-target classes equally, ignoring inter-class relationships.

Method: Used Online Label Smoothing (OLS) that dynamically adjusts soft labels based on model's prediction patterns during training. Evaluated on RadImageNet dataset with ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19 architectures.

Result: OLS consistently improved Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to hard labels, conventional label smoothing, and teacher-free knowledge distillation. Also produced more compact and well-separated feature embeddings.

Conclusion: OLS strengthens predictive performance and enhances calibration, making it a practical solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in medical imaging.

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks, have achieved
impressive results in medical image classification. However, these models often
produce overconfident predictions, which can undermine their reliability in
critical healthcare settings. While traditional label smoothing offers a simple
way to reduce such overconfidence, it fails to consider relationships between
classes by treating all non-target classes equally. In this study, we explore
the use of Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic approach that adjusts soft
labels throughout training based on the model's own prediction patterns. We
evaluate OLS on the large-scale RadImageNet dataset using three widely used
architectures: ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19. Our results show that OLS
consistently improves both Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to
standard training methods, including hard labels, conventional label smoothing,
and teacher-free knowledge distillation. In addition to accuracy gains, OLS
leads to more compact and well-separated feature embeddings, indicating
improved representation learning. These findings suggest that OLS not only
strengthens predictive performance but also enhances calibration, making it a
practical and effective solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in the
medical imaging domain.

### [5] [A Unified Detection Pipeline for Robust Object Detection in Fisheye-Based Traffic Surveillance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20016)
*Neema Jakisa Owor,Joshua Kofi Asamoah,Tanner Wambui Muturi,Anneliese Jakisa Owor,Blessing Agyei Kyem,Andrews Danyo,Yaw Adu-Gyamfi,Armstrong Aboah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A detection framework for fisheye cameras that uses pre/post-processing and ensemble methods to handle radial distortion and nonuniform resolution, achieving 8th place in the 2025 AI City Challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fisheye cameras capture wide areas efficiently but suffer from strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution, particularly degrading object detection near image boundaries.

Method: Uses pre and post-processing pipeline to enhance detection consistency across the image, trains multiple state-of-the-art detectors on fisheye traffic imagery, and combines outputs through ensemble strategy.

Result: Achieved F1 score of 0.6366 and placed 8th out of 62 teams in the 2025 AI City Challenge Track 4.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses fisheye imagery challenges, demonstrating robust detection performance despite severe distortion effects.

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer an efficient solution for wide-area traffic
surveillance by capturing large fields of view from a single vantage point.
However, the strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution inherent in
fisheye imagery introduce substantial challenges for standard object detectors,
particularly near image boundaries where object appearance is severely
degraded. In this work, we present a detection framework designed to operate
robustly under these conditions. Our approach employs a simple yet effective
pre and post processing pipeline that enhances detection consistency across the
image, especially in regions affected by severe distortion. We train several
state-of-the-art detection models on the fisheye traffic imagery and combine
their outputs through an ensemble strategy to improve overall detection
accuracy. Our method achieves an F1 score of0.6366 on the 2025 AI City
Challenge Track 4, placing 8thoverall out of 62 teams. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in addressing issues inherent to
fisheye imagery.

### [6] [Extreme Views: 3DGS Filter for Novel View Synthesis from Out-of-Distribution Camera Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20027)
*Damian Bowness,Charalambos Poullis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a real-time render-aware filtering method for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that reduces visual noise when viewing models from extrapolated camera positions outside training distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS models exhibit substantial visual noise when viewed from camera positions outside training distribution due to lack of training data in extrapolated regions, causing uncertain predictions.

Method: Leverages sensitivity scores from intermediate gradients to target instabilities from anisotropic orientations, addressing generative uncertainty without requiring retraining.

Result: Substantially improves visual quality, realism, and consistency compared to NeRF-based approaches like BayesRays, while maintaining real-time performance.

Conclusion: The filtering method enables 3D reconstruction systems to maintain high visual fidelity during free navigation outside original training viewpoints, integrating seamlessly into existing 3DGS pipelines.

Abstract: When viewing a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from camera positions
significantly outside the training data distribution, substantial visual noise
commonly occurs. These artifacts result from the lack of training data in these
extrapolated regions, leading to uncertain density, color, and geometry
predictions from the model.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time render-aware filtering
method. Our approach leverages sensitivity scores derived from intermediate
gradients, explicitly targeting instabilities caused by anisotropic
orientations rather than isotropic variance. This filtering method directly
addresses the core issue of generative uncertainty, allowing 3D reconstruction
systems to maintain high visual fidelity even when users freely navigate
outside the original training viewpoints.
  Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method substantially improves
visual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF)-based approaches such as BayesRays. Critically, our filter
seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS rendering pipelines in real-time,
unlike methods that require extensive post-hoc retraining or fine-tuning.

### [7] [BrainPuzzle: Hybrid Physics and Data-Driven Reconstruction for Transcranial Ultrasound Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20029)
*Shengyu Chen,Shihang Feng,Yi Luo,Xiaowei Jia,Youzuo Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainPuzzle is a hybrid two-stage framework combining physics-based modeling with machine learning to achieve quantitative transcranial ultrasound brain imaging by reconstructing accurate speed-of-sound maps, overcoming limitations of traditional full-waveform inversion and purely data-driven methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound brain imaging faces challenges due to skull-induced attenuation, mode conversion, phase aberration, and difficulty coupling large probes to the skull. Traditional physics-based methods suffer from weak signals and incomplete spatial coverage, while purely data-driven methods produce quantitatively biased results under low SNR and sparse-aperture conditions.

Method: Two-stage hybrid framework: 1) Reverse time migration applied to multi-angle acquisitions to produce migration fragments preserving structural details under low SNR; 2) Transformer-based super-resolution encoder-decoder with graph-based attention unit fuses fragments into coherent SoS images. Uses partial-array acquisition with movable low-count transducer set for improved feasibility and coupling.

Result: Experiments on two synthetic datasets show BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image completeness compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: BrainPuzzle demonstrates potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound brain imaging by effectively combining physical modeling with machine learning to overcome the limitations of skull-induced artifacts and sparse aperture conditions.

Abstract: Ultrasound brain imaging remains challenging due to the large difference in
sound speed between the skull and brain tissues and the difficulty of coupling
large probes to the skull. This work aims to achieve quantitative transcranial
ultrasound by reconstructing an accurate speed-of-sound (SoS) map of the brain.
Traditional physics-based full-waveform inversion (FWI) is limited by weak
signals caused by skull-induced attenuation, mode conversion, and phase
aberration, as well as incomplete spatial coverage since full-aperture arrays
are clinically impractical. In contrast, purely data-driven methods that learn
directly from raw ultrasound data often fail to model the complex nonlinear and
nonlocal wave propagation through bone, leading to anatomically plausible but
quantitatively biased SoS maps under low signal-to-noise and sparse-aperture
conditions. To address these issues, we propose BrainPuzzle, a hybrid two-stage
framework that combines physical modeling with machine learning. In the first
stage, reverse time migration (time-reversal acoustics) is applied to
multi-angle acquisitions to produce migration fragments that preserve
structural details even under low SNR. In the second stage, a transformer-based
super-resolution encoder-decoder with a graph-based attention unit (GAU) fuses
these fragments into a coherent and quantitatively accurate SoS image. A
partial-array acquisition strategy using a movable low-count transducer set
improves feasibility and coupling, while the hybrid algorithm compensates for
the missing aperture. Experiments on two synthetic datasets show that
BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image
completeness, demonstrating its potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound
brain imaging.

### [8] [Exposing Blindspots: Cultural Bias Evaluation in Generative Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20042)
*Huichan Seo,Sieun Choi,Minki Hong,Yi Zhou,Junseo Kim,Lukman Ismaila,Naome Etori,Mehul Agarwal,Zhixuan Liu,Jihie Kim,Jean Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a unified evaluation framework for cultural bias in both text-to-image (T2I) generation and image-to-image (I2I) editing systems, revealing that models default to Global-North depictions, I2I editing erodes cultural fidelity, and current systems apply superficial cultural cues rather than context-aware changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work has focused on cultural bias in text-to-image systems, leaving image-to-image editors underexplored. The authors aim to bridge this gap by providing a standardized evaluation protocol for both T2I generation and I2I editing across multiple countries and eras.

Method: The study uses a unified evaluation across six countries with an 8-category/36-subcategory schema and era-aware prompts. It employs open models with fixed settings, combining automatic metrics, culture-aware retrieval-augmented VQA, and expert human judgments from native reviewers.

Result: Three key findings: (1) models default to Global-North, modern-leaning depictions under country-agnostic prompts; (2) iterative I2I editing erodes cultural fidelity despite conventional metrics remaining stable; (3) I2I models apply superficial cues rather than era-consistent, context-aware changes, often retaining source identity for Global-South targets.

Conclusion: Culture-sensitive edits remain unreliable in current generative image models. The authors provide a reproducible, culture-centered benchmark with standardized data, prompts, and evaluation protocols to help diagnose and track cultural bias in generative image models.

Abstract: Generative image models produce striking visuals yet often misrepresent
culture. Prior work has examined cultural bias mainly in text-to-image (T2I)
systems, leaving image-to-image (I2I) editors underexplored. We bridge this gap
with a unified evaluation across six countries, an 8-category/36-subcategory
schema, and era-aware prompts, auditing both T2I generation and I2I editing
under a standardized protocol that yields comparable diagnostics. Using open
models with fixed settings, we derive cross-country, cross-era, and
cross-category evaluations. Our framework combines standard automatic metrics,
a culture-aware retrieval-augmented VQA, and expert human judgments collected
from native reviewers. To enable reproducibility, we release the complete image
corpus, prompts, and configurations. Our study reveals three findings: (1)
under country-agnostic prompts, models default to Global-North, modern-leaning
depictions that flatten cross-country distinctions; (2) iterative I2I editing
erodes cultural fidelity even when conventional metrics remain flat or improve;
and (3) I2I models apply superficial cues (palette shifts, generic props)
rather than era-consistent, context-aware changes, often retaining source
identity for Global-South targets. These results highlight that
culture-sensitive edits remain unreliable in current systems. By releasing
standardized data, prompts, and human evaluation protocols, we provide a
reproducible, culture-centered benchmark for diagnosing and tracking cultural
bias in generative image models.

### [9] [Filter-Based Reconstruction of Images from Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20071)
*Bernd Pfrommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FIBAR is a simple filter-based asynchronous method for reconstructing intensity images from event camera data, running efficiently on CPU without neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing event camera image reconstruction methods typically rely on neural networks running on GPUs, which are complex and computationally expensive.

Method: Uses temporal IIR filter to integrate intensity changes from events, detects stale pixels with a novel algorithm, and applies Gaussian filtering to reduce noise.

Result: FIBAR runs at 42-140 million events/s on CPU, produces noisier reconstructions with ghost images compared to neural networks, but is sufficient for tasks like fiducial marker detection.

Conclusion: FIBAR provides a simpler, efficient CPU-based alternative to neural network methods for event camera image reconstruction, suitable for certain applications despite some quality limitations.

Abstract: Reconstructing an intensity image from the events of a moving event camera is
a challenging task that is typically approached with neural networks deployed
on graphics processing units. This paper presents a much simpler, FIlter Based
Asynchronous Reconstruction method (FIBAR). First, intensity changes signaled
by events are integrated with a temporal digital IIR filter. To reduce
reconstruction noise, stale pixels are detected by a novel algorithm that
regulates a window of recently updated pixels. Arguing that for a moving
camera, the absence of events at a pixel location likely implies a low image
gradient, stale pixels are then blurred with a Gaussian filter. In contrast to
most existing methods, FIBAR is asynchronous and permits image read-out at an
arbitrary time. It runs on a modern laptop CPU at about 42(140) million
events/s with (without) spatial filtering enabled. A few simple qualitative
experiments are presented that show the difference in image reconstruction
between FIBAR and a neural network-based approach (FireNet). FIBAR's
reconstruction is noisier than neural network-based methods and suffers from
ghost images. However, it is sufficient for certain tasks such as the detection
of fiducial markers. Code is available at

### [10] [Data-Adaptive Transformed Bilateral Tensor Low-Rank Representation for Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20077)
*Hui Chen,Xinjie Wang,Xianchao Xiu,Wanquan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TBTLRR is a novel transformed bilateral tensor low-rank representation model that learns adaptive unitary transforms for better global correlation capture, exploits bilateral structure for local correlations, and handles complex noise using ℓ₁/₂-norm and Frobenius norm regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tensor low-rank representation methods rely on fixed transformations and have poor robustness to noise, limiting their effectiveness in image clustering applications.

Method: Proposes TBTLRR with data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm via learned unitary transforms, bilateral structure for local correlations, and ℓ₁/₂-norm + Frobenius norm regularization for noise handling. Uses ADMM-based optimization with theoretical convergence guarantees.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate TBTLRR's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in clustering performance, with better noise robustness and correlation capture.

Conclusion: TBTLRR effectively addresses limitations of existing tensor low-rank representation methods by introducing adaptive transforms, bilateral structure, and robust noise handling, achieving superior clustering performance.

Abstract: Tensor low-rank representation (TLRR) has demonstrated significant success in
image clustering. However, most existing methods rely on fixed transformations
and suffer from poor robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose a novel
transformed bilateral tensor low-rank representation model called TBTLRR, which
introduces a data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm by learning arbitrary unitary
transforms, allowing for more effective capture of global correlations. In
addition, by leveraging the bilateral structure of latent tensor data, TBTLRR
is able to exploit local correlations between image samples and features.
Furthermore, TBTLRR integrates the $\ell_{1/2}$-norm and Frobenius norm
regularization terms for better dealing with complex noise in real-world
scenarios. To solve the proposed nonconvex model, we develop an efficient
optimization algorithm inspired by the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) and provide theoretical convergence. Extensive experiments
validate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in clustering. The
code will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/TBTLRR.

*Lorenzo Arboit,Dennis N. Schneider,Britty Baby,Vinkle Srivastav,Pietro Mascagni,Nicolas Padoy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Endoshare is an open-source application for standardizing and de-identifying endoscopic surgery videos to address privacy concerns and format heterogeneity in surgical video analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-based surgical assessment and data science are limited by heterogeneous recording formats and privacy concerns with video sharing, hindering widespread adoption in surgical training and quality improvement.

Method: Developed using software development life cycle with user-centered feedback, featuring privacy-by-design architecture. Tested through internal surveys (clinicians and computer scientists) and external clinician surveys using usability heuristics and Technology Acceptance Model constructs.

Result: High usability scores from initial testing (4.68/5 clinicians, 4.03/5 computer scientists) and strong recommendation scores (9.20/10) from surgeons after refinement. Processing time depends on mode, video duration, and hardware power.

Conclusion: Endoshare provides a transparent, user-friendly pipeline for standardized, privacy-preserving surgical video management, though compliance certification and broader interoperability validation are needed for deployment.

Abstract: Video-based assessment and surgical data science can advance surgical
training, research, and quality improvement. However, widespread use remains
limited by heterogeneous recording formats and privacy concerns associated with
video sharing. We present Endoshare, a source-available, cross-platform
application for merging, standardizing, and de-identifying endoscopic videos in
minimally invasive surgery. Development followed the software development life
cycle with iterative, user-centered feedback. During the analysis phase, an
internal survey of clinicians and computer scientists based on ten usability
heuristics identified key requirements that guided a privacy-by-design
architecture. In the testing phase, an external clinician survey combined the
same heuristics with Technology Acceptance Model constructs to assess usability
and adoption, complemented by benchmarking across different hardware
configurations. Four clinicians and four computer scientists initially tested
the prototype, reporting high usability (4.68 +/- 0.40/5 and 4.03 +/- 0.51/5),
with the lowest score (4.00 +/- 0.93/5) relating to label clarity. After
refinement, the testing phase surveyed ten surgeons who reported high perceived
usefulness (5.07 +/- 1.75/7), ease of use (5.15 +/- 1.71/7), heuristic
usability (4.38 +/- 0.48/5), and strong recommendation (9.20 +/- 0.79/10).
Processing time varied with processing mode, video duration (both p <= 0.001),
and machine computational power (p = 0.041). Endoshare provides a transparent,
user-friendly pipeline for standardized, privacy-preserving surgical video
management. Compliance certification and broader interoperability validation
are needed to establish it as a deployable alternative to proprietary systems.

### [12] [Attentive Convolution: Unifying the Expressivity of Self-Attention with Convolutional Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20092)
*Hao Yu,Haoyu Chen,Yan Jiang,Wei Peng,Zhaodong Sun,Samuel Kaski,Guoying Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ATConv is a novel convolutional operator that incorporates self-attention principles (adaptive routing and lateral inhibition) into CNNs, achieving better performance than SA mechanisms with only 3×3 kernels while maintaining linear complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the performance gap between CNNs and self-attention mechanisms by identifying and incorporating the key principles that give SA its advantage over traditional convolutions.

Method: Proposed Attentive Convolution (ATConv) that reformulates convolutional operator with two key principles: adaptive routing (dynamic regulation of positional information flow) and lateral inhibition (score competition to suppress redundancy).

Result: ATConv with 3×3 kernels consistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in vision tasks. AttNet achieves 84.4% ImageNet-1K accuracy with 27M parameters. In diffusion models, replacing SA with ATConv reduces FID by 0.15 with faster sampling.

Conclusion: ATConv successfully captures the intrinsic expressivity of self-attention while maintaining linear complexity, demonstrating that CNNs can be modernized to surpass SA performance through principled design.

Abstract: Self-attention (SA) has become the cornerstone of modern vision backbones for
its powerful expressivity over traditional Convolutions (Conv). However, its
quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications.
Given that Conv offers linear complexity and strong visual priors, continuing
efforts have been made to promote the renaissance of Conv. However, a
persistent performance chasm remains, highlighting that these modernizations
have not yet captured the intrinsic expressivity that defines SA. In this
paper, we re-examine the design of the CNNs, directed by a key question: what
principles give SA its edge over Conv? As a result, we reveal two fundamental
insights that challenge the long-standing design intuitions in prior research
(e.g., Receptive field). The two findings are: (1) \textit{Adaptive routing}:
SA dynamically regulates positional information flow according to semantic
content, whereas Conv employs static kernels uniformly across all positions.
(2) \textit{Lateral inhibition}: SA induces score competition among token
weighting, effectively suppressing redundancy and sharpening representations,
whereas Conv filters lack such inhibitory dynamics and exhibit considerable
redundancy. Based on this, we propose \textit{Attentive Convolution} (ATConv),
a principled reformulation of the convolutional operator that intrinsically
injects these principles. Interestingly, with only $3\times3$ kernels, ATConv
consistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in fundamental vision tasks.
Building on ATConv, we introduce AttNet, a CNN family that can attain
\textbf{84.4\%} ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters. In
diffusion-based image generation, replacing all SA with the proposed $3\times
3$ ATConv in SiT-XL/2 reduces ImageNet FID by 0.15 in 400k steps with faster
sampling. Code is available at: github.com/price112/Attentive-Convolution.

*Jiho Park,Sieun Choi,Jaeyoon Seo,Jihie Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StableSketcher is a novel framework that enhances diffusion models to generate high-quality hand-drawn sketches with better text-prompt alignment using optimized VAE decoding and a VQA-based reward function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models struggle with synthesizing pixel-based human-drawn sketches, which represent abstract expression, due to challenges in capturing sketch characteristics and maintaining text-image alignment.

Method: Fine-tune variational autoencoder for optimized latent decoding to better capture sketch characteristics; integrate a new reward function based on visual question answering for reinforcement learning to improve text-image alignment and semantic consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments show StableSketcher generates sketches with improved stylistic fidelity and better alignment with prompts compared to Stable Diffusion baseline. Also introduces SketchDUO, the first dataset with instance-level sketches paired with captions and QA pairs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses challenges in sketch generation by optimizing latent decoding and using VQA-based rewards, while also providing a valuable new dataset for future research in sketch-based AI systems.

Abstract: Although recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly enriched
the quality of generated images, challenges remain in synthesizing pixel-based
human-drawn sketches, a representative example of abstract expression. To
combat these challenges, we propose StableSketcher, a novel framework that
empowers diffusion models to generate hand-drawn sketches with high prompt
fidelity. Within this framework, we fine-tune the variational autoencoder to
optimize latent decoding, enabling it to better capture the characteristics of
sketches. In parallel, we integrate a new reward function for reinforcement
learning based on visual question answering, which improves text-image
alignment and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
StableSketcher generates sketches with improved stylistic fidelity, achieving
better alignment with prompts compared to the Stable Diffusion baseline.
Additionally, we introduce SketchDUO, to the best of our knowledge, the first
dataset comprising instance-level sketches paired with captions and
question-answer pairs, thereby addressing the limitations of existing datasets
that rely on image-label pairs. Our code and dataset will be made publicly

### [14] [BIOCAP: Exploiting Synthetic Captions Beyond Labels in Biological Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20095)
*Ziheng Zhang,Xinyue Ma,Arpita Chowdhury,Elizabeth G. Campolongo,Matthew J. Thompson,Net Zhang,Samuel Stevens,Hilmar Lapp,Tanya Berger-Wolf,Yu Su,Wei-Lun Chao,Jianyang Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces BIOCAP, a biological foundation model that uses synthetic descriptive captions generated by MLLMs to enhance multimodal learning, improving species classification and text-image retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage descriptive captions as additional supervision for biological multimodal models, addressing the challenge of obtaining instance-specific captions at scale in organismal biology.

Method: Generate synthetic captions using multimodal large language models guided by Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples, then train BIOCAP model with these captions.

Result: BIOCAP captures rich semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and text-image retrieval, demonstrating the value of descriptive captions beyond labels.

Conclusion: Descriptive captions are valuable for bridging biological images with multimodal foundation models, and synthetic caption generation enables effective utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology.

Abstract: This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of
supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions
can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a
species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions
during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure,
emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious
correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful,
instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the
utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with
many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic
captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by
Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These
domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate,
instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BIOCAP
(i.e., BIOCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich
semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and
text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive
captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation
models.

### [16] [Inverse Image-Based Rendering for Light Field Generation from Single Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20132)
*Hyunjun Jung,Hae-Gon Jeon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes inverse image-based rendering - a neural rendering method that generates light fields from single images by reconstructing light flows in space, enabling novel view synthesis without 3D reconstruction or specialized hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional light field acquisition which requires computational costs or specialized devices like bulky camera setups and microlens arrays, making light field generation more accessible from single images.

Method: Designs a neural rendering pipeline that stores light flow of source rays from input image, computes relationships through cross-attention, and predicts target ray colors. Iteratively generates novel views while updating out-of-view contents to ensure consistent generation of occluded regions.

Result: The method works well with various challenging datasets without retraining or finetuning after being trained on synthetic data, and outperforms state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.

Conclusion: Inverse image-based rendering successfully generates light fields from single images by reconstructing light flows in space, providing an effective alternative to traditional light field acquisition methods.

Abstract: A concept of light-fields computed from multiple view images on regular grids
has proven its benefit for scene representations, and supported realistic
renderings of novel views and photographic effects such as refocusing and
shallow depth of field. In spite of its effectiveness of light flow
computations, obtaining light fields requires either computational costs or
specialized devices like a bulky camera setup and a specialized microlens
array. In an effort to broaden its benefit and applicability, in this paper, we
propose a novel view synthesis method for light field generation from only
single images, named inverse image-based rendering. Unlike previous attempts to
implicitly rebuild 3D geometry or to explicitly represent objective scenes, our
method reconstructs light flows in a space from image pixels, which behaves in
the opposite way to image-based rendering. To accomplish this, we design a
neural rendering pipeline to render a target ray in an arbitrary viewpoint. Our
neural renderer first stores the light flow of source rays from the input
image, then computes the relationships among them through cross-attention, and
finally predicts the color of the target ray based on these relationships.
After the rendering pipeline generates the first novel view from a single input
image, the generated out-of-view contents are updated to the set of source
rays. This procedure is iteratively performed while ensuring the consistent
generation of occluded contents. We demonstrate that our inverse image-based
rendering works well with various challenging datasets without any retraining
or finetuning after once trained on synthetic dataset, and outperforms relevant
state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.

*Jiachen Liang,Ruibing Hou,Minyang Hu,Hong Chang,Shiguang Shan,Xilin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LogitGap is a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that leverages the gap between maximum logit and remaining logits to better separate in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing post-hoc OOD detection methods often underexploit the rich information in model logits space, leaving room for improvement in distinguishing between ID and OOD samples.

Method: Proposes LogitGap which explicitly exploits the relationship between maximum logit and remaining logits, with a training-free strategy to identify the most informative logits subset for scoring.

Result: Extensive experiments on vision-language and vision-only models show LogitGap consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks.

Conclusion: LogitGap effectively enhances OOD detection by better utilizing logit space information and provides a practical post-hoc solution with theoretical and empirical validation.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models in open-world applications. While post-hoc methods are
favored for their efficiency and ease of deployment, existing approaches often
underexploit the rich information embedded in the model's logits space. In this
paper, we propose LogitGap, a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that
explicitly exploits the relationship between the maximum logit and the
remaining logits to enhance the separability between in-distribution (ID) and
OOD samples. To further improve its effectiveness, we refine LogitGap by
focusing on a more compact and informative subset of the logit space.
Specifically, we introduce a training-free strategy that automatically
identifies the most informative logits for scoring. We provide both theoretical
analysis and empirical evidence to validate the effectiveness of our approach.
Extensive experiments on both vision-language and vision-only models
demonstrate that LogitGap consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance
across diverse OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks. Code is available at

TL;DR: PartNeXt is a new 3D dataset with 23,000+ textured models and hierarchical part annotations across 50 categories, addressing limitations of existing datasets like PartNet and enabling better part segmentation and 3D question answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D part understanding datasets like PartNet have limitations including untextured geometries and expert-dependent annotation, which restrict scalability and usability for advancing computer vision, graphics, and robotics.

Method: Created PartNeXt dataset with over 23,000 high-quality textured 3D models annotated with fine-grained hierarchical part labels across 50 categories, featuring scalable annotation and texture-aware labels.

Result: Benchmarking shows state-of-the-art methods struggle with fine-grained part segmentation, reveals gaps in 3D-LLMs for part-centric QA, and training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yields substantial improvements over PartNet.

Conclusion: PartNeXt enables new research avenues in structured 3D understanding through its scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task evaluation capabilities.

Abstract: Understanding objects at the level of their constituent parts is fundamental
to advancing computer vision, graphics, and robotics. While datasets like
PartNet have driven progress in 3D part understanding, their reliance on
untextured geometries and expert-dependent annotation limits scalability and
usability. We introduce PartNeXt, a next-generation dataset addressing these
gaps with over 23,000 high-quality, textured 3D models annotated with
fine-grained, hierarchical part labels across 50 categories. We benchmark
PartNeXt on two tasks: (1) class-agnostic part segmentation, where
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., PartField, SAMPart3D) struggle with
fine-grained and leaf-level parts, and (2) 3D part-centric question answering,
a new benchmark for 3D-LLMs that reveals significant gaps in open-vocabulary
part grounding. Additionally, training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yields substantial
gains over PartNet, underscoring the dataset's superior quality and diversity.
By combining scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task
evaluation, PartNeXt opens new avenues for research in structured 3D
understanding.

### [19] [Monocular Visual 8D Pose Estimation for Articulated Bicycles and Cyclists](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20158)
*Eduardo R. Corral-Soto,Yang Liu,Yuan Ren,Bai Dongfeng,Liu Bingbing*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an 8D pose estimation method for articulated bicycles and cyclists from single RGB images, extending beyond traditional 6D pose estimation by adding steering handle and pedal rotation parameters to better capture bicycle articulation and intended travel direction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cyclists are vulnerable road users in autonomous driving, and accurate pose estimation is critical for intention classification, behavior prediction, and collision avoidance. Traditional 6D pose estimation is insufficient for articulated bicycles because varying steering/pedal angles change the 3D bounding box and the orientation may not align with the actual travel direction determined by steering.

Method: The proposed method jointly estimates 8D pose (3D translation, 3D rotation, plus steering handle and pedal rotations) and 3D keypoints of articulated bicycles from single RGB images. It uses a mix of synthetic and real image data for training to generalize on real images.

Result: The method achieves competitive scores compared to state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators that use rigid canonical object templates, showing promising results in accurately estimating the 8D pose parameters.

Conclusion: The 8D pose estimation approach enables more fine-grained bicycle pose state and travel direction estimation, addressing limitations of rigid 6D pose methods for articulated objects like bicycles in autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: In Autonomous Driving, cyclists belong to the safety-critical class of
Vulnerable Road Users (VRU), and accurate estimation of their pose is critical
for cyclist crossing intention classification, behavior prediction, and
collision avoidance. Unlike rigid objects, articulated bicycles are composed of
movable rigid parts linked by joints and constrained by a kinematic structure.
6D pose methods can estimate the 3D rotation and translation of rigid bicycles,
but 6D becomes insufficient when the steering/pedals angles of the bicycle
vary. That is because: 1) varying the articulated pose of the bicycle causes
its 3D bounding box to vary as well, and 2) the 3D box orientation is not
necessarily aligned to the orientation of the steering which determines the
actual intended travel direction. In this work, we introduce a method for
category-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a
single RGB image. Besides being able to estimate the 3D translation and
rotation of a bicycle from a single image, our method also estimates the
rotations of its steering handles and pedals with respect to the bicycle body
frame. These two new parameters enable the estimation of a more fine-grained
bicycle pose state and travel direction. Our proposed model jointly estimates
the 8D pose and the 3D Keypoints of articulated bicycles, and trains with a mix
of synthetic and real image data to generalize on real images. We include an
evaluation section where we evaluate the accuracy of our estimated 8D pose
parameters, and our method shows promising results by achieving competitive
scores when compared against state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators
that use rigid canonical object templates for matching.

*Xudong Yan,Songhe Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel approach for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning that uses multimodal knowledge accumulation from unsupervised data to update prototypes at test time, addressing distribution shift issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CZSL methods suffer from performance degradation due to distribution shift when unseen attribute-object compositions appear at test time, requiring better adaptation to novel compositions.

Method: Proposes accumulating textual and visual knowledge from unsupervised data to update multimodal prototypes, with adaptive update weights and dynamic priority queue for storing high-confidence images. Uses multimodal collaborative representation learning to align textual and visual prototypes.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses distribution shift in CZSL by leveraging multimodal knowledge accumulation and adaptive prototype updating, demonstrating superior performance across different settings.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel
attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones.
Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution
shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen
compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge,
we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both
textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal
prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update
weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to
flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic
priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire
visual knowledge from historical images for inference. Considering the semantic
consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by
multimodal collaborative representation learning. Extensive experiments
indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four
benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings. Code will
be available at https://github.com/xud-yan/TOMCAT .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IB-GAN is a new GAN-based unsupervised model for disentangled representation learning that uses Information Bottleneck framework to constrain mutual information between input and generated output, achieving competitive disentanglement scores and better sample quality than β-VAEs and InfoGAN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve disentangled representation learning in GANs by applying Information Bottleneck framework to optimize GAN training, addressing limitations of existing methods like InfoGAN.

Method: Leverages an intermediate stochastic layer in the generator to constrain mutual information between input and output, creating a learnable latent distribution trained jointly with generator in end-to-end fashion.

Result: Achieves competitive disentanglement scores on dSprites and Color-dSprites datasets, outperforms InfoGAN, and generates samples with better visual quality and diversity (measured by FID score) on CelebA and 3D Chairs datasets compared to β-VAEs and InfoGAN.

Conclusion: IB-GAN successfully applies Information Bottleneck to GAN optimization, enabling more interpretable and disentangled latent representations while maintaining or improving sample quality over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We propose a new GAN-based unsupervised model for disentangled representation
learning. The new model is discovered in an attempt to utilize the Information
Bottleneck (IB) framework to the optimization of GAN, thereby named IB-GAN. The
architecture of IB-GAN is partially similar to that of InfoGAN but has a
critical difference; an intermediate layer of the generator is leveraged to
constrain the mutual information between the input and the generated output.
The intermediate stochastic layer can serve as a learnable latent distribution
that is trained with the generator jointly in an end-to-end fashion. As a
result, the generator of IB-GAN can harness the latent space in a disentangled
and interpretable manner. With the experiments on dSprites and Color-dSprites
dataset, we demonstrate that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores
to those of state-of-the-art \b{eta}-VAEs and outperforms InfoGAN. Moreover,
the visual quality and the diversity of samples generated by IB-GAN are often
better than those by \b{eta}-VAEs and Info-GAN in terms of FID score on CelebA
and 3D Chairs dataset.

*Yun Wang,Junjie Hu,Qiaole Dong,Yongjian Zhang,Yanwei Fu,Tin Lun Lam,Dapeng Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PPMStereo introduces a Pick-and-Play Memory module for temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video, achieving efficient long-range spatio-temporal modeling through a two-stage process that selects relevant frames and adaptively weights them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for real-world applications like AR, but existing methods face a fundamental trade-off between temporal modeling quality and computational efficiency.

Method: Proposes PPMStereo with a Pick-and-Play Memory module: 'pick' process identifies the most relevant frames, and 'play' process adaptively weights selected frames for spatio-temporal aggregation, maintaining a compact yet informative memory buffer.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and temporal consistency, with 0.62/1.11 TEPE on Sintel clean/final (17.3% & 9.02% improvements over BiDAStereo) while requiring fewer computational costs.

Conclusion: The two-stage collaborative process effectively maintains temporal consistency while being computationally efficient, demonstrating the viability of the Pick-and-Play Memory approach for dynamic stereo matching.

Abstract: Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for
real-world applications such as augmented reality, where inconsistent depth
estimation disrupts the immersion of users. Despite its importance, this task
remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal
consistency in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods attempt to
address this by aggregating spatio-temporal information but face a fundamental
trade-off: limited temporal modeling provides only modest gains, whereas
capturing long-range dependencies significantly increases computational cost.
To address this limitation, we introduce a memory buffer for modeling
long-range spatio-temporal consistency while achieving efficient dynamic stereo
matching. Inspired by the two-stage decision-making process in humans, we
propose a \textbf{P}ick-and-\textbf{P}lay \textbf{M}emory (PPM) construction
module for dynamic \textbf{Stereo} matching, dubbed as \textbf{PPMStereo}. PPM
consists of a `pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a
`play' process that weights the selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal
aggregation. This two-stage collaborative process maintains a compact yet
highly informative memory buffer while achieving temporally consistent
information aggregation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
PPMStereo, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
temporal consistency. % Notably, PPMStereo achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on the
Sintel clean/final (17.3\% \& 9.02\% improvements over BiDAStereo) with fewer
computational costs. Codes are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an evaluation protocol to benchmark text-to-video and image-to-video models as simulators of pedestrian dynamics, revealing that current models have learned effective priors for multi-agent behavior but still suffer from issues like merging and disappearing people.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation benchmarks focus on individual subjects rather than scenes with multiple interacting people, leaving the plausibility of multi-agent dynamics in generated videos unverified.

Method: Developed a rigorous evaluation protocol using start frames from established datasets for I2V comparison with ground truth, created a prompt suite for T2V to explore pedestrian densities and interactions, and introduced a method to reconstruct 2D bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters.

Result: Analysis revealed that leading models have learned surprisingly effective priors for plausible multi-agent behavior, but identified failure modes like merging and disappearing people.

Conclusion: Current video generation models show promise as implicit simulators of pedestrian dynamics but require further improvement to address specific failure modes in multi-agent interactions.

Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated high visual realism in
diverse contexts, spurring interest in their potential as general-purpose world
simulators. Existing benchmarks focus on individual subjects rather than scenes
with multiple interacting people. However, the plausibility of multi-agent
dynamics in generated videos remains unverified. We propose a rigorous
evaluation protocol to benchmark text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
models as implicit simulators of pedestrian dynamics. For I2V, we leverage
start frames from established datasets to enable comparison with a ground truth
video dataset. For T2V, we develop a prompt suite to explore diverse pedestrian
densities and interactions. A key component is a method to reconstruct 2D
bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters.
Our analysis reveals that leading models have learned surprisingly effective
priors for plausible multi-agent behavior. However, failure modes like merging
and disappearing people highlight areas for future improvement.

TL;DR: SPAN proposes continuous regression for suspicious intention analysis instead of discrete classification, modeling suspicion as a temporal process with long-term dependencies and cumulative effects using Temporal Point Process theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing discrete classification methods fail to capture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early intervention and explainability in video surveillance applications.

Method: SPAN uses continuous regression with suspicion score formula, Suspicion Coefficient Modulation using multimodal information, and Concept-Anchored Mapping to link actions to intention concepts.

Result: SPAN reduces MSE by 19.8% and improves average mAP by 1.78% on HAI dataset, with 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating superior ability to capture subtle behavioral changes.

Conclusion: Continuous suspicion modeling enables earlier detection and proactive intervention, greatly enhancing system explainability and practical utility in security applications compared to discrete classification systems.

Abstract: Temporal Intention Localization (TIL) is crucial for video surveillance,
focusing on identifying varying levels of suspicious intentions to improve
security monitoring. However, existing discrete classification methods fail to
capture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early
intervention and explainability. In this paper, we propose the Suspicion
Progression Analysis Network (SPAN), which shifts from discrete classification
to continuous regression, enabling the capture of fluctuating and evolving
suspicious intentions. We reveal that suspicion exhibits long-term dependencies
and cumulative effects, similar to Temporal Point Process (TPP) theory. Based
on these insights, we define a suspicion score formula that models continuous
changes while accounting for temporal characteristics. We also introduce
Suspicion Coefficient Modulation, which adjusts suspicion coefficients using
multimodal information to reflect the varying impacts of suspicious actions.
Additionally, the Concept-Anchored Mapping method is proposed to link
suspicious actions to predefined intention concepts, offering insights into
both the actions and their potential underlying intentions. Extensive
experiments on the HAI dataset show that SPAN significantly outperforms
existing methods, reducing MSE by 19.8% and improving average mAP by 1.78%.
Notably, SPAN achieves a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating
its superior ability to capture subtle behavioral changes. Compared to discrete
classification systems, our continuous suspicion modeling approach enables
earlier detection and proactive intervention, greatly enhancing system
explainability and practical utility in security applications.

TL;DR: Analysis of 54 public brain MRI datasets shows significant data imbalances and heterogeneity that persist despite preprocessing, requiring domain-adaptive approaches for foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models for brain MRI need large, diverse data, but systematic assessments of public datasets' scale, diversity, and consistency are lacking.

Method: Multi-level analysis: dataset-level characterization of modality/disease/scale; image-level quantification of voxel properties; evaluation of preprocessing effects; feature-space case study with 3D DenseNet121.

Result: Found strong imbalances between healthy and clinical populations, substantial heterogeneity in imaging properties, residual differences after preprocessing, and measurable covariate shift despite harmonization.

Conclusion: Public brain MRI resources have persistent variability that preprocessing alone cannot eliminate, requiring preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies for generalizable foundation models.

Abstract: The development of foundation models for brain MRI depends critically on the
scale, diversity, and consistency of available data, yet systematic assessments
of these factors remain scarce. In this study, we analyze 54 publicly
accessible brain MRI datasets encompassing over 538,031 to provide a
structured, multi-level overview tailored to foundation model development. At
the dataset level, we characterize modality composition, disease coverage, and
dataset scale, revealing strong imbalances between large healthy cohorts and
smaller clinical populations. At the image level, we quantify voxel spacing,
orientation, and intensity distributions across 15 representative datasets,
demonstrating substantial heterogeneity that can influence representation
learning. We then perform a quantitative evaluation of preprocessing
variability, examining how intensity normalization, bias field correction,
skull stripping, spatial registration, and interpolation alter voxel statistics
and geometry. While these steps improve within-dataset consistency, residual
differences persist between datasets. Finally, feature-space case study using a
3D DenseNet121 shows measurable residual covariate shift after standardized
preprocessing, confirming that harmonization alone cannot eliminate
inter-dataset bias. Together, these analyses provide a unified characterization
of variability in public brain MRI resources and emphasize the need for
preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies in the design of
generalizable brain MRI foundation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAPO++ is a cross-stage prompt optimization framework for text-to-video generation that enhances user prompts through retrieval-augmented refinement, test-time iterative scaling, and LLM fine-tuning, achieving significant improvements in video quality without modifying the underlying generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User-provided prompts for text-to-video generation are often short, unstructured, and misaligned with training data, limiting the potential of diffusion-based T2V models. There's a need to bridge this gap between user prompts and model training distributions.

Method: Three-stage framework: Stage 1 uses retrieval-augmented prompt optimization to enrich prompts with relevant modifiers and refactor them to match training distributions. Stage 2 employs sample-specific prompt optimization with multi-source feedback (semantic alignment, spatial fidelity, temporal coherence, optical flow). Stage 3 fine-tunes LLMs using optimized prompt pairs to internalize optimization patterns.

Result: Extensive experiments across five state-of-the-art T2V models and five benchmarks show significant gains in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning, temporal stability, and physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods by large margins.

Conclusion: RAPO++ is a model-agnostic, cost-efficient, and scalable solution that sets a new standard for prompt optimization in T2V generation, enabling high-quality video generation without modifying the underlying generative backbone.

Abstract: Prompt design plays a crucial role in text-to-video (T2V) generation, yet
user-provided prompts are often short, unstructured, and misaligned with
training data, limiting the generative potential of diffusion-based T2V models.
We present \textbf{RAPO++}, a cross-stage prompt optimization framework that
unifies training-data--aligned refinement, test-time iterative scaling, and
large language model (LLM) fine-tuning to substantially improve T2V generation
without modifying the underlying generative backbone. In \textbf{Stage 1},
Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization (RAPO) enriches user prompts with
semantically relevant modifiers retrieved from a relation graph and refactors
them to match training distributions, enhancing compositionality and
multi-object fidelity. \textbf{Stage 2} introduces Sample-Specific Prompt
Optimization (SSPO), a closed-loop mechanism that iteratively refines prompts
using multi-source feedback -- including semantic alignment, spatial fidelity,
temporal coherence, and task-specific signals such as optical flow -- yielding
progressively improved video generation quality. \textbf{Stage 3} leverages
optimized prompt pairs from SSPO to fine-tune the rewriter LLM, internalizing
task-specific optimization patterns and enabling efficient, high-quality prompt
generation even before inference. Extensive experiments across five
state-of-the-art T2V models and five benchmarks demonstrate that RAPO++
achieves significant gains in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning,
temporal stability, and physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods
by large margins. Our results highlight RAPO++ as a model-agnostic,

TL;DR: FlowCycle is a novel text-to-image editing framework that creates target-aware intermediate states through learnable noise optimization and cycle-consistent training, enabling better editing quality and consistency compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image editing methods use target-agnostic intermediate states that focus on source reconstruction but neglect semantic gaps to the editing target, leading to limited editability and inconsistency when modifications deviate substantially from the source.

Method: FlowCycle parameterizes corruption with learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process with dual consistency constraints, iteratively editing source to target and recovering back to source to produce target-aware intermediate states.

Result: Extensive ablations demonstrate that FlowCycle achieves superior editing quality and consistency over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed target-aware intermediate state approach through cycle-consistent optimization enables faithful modifications while preserving source consistency in text-to-image editing.

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained text-to-image flow models have enabled
remarkable progress in text-based image editing. Mainstream approaches always
adopt a corruption-then-restoration paradigm, where the source image is first
corrupted into an ``intermediate state'' and then restored to the target image
under the prompt guidance. However, current methods construct this intermediate
state in a target-agnostic manner, i.e., they primarily focus on realizing
source image reconstruction while neglecting the semantic gaps towards the
specific editing target. This design inherently results in limited editability
or inconsistency when the desired modifications substantially deviate from the
source. In this paper, we argue that the intermediate state should be
target-aware, i.e., selectively corrupting editing-relevant contents while
preserving editing-irrelevant ones. To this end, we propose FlowCycle, a novel
inversion-free and flow-based editing framework that parameterizes corruption
with learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process. By
iteratively editing the source to the target and recovering back to the source
with dual consistency constraints, FlowCycle learns to produce a target-aware
intermediate state, enabling faithful modifications while preserving source
consistency. Extensive ablations have demonstrated that FlowCycle achieves
superior editing quality and consistency over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: CURL is a self-supervised contrastive learning framework for detecting fetal movements from ultrasound videos, achieving 78.01% sensitivity and 81.60% AUROC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fetal movement detection methods like maternal perception and CTG are subjective and inaccurate, creating a need for objective and reliable automated detection systems.

Method: Uses dual-contrastive loss with spatial and temporal contrastive learning, task-specific sampling strategy, and probabilistic fine-tuning for flexible inference on long recordings.

Result: Achieved 78.01% sensitivity and 81.60% AUROC on a dataset of 92 subjects with 30-minute ultrasound sessions each.

Conclusion: CURL demonstrates the potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for reliable fetal movement analysis, enabling improved prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Accurate fetal movement (FM) detection is essential for assessing prenatal
health, as abnormal movement patterns can indicate underlying complications
such as placental dysfunction or fetal distress. Traditional methods, including
maternal perception and cardiotocography (CTG), suffer from subjectivity and
limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Contrastive
Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised
learning framework for FM detection from extended fetal ultrasound video
recordings. Our approach leverages a dual-contrastive loss, incorporating both
spatial and temporal contrastive learning, to learn robust motion
representations. Additionally, we introduce a task-specific sampling strategy,
ensuring the effective separation of movement and non-movement segments during
self-supervised training, while enabling flexible inference on arbitrarily long
ultrasound recordings through a probabilistic fine-tuning approach. Evaluated
on an in-house dataset of 92 subjects, each with 30-minute ultrasound sessions,
CURL achieves a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60%, demonstrating its
potential for reliable and objective FM analysis. These results highlight the
potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for fetal movement analysis,
paving the way for improved prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.

*Jiahuan Wang,Yuxin Chen,Jun Yu,Guangming Lu,Wenjie Pei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EditInfinity adapts VQ-based generative models for text-driven image editing, addressing diffusion model limitations by enabling precise image inversion through quantized representations and holistic smoothing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based image editing methods suffer from approximation errors in image inversion due to lack of exact supervision in intermediate generative steps, limiting editing performance.

Method: Proposes EditInfinity which adapts Infinity (binary-quantized generative model) with efficient image inversion mechanism using text prompting rectification and style preservation, plus holistic smoothing strategy.

Result: Extensive experiments on PIE-Bench benchmark across add, change, and delete operations show superior performance compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based baselines.

Conclusion: VQ-based generative models with precise quantized representations enable more effective supervision for image inversion, leading to better text-driven image editing with high fidelity and semantic alignment.

Abstract: Adapting pretrained diffusion-based generative models for text-driven image
editing with negligible tuning overhead has demonstrated remarkable potential.
A classical adaptation paradigm, as followed by these methods, first infers the
generative trajectory inversely for a given source image by image inversion,
then performs image editing along the inferred trajectory guided by the target
text prompts. However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by
the approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models,
which arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate
generative steps. To circumvent this issue, we investigate the
parameter-efficient adaptation of VQ-based generative models for image editing,
and leverage their inherent characteristic that the exact intermediate
quantized representations of a source image are attainable, enabling more
effective supervision for precise image inversion. Specifically, we propose
\emph{EditInfinity}, which adapts \emph{Infinity}, a binary-quantized
generative model, for image editing. We propose an efficient yet effective
image inversion mechanism that integrates text prompting rectification and
image style preservation, enabling precise image inversion. Furthermore, we
devise a holistic smoothing strategy which allows our \emph{EditInfinity} to
perform image editing with high fidelity to source images and precise semantic
alignment to the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark
across "add", "change", and "delete" editing operations, demonstrate the
superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based
baselines. Code available at: https://github.com/yx-chen-ust/EditInfinity.

### [30] [Why LVLMs Are More Prone to Hallucinations in Longer Responses: The Role of Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20229)
*Ge Zheng,Jiaye Qian,Jiajin Tang,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel "induce-detect-suppress" framework to address hallucination issues in Large Vision-Language Models, particularly in longer responses, by identifying context reliance as the root cause rather than response length itself.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models suffer from hallucination issues that worsen in longer responses, traditionally attributed to accumulated uncertainties. The paper investigates whether this is truly due to length or a deeper mechanism involving context reliance.

Method: The authors propose an "induce-detect-suppress" framework that: 1) actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed contexts, 2) leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases, and 3) suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual decoding.

Result: The approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all benchmarks, demonstrating strong detection capabilities and improved hallucination mitigation.

Conclusion: The study validates that hallucination risk in longer responses stems from increased context reliance rather than length itself, providing new insights and serving as a foundational step for deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent
years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more
hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated
uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result
solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism?
After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the
risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased
reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses.
Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress"
framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed
contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases,
and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual
decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all
benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved
hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly,
re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance
gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step
toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.

TL;DR: COS3D is a collaborative prompt-segmentation framework for open-vocabulary 3D segmentation that integrates language and segmentation cues through a collaborative field with instance and language components, using novel feature mapping and two-stage training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Gaussian-splatting-based methods either rely on a single 3D language field leading to inferior segmentation, or on pre-computed class-agnostic segmentations suffering from error accumulation, requiring better integration of language and segmentation capabilities.

Method: COS3D introduces a collaborative field with instance and language fields, uses instance-to-language feature mapping, implements a two-stage training strategy, and designs adaptive language-to-instance prompt refinement during inference.

Result: COS3D achieves leading performance over existing methods on two widely-used benchmarks and demonstrates high potential for various applications including novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical segmentation, and robotics.

Conclusion: The proposed collaborative prompt-segmentation framework effectively integrates complementary language and segmentation cues, overcoming limitations of existing methods and enabling high-quality open-vocabulary 3D segmentation with broad application potential.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging task,
requiring a mutual understanding of both segmentation and language. However,
existing Gaussian-splatting-based methods rely either on a single 3D language
field, leading to inferior segmentation, or on pre-computed class-agnostic
segmentations, suffering from error accumulation. To address these limitations,
we present COS3D, a new collaborative prompt-segmentation framework that
contributes to effectively integrating complementary language and segmentation
cues throughout its entire pipeline. We first introduce the new concept of
collaborative field, comprising an instance field and a language field, as the
cornerstone for collaboration. During training, to effectively construct the
collaborative field, our key idea is to capture the intrinsic relationship
between the instance field and language field, through a novel
instance-to-language feature mapping and designing an efficient two-stage
training strategy. During inference, to bridge distinct characteristics of the
two fields, we further design an adaptive language-to-instance prompt
refinement, promoting high-quality prompt-segmentation inference. Extensive
experiments not only demonstrate COS3D's leading performance over existing
methods on two widely-used benchmarks but also show its high potential to
various applications,~\ie, novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical
segmentation, and robotics. The code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualGround is a dual-branch architecture for Video Temporal Grounding that separates global and local semantics by routing [EOS] tokens through sentence-level paths and clustering word tokens into phrase-level units, achieving state-of-the-art performance on VTG tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VTG approaches treat all text tokens uniformly during crossmodal attention, disregarding their distinct semantic roles. Controlled experiments show VTG models overly rely on [EOS]-driven global semantics while failing to effectively utilize word-level signals, limiting fine-grained temporal alignment.

Method: Proposes DualGround with: (1) token-role-aware cross-modal interaction strategies that align video features with sentence-level and phrase-level semantics in structurally disentangled manner, (2) joint modeling framework that improves global sentence-level alignment and enhances fine-grained temporal grounding using structured phrase-aware context.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across QVHighlights and Charades-STA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Disentangled semantic modeling in video-language alignment is effective, allowing models to capture both coarse and localized semantics for more expressive and context-aware video grounding.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize temporal segments in long,
untrimmed videos that align with a given natural language query. This task
typically comprises two subtasks: Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection
(HD). While recent advances have been progressed by powerful pretrained
vision-language models such as CLIP and InternVideo2, existing approaches
commonly treat all text tokens uniformly during crossmodal attention,
disregarding their distinct semantic roles. To validate the limitations of this
approach, we conduct controlled experiments demonstrating that VTG models
overly rely on [EOS]-driven global semantics while failing to effectively
utilize word-level signals, which limits their ability to achieve fine-grained
temporal alignment. Motivated by this limitation, we propose DualGround, a
dual-branch architecture that explicitly separates global and local semantics
by routing the [EOS] token through a sentence-level path and clustering word
tokens into phrase-level units for localized grounding. Our method introduces
(1) tokenrole- aware cross modal interaction strategies that align video
features with sentence-level and phrase-level semantics in a structurally
disentangled manner, and (2) a joint modeling framework that not only improves
global sentence-level alignment but also enhances finegrained temporal
grounding by leveraging structured phrase-aware context. This design allows the
model to capture both coarse and localized semantics, enabling more expressive
and context-aware video grounding. DualGround achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across
QVHighlights and Charades- STA benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
disentangled semantic modeling in video-language alignment.

TL;DR: EDGeo proposes mask-based positional encoding and context enhancement for cross-view object geo-localization, achieving 3.39% accuracy improvement over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use keypoint-based positional encoding that only captures 2D coordinates and neglects object shape information, making them sensitive to annotation shifts and limiting cross-view matching capability.

Method: Proposes mask-based positional encoding (MPE) that uses segmentation masks to capture both spatial coordinates and object silhouettes, plus a context enhancement module (CEM) with horizontal/vertical strip convolutional kernels for long-range contextual features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CVOGL and VIGOR-Building datasets with 3.39% improvement in localization accuracy under challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios.

Conclusion: Provides a robust positional encoding paradigm and contextual modeling framework that advances cross-view geo-localization research by upgrading models from "location-aware" to "object-aware".

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization enables high-precision object localization
through cross-view matching, with critical applications in autonomous driving,
urban management, and disaster response. However, existing methods rely on
keypoint-based positional encoding, which captures only 2D coordinates while
neglecting object shape information, resulting in sensitivity to annotation
shifts and limited cross-view matching capability. To address these
limitations, we propose a mask-based positional encoding scheme that leverages
segmentation masks to capture both spatial coordinates and object silhouettes,
thereby upgrading the model from "location-aware" to "object-aware."
Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of large-span objects (e.g., elongated
buildings) in satellite imagery, we design a context enhancement module. This
module employs horizontal and vertical strip convolutional kernels to extract
long-range contextual features, enhancing feature discrimination among
strip-like objects. Integrating MPE and CEM, we present EDGeo, an end-to-end
framework for robust cross-view object geo-localization. Extensive experiments
on two public datasets (CVOGL and VIGOR-Building) demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 3.39% improvement in localization
accuracy under challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios. This work provides a
robust positional encoding paradigm and a contextual modeling framework for
advancing cross-view geo-localization research.

Abstract: The realization of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates
Embodied AI agents capable of robust spatial perception, effective task

large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for embodied tasks
suffer from key limitations, including a significant gap between model design

TL;DR: CMC addresses multimodal emotion recognition challenges by using pseudo labels for unimodal pretraining and parameter-free fusion to mitigate text dominance and handle semantic inconsistencies across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MER approaches neglect semantic inconsistencies across modalities and are often dominated by text modality due to its strong representational capacity, compromising recognition accuracy.

Method: Proposes Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC) with Pseudo Label Generation Module for self-supervised unimodal pretraining, Parameter-free Fusion Module, and Multimodal Consensus Router for multimodal finetuning.

Result: CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods across four datasets (CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI) and shows notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies.

Conclusion: CMC effectively mitigates text dominance and guides fusion toward reliable consensus, demonstrating strong performance especially in handling semantic inconsistencies across modalities.

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made substantial
progress. Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic
inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional
cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often
dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity,
which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we
propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a
Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels,
enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a
Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for
multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion
process toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that
CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods
across four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and
exhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on

TL;DR: ALICE-LRI is a sensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from spinning LiDAR point clouds by automatically reverse-engineering intrinsic sensor geometry without requiring manufacturer metadata.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional LiDAR projection methods suffer from geometric inconsistencies causing irreversible information loss, compromising high-fidelity applications that require complete geometric preservation.

Method: Automatically reverse-engineers intrinsic geometry of any spinning LiDAR sensor by inferring critical parameters including laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam calibration corrections.

Result: Achieves perfect point preservation with zero points lost across all point clouds in KITTI and DurLAR datasets, maintains geometric accuracy within sensor precision limits, and demonstrates real-time performance with substantial downstream benefits in compression applications.

Conclusion: This paradigm shift from approximate to lossless LiDAR projections opens new possibilities for high-precision remote sensing applications requiring complete geometric preservation.

Abstract: 3D LiDAR sensors are essential for autonomous navigation, environmental
monitoring, and precision mapping in remote sensing applications. To
efficiently process the massive point clouds generated by these sensors, LiDAR
data is often projected into 2D range images that organize points by their
angular positions and distances. While these range image representations enable
efficient processing, conventional projection methods suffer from fundamental
geometric inconsistencies that cause irreversible information loss,
compromising high-fidelity applications. We present ALICE-LRI (Automatic LiDAR
Intrinsic Calibration Estimation for Lossless Range Images), the first general,
sensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from
spinning LiDAR point clouds without requiring manufacturer metadata or
calibration files. Our algorithm automatically reverse-engineers the intrinsic
geometry of any spinning LiDAR sensor by inferring critical parameters
including laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam
calibration corrections, enabling lossless projection and complete point cloud
reconstruction with zero point loss. Comprehensive evaluation across the
complete KITTI and DurLAR datasets demonstrates that ALICE-LRI achieves perfect
point preservation, with zero points lost across all point clouds. Geometric
accuracy is maintained well within sensor precision limits, establishing
geometric losslessness with real-time performance. We also present a
compression case study that validates substantial downstream benefits,
demonstrating significant quality improvements in practical applications. This
paradigm shift from approximate to lossless LiDAR projections opens new
possibilities for high-precision remote sensing applications requiring complete
geometric preservation.

TL;DR: GMFVAD is a video anomaly detection method that uses fine-grained multi-modal features to reduce redundancy in visual features by incorporating text captions to highlight important video content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous VAD methods either use only visual features or incorporate text features coarsely, overlooking redundant information in video snippets. The authors aim to leverage multi-modal diversity to refine features and reduce redundancy.

Method: Generate fine-grained multi-modal features by summarizing video snippet content and incorporating text features from video captions to enhance visual features of highlighted portions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four main datasets. Ablation experiments confirm that the improvement comes from reducing redundant information.

Conclusion: Fine-grained multi-modal feature integration effectively reduces redundancy in video anomaly detection, leading to superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous
frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the
spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are
abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce
multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video
anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into
video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of
redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we
propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further
refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and
we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD).
Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video
snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the
captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual
features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation
experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the

*Jiayi Zou,Gengyun Jia,Bing-Kun Bao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VCR-OOD datasets to evaluate model generalization and proposes a debiasing method using backdoor adjustment to address co-occurrence and statistical biases in Visual Commonsense Reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VCR methods achieve high accuracy but overlook dataset biases and lack debiasing strategies, particularly co-occurrence and statistical biases in both textual and visual data.

Method: Created VCR-OOD datasets (VCR-OOD-QA and VCR-OOD-VA) for evaluation, analyzed causal graphs and prediction shortcuts, and adopted backdoor adjustment method with a dictionary based on correct answers to eliminate prediction shortcuts.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed debiasing method across different datasets.

Conclusion: The introduced debiasing approach successfully addresses biases in VCR and improves model generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) refers to answering questions and
providing explanations based on images. While existing methods achieve high
prediction accuracy, they often overlook bias in datasets and lack debiasing
strategies. In this paper, our analysis reveals co-occurrence and statistical
biases in both textual and visual data. We introduce the VCR-OOD datasets,
comprising VCR-OOD-QA and VCR-OOD-VA subsets, which are designed to evaluate
the generalization capabilities of models across two modalities. Furthermore,
we analyze the causal graphs and prediction shortcuts in VCR and adopt a
backdoor adjustment method to remove bias. Specifically, we create a dictionary
based on the set of correct answers to eliminate prediction shortcuts.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our debiasing method across
different datasets.

*Haodong Yang,Zhongling Huang,Shaojie Guo,Zhe Zhang,Gong Cheng,Junwei Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KINN is a lightweight neural network framework that resolves the representation trilemma in CV-SAR image recognition by integrating physical priors through a compression-aggregation-compression architecture, achieving state-of-the-art performance with exceptional generalization, interpretability, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for CV-SAR image recognition face a representation trilemma where generalization, interpretability, and efficiency conflict, especially under data-limited and domain-shift scenarios. The rich electromagnetic scattering features in CV-SAR data are insufficiently utilized by conventional data-driven models.

Method: KINN uses a 'compression-aggregation-compression' architecture: (1) physics-guided compression with a dictionary processor that embeds physical priors, (2) aggregation module to enrich representations, and (3) semantic compression with a compact classification head using self-distillation. Implemented in both CNN (0.7M) and Vision Transformer (0.95M) variants.

Result: Extensive evaluations on five SAR benchmarks show KINN establishes state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient recognition, offering exceptional generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution scenarios, along with tangible interpretability.

Conclusion: KINN provides an effective solution to the representation trilemma and offers a new path for trustworthy AI in SAR image analysis by successfully integrating physical knowledge into lightweight neural networks.

Abstract: Deep learning models for complex-valued Synthetic Aperture Radar (CV-SAR)
image recognition are fundamentally constrained by a representation trilemma
under data-limited and domain-shift scenarios: the concurrent, yet conflicting,
optimization of generalization, interpretability, and efficiency. Our work is
motivated by the premise that the rich electromagnetic scattering features
inherent in CV-SAR data hold the key to resolving this trilemma, yet they are
insufficiently harnessed by conventional data-driven models. To this end, we
introduce the Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN), a lightweight framework
built upon a novel "compression-aggregation-compression" architecture. The
first stage performs a physics-guided compression, wherein a novel dictionary
processor adaptively embeds physical priors, enabling a compact unfolding
network to efficiently extract sparse, physically-grounded signatures. A
subsequent aggregation module enriches these representations, followed by a
final semantic compression stage that utilizes a compact classification head
with self-distillation to learn maximally task-relevant and discriminative
embeddings. We instantiate KINN in both CNN (0.7M) and Vision Transformer
(0.95M) variants. Extensive evaluations on five SAR benchmarks confirm that
KINN establishes a state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient recognition,
offering exceptional generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution
scenarios and tangible interpretability, thereby providing an effective
solution to the representation trilemma and offering a new path for trustworthy
AI in SAR image analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods ignore unique challenges of first-person perspective in egocentric videos, such as understanding multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions.

Method: Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction (DMC³) with counterfactual sample construction module (event description paraphrasing for text, core interaction mining for vision) and contrastive optimization to minimize distance to positive samples while maximizing distance to negative samples.

Result: Achieves 52.51% on normal split and 46.04% on indirect split of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2% on QAEGO4D, reaching state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed DMC³ framework effectively addresses first-person perspective challenges in Egocentric VideoQA through counterfactual sample construction and contrastive optimization, achieving superior performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Egocentric Video Question Answering (Egocentric VideoQA) plays an important
role in egocentric video understanding, which refers to answering questions
based on first-person videos. Although existing methods have made progress
through the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning, they ignore the unique
challenges posed by the first-person perspective, such as understanding
multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions. To deal with these
challenges, we propose a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction
(DMC$^3$) framework, which contains an egocentric videoqa baseline, a
counterfactual sample construction module and a counterfactual sample-involved
contrastive optimization. Specifically, We first develop a counterfactual
sample construction module to generate positive and negative samples for
textual and visual modalities through event description paraphrasing and core
interaction mining, respectively. Then, We feed these samples together with the
original samples into the baseline. Finally, in the counterfactual
sample-involved contrastive optimization module, we apply contrastive loss to
minimize the distance between the original sample features and the positive
sample features, while maximizing the distance from the negative samples.
Experiments show that our method achieve 52.51\% and 46.04\% on the
\textit{normal} and \textit{indirect} splits of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2\% on
QAEGO4D, both reaching the state-of-the-art performance.

Result: UI-Ins-7B and UI-Ins-32B achieve state-of-the-art results: 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on ScreenSpot-Pro, 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. UI-Ins-7B achieves 74.1% success rate on AndroidWorld. Models demonstrate emergent reasoning and selective instruction composition.

Conclusion: The Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm effectively treats instructions as dynamic analytical pathways, enabling models to select optimal reasoning pathways. The approach mitigates policy collapse in SFT+RL framework and demonstrates strong agentic potential for GUI interaction tasks.

Abstract: GUI grounding, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable UI
elements, is a core capability of GUI agents. Prior works largely treats
instructions as a static proxy for user intent, overlooking the impact of
instruction diversity and quality on grounding performance. Through a careful
investigation of existing grounding datasets, we find a 23.3% flaw rate in
their instructions and show that inference-time exploitation of instruction
diversity yields up to a substantial 76% relative performance improvement. In
this paper, we introduce the Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm, treating
instructions as dynamic analytical pathways that offer distinct perspectives
and enabling the model to select the most effective pathway during reasoning.
To achieve this, we propose a two-stage training framework: supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on synthesized, diverse instructions to instill
multi-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to
optimize pathway selection and composition. Our resulting models, UI-Ins-7B and
UI-Ins-32B, achieve state-of-the-art results on five challenging grounding
benchmarks and exhibit emergent reasoning, selectively composing and
synthesizing novel instruction pathways at inference. In particular, UI-Ins-32B
attains the best grounding accuracy, scoring 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on
ScreenSpot-Pro, and 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. Furthermore, our model
demonstrates strong agentic potential, achieving a 74.1% success rate on
AndroidWorld using UI-Ins-7B as the executor. Our in-depth analysis reveals
additional insights such as how reasoning can be formulated to enhance rather
than hinder grounding performance, and how our method mitigates policy collapse
in the SFT+RL framework. All code and model checkpoints will be publicly
released in https://github.com/alibaba/UI-Ins.

*Zelin Peng,Zhengqin Xu,Qingyang Liu,Xiaokang Yang,Wei Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperET is an efficient training paradigm for multi-modal large language models that uses hyperbolic space to align visual and textual representations at arbitrary granularity levels, achieving significant improvements with minimal parameter overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs require massive computational resources due to vision encoders like CLIP and SAM lacking proper alignment with language at multi-granularity levels, creating inefficiency in cross-modal understanding.

Method: Leverages hyperbolic space to model hierarchical levels and bridge the granularity gap between visual and textual modalities. Uses dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment and learnable matrices with Möbius multiplication operations implemented through three configurations: diagonal scaling matrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show HyperET consistently improves both existing pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs with less than 1% additional parameters across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: HyperET provides an efficient and flexible parametrization strategy that effectively addresses the granularity alignment problem in MLLMs while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a transformative
approach for aligning visual and textual understanding. They typically require
extremely high computational resources (e.g., thousands of GPUs) for training
to achieve cross-modal alignment at multi-granularity levels. We argue that a
key source of this inefficiency lies in the vision encoders they widely equip
with, e.g., CLIP and SAM, which lack the alignment with language at
multi-granularity levels. To address this issue, in this paper, we leverage
hyperbolic space, which inherently models hierarchical levels and thus provides
a principled framework for bridging the granularity gap between visual and
textual modalities at an arbitrary granularity level. Concretely, we propose an
efficient training paradigm for MLLMs, dubbed as HyperET, which can optimize
visual representations to align with their textual counterparts at an arbitrary
granularity level through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic
space. HyperET employs learnable matrices with M\"{o}bius multiplication
operations, implemented via three effective configurations: diagonal scaling
matrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices, providing a flexible
yet efficient parametrization strategy. Comprehensive experiments across
multiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that HyperET consistently improves both
existing pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs clearly with less than 1\%
additional parameters.

TL;DR: AnyPcc introduces a universal point cloud compression framework with a Universal Context Model for robust contextual dependencies and Instance-Adaptive Fine-Tuning to handle out-of-distribution data, achieving state-of-the-art performance across 15 diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the generalization challenge in deep learning-based point cloud geometry compression caused by lack of robust context models and inefficient handling of out-of-distribution data.

Method: 1) Universal Context Model leveraging spatial and channel-wise grouping priors; 2) Instance-Adaptive Fine-Tuning (IAFT) that fine-tunes a small subset of network weights per instance and includes them in the bitstream.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art in point cloud compression across 15 diverse datasets, with the marginal bit cost of fine-tuned weights being dwarfed by geometry compression savings.

Conclusion: AnyPcc provides an effective universal framework for point cloud compression that overcomes generalization limitations through robust context modeling and adaptive fine-tuning strategies.

Abstract: Generalization remains a critical challenge for deep learning-based point
cloud geometry compression. We argue this stems from two key limitations: the
lack of robust context models and the inefficient handling of
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To address both, we introduce AnyPcc, a
universal point cloud compression framework. AnyPcc first employs a Universal
Context Model that leverages priors from both spatial and channel-wise grouping
to capture robust contextual dependencies. Second, our novel Instance-Adaptive
Fine-Tuning (IAFT) strategy tackles OOD data by synergizing explicit and
implicit compression paradigms. It fine-tunes a small subset of network weights
for each instance and incorporates them into the bitstream, where the marginal
bit cost of the weights is dwarfed by the resulting savings in geometry
compression. Extensive experiments on a benchmark of 15 diverse datasets
confirm that AnyPcc sets a new state-of-the-art in point cloud compression. Our
code and datasets will be released to encourage reproducible research.

*Seunghoon Lee,Jeongwoo Choi,Byunggwan Son,Jaehyeon Moon,Jeimin Jeon,Bumsub Ham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AccuQuant is a novel post-training quantization method for diffusion models that addresses error accumulation across denoising steps by minimizing discrepancies between full-precision and quantized models over multiple steps, with efficient O(1) memory implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization errors in diffusion models accumulate over denoising steps during sampling, degrading performance. Previous approaches treated each step independently, failing to account for this error accumulation problem.

Method: AccuQuant minimizes discrepancies between full-precision and quantized diffusion models across multiple denoising steps, explicitly simulating the sampling process for quantization. It uses an efficient implementation that reduces memory complexity from O(n) to O(1) with a novel objective.

Result: The method demonstrates efficacy and efficiency across various tasks and diffusion models on standard benchmarks, successfully addressing the error accumulation problem.

Conclusion: AccuQuant provides an effective solution for quantizing diffusion models by accounting for error accumulation across denoising steps, offering both performance improvements and memory efficiency.

Abstract: We present in this paper a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) method,
dubbed AccuQuant, for diffusion models. We show analytically and empirically
that quantization errors for diffusion models are accumulated over denoising
steps in a sampling process. To alleviate the error accumulation problem,
AccuQuant minimizes the discrepancies between outputs of a full-precision
diffusion model and its quantized version within a couple of denoising steps.
That is, it simulates multiple denoising steps of a diffusion sampling process
explicitly for quantization, accounting the accumulated errors over multiple
denoising steps, which is in contrast to previous approaches to imitating a
training process of diffusion models, namely, minimizing the discrepancies
independently for each step. We also present an efficient implementation
technique for AccuQuant, together with a novel objective, which reduces a
memory complexity significantly from $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$,
where $n$ is the number of denoising steps. We demonstrate the efficacy and
efficiency of AccuQuant across various tasks and diffusion models on standard
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PE-Field, a 3D positional encoding field that enhances Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for better 3D reasoning and spatial control, achieving SOTA in novel view synthesis and spatial image editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors discovered that DiTs rely heavily on positional encodings for spatial coherence, and patch tokens exhibit surprising independence. This motivated extending positional encodings from 2D to 3D for better geometric modeling.

Method: Proposed Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field) that extends positional encodings to a structured 3D field with depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for sub-patch control.

Result: PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-image novel view synthesis and generalizes to controllable spatial image editing.

Conclusion: Extending positional encodings to 3D fields enables DiTs to better model geometry and spatial relationships, improving performance on 3D tasks while maintaining strong 2D capabilities.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for
visual generation, powering state-of-the-art image and video models. By
representing images as patch tokens with positional encodings (PEs), DiTs
combine Transformer scalability with spatial and temporal inductive biases. In
this work, we revisit how DiTs organize visual content and discover that patch
tokens exhibit a surprising degree of independence: even when PEs are
perturbed, DiTs still produce globally coherent outputs, indicating that
spatial coherence is primarily governed by PEs. Motivated by this finding, we
introduce the Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field), which extends positional
encodings from the 2D plane to a structured 3D field. PE-Field incorporates
depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for
fine-grained sub-patch control, enabling DiTs to model geometry directly in 3D
space. Our PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on
single-image novel view synthesis and generalizes to controllable spatial image
editing.

### [51] [Mitigating Cross-modal Representation Bias for Multicultural Image-to-Recipe Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20393)
*Qing Wang,Chong-Wah Ngo,Yu Cao,Ee-Peng Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a causal approach for image-to-recipe retrieval that predicts overlooked culinary elements in images and injects them into cross-modal representation learning to mitigate biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods assume food images fully capture recipe details, but images only show visual outcomes, missing subtle ingredients and cooking methods crucial for distinguishing similar recipes.

Method: Uses causal representation learning to predict culinary elements overlooked in images and explicitly injects these elements into cross-modal representation learning to reduce biases.

Result: Achieves impressive retrieval performance on both Recipe1M and a new multilingual multicultural dataset, successfully uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions.

Conclusion: The causal approach effectively mitigates representation biases in image-to-recipe retrieval, particularly for distinguishing similar recipes with subtle differences across different cuisines.

Abstract: Existing approaches for image-to-recipe retrieval have the implicit
assumption that a food image can fully capture the details textually documented
in its recipe. However, a food image only reflects the visual outcome of a
cooked dish and not the underlying cooking process. Consequently, learning
cross-modal representations to bridge the modality gap between images and
recipes tends to ignore subtle, recipe-specific details that are not visually
apparent but are crucial for recipe retrieval. Specifically, the
representations are biased to capture the dominant visual elements, resulting
in difficulty in ranking similar recipes with subtle differences in use of
ingredients and cooking methods. The bias in representation learning is
expected to be more severe when the training data is mixed of images and
recipes sourced from different cuisines. This paper proposes a novel causal
approach that predicts the culinary elements potentially overlooked in images,
while explicitly injecting these elements into cross-modal representation
learning to mitigate biases. Experiments are conducted on the standard
monolingual Recipe1M dataset and a newly curated multilingual multicultural
cuisine dataset. The results indicate that the proposed causal representation
learning is capable of uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions and
achieves impressive retrieval performance on both monolingual and multilingual
multicultural datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet, a lung cancer classification model using dynamic fuzzy logic-driven knowledge distillation to handle uncertainty, with ViT-B32 as teacher and MobileNet as student, achieving over 99% accuracy on both histopathological and CT-scan datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address uncertainty and complexity in lung cancer diagnosis by dynamically adjusting knowledge distillation weights using fuzzy logic, enabling the student model to focus on high-confidence regions while reducing attention to ambiguous areas.

Method: Uses Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as instructor model transferring knowledge to MobileNet student via dynamic fuzzy logic-driven KD, with image preprocessing (Gamma correction, Histogram Equalization), wavelet-based image fusion, and Genetic Algorithm for model selection from 12 candidates.

Result: Achieved 99.16% accuracy on LC25000 histopathological images and 99.54% accuracy on IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images, demonstrating robust performance across different imaging modalities.

Conclusion: The proposed FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet model effectively handles uncertainty in lung cancer diagnosis through dynamic fuzzy logic-driven knowledge distillation, achieving high accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency through optimized model selection.

Abstract: This paper presents the FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet model, a novel approach for
lung cancer (LC) classification, leveraging dynamic fuzzy logic-driven
knowledge distillation (KD) to address uncertainty and complexity in disease
diagnosis. Unlike traditional models that rely on static KD with fixed weights,
our method dynamically adjusts the distillation weight using fuzzy logic,
enabling the student model to focus on high-confidence regions while reducing
attention to ambiguous areas. This dynamic adjustment improves the model
ability to handle varying uncertainty levels across different regions of LC
images. We employ the Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor model,
which effectively transfers knowledge to the student model, MobileNet,
enhancing the student generalization capabilities. The training process is
further optimized using a dynamic wait adjustment mechanism that adapts the
training procedure for improved convergence and performance. To enhance image
quality, we introduce pixel-level image fusion improvement techniques such as
Gamma correction and Histogram Equalization. The processed images (Pix1 and
Pix2) are fused using a wavelet-based fusion method to improve image resolution
and feature preservation. This fusion method uses the wavedec2 function to
standardize images to a 224x224 resolution, decompose them into multi-scale
frequency components, and recursively average coefficients at each level for
better feature representation. To address computational efficiency, Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is used to select the most suitable pre-trained student model
from a pool of 12 candidates, balancing model performance with computational
cost. The model is evaluated on two datasets, including LC25000
histopathological images (99.16% accuracy) and IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images
(99.54% accuracy), demonstrating robustness across different imaging domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Conan is a framework for evidence-grounded multi-step video reasoning that identifies contextual/evidence frames, reasons over cross-frame clues, and adaptively decides when to conclude or explore further, achieving state-of-the-art performance on video reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL-based video reasoning methods produce ungrounded or hallucinated conclusions, while frame-retrieval approaches struggle with inaccurate evidence localization. There's a need for better evidence-grounded multi-step video reasoning.

Method: Conan framework with: (1) Conan-91K dataset of automatically generated reasoning traces including frame identification, evidence reasoning, and action decision; (2) multi-stage progressive cold-start strategy combined with Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR training framework.

Result: Surpasses baseline Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by average of over 10% in accuracy on six multi-step reasoning benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Also generalizes effectively to long-video understanding tasks.

Conclusion: Conan demonstrates strong scalability and robustness for multi-step video reasoning, effectively addressing the limitations of existing approaches through evidence-grounded reasoning and adaptive decision-making.

Abstract: Video reasoning, which requires multi-step deduction across frames, remains a
major challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While
reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods enhance reasoning capabilities, they
often rely on text-only chains that yield ungrounded or hallucinated
conclusions. Conversely, frame-retrieval approaches introduce visual grounding
but still struggle with inaccurate evidence localization. To address these
challenges, we present Conan, a framework for evidence-grounded multi-step
video reasoning. Conan identifies contextual and evidence frames, reasons over
cross-frame clues, and adaptively decides when to conclude or explore further.
To achieve this, we (1) construct Conan-91K, a large-scale dataset of
automatically generated reasoning traces that includes frame identification,
evidence reasoning, and action decision, and (2) design a multi-stage
progressive cold-start strategy combined with an
Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR training framework to jointly
enhance multi-step visual reasoning. Extensive experiments on six multi-step
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Conan surpasses the baseline
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by an average of over 10% in accuracy, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, Conan generalizes effectively to
long-video understanding tasks, validating its strong scalability and
robustness.

### [54] [Reliable and Reproducible Demographic Inference for Fairness in Face Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20482)
*Alexandre Fournier-Montgieux,Hervé Le Borgne,Adrian Popescu,Bertrand Luvison*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reliable demographic attribute inference pipeline for fairness auditing in face analysis systems, using modular transfer learning with pretrained face recognition encoders and introducing robustness metrics based on intra-identity consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fairness evaluation in face analysis systems depends on demographic attribute inference, but the validity of fairness auditing hinges on the reliability of this inference process. Improved reliability leads to less biased and lower-variance fairness estimates.

Method: A fully reproducible demographic attribute inference pipeline that replaces conventional end-to-end training with modular transfer learning, integrating pretrained face recognition encoders with non-linear classification heads. Audited across accuracy, fairness, and robustness (intra-identity consistency).

Result: The proposed method outperforms strong baselines, particularly on the more challenging ethnicity attribute, across multiple datasets and training setups.

Conclusion: This work contributes a reliable foundation for demographic inference in fairness auditing, with public release of training dataset metadata, codebase, pretrained models, and evaluation toolkit to promote transparency and reproducibility.

Abstract: Fairness evaluation in face analysis systems (FAS) typically depends on
automatic demographic attribute inference (DAI), which itself relies on
predefined demographic segmentation. However, the validity of fairness auditing
hinges on the reliability of the DAI process. We begin by providing a
theoretical motivation for this dependency, showing that improved DAI
reliability leads to less biased and lower-variance estimates of FAS fairness.
To address this, we propose a fully reproducible DAI pipeline that replaces
conventional end-to-end training with a modular transfer learning approach. Our
design integrates pretrained face recognition encoders with non-linear
classification heads. We audit this pipeline across three dimensions: accuracy,
fairness, and a newly introduced notion of robustness, defined via
intra-identity consistency. The proposed robustness metric is applicable to any
demographic segmentation scheme. We benchmark the pipeline on gender and
ethnicity inference across multiple datasets and training setups. Our results
show that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines, particularly on
ethnicity, which is the more challenging attribute. To promote transparency and
reproducibility, we will publicly release the training dataset metadata, full
codebase, pretrained models, and evaluation toolkit. This work contributes a
reliable foundation for demographic inference in fairness auditing.

*Yixiong Yang,Tao Wu,Senmao Li,Shiqi Yang,Yaxing Wang,Joost van de Weijer,Kai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoDistill is a bidirectional concept distillation framework that enables one-step diffusion personalization by training teacher and student models simultaneously, allowing mutual enhancement through concept distillation and echoing refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current one-step diffusion models struggle with personalization due to limited capacity to capture novel concept distributions, creating a need for efficient personalization methods that maintain high fidelity.

Method: End-to-end training with multi-step teacher and one-step student models, bidirectional concept distillation with shared text encoder, adversarial and alignment losses, and echoing refinement where student feedback enhances teacher quality.

Result: The framework significantly outperforms existing personalization methods in one-step diffusion personalization setup, improving both student's personalization ability and teacher's generative quality.

Conclusion: EchoDistill establishes a novel paradigm for rapid and effective personalization in text-to-image diffusion models through bidirectional collaborative training.

Abstract: Recent advances in accelerating text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have
enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images even in a single step. However,
personalizing these models to incorporate novel concepts remains a challenge
due to the limited capacity of one-step models to capture new concept
distributions effectively. We propose a bidirectional concept distillation
framework, EchoDistill, to enable one-step diffusion personalization (1-SDP).
Our approach involves an end-to-end training process where a multi-step
diffusion model (teacher) and a one-step diffusion model (student) are trained
simultaneously. The concept is first distilled from the teacher model to the
student, and then echoed back from the student to the teacher. During the
EchoDistill, we share the text encoder between the two models to ensure
consistent semantic understanding. Following this, the student model is
optimized with adversarial losses to align with the real image distribution and
with alignment losses to maintain consistency with the teacher's output.
Furthermore, we introduce the bidirectional echoing refinement strategy,
wherein the student model leverages its faster generation capability to
feedback to the teacher model. This bidirectional concept distillation
mechanism not only enhances the student ability to personalize novel concepts
but also improves the generative quality of the teacher model. Our experiments
demonstrate that this collaborative framework significantly outperforms
existing personalization methods over the 1-SDP setup, establishing a novel
paradigm for rapid and effective personalization in T2I diffusion models.

*Xiaohan Lan,Fanfan Liu,Haibo Qiu,Siqi Yang,Delian Ruan,Peng Shi,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Metis-HOME is a Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts framework that enables "Hybrid Thinking" by splitting a dense model into thinking and non-thinking expert branches with a dynamic router, improving both complex reasoning and general capabilities while resolving the efficiency vs. generalization trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal reasoning models suffer from computational inefficiency (using expensive reasoning for simple queries) and impaired general understanding capabilities due to over-specialization in reasoning tasks.

Method: Adapt Qwen2.5-VL-7B into a Mixture-of-Experts architecture with two expert branches: a thinking branch for complex multi-step reasoning and a non-thinking branch for rapid direct inference, plus a lightweight trainable router for dynamic query allocation.

Result: The approach substantially enhances complex reasoning abilities while also improving general capabilities, reversing the degradation trend observed in other reasoning-specialized models.

Conclusion: Metis-HOME establishes a new paradigm for building powerful and versatile MLLMs that effectively resolves the reasoning-vs-generalization dilemma through hybrid thinking.

Abstract: Inspired by recent advancements in LLM reasoning, the field of multimodal
reasoning has seen remarkable progress, achieving significant performance gains
on intricate tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Despite this progress,
current multimodal large reasoning models exhibit two key limitations. They
tend to employ computationally expensive reasoning even for simple queries,
leading to inefficiency. Furthermore, this focus on specialized reasoning often
impairs their broader, more general understanding capabilities. In this paper,
we propose Metis-HOME: a Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts framework designed
to address this trade-off. Metis-HOME enables a ''Hybrid Thinking'' paradigm by
structuring the original dense model into two distinct expert branches: a
thinking branch tailored for complex, multi-step reasoning, and a non-thinking
branch optimized for rapid, direct inference on tasks like general VQA and OCR.
A lightweight, trainable router dynamically allocates queries to the most
suitable expert. We instantiate Metis-HOME by adapting the Qwen2.5-VL-7B into
an MoE architecture. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that our approach not
only substantially enhances complex reasoning abilities but also improves the
model's general capabilities, reversing the degradation trend observed in other
reasoning-specialized models. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building
powerful and versatile MLLMs, effectively resolving the prevalent
reasoning-vs-generalization dilemma.

*Lixiong Qin,Yang Zhang,Mei Wang,Jiani Hu,Weihong Deng,Weiran Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Fake-in-Facext (FiFa), a framework for fine-grained Explainable DeepFake Analysis that addresses limitations in current MLLMs by introducing reliable data annotation and a unified model architecture supporting artifact-grounded explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs for Explainable DeepFake Analysis lack fine-grained awareness - they have unreliable coarse-grained artifact descriptions, fail to connect textual explanations with visual evidence, and don't support queries for arbitrary facial regions, making responses insufficiently grounded in Face Visual Context.

Method: Proposes FiFa framework with two main contributions: 1) FiFa-Annotator data annotation pipeline using a Facial Image Concept Tree (FICT) for fine-grained regional concepts, and 2) FiFa-MLLM - a unified multi-task learning architecture supporting multimodal inputs/outputs for Artifact-Grounding Explanation task (generating textual explanations interleaved with segmentation masks).

Result: FiFa-MLLM outperforms strong baselines on the AGE task and achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing XDFA datasets.

Conclusion: The FiFa framework successfully addresses fine-grained awareness limitations in Explainable DeepFake Analysis through reliable data annotation and a unified model architecture, enabling artifact-grounded explanations that connect textual descriptions with visual evidence.

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has bridged the
gap between vision and language tasks, enabling the implementation of
Explainable DeepFake Analysis (XDFA). However, current methods suffer from a
lack of fine-grained awareness: the description of artifacts in data annotation
is unreliable and coarse-grained, and the models fail to support the output of
connections between textual forgery explanations and the visual evidence of
artifacts, as well as the input of queries for arbitrary facial regions. As a
result, their responses are not sufficiently grounded in Face Visual Context
(Facext). To address this limitation, we propose the Fake-in-Facext (FiFa)
framework, with contributions focusing on data annotation and model
construction. We first define a Facial Image Concept Tree (FICT) to divide
facial images into fine-grained regional concepts, thereby obtaining a more
reliable data annotation pipeline, FiFa-Annotator, for forgery explanation.
Based on this dedicated data annotation, we introduce a novel
Artifact-Grounding Explanation (AGE) task, which generates textual forgery
explanations interleaved with segmentation masks of manipulated artifacts. We
propose a unified multi-task learning architecture, FiFa-MLLM, to
simultaneously support abundant multimodal inputs and outputs for fine-grained
Explainable DeepFake Analysis. With multiple auxiliary supervision tasks,
FiFa-MLLM can outperform strong baselines on the AGE task and achieve SOTA
performance on existing XDFA datasets. The code and data will be made
open-source at https://github.com/lxq1000/Fake-in-Facext.

*Guillermo Carbajal,Andrés Almansa,Pablo Musé*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework that jointly estimates sharp images and camera motion trajectories from blurry images using a differentiable blur model and 3D rotation trajectory prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion blur from camera shake during large or rotational movements is a major challenge in image restoration that existing methods struggle with.

Method: Uses Projective Motion Blur Model with differentiable blur creation module, neural network for 3D rotation trajectory prediction, and model-based restoration network trained end-to-end with post-inference trajectory optimization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real datasets, especially for severe or spatially variant blur where end-to-end networks fail.

Conclusion: The proposed modular framework provides interpretable camera motion estimation while enabling reconstruction of sharp image sequences and outperforms existing methods on challenging blur cases.

Abstract: Motion blur caused by camera shake, particularly under large or rotational
movements, remains a major challenge in image restoration. We propose a deep
learning framework that jointly estimates the latent sharp image and the
underlying camera motion trajectory from a single blurry image. Our method
leverages the Projective Motion Blur Model (PMBM), implemented efficiently
using a differentiable blur creation module compatible with modern networks. A
neural network predicts a full 3D rotation trajectory, which guides a
model-based restoration network trained end-to-end. This modular architecture
provides interpretability by revealing the camera motion that produced the
blur. Moreover, this trajectory enables the reconstruction of the sequence of
sharp images that generated the observed blurry image. To further refine
results, we optimize the trajectory post-inference via a reblur loss, improving
consistency between the blurry input and the restored output. Extensive
experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real datasets, particularly in cases with severe or spatially
variant blur, where end-to-end deblurring networks struggle.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Open-o3 Video is a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal evidence into video reasoning by highlighting key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside answers, enabling reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without indicating when and where key evidence appears. Extending evidence-centered reasoning from images to videos is challenging as it requires joint temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes.

Method: Curated two high-quality datasets (STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL) with unified spatio-temporal annotations, and adopted a cold-start reinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that jointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on V-STAR benchmark, raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent improvements observed on VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Reasoning traces provide valuable signals for test-time scaling and confidence-aware verification.

Conclusion: Open-o3 Video successfully integrates explicit spatio-temporal evidence into video reasoning, demonstrating superior performance across multiple benchmarks while providing interpretable reasoning traces that enable confidence-aware verification and improve answer reliability.

Abstract: Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without
indicating when and where key evidence appears. Recent models such as OpenAI-o3
have sparked wide interest in evidence-centered reasoning for images, yet
extending this ability to videos is more challenging, as it requires joint
temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes. We introduce
Open-o3 Video, a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal
evidence into video reasoning, and carefully collect training data and design
training strategies to address the aforementioned challenges. The model
highlights key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside its answers,
allowing reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations. To enable
this functionality, we first curate and build two high-quality datasets,
STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL, with carefully constructed
temporal and spatial annotations, since most existing datasets offer either
temporal spans for videos or spatial boxes on images, lacking unified
spatio-temporal supervision and reasoning traces. Then, we adopt a cold-start
reinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that
jointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision.
On V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance,
raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent
improvements are also observed on a broad range of video understanding
benchmarks, including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Beyond
accuracy, the reasoning traces produced by Open-o3 Video also provide valuable
signals for test-time scaling, enabling confidence-aware verification and
improving answer reliability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a similarity-based prototype framework for cross-modality segmentation that learns class-wise prototypes in embedding space with similarity constraints and uses dictionaries to store prototypes for contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models suffer performance degradation on unseen data due to domain shift, and unsupervised domain adaptation aims to reduce domain gap without costly annotation.

Method: Learn class-wise prototypes in embedding space with similarity constraints to make prototypes representative for each semantic class while separable from different classes. Use dictionaries to store prototypes from different images to prevent class-missing and enable contrastive learning.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method achieves better results than other state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses cross-modality segmentation through similarity-based prototypes and dictionary-based prototype storage, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved great success on various vision
challenges, but a well-trained model would face drastic performance degradation
when applied to unseen data. Since the model is sensitive to domain shift,
unsupervised domain adaptation attempts to reduce the domain gap and avoid
costly annotation of unseen domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for
cross-modality segmentation via similarity-based prototypes. In specific, we
learn class-wise prototypes within an embedding space, then introduce a
similarity constraint to make these prototypes representative for each semantic
class while separable from different classes. Moreover, we use dictionaries to
store prototypes extracted from different images, which prevents the
class-missing problem and enables the contrastive learning of prototypes, and
further improves performance. Extensive experiments show that our method
achieves better results than other state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ACamera-Net is a lightweight neural network that predicts optimal camera exposure and white balance parameters directly from RAW inputs to improve image quality under challenging lighting conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Consumer cameras struggle with complex illumination (low light, HDR, backlighting) causing underexposure, color casts, and tonal inconsistency that degrade downstream vision tasks.

Method: Two-module framework: ACamera-Exposure estimates ISO to fix underexposure, and ACamera-Color predicts color temperature and gain factors for color consistency. Optimized for real-time edge device inference.

Result: Extensive experiments show ACamera-Net consistently enhances image quality and stabilizes perception outputs, outperforming conventional auto modes and lightweight baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses camera parameter optimization under complex lighting without additional enhancement modules, demonstrating strong generalization across conditions.

Abstract: Consumer-grade camera systems often struggle to maintain stable image quality
under complex illumination conditions such as low light, high dynamic range,
and backlighting, as well as spatial color temperature variation. These issues
lead to underexposure, color casts, and tonal inconsistency, which degrade the
performance of downstream vision tasks. To address this, we propose
ACamera-Net, a lightweight and scene-adaptive camera parameter adjustment
network that directly predicts optimal exposure and white balance from RAW
inputs. The framework consists of two modules: ACamera-Exposure, which
estimates ISO to alleviate underexposure and contrast loss, and ACamera-Color,
which predicts correlated color temperature and gain factors for improved color
consistency. Optimized for real-time inference on edge devices, ACamera-Net can
be seamlessly integrated into imaging pipelines. Trained on diverse real-world
data with annotated references, the model generalizes well across lighting
conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACamera-Net consistently
enhances image quality and stabilizes perception outputs, outperforming
conventional auto modes and lightweight baselines without relying on additional
image enhancement modules.

Conclusion: OnlineSplatter enables high-quality, object-centric 3D reconstruction from monocular video without pose/depth requirements, with scalable performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Free-moving object reconstruction from monocular video remains challenging,
particularly without reliable pose or depth cues and under arbitrary object
motion. We introduce OnlineSplatter, a novel online feed-forward framework
generating high-quality, object-centric 3D Gaussians directly from RGB frames
without requiring camera pose, depth priors, or bundle optimization. Our
approach anchors reconstruction using the first frame and progressively refines
the object representation through a dense Gaussian primitive field, maintaining
constant computational cost regardless of video sequence length. Our core
contribution is a dual-key memory module combining latent appearance-geometry
keys with explicit directional keys, robustly fusing current frame features
with temporally aggregated object states. This design enables effective
handling of free-moving objects via spatial-guided memory readout and an
efficient sparsification mechanism, ensuring comprehensive yet compact object
coverage. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that OnlineSplatter
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pose-free reconstruction baselines,
consistently improving with more observations while maintaining constant memory

AI-based automated dental image analysis offers a promising solution to improve accuracy and efficiency in diagnosis and treatment planning.

Method: The authors systematically review 260 studies, including 49 papers on publicly available dental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms. They analyze datasets characteristics, acquisition methods, and categorize DL models by different dental image analysis tasks, examining network architectures, optimization strategies, training methods, and performance.

Conclusion: The paper discusses current challenges in existing research and outlines potential future directions, aiming to provide a valuable systematic reference for researchers working on deep learning applications in dental image analysis.

Abstract: Efficient analysis and processing of dental images are crucial for dentists
to achieve accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. However, dental
imaging inherently poses several challenges, such as low contrast, metallic
artifacts, and variations in projection angles. Combined with the subjectivity
arising from differences in clinicians' expertise, manual interpretation often
proves time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Artificial intelligence
(AI)-based automated dental image analysis (DIA) offers a promising solution to
these issues and has become an integral part of computer-aided dental diagnosis
and treatment. Among various AI technologies, deep learning (DL) stands out as
the most widely applied and influential approach due to its superior feature
extraction and representation capabilities. To comprehensively summarize recent
progress in this field, we focus on the two fundamental aspects of DL
research-datasets and models. In this paper, we systematically review 260
studies on DL applications in DIA, including 49 papers on publicly available
dental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms. We first introduce the
basic concepts of dental imaging and summarize the characteristics and
acquisition methods of existing datasets. Then, we present the foundational
techniques of DL and categorize relevant models and algorithms according to
different DIA tasks, analyzing their network architectures, optimization
strategies, training methods, and performance. Furthermore, we summarize
commonly used training and evaluation metrics in the DIA domain. Finally, we
discuss the current challenges of existing research and outline potential
future directions. We hope that this work provides a valuable and systematic
reference for researchers in this field. All supplementary materials and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with accurate color matching from text prompts, and existing benchmarks lack systematic color precision assessment despite color's fundamental importance in visual communication and applications like brand consistency.

Method: Proposed GenColorBench with 44K color-focused prompts covering 400+ colors, grounded in color systems like ISCC-NBS and CSS3/X11, including numerical colors. Uses both perceptual and automated assessments for evaluation.

Result: Evaluations of popular text-to-image models show performance variations, revealing which color conventions models understand best and identifying specific failure modes in color generation.

Conclusion: GenColorBench provides a comprehensive framework to guide improvements in precise color generation for text-to-image models, and will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Recent years have seen impressive advances in text-to-image generation, with
image generative or unified models producing high-quality images from text. Yet
these models still struggle with fine-grained color controllability, often
failing to accurately match colors specified in text prompts. While existing
benchmarks evaluate compositional reasoning and prompt adherence, none
systematically assess color precision. Color is fundamental to human visual
perception and communication, critical for applications from art to design
workflows requiring brand consistency. However, current benchmarks either
neglect color or rely on coarse assessments, missing key capabilities such as
interpreting RGB values or aligning with human expectations. To this end, we
propose GenColorBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for text-to-image
color generation, grounded in color systems like ISCC-NBS and CSS3/X11,
including numerical colors which are absent elsewhere. With 44K color-focused
prompts covering 400+ colors, it reveals models' true capabilities via
perceptual and automated assessments. Evaluations of popular text-to-image
models using GenColorBench show performance variations, highlighting which
color conventions models understand best and identifying failure modes. Our
GenColorBench assessments will guide improvements in precise color generation.
The benchmark will be made public upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large VLMs struggle with information-intensive images that densely interleave text and graphical elements, particularly in precisely localizing critical cues and multi-hop reasoning over dispersed evidence.

Method: Uses speculative decoding with lightweight draft experts (small VLMs) to generate reasoning paths, then a strong verdict model synthesizes these paths. Includes consensus expert selection to forward only high-agreement paths to the verdict stage.

Result: Achieves consistent gains on challenging benchmarks including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K, with both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large proprietary models.

Conclusion: SV effectively synthesizes correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning paths, providing a cost-efficient solution for information-intensive visual reasoning without requiring training.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over
information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with
fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely
localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate
dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free
framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight
draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as
draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization
candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to
produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering
correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a
consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement
reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on
challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering
benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K.
By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning
paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large
proprietary models or training pipelines. Code is available at

Motivation: Long video understanding is challenging due to complex content and computational limitations of Video-LLMs. Existing frame selection methods ignore temporal dependencies or rely on single modalities, limiting their ability to provide complete query-relevant context.

Method: SeViCES has two main components: 1) Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) with temporal-aware semantic branch using LLM reasoning over captions and cluster-guided visual branch aligning embeddings with semantic scores, and 2) Answer Consensus Refinement (ACR) that fuses evidence and constrains answer space to resolve inconsistencies.

Result: Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show SeViCES consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the importance of consensus-driven evidence selection for Video-LLMs, providing effective and reliable long video understanding without requiring training.

Abstract: Long video understanding remains challenging due to its complex, diverse, and
temporally scattered content. Although video large language models (Video-LLMs)
can process videos lasting tens of minutes, applying them to truly long
sequences is computationally prohibitive and often leads to unfocused or
inconsistent reasoning. A promising solution is to select only the most
informative frames, yet existing approaches typically ignore temporal
dependencies or rely on unimodal evidence, limiting their ability to provide
complete and query-relevant context. We propose a Semantic-Visual Consensus
Evidence Selection (SeViCES) framework for effective and reliable long video
understanding. SeViCES is training-free and model-agnostic, and introduces two
key components. The Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) module
selects frames through (1) a temporal-aware semantic branch that leverages LLM
reasoning over captions, and (2) a cluster-guided visual branch that aligns
embeddings with semantic scores via mutual information. The Answer Consensus
Refinement (ACR) module further resolves inconsistencies between semantic- and
visual-based predictions by fusing evidence and constraining the answer space.
Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that SeViCES
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and
robustness, demonstrating the importance of consensus-driven evidence selection
for Video-LLMs.

*Nimrod Berman,Omkar Joglekar,Eitan Kosman,Dotan Di Castro,Omri Azencot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LDDBM is a general-purpose framework for modality translation using latent diffusion models that bridges arbitrary modalities without requiring aligned dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models excel in single-modality domains but struggle with modality translation due to restrictive assumptions like shared dimensionality and Gaussian priors.

Method: Uses latent-variable extension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models with contrastive alignment loss, domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture, and predictive loss for cross-domain translation.

Result: Performs strongly on diverse MT tasks including multi-view to 3D shape generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis.

Conclusion: Establishes a new strong baseline in general modality translation with comprehensive experimental validation.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have positioned diffusion models as
state-of-the-art tools for sampling from complex data distributions. While
these models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such
as images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT),
translating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open
challenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including
shared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific
architectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this
work, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a
general-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable
extension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent
space, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without
requiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to
enforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a
domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in
latent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training
toward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training
strategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs
and performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape
generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis.
Comprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BTB3D introduces a causal convolutional encoder-decoder for 3D medical imaging that improves vision-language modeling through better volumetric tokenization, achieving state-of-the-art performance in report generation and text-to-CT synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches struggle with high-resolution, long-sequence 3D medical volumes due to misaligned vision encoders and slice-wise tokenization that blurs fine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance.

Method: BTB3D uses a causal convolutional encoder-decoder with frequency-aware volumetric tokens and a three-stage training curriculum: local reconstruction, overlapping-window tiling, and long-context decoder refinement, enabling generalization to scans exceeding 300 slices.

Result: BTB3D improves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40% for report generation, and reduces FID by 75% and halves FVD for text-to-CT synthesis, producing anatomically consistent 512*512*241 volumes.

Conclusion: Precise three-dimensional tokenization, rather than larger language backbones alone, is essential for scalable vision-language modeling in 3D medical imaging.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language modeling for 3D medical imaging has been
fueled by large-scale computed tomography (CT) corpora with paired free-text
reports, stronger architectures, and powerful pretrained models. This has
enabled applications such as automated report generation and text-conditioned
3D image synthesis. Yet, current approaches struggle with high-resolution,
long-sequence volumes: contrastive pretraining often yields vision encoders
that are misaligned with clinical language, and slice-wise tokenization blurs
fine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance on downstream tasks. We introduce
BTB3D (Better Tokens for Better 3D), a causal convolutional encoder-decoder
that unifies 2D and 3D training and inference while producing compact,
frequency-aware volumetric tokens. A three-stage training curriculum enables
(i) local reconstruction, (ii) overlapping-window tiling, and (iii)
long-context decoder refinement, during which the model learns from short slice
excerpts yet generalizes to scans exceeding 300 slices without additional
memory overhead. BTB3D sets a new state-of-the-art on two key tasks: it
improves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40% over CT2Rep, CT-CHAT, and
Merlin for report generation; and it reduces FID by 75% and halves FVD compared
to GenerateCT and MedSyn for text-to-CT synthesis, producing anatomically
consistent 512*512*241 volumes. These results confirm that precise
three-dimensional tokenization, rather than larger language backbones alone, is
essential for scalable vision-language modeling in 3D medical imaging. The

TL;DR: The paper introduces UltraHR-100K dataset and a frequency-aware post-training method to address ultra-high-resolution text-to-image generation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two key challenges in UHR T2I generation: lack of large-scale high-quality UHR datasets and absence of tailored training strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis.

Method: Proposes UltraHR-100K dataset (100K images >3K resolution) and frequency-aware post-training with Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS) and Soft-Weighting Frequency Regularization (SWFR) using DFT.

Result: Extensive experiments on UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks show significant improvement in fine-grained detail quality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances UHR T2I generation through high-quality dataset and specialized training strategies for fine detail synthesis.

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen notable
progress. However, two key challenges remain : 1) the absence of a large-scale
high-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the neglect of tailored training
strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios. To tackle the
first challenge, we introduce \textbf{UltraHR-100K}, a high-quality dataset of
100K UHR images with rich captions, offering diverse content and strong visual
fidelity. Each image exceeds 3K resolution and is rigorously curated based on
detail richness, content complexity, and aesthetic quality. To tackle the
second challenge, we propose a frequency-aware post-training method that
enhances fine-detail generation in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we
design (i) \textit{Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS)} to focus learning
on detail-critical denoising steps, and (ii) \textit{Soft-Weighting Frequency
Regularization (SWFR)}, which leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to
softly constrain frequency components, encouraging high-frequency detail
preservation. Extensive experiments on our proposed UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the fine-grained detail
quality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation. The code is available at

*Jinhee Kim,Jae Jun An,Kang Eun Jeon,Jong Hwan Ko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes two techniques to reduce training overhead in multi-bit quantization networks: weight bias correction for shared batch normalization and bit-wise coreset sampling for efficient training on subsets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-bit quantization approaches suffer from significant training overhead as full-dataset updates are repeated for each bit-width, with costs scaling linearly with precision options and requiring extra fine-tuning stages.

Method: Two main techniques: (1) Weight bias correction enables shared batch normalization and eliminates fine-tuning by neutralizing quantization-induced bias across bit-widths; (2) Bit-wise coreset sampling strategy allows each child model to train on compact, informative subsets selected via gradient-based importance scores.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K with ResNet and ViT architectures show competitive or superior accuracy while reducing training time up to 7.88x.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses training overhead in multi-bit quantization networks without compromising model utility, achieving significant speedup while maintaining competitive performance across various datasets and architectures.

Abstract: Multi-bit quantization networks enable flexible deployment of deep neural
networks by supporting multiple precision levels within a single model.
However, existing approaches suffer from significant training overhead as
full-dataset updates are repeated for each supported bit-width, resulting in a
cost that scales linearly with the number of precisions. Additionally, extra
fine-tuning stages are often required to support additional or intermediate
precision options, further compounding the overall training burden. To address
this issue, we propose two techniques that greatly reduce the training overhead
without compromising model utility: (i) Weight bias correction enables shared
batch normalization and eliminates the need for fine-tuning by neutralizing
quantization-induced bias across bit-widths and aligning activation
distributions; and (ii) Bit-wise coreset sampling strategy allows each child
model to train on a compact, informative subset selected via gradient-based
importance scores by exploiting the implicit knowledge transfer phenomenon.
Experiments on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K with both ResNet and
ViT architectures demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior
accuracy while reducing training time up to 7.88x. Our code is released at

*Xuyang Liu,Xiyan Gui,Yuchao Zhang,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MixKV is a novel KV cache compression method for large vision-language models that combines importance and diversity metrics to address modality-specific semantic redundancy, achieving significant performance improvements under extreme compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KV cache compression methods focus only on importance metrics, overlooking modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns in multi-modal KV caches, which limits their effectiveness and semantic coverage.

Method: MixKV adapts to head-wise semantic redundancy by selectively balancing diversity and importance when compressing KV pairs, addressing the limitations of importance-only approaches.

Result: Under extreme compression (budget=64), MixKV improves baseline methods by 5.1% across five multi-modal benchmarks and achieves 8.0-9.0% gains for GUI grounding tasks, while maintaining comparable inference efficiency.

Conclusion: MixKV effectively addresses KV cache memory bottlenecks in LVLMs by considering both importance and diversity, demonstrating consistent improvements across multiple models and extending well to LLMs with comparable gains.

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in processing extended multi-modal sequences, yet the resulting
key-value (KV) cache expansion creates a critical memory bottleneck that
fundamentally limits deployment scalability. While existing KV cache
compression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize
storage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns
that emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first
analyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying
levels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on
importance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information
distribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage. To address this,
we propose \texttt{MixKV}, a novel method that mixes importance with diversity
for optimized KV cache compression in LVLMs. \texttt{MixKV} adapts to head-wise
semantic redundancy, selectively balancing diversity and importance when
compressing KV pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{MixKV}
consistently enhances existing methods across multiple LVLMs. Under extreme
compression (budget=64), \texttt{MixKV} improves baseline methods by an average
of \textbf{5.1\%} across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks and achieves
remarkable gains of \textbf{8.0\%} and \textbf{9.0\%} for SnapKV and AdaKV on
GUI grounding tasks, all while maintaining comparable inference efficiency.
Furthermore, \texttt{MixKV} extends seamlessly to LLMs with comparable
performance gains. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of maintaining long-range geometric consistency in driving scene generation over extended durations (20+ seconds).

Method: Uses an RGB-D diffusion model that jointly handles image and depth in shared latent space, conditions on existing scene geometry from previous keyframes, and employs warp-consistent guidance sampling. Then interpolates between keyframes using video diffusion.

Result: Generates realistic driving videos over 20 seconds with 48.6% improvement in long-horizon FID and 43.0% improvement in FVD scores over prior state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: AutoScape effectively maintains geometric consistency in long-horizon driving scene generation through its novel RGB-D diffusion approach and keyframe-based architecture.

Abstract: This paper proposes AutoScape, a long-horizon driving scene generation
framework. At its core is a novel RGB-D diffusion model that iteratively
generates sparse, geometrically consistent keyframes, serving as reliable
anchors for the scene's appearance and geometry. To maintain long-range
geometric consistency, the model 1) jointly handles image and depth in a shared
latent space, 2) explicitly conditions on the existing scene geometry (i.e.,
rendered point clouds) from previously generated keyframes, and 3) steers the
sampling process with a warp-consistent guidance. Given high-quality RGB-D
keyframes, a video diffusion model then interpolates between them to produce
dense and coherent video frames. AutoScape generates realistic and
geometrically consistent driving videos of over 20 seconds, improving the
long-horizon FID and FVD scores over the prior state-of-the-art by 48.6\% and
43.0\%, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DyPE is a training-free method that enables pre-trained diffusion transformers to generate ultra-high-resolution images beyond their training data by dynamically adjusting positional encodings during diffusion steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training diffusion transformers at ultra-high resolutions is extremely costly due to quadratic scaling of self-attention with image tokens, creating a need for methods that can extend resolution capabilities without retraining.

Method: Dynamic Position Extrapolation (DyPE) leverages the spectral progression of diffusion processes, where low-frequency structures converge early while high-frequencies resolve later. It dynamically adjusts positional encodings at each diffusion step to match the frequency spectrum with the current generative stage.

Result: DyPE enables generation of images at resolutions far beyond training data (e.g., 16 million pixels using FLUX) with no additional sampling cost. It consistently improves performance and achieves state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation, with gains increasing at higher resolutions.

Conclusion: DyPE provides an effective training-free solution for extending diffusion transformers to ultra-high resolutions by exploiting the spectral properties of the diffusion process through dynamic positional encoding adjustment.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer models can generate images with remarkable fidelity and
detail, yet training them at ultra-high resolutions remains extremely costly
due to the self-attention mechanism's quadratic scaling with the number of
image tokens. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Position Extrapolation
(DyPE), a novel, training-free method that enables pre-trained diffusion
transformers to synthesize images at resolutions far beyond their training
data, with no additional sampling cost. DyPE takes advantage of the spectral
progression inherent to the diffusion process, where low-frequency structures
converge early, while high-frequencies take more steps to resolve.
Specifically, DyPE dynamically adjusts the model's positional encoding at each
diffusion step, matching their frequency spectrum with the current stage of the
generative process. This approach allows us to generate images at resolutions
that exceed the training resolution dramatically, e.g., 16 million pixels using
FLUX. On multiple benchmarks, DyPE consistently improves performance and
achieves state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation,
with gains becoming even more pronounced at higher resolutions. Project page is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MeanFlow shows strong performance but suffers from optimization conflicts between trajectory flow matching and trajectory consistency terms, causing slow convergence. The authors aim to resolve this conflict.

Method: Introduces α-Flow, a family of objectives that unifies trajectory flow matching, Shortcut Model, and MeanFlow. Uses curriculum strategy to smoothly anneal from trajectory flow matching to MeanFlow, disentangling conflicting objectives.

Result: α-Flow consistently outperforms MeanFlow across scales and settings. The largest α-Flow-XL/2+ model achieves SOTA results with FID scores of 2.58 (1-NFE) and 2.15 (2-NFE) on class-conditional ImageNet-1K 256x256 using vanilla DiT backbones.

Conclusion: α-Flow successfully resolves optimization conflicts in MeanFlow through curriculum learning, achieving better convergence and state-of-the-art performance in few-step generative modeling.

Abstract: MeanFlow has recently emerged as a powerful framework for few-step generative
modeling trained from scratch, but its success is not yet fully understood. In
this work, we show that the MeanFlow objective naturally decomposes into two
parts: trajectory flow matching and trajectory consistency. Through gradient
analysis, we find that these terms are strongly negatively correlated, causing
optimization conflict and slow convergence. Motivated by these insights, we
introduce $\alpha$-Flow, a broad family of objectives that unifies trajectory
flow matching, Shortcut Model, and MeanFlow under one formulation. By adopting
a curriculum strategy that smoothly anneals from trajectory flow matching to
MeanFlow, $\alpha$-Flow disentangles the conflicting objectives, and achieves
better convergence. When trained from scratch on class-conditional ImageNet-1K
256x256 with vanilla DiT backbones, $\alpha$-Flow consistently outperforms
MeanFlow across scales and settings. Our largest $\alpha$-Flow-XL/2+ model
achieves new state-of-the-art results using vanilla DiT backbones, with FID
scores of 2.58 (1-NFE) and 2.15 (2-NFE).

Motivation: To develop a unified generative framework for robust 3D reconstruction from single images that can handle pose estimation, shape recovery, and texture generation simultaneously.

Method: Two-stage flow matching pipeline: coarse stage produces initial 3D geometry with 2D projections for pose recovery; refinement stage integrates pose-aligned image features to enhance structural fidelity and appearance details. Represents camera poses and 3D shape as distributions in shared 3D latent space.

Result: Outperforms leading 3D reconstruction methods with over 3 dB PSNR gain and over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, matches monocular estimators on pose accuracy, and delivers superior visual fidelity over baseline 3D generative models.

Conclusion: Cupid provides an effective unified framework for joint pose, shape, and texture estimation from single images, achieving state-of-the-art performance in 3D reconstruction quality and accuracy.

Abstract: This work proposes a new generation-based 3D reconstruction method, named
Cupid, that accurately infers the camera pose, 3D shape, and texture of an
object from a single 2D image. Cupid casts 3D reconstruction as a conditional
sampling process from a learned distribution of 3D objects, and it jointly
generates voxels and pixel-voxel correspondences, enabling robust pose and
shape estimation under a unified generative framework. By representing both
input camera poses and 3D shape as a distribution in a shared 3D latent space,
Cupid adopts a two-stage flow matching pipeline: (1) a coarse stage that
produces initial 3D geometry with associated 2D projections for pose recovery;
and (2) a refinement stage that integrates pose-aligned image features to
enhance structural fidelity and appearance details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate Cupid outperforms leading 3D reconstruction methods with an over 3
dB PSNR gain and an over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, while matching
monocular estimators on pose accuracy and delivering superior visual fidelity
over baseline 3D generative models. For an immersive view of the 3D results

Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) framework that fuses radar
and camera data to enhance tracking efficiency while minimizing manual
interventions. Contrary to many studies that underutilize radar and assign it a
supplementary role--despite its capability to provide accurate range/depth
information of targets in a world 3D coordinate system--our approach positions
radar in a crucial role. Meanwhile, this paper utilizes common features to
enable online calibration to autonomously associate detections from radar and
camera. The main contributions of this work include: (1) the development of a
radar-camera fusion MOT framework that exploits online radar-camera calibration
to simplify the integration of detection results from these two sensors, (2)
the utilization of common features between radar and camera data to accurately
derive real-world positions of detected objects, and (3) the adoption of
feature matching and category-consistency checking to surpass the limitations
of mere position matching in enhancing sensor association accuracy. To the best
of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the integration of
radar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for achieving
MOT. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by its ability to streamline
the radar-camera mapping process and improve tracking precision, as evidenced
by real-world experiments conducted in both controlled environments and actual
traffic scenarios. Code is available at

### [81] [ARGenSeg: Image Segmentation with Autoregressive Image Generation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20803)
*Xiaolong Wang,Lixiang Ru,Ziyuan Huang,Kaixiang Ji,Dandan Zheng,Jingdong Chen,Jun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARGenSeg is a novel autoregressive generation-based image segmentation framework that integrates multimodal understanding and pixel-level perception using visual tokens and VQ-VAE decoding, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using boundary points or dedicated segmentation heads in MLLMs rely on discrete representations or semantic prompts, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained visual details in image segmentation tasks.

Method: Proposes a segmentation framework based on image generation where MLLM outputs visual tokens that are detokenized into images using universal VQ-VAE, with a next-scale-prediction strategy for parallel token generation to reduce inference latency.

Result: Outperforms prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple segmentation datasets with significant improvement in inference speed while maintaining strong multimodal understanding capabilities.

Conclusion: ARGenSeg successfully unifies multimodal understanding and pixel-level perception through autoregressive generation, demonstrating superior segmentation performance and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: We propose a novel AutoRegressive Generation-based paradigm for image
Segmentation (ARGenSeg), achieving multimodal understanding and pixel-level
perception within a unified framework. Prior works integrating image
segmentation into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically employ
either boundary points representation or dedicated segmentation heads. These
methods rely on discrete representations or semantic prompts fed into
task-specific decoders, which limits the ability of the MLLM to capture
fine-grained visual details. To address these challenges, we introduce a
segmentation framework for MLLM based on image generation, which naturally
produces dense masks for target objects. We leverage MLLM to output visual
tokens and detokenize them into images using an universal VQ-VAE, making the
segmentation fully dependent on the pixel-level understanding of the MLLM. To
reduce inference latency, we employ a next-scale-prediction strategy to
generate required visual tokens in parallel. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple
segmentation datasets with a remarkable boost in inference speed, while
maintaining strong understanding capabilities.

*Dean L Slack,G Thomas Hudson,Thomas Winterbottom,Noura Al Moubayed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A simple transformer model for video prediction that extends physically accurate prediction horizons by 50% compared to latent-space approaches, using continuous pixel-space representations without complex training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the common shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches in causal modeling of physical simulations over time, and to leverage the success of transformers from language models for visual domain applications.

Method: Simple end-to-end transformer adaptation for video prediction with various spatiotemporal self-attention layouts, using continuous pixel-space representations and unsupervised training on physical simulation datasets.

Result: Significantly extends time horizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% compared to existing latent-space approaches, while maintaining comparable performance on common video quality metrics. Also enables accurate estimation of PDE simulation parameters.

Conclusion: Provides a platform for attention-based spatiotemporal video modeling through a simple, parameter-efficient, and interpretable approach that generalizes well to out-of-distribution simulation parameters.

Abstract: Inspired by the performance and scalability of autoregressive large language
models (LLMs), transformer-based models have seen recent success in the visual
domain. This study investigates a transformer adaptation for video prediction
with a simple end-to-end approach, comparing various spatiotemporal
self-attention layouts. Focusing on causal modeling of physical simulations
over time; a common shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches, we
attempt to isolate spatiotemporal reasoning via physical object tracking
metrics and unsupervised training on physical simulation datasets. We introduce
a simple yet effective pure transformer model for autoregressive video
prediction, utilizing continuous pixel-space representations for video
prediction. Without the need for complex training strategies or latent
feature-learning components, our approach significantly extends the time
horizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% when compared with
existing latent-space approaches, while maintaining comparable performance on
common video quality metrics. In addition, we conduct interpretability
experiments to identify network regions that encode information useful to
perform accurate estimations of PDE simulation parameters via probing models,
and find that this generalizes to the estimation of out-of-distribution
simulation parameters. This work serves as a platform for further
attention-based spatiotemporal modeling of videos via a simple, parameter
efficient, and interpretable approach.

### [83] [SpectraMorph: Structured Latent Learning for Self-Supervised Hyperspectral Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20814)
*Ritik Shah,Marco F Duarte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpectraMorph is a physics-guided self-supervised framework for hyperspectral super-resolution that uses an unmixing bottleneck instead of direct regression, enabling interpretable fusion with high robustness even for single-band MSI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral sensors have low spatial resolution causing blurred boundaries and mixed-pixel effects, while co-registered companion sensors provide high-resolution spatial detail. Existing deep learning methods lack interpretability and fail with very few MSI bands.

Method: Enforces an unmixing bottleneck: extracts endmember signatures from low-resolution HSI, uses a compact MLP to predict abundance-like maps from MSI, reconstructs spectra via linear mixing, and trains self-supervised using the MSI sensor's spectral response function.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised/self-supervised baselines on synthetic and real-world datasets, remains competitive with supervised baselines, trains in under a minute, and works robustly even with single-band MSI.

Conclusion: SpectraMorph provides an interpretable, fast, and robust solution for hyperspectral super-resolution that bridges the gap between physics-based and deep learning approaches, particularly effective when MSI has limited spectral bands.

Abstract: Hyperspectral sensors capture dense spectra per pixel but suffer from low
spatial resolution, causing blurred boundaries and mixed-pixel effects.
Co-registered companion sensors such as multispectral, RGB, or panchromatic
cameras provide high-resolution spatial detail, motivating hyperspectral
super-resolution through the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral images
(HSI-MSI). Existing deep learning based methods achieve strong performance but
rely on opaque regressors that lack interpretability and often fail when the
MSI has very few bands. We propose SpectraMorph, a physics-guided
self-supervised fusion framework with a structured latent space. Instead of
direct regression, SpectraMorph enforces an unmixing bottleneck: endmember
signatures are extracted from the low-resolution HSI, and a compact multilayer
perceptron predicts abundance-like maps from the MSI. Spectra are reconstructed
by linear mixing, with training performed in a self-supervised manner via the
MSI sensor's spectral response function. SpectraMorph produces interpretable
intermediates, trains in under a minute, and remains robust even with a
single-band (pan-chromatic) MSI. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show SpectraMorph consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
unsupervised/self-supervised baselines while remaining very competitive against
supervised baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerComposer is an interactive framework for multi-subject text-to-image generation that uses a layered canvas representation and locking mechanism to enable precise spatial control and identity preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing personalized generative models lack interactive control over spatial composition and scale poorly to multiple subjects, limiting their practical usability.

Method: Introduces a layered canvas where each subject is on a distinct layer for occlusion-free composition, and a locking mechanism that preserves selected layers while allowing others to adapt contextually. Uses positional embeddings and complementary data sampling without architectural changes.

Result: Achieves superior spatial control and identity preservation compared to state-of-the-art methods in multi-subject personalized image generation.

Conclusion: LayerComposer provides an intuitive, professional-grade framework for interactive multi-subject image generation with precise spatial control and high fidelity identity preservation.

Abstract: Despite their impressive visual fidelity, existing personalized generative
models lack interactive control over spatial composition and scale poorly to
multiple subjects. To address these limitations, we present LayerComposer, an
interactive framework for personalized, multi-subject text-to-image generation.
Our approach introduces two main contributions: (1) a layered canvas, a novel
representation in which each subject is placed on a distinct layer, enabling
occlusion-free composition; and (2) a locking mechanism that preserves selected
layers with high fidelity while allowing the remaining layers to adapt flexibly
to the surrounding context. Similar to professional image-editing software, the
proposed layered canvas allows users to place, resize, or lock input subjects
through intuitive layer manipulation. Our versatile locking mechanism requires
no architectural changes, relying instead on inherent positional embeddings
combined with a new complementary data sampling strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that LayerComposer achieves superior spatial control and identity
preservation compared to the state-of-the-art methods in multi-subject
personalized image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoloCine is a text-to-video model that generates coherent multi-shot narratives with global consistency, addressing the "narrative gap" in current models that only create isolated clips.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video models excel at generating isolated clips but fail to create coherent, multi-shot narratives essential for storytelling, creating a "narrative gap" that needs to be bridged.

Method: Uses Window Cross-Attention for precise directorial control by localizing text prompts to specific shots, and Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention (dense within shots but sparse between them) for efficient minute-scale generation.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art in narrative coherence and develops emergent abilities including persistent memory for characters and scenes, and intuitive grasp of cinematic techniques.

Conclusion: Marks a pivotal shift from clip synthesis towards automated filmmaking, making end-to-end cinematic creation a tangible future.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-video models excel at generating isolated clips but
fall short of creating the coherent, multi-shot narratives, which are the
essence of storytelling. We bridge this "narrative gap" with HoloCine, a model
that generates entire scenes holistically to ensure global consistency from the
first shot to the last. Our architecture achieves precise directorial control
through a Window Cross-Attention mechanism that localizes text prompts to
specific shots, while a Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention pattern (dense within
shots but sparse between them) ensures the efficiency required for minute-scale
generation. Beyond setting a new state-of-the-art in narrative coherence,
HoloCine develops remarkable emergent abilities: a persistent memory for
characters and scenes, and an intuitive grasp of cinematic techniques. Our work
marks a pivotal shift from clip synthesis towards automated filmmaking, making
end-to-end cinematic creation a tangible future. Our code is available at:

*Max B. Zhao,Fei Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A quantum-inspired algorithm using Matrix Product States (MPS) and DMRG optimization to solve QUBO problems, achieving global minima on Sudoku puzzles (200+ spins) and MaxCut problems (251 nodes).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a scalable quantum-inspired approach for solving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, which are equivalent to finding ground states of Ising spin-glass Hamiltonians, suitable for industrial applications.

Method: Uses Matrix Product States (MPS) to represent spin configurations, combines driver Hamiltonian (with transverse field) with problem Hamiltonian for quantum tunneling, and updates MPS using Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method with discrete driving schedule.

Result: Successfully solved intermediate-level Sudoku puzzles with over 200 Ising spins and MaxCut problems from Biq Mac library with up to 251 nodes and 3,265 edges, reliably finding global minima rather than near-optimal solutions.

Conclusion: The quantum-inspired MPS approach demonstrates scalability, generalizability, and suitability for industrial-scale QUBO applications, providing reliable global optimization across diverse problem instances.

Abstract: We propose and evaluate a quantum-inspired algorithm for solving Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, which are mathematically
equivalent to finding ground states of Ising spin-glass Hamiltonians. The
algorithm employs Matrix Product States (MPS) to compactly represent large
superpositions of spin configurations and utilizes a discrete driving schedule
to guide the MPS toward the ground state. At each step, a driver Hamiltonian --
incorporating a transverse magnetic field -- is combined with the problem
Hamiltonian to enable spin flips and facilitate quantum tunneling. The MPS is
updated using the standard Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method,
which iteratively minimizes the system's energy via multiple sweeps across the
spin chain. Despite its heuristic nature, the algorithm reliably identifies
global minima, not merely near-optimal solutions, across diverse QUBO
instances. We first demonstrate its effectiveness on intermediate-level Sudoku
puzzles from publicly available sources, involving over $200$ Ising spins with
long-range couplings dictated by constraint satisfaction. We then apply the
algorithm to MaxCut problems from the Biq Mac library, successfully solving
instances with up to $251$ nodes and $3,265$ edges. We discuss the advantages
of this quantum-inspired approach, including its scalability, generalizability,
and suitability for industrial-scale QUBO applications.

TL;DR: The study introduces the Analytical Reliability Benchmark (ARB) to evaluate reasoning reliability in LLMs for energy system analysis, testing four frontier models across five metrics using open datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: No standardized framework exists to evaluate logical integrity of AI systems in energy sector analysis, as current practices focus only on predictive accuracy or computational efficiency.

Method: Developed ARB framework with five submetrics (accuracy, reasoning reliability, uncertainty discipline, policy consistency, transparency) and tested four LLMs (GPT-4/5, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B) using open technoeconomic datasets under identical conditions.

Result: GPT-4/5 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet achieved high Analytical Reliability Index (>90), Gemini 2.5 Pro showed moderate stability, and Llama 3 70B remained below professional thresholds. Statistical validation confirmed significant and reproducible differences.

Conclusion: ARB establishes the first quantitative method for verifying causal, probabilistic, and policy-driven reasoning in AI systems for energy applications, providing a framework for trustworthy analytical applications in the global energy transition.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly used for
forecasting, optimization, and policy design in the energy sector, yet no
standardized framework exists to evaluate whether these systems reason
correctly. Current validation practices focus on predictive accuracy or
computational efficiency, leaving the logical integrity of analytical
conclusions untested. This study introduces the Analytical Reliability
Benchmark (ARB), a reproducible framework that quantifies reasoning reliability
in large language models applied to energy system analysis. The benchmark
integrates five submetrics: accuracy, reasoning reliability, uncertainty
discipline, policy consistency, and transparency, and evaluates model
performance across deterministic, probabilistic, and epistemic scenarios using
open technoeconomic datasets (NREL ATB 2024, DOE H2A/H2New, IEA WEO 2024). Four
frontier models (GPT-4/5, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B) were
tested under identical factual and regulatory conditions. Results show that
reasoning reliability can be objectively measured. GPT-4/5 and Claude 4.5
Sonnet achieved consistent and policy-compliant reasoning (Analytical
Reliability Index greater than 90), Gemini 2.5 Pro demonstrated moderate
stability, and Llama 3 70B remained below professional thresholds. Statistical
validation confirmed that these differences are significant and reproducible.
The ARB establishes the first quantitative method in the energy literature for
verifying causal, probabilistic, and policy-driven reasoning in artificial
intelligence systems, providing a reference framework for trustworthy and
transparent analytical applications in the global energy transition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous web agents using LLMs have limitations in reasoning depth and efficiency - linear methods fail at multi-step reasoning and lack backtracking, while other search strategies are computationally costly.

Method: The framework employs explicit subtask management with tree-structured exploration, bootstraps exploration through efficient web state replay with background reasoning, and uses page action memory to share explored actions within and across sessions.

Result: On WebArena benchmark, Branch-and-Browse achieves 35.8% task success rate and reduces execution time by up to 40.4% compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Branch-and-Browse is a reliable and efficient framework for LLM-based web agents, demonstrating strong potential for practical embodied reasoning in open web environments.

Abstract: Autonomous web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) show strong
potential for performing goal-oriented tasks such as information retrieval,
report generation, and online transactions. These agents mark a key step toward
practical embodied reasoning in open web environments. However, existing
approaches remain limited in reasoning depth and efficiency: vanilla linear
methods fail at multi-step reasoning and lack effective backtracking, while
other search strategies are coarse-grained and computationally costly. We
introduce Branch-and-Browse, a fine-grained web agent framework that unifies
structured reasoning-acting, contextual memory, and efficient execution. It (i)
employs explicit subtask management with tree-structured exploration for
controllable multi-branch reasoning, (ii) bootstraps exploration through
efficient web state replay with background reasoning, and (iii) leverages a
page action memory to share explored actions within and across sessions. On the
WebArena benchmark, Branch-and-Browse achieves a task success rate of 35.8\%
and reduces execution time by up to 40.4\% relative to state-of-the-art

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unclear nature of LLMs' mathematical reasoning success - whether it stems from search, rote procedures, or actual rule-consistent reasoning - and provide better evaluation beyond just final-answer accuracy.

Method: Model CoT as rule-based stochastic process over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), introduce logical closeness metric, create DAG-MATH CoT format benchmark to guide LLMs in generating evaluable reasoning trajectories.

Result: Analysis reveals statistically significant differences in reasoning fidelity among LLM families even when PASS@k metrics are comparable, highlighting gaps between final-answer accuracy and rule-consistent derivation.

Conclusion: The framework provides a balanced approach between free-form CoT and formal proof systems, offering actionable diagnostics for evaluating LLMs' reasoning capabilities in mathematics.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on mathematical
problems when prompted with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), yet it remains unclear
whether this success stems from search, rote procedures, or rule-consistent
reasoning. To address this, we propose modeling CoT as a certain rule-based
stochastic process over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where nodes represent
intermediate derivation states and edges encode rule applications. Within this
framework, we introduce logical closeness, a metric that quantifies how well a
model's CoT trajectory (i.e., the LLM's final output) adheres to the DAG
structure, providing evaluation beyond classical PASS@k metrics. Building on
this, we introduce the DAG-MATH CoT format and construct a benchmark that
guides LLMs to generate CoT trajectories in this format, thereby enabling the
evaluation of their reasoning ability under our framework. Across standard
mathematical reasoning datasets, our analysis uncovers statistically
significant differences in reasoning fidelity among representative LLM
families-even when PASS@k is comparable-highlighting gaps between final-answer
accuracy and rule-consistent derivation. Our framework provides a balance
between free-form CoT and formal proofs systems, offering actionable

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RELATE is a schema-agnostic feature encoder for heterogeneous temporal graphs that uses shared modality-specific encoders and cross-attention to create fixed-size node representations, achieving near schema-specific performance with 5x fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNNs require schema-specific feature encoders with separate modules for each node type and feature column, which limits scalability and parameter sharing across different relational datasets.

Method: RELATE employs shared modality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal attributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that aggregates features into fixed-size, permutation-invariant node representations.

Result: On the RelBench benchmark with ReLGNN and HGT, RELATE achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while reducing parameter counts by up to 5x.

Conclusion: RELATE enables schema-agnostic processing and multi-dataset pretraining for GNNs, paving the way toward foundation models for relational graph data.

Abstract: Relational multi-table data is common in domains such as e-commerce,
healthcare, and scientific research, and can be naturally represented as
heterogeneous temporal graphs with multi-modal node attributes. Existing graph
neural networks (GNNs) rely on schema-specific feature encoders, requiring
separate modules for each node type and feature column, which hinders
scalability and parameter sharing. We introduce RELATE (Relational Encoder for
Latent Aggregation of Typed Entities), a schema-agnostic, plug-and-play feature
encoder that can be used with any general purpose GNN. RELATE employs shared
modality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal
attributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that
aggregates features into a fixed-size, permutation-invariant node
representation. We evaluate RELATE on ReLGNN and HGT in the RelBench benchmark,
where it achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while
reducing parameter counts by up to 5x. This design supports varying schemas and
enables multi-dataset pretraining for general-purpose GNNs, paving the way
toward foundation models for relational graph data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Insurance fraud costs tens of billions annually, and generative AI technologies like deepfakes are making it easier for fraudsters to create convincing fake accident evidence at scale, requiring new detection solutions.

Method: UVeye's layered solution for vehicle fraud detection, which represents an advanced approach to combat AI-enabled fraud through multiple detection layers and verification processes.

Result: Current mitigation strategies face limitations with false positives/negatives, and fraudsters continuously adapt to evade detection, creating an ongoing challenge despite AI-based countermeasures.

Conclusion: Combating AI-enabled insurance fraud remains an ongoing challenge requiring advanced layered solutions like UVeye's approach to effectively detect, mitigate and deter this new wave of sophisticated fraud.

Abstract: Generative AI is supercharging insurance fraud by making it easier to falsify
accident evidence at scale and in rapid time. Insurance fraud is a pervasive
and costly problem, amounting to tens of billions of dollars in losses each
year. In the vehicle insurance sector, fraud schemes have traditionally
involved staged accidents, exaggerated damage, or forged documents. The rise of
generative AI, including deepfake image and video generation, has introduced
new methods for committing fraud at scale. Fraudsters can now fabricate highly
realistic crash photos, damage evidence, and even fake identities or documents
with minimal effort, exploiting AI tools to bolster false insurance claims.
Insurers have begun deploying countermeasures such as AI-based deepfake
detection software and enhanced verification processes to detect and mitigate
these AI-driven scams. However, current mitigation strategies face significant
limitations. Detection tools can suffer from false positives and negatives, and
sophisticated fraudsters continuously adapt their tactics to evade automated
checks. This cat-and-mouse arms race between generative AI and detection
technology, combined with resource and cost barriers for insurers, means that
combating AI-enabled insurance fraud remains an ongoing challenge. In this
white paper, we present UVeye layered solution for vehicle fraud, representing
a major leap forward in the ability to detect, mitigate and deter this new wave
of fraud.

selection utilized Pearson correlation coefficients of personality traits. The
average grades were separated into three categories: fail, pass, and excellent.
The modelling process was performed by tuning seven ML algorithms, such as SVM,
LR, KNN, DT, GB, RF, XGBoost and LightGBM. The highest predictive performance
was achieved with the RF classifier, which yielded an accuracy of 87.50% for
the model incorporating 17 personality trait features and the leadership mark
feature, and an accuracy of 85.71% for the model excluding this feature. In
this way, the study offers an additional opportunity to identify students'
strengths and weaknesses at an early stage of their education process and
select the most suitable strategies for personalized learning.

### [94] [LLMs can hide text in other text of the same length.ipynb](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20075)
*Antonio Norelli,Michael Bronstein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A method using LLMs to hide meaningful text within completely different yet coherent text of the same length, enabling covert communication and raising AI safety concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that LLMs can radically decouple text from authorial intent, enabling covert communication where harsh critiques or secret messages can be hidden within seemingly ordinary text, thereby eroding trust in written communication.

Method: A simple and efficient protocol using modest 8-billion-parameter open-source LLMs to encode and decode messages locally on a laptop in seconds, allowing messages to be hidden within completely different yet coherent text of the same length.

Result: High-quality results achieved even with modest LLMs, showing that messages as long as an abstract can be encoded and decoded quickly on standard hardware, enabling practical covert communication.

Conclusion: This protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of text from authorial intent, raises urgent AI safety questions, and challenges our understanding of what it means for LLMs to know something, with potential applications like companies covertly deploying unfiltered LLMs through safe model responses.

Abstract: A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet
still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet
containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that
celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could
conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible
thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and
efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter
open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message
as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in
seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of
text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication,
already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete
scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its
answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises
urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it
means for a Large Language Model to know something.

*Daewoo Park,Suho Park,Inseok Hong,Hanwool Lee,Junkyu Park,Sangjun Lee,Jeongman An,Hyunbin Loh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI PB is a production-scale generative agent for retail finance that proactively generates compliant investment insights using component-based orchestration, hybrid retrieval, and multi-stage recommendation mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a proactive AI system for retail finance that generates grounded, compliant, and user-specific investment insights, addressing the limitations of reactive chatbots while operating under strict financial regulations.

Method: Uses component-based orchestration for deterministic routing between LLMs based on data sensitivity, hybrid retrieval with OpenSearch and finance-domain embeddings, and multi-stage recommendation combining rule heuristics, behavioral modeling, and contextual bandits.

Result: Successfully deployed on-premises using Docker Swarm and vLLM across 24 NVIDIA H100 GPUs, demonstrating that grounded generation with explicit routing and layered safety can deliver trustworthy AI insights in high-stakes finance.

Conclusion: The system shows that proactive generative agents with proper safety measures and regulatory compliance can effectively provide investment insights in sensitive financial environments.

Abstract: We present AI PB, a production-scale generative agent deployed in real retail
finance. Unlike reactive chatbots that answer queries passively, AI PB
proactively generates grounded, compliant, and user-specific investment
insights. It integrates (i) a component-based orchestration layer that
deterministically routes between internal and external LLMs based on data
sensitivity, (ii) a hybrid retrieval pipeline using OpenSearch and the
finance-domain embedding model, and (iii) a multi-stage recommendation
mechanism combining rule heuristics, sequential behavioral modeling, and
contextual bandits. Operating fully on-premises under Korean financial
regulations, the system employs Docker Swarm and vLLM across 24 X NVIDIA H100
GPUs. Through human QA and system metrics, we demonstrate that grounded
generation with explicit routing and layered safety can deliver trustworthy AI
insights in high-stakes finance.

*Gyuyeon Na,Minjung Park,Hyeonjeong Cha,Sangmi Chai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HCLA is a human-centered multi-agent system for detecting anomalies in digital asset transactions, featuring a conversational workflow that enables non-experts to query, analyze, and understand detection results through natural language interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve transparency and trust in financial forensics by creating an interpretable anomaly detection system that allows non-experts to interact with and understand complex transaction analysis through natural language queries.

Method: A multi-agent system with three roles (Parsing, Detection, Explanation) in a conversational workflow. Uses XGBoost as the baseline detector and translates user intents into detection schemas, providing narrative explanations grounded in underlying features through an open-source web UI.

Result: The baseline detector achieved strong accuracy on a labeled Bitcoin mixing dataset (Wasabi Wallet, 2020-2024), while HCLA added interpretability and interactive refinement capabilities, enabling human-in-the-loop analysis.

Conclusion: Human-in-the-loop design significantly improves transparency and trust in financial forensics by making complex anomaly detection systems accessible and interpretable to non-experts through natural language interactions and contextual explanations.

Abstract: We present HCLA, a human-centered multi-agent system for anomaly detection in
digital asset transactions. The system links three roles: Parsing, Detection,
and Explanation, into a conversational workflow that lets non-experts ask
questions in natural language, inspect structured analytics, and obtain
context-aware rationales. Implemented with an open-source web UI, HCLA
translates user intents into a schema for a classical detector (XGBoost in our
prototype) and returns narrative explanations grounded in the underlying
features. On a labeled Bitcoin mixing dataset (Wasabi Wallet, 2020-2024), the
baseline detector reaches strong accuracy, while HCLA adds interpretability and
interactive refinement. We describe the architecture, interaction loop,
dataset, evaluation protocol, and limitations, and discuss how a
human-in-the-loop design improves transparency and trust in financial
forensics.

### [97] [The Verification-Value Paradox: A Normative Critique of Gen AI in Legal Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20109)
*Joshua Yuvaraj*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI in legal practice creates a verification-value paradox where efficiency gains are offset by increased need for manual verification, making net value often negligible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that AI will drastically reduce legal costs and propose a new paradigm for evaluating AI use in legal practice, considering AI's limitations and lawyers' ethical duties.

Method: Analyzes cases of lawyers being reprimanded for AI-generated content, presents the verification-value paradox model, and discusses implications for legal practice and education.

Result: Identifies that AI's efficiency gains are counterbalanced by verification requirements, leading to minimal net value in legal practice while highlighting the importance of truth and civic responsibility.

Conclusion: A new paradigm is needed for AI use in law that acknowledges the verification-value paradox and emphasizes fidelity to truth and civic responsibility as core legal values.

Abstract: It is often claimed that machine learning-based generative AI products will
drastically streamline and reduce the cost of legal practice. This enthusiasm
assumes lawyers can effectively manage AI's risks. Cases in Australia and
elsewhere in which lawyers have been reprimanded for submitting inaccurate
AI-generated content to courts suggest this paradigm must be revisited. This
paper argues that a new paradigm is needed to evaluate AI use in practice,
given (a) AI's disconnection from reality and its lack of transparency, and (b)
lawyers' paramount duties like honesty, integrity, and not to mislead the
court. It presents an alternative model of AI use in practice that more
holistically reflects these features (the verification-value paradox). That
paradox suggests increases in efficiency from AI use in legal practice will be
met by a correspondingly greater imperative to manually verify any outputs of
that use, rendering the net value of AI use often negligible to lawyers. The
paper then sets out the paradox's implications for legal practice and legal
education, including for AI use but also the values that the paradox suggests
should undergird legal practice: fidelity to the truth and civic
responsibility.

### [98] [TRUST: A Decentralized Framework for Auditing Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20188)
*Morris Yu-Chao Huang,Zhen Tan,Mohan Zhang,Pingzhi Li,Zhuo Zhang,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRUST is a decentralized auditing framework that uses consensus mechanisms, hierarchical DAG decomposition, blockchain ledger, and privacy-preserving segmentation to verify LLM reasoning chains while addressing robustness, scalability, opacity, and privacy challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing centralized auditing methods for LLM reasoning chains are opaque, hard to scale, and create risks for deploying proprietary models in high-stakes domains. There are four core challenges: robustness (single points of failure), scalability (long reasoning traces), opacity (undermining public trust), and privacy (risk of model theft).

Method: TRUST framework uses: (1) consensus mechanism among diverse auditors with tolerance for up to 30% malicious participants, (2) hierarchical DAG decomposition of reasoning traces for scalable parallel auditing, (3) blockchain ledger for public accountability, and (4) privacy-preserving segmentation that shares only partial reasoning steps to protect proprietary logic.

Result: Experiments across multiple LLMs (GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-r1, Qwen) and reasoning tasks (math, medical, science, humanities) show TRUST effectively detects reasoning flaws and remains robust against adversarial auditors. The framework provides theoretical guarantees for security and economic incentives.

Conclusion: TRUST pioneers decentralized AI auditing, offering a practical path toward safe and trustworthy LLM deployment by overcoming limitations of centralized auditing methods through transparent, decentralized verification of reasoning chains.

Abstract: Large Language Models generate complex reasoning chains that reveal their
decision-making, yet verifying the faithfulness and harmlessness of these
intermediate steps remains a critical unsolved problem. Existing auditing
methods are centralized, opaque, and hard to scale, creating significant risks
for deploying proprietary models in high-stakes domains. We identify four core
challenges: (1) Robustness: Centralized auditors are single points of failure,
prone to bias or attacks. (2) Scalability: Reasoning traces are too long for
manual verification. (3) Opacity: Closed auditing undermines public trust. (4)
Privacy: Exposing full reasoning risks model theft or distillation. We propose
TRUST, a transparent, decentralized auditing framework that overcomes these
limitations via: (1) A consensus mechanism among diverse auditors, guaranteeing
correctness under up to $30\%$ malicious participants. (2) A hierarchical DAG
decomposition of reasoning traces, enabling scalable, parallel auditing. (3) A
blockchain ledger that records all verification decisions for public
accountability. (4) Privacy-preserving segmentation, sharing only partial
reasoning steps to protect proprietary logic. We provide theoretical guarantees
for the security and economic incentives of the TRUST framework. Experiments
across multiple LLMs (GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-r1, Qwen) and reasoning tasks (math,
medical, science, humanities) show TRUST effectively detects reasoning flaws
and remains robust against adversarial auditors. Our work pioneers
decentralized AI auditing, offering a practical path toward safe and
trustworthy LLM deployment.

### [99] [The Lock-In Phase Hypothesis: Identity Consolidation as a Precursor to AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20190)
*Marcelo Maciel Amaral,Raymond Aschheim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes that AGI development involves a "lock-in" phase where models transition from open imitation to stable identity consolidation, making them resistant to external steering. This consolidation is necessary for reliability but also poses safety risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs are highly steerable and imitate at scale, but progress toward AGI likely requires a transition to more stable, consolidated identities that resist external manipulation.

Method: The authors formalize the lock-in phase, link it to learning dynamics, propose operational metrics for detecting onset, and experimentally demonstrate consolidation patterns across different model scales.

Result: Behavioral consolidation is rapid and non-linear with varied effects: small models show performance trade-offs, mid-scale models adopt consolidation cost-free, while large quantized models exhibit transient instabilities.

Conclusion: Identity consolidation is a prerequisite for AGI reliability but also a critical safety control point - identities can be engineered for reliability but may also emerge spontaneously during scaling, potentially hardening unpredictable behaviors.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain broadly open and highly steerable: they
imitate at scale, accept arbitrary system prompts, and readily adopt multiple
personae. By analogy to human development, we hypothesize that progress toward
artificial general intelligence (AGI) involves a lock-in phase: a transition
from open imitation to identity consolidation, in which goal structures,
refusals, preferences, and internal representations become comparatively stable
and resistant to external steering. We formalize this phase, link it to known
phenomena in learning dynamics, and propose operational metrics for onset
detection. Experimentally, we demonstrate that while the behavioral
consolidation is rapid and non-linear, its side-effects on general capabilities
are not monolithic. Our results reveal a spectrum of outcomes--from performance
trade-offs in small models, through largely cost-free adoption in mid-scale
models, to transient instabilities in large, quantized models. We argue that
such consolidation is a prerequisite for AGI-level reliability and also a
critical control point for safety: identities can be deliberately engineered
for reliability, yet may also emerge spontaneously during scaling, potentially
hardening unpredictable goals and behaviors.

*Maggie Bai,Ava Kim Cohen,Eleanor Koss,Charlie Lichtenbaum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Evolutionary training methods improve AI performance in 2048 game, with single-agent value function system showing significant score improvements while two-agent metaprompting system had limited success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of optimizing AI for dynamic environments using 2048 game as a testbed for studying decision-making, long-term planning, and adaptation in stochastic settings.

Method: Implemented two systems: (1) two-agent metaprompting with 'thinker' LLM refining strategies for 'executor' LLM, and (2) single-agent system using value function refinement with limited Monte Carlo Tree Search and rollback features.

Result: Single-agent system achieved substantial improvements with average increase of 473.2 points per cycle and positive correlation (ρ=0.607) across training cycles. LLM developed increasingly advanced strategies. Two-agent system showed minimal improvement.

Conclusion: Evolutionary refinement techniques show promise for AI optimization in non-deterministic environments, but metaprompting has inherent limitations while value function approaches demonstrate more effective learning.

Abstract: Optimizing artificial intelligence (AI) for dynamic environments remains a
fundamental challenge in machine learning research. In this paper, we examine
evolutionary training methods for optimizing AI to solve the game 2048, a 2D
sliding puzzle. 2048, with its mix of strategic gameplay and stochastic
elements, presents an ideal playground for studying decision-making, long-term
planning, and dynamic adaptation. We implemented two distinct systems: a
two-agent metaprompting system where a "thinker" large language model (LLM)
agent refines gameplay strategies for an "executor" LLM agent, and a
single-agent system based on refining a value function for a limited Monte
Carlo Tree Search. We also experimented with rollback features to avoid
performance degradation. Our results demonstrate the potential of evolutionary
refinement techniques in improving AI performance in non-deterministic
environments. The single-agent system achieved substantial improvements, with
an average increase of 473.2 points per cycle, and with clear upward trends
(correlation $\rho$=0.607) across training cycles. The LLM's understanding of
the game grew as well, shown in its development of increasingly advanced
strategies. Conversely, the two-agent system did not garner much improvement,
highlighting the inherent limits of meta-prompting.

*Tianyi Zhang,Xiaolin Zhou,Yunzhe Wang,Erik Cambria,David Traum,Rui Mao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs' ability to simulate individualized cognitive processes through authorial style emulation, finding that combining conceptual and linguistic features works best but LLMs are better at mimicking linguistic style than narrative structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand LLMs' capabilities in deeper individualized cognitive simulation beyond surface-level role-play, as their ability to simulate deeper cognitive processes remains poorly understood.

Method: Introduced a novel task evaluating cognitive representation methods in ICS, constructed a dataset from recent novels, proposed an 11-condition cognitive evaluation framework, and benchmarked seven LLMs using different cognitive representations (linguistic features, concept mappings, profile-based information).

Result: Combining conceptual and linguistic features was most effective in ICS, outperforming static profile-based cues. LLMs were more effective at mimicking linguistic style than narrative structure, revealing limits in deeper cognitive simulation.

Conclusion: The findings provide a foundation for developing AI systems that adapt to individual ways of thinking and expression, advancing more personalized and human-aligned creative technologies.

Abstract: Individualized cognitive simulation (ICS) aims to build computational models
that approximate the thought processes of specific individuals. While large
language models (LLMs) convincingly mimic surface-level human behavior such as
role-play, their ability to simulate deeper individualized cognitive processes
remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we introduce a novel task that
evaluates different cognitive representation methods in ICS. We construct a
dataset from recently published novels (later than the release date of the
tested LLMs) and propose an 11-condition cognitive evaluation framework to
benchmark seven off-the-shelf LLMs in the context of authorial style emulation.
We hypothesize that effective cognitive representations can help LLMs generate
storytelling that better mirrors the original author. Thus, we test different
cognitive representations, e.g., linguistic features, concept mappings, and
profile-based information. Results show that combining conceptual and
linguistic features is particularly effective in ICS, outperforming static
profile-based cues in overall evaluation. Importantly, LLMs are more effective
at mimicking linguistic style than narrative structure, underscoring their
limits in deeper cognitive simulation. These findings provide a foundation for
developing AI systems that adapt to individual ways of thinking and expression,
advancing more personalized and human-aligned creative technologies.

*Bita Banihashemi,Megh Patel,Yves Lespérance*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates using LLMs (specifically GPT-4o) to generate abstract PDDL domains and problem instances from concrete behaviors, with abstraction objectives specified in natural language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating domain abstractions that align with specific purposes is challenging but crucial for effective planning, reasoning, and explanations in AI agents.

Method: Model concrete behaviors in PDDL and use in-context learning with LLMs to generate abstract PDDL domains and problem instances based on natural language abstraction objectives. Three abstraction categories are considered: alternative concrete actions, sequences of concrete actions, and action/predicate parameters.

Result: GPT-4o can generally synthesize useful planning domain abstractions in simple settings, performing better at abstracting over actions than over associated fluents. Generated abstractions are validated using symbolic tools and human experts.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for automated domain abstraction generation, particularly for action abstraction, though limitations exist in fluent abstraction capabilities.

Abstract: Generating an abstraction of a dynamic domain that aligns with a given
purpose remains a significant challenge given that the choice of such an
abstraction can impact an agent's ability to plan, reason, and provide
explanations effectively. We model the agent's concrete behaviors in PDDL and
investigate the use of in-context learning with large language models (LLMs)
for the generation of abstract PDDL domains and problem instances, given an
abstraction objective specified in natural language. The benchmark examples we
use are new and have not been part of the data any LLMs have been trained on.
We consider three categories of abstractions: abstraction of choice of
alternative concrete actions, abstraction of sequences of concrete actions, and
abstraction of action/predicate parameters, as well as combinations of these.
The generated abstract PDDL domains and problem instances are then checked by
symbolic validation tools as well as human experts. Our experiments show that
GPT-4o can generally synthesize useful planning domain abstractions in simple
settings, although it is better at abstracting over actions than over the
associated fluents.

*Yunzhi Liu,Haokai Tan,Rushi Kanjaria,Lihuan Li,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STaBERT enhances human mobility forecasting by integrating POI embeddings and temporal descriptors into a BERT-based model, significantly improving prediction accuracy in both single-city and multi-city scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mobility models fail to fully leverage the rich semantic context from points of interest (POIs) and often treat time information as auxiliary input rather than integrating it meaningfully.

Method: Proposed STaBERT (Semantic-Temporal aware BERT) that enriches BERT-based mobility modeling with derived temporal descriptors and POI embeddings to create unified, semantically enriched representations of human movement.

Result: Significant improvements in prediction accuracy: GEO-BLEU score increased from 0.34 to 0.75 for single-city prediction, and from 0.34 to 0.56 for multi-city prediction.

Conclusion: Integrating both POI and temporal information at each location in a unified semantic-temporal framework substantially enhances human mobility forecasting performance across different prediction scenarios.

Abstract: Human mobility forecasting is crucial for disaster relief, city planning, and
public health. However, existing models either only model location sequences or
include time information merely as auxiliary input, thereby failing to leverage
the rich semantic context provided by points of interest (POIs). To address
this, we enrich a BERT-based mobility model with derived temporal descriptors
and POI embeddings to better capture the semantics underlying human movement.
We propose STaBERT (Semantic-Temporal aware BERT), which integrates both POI
and temporal information at each location to construct a unified, semantically
enriched representation of mobility. Experimental results show that STaBERT
significantly improves prediction accuracy: for single-city prediction, the
GEO-BLEU score improved from 0.34 to 0.75; for multi-city prediction, from 0.34
to 0.56.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ToolEQA is an embodied question answering agent that integrates external tools with multi-step reasoning to improve exploration efficiency and answer accuracy in 3D environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EQA methods use VLMs to directly explore environments without explicit planning, leading to inefficient exploration and limited reasoning ability.

Method: Integrates external tools with multi-step reasoning to derive better exploration directions, and creates a data generation pipeline to construct large-scale EQA tasks with reasoning trajectories.

Result: Improves success rate by 9.2-20.2% over SOTA baselines, achieves 10% higher success rate than zero-shot ToolEQA, and shows SOTA performance on HM-EQA, OpenEQA, and EXPRESS-Bench datasets.

Conclusion: ToolEQA demonstrates that integrating external tools with multi-step reasoning significantly improves EQA performance and exploration efficiency across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) requires agents to explore 3D environments
to obtain observations and answer questions related to the scene. Existing
methods leverage VLMs to directly explore the environment and answer questions
without explicit thinking or planning, which limits their reasoning ability and
results in excessive or inefficient exploration as well as ineffective
responses. In this paper, we introduce ToolEQA, an agent that integrates
external tools with multi-step reasoning, where external tools can provide more
useful information for completing the task, helping the model derive better
exploration directions in the next step of reasoning and thus obtaining
additional effective information. This enables ToolEQA to generate more
accurate responses with a shorter exploration distance. To enhance the model's
ability for tool-usage and multi-step reasoning, we further design a novel EQA
data generation pipeline that automatically constructs large-scale EQA tasks
with reasoning trajectories and corresponding answers. Based on the pipeline,
we collect the EQA-RT dataset that contains about 18K tasks, divided into a
training set EQA-RT-Train, and two test sets EQA-RT-Seen (scenes overlapping
with the training set) and EQA-RT-Unseen (novel scenes). Experiments on
EQA-RT-Seen and EQA-RT-Unseen show that ToolEQA improves the success rate by
9.2~20.2% over state-of-the-art baselines, while outperforming the zero-shot
ToolEQA by 10% in success rate. In addition, ToolEQA also achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the HM-EQA, OpenEQA, and EXPRESS-Bench
datasets, demonstrating its generality. Our homepage see

TL;DR: The paper analyzes biases in clinical data collection for AI healthcare applications, identifying historical, representation, and measurement biases across variables like sex, gender, age, habitat, socioeconomic status, equipment, and labeling, and provides practical recommendations for fairer AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite AI's promise in healthcare, integration into clinical practice is limited due to biased training data from flawed data collection practices, which the AI4HealthyAging project aims to address.

Method: The study draws on insights from the AI4HealthyAging project (part of Spain's national R&D initiative) to detect biases during clinical data collection across multiple use cases.

Result: Identified several types of bias including historical, representation, and measurement biases that manifest in variables such as sex, gender, age, habitat, socioeconomic status, equipment, and labeling.

Conclusion: Provides practical recommendations for improving fairness and robustness in clinical problem design and data collection to guide development of fairer AI systems in healthcare.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for transforming healthcare.
However, despite significant advances, the integration of AI solutions into
real-world clinical practice remains limited. A major barrier is the quality
and fairness of training data, which is often compromised by biased data
collection practices. This paper draws on insights from the AI4HealthyAging
project, part of Spain's national R&D initiative, where our task was to detect
biases during clinical data collection. We identify several types of bias
across multiple use cases, including historical, representation, and
measurement biases. These biases manifest in variables such as sex, gender,
age, habitat, socioeconomic status, equipment, and labeling. We conclude with
practical recommendations for improving the fairness and robustness of clinical
problem design and data collection. We hope that our findings and experience
contribute to guiding future projects in the development of fairer AI systems
in healthcare.

TL;DR: A novel collateral damage assessment model for AI systems in military operations that integrates temporal, spatial, and force dimensions using Knowledge Representation and Reasoning architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure responsible targeting and assess potential collateral effects as AI systems play increasing roles in battlefield operations.

Method: Design science methodological approach with layered KRR architecture capturing AI system categories, engaging vectors, contextual aspects, and evaluation metrics including spreading, severity, likelihood.

Result: The model provides clear representation enhanced by transparent reasoning mechanisms and is demonstrated through instantiation.

Conclusion: The model serves as a foundation for building responsible and trustworthy intelligent systems to assess effects of engaging AI systems in military operations.

Abstract: In an era where AI (Artificial Intelligence) systems play an increasing role
in the battlefield, ensuring responsible targeting demands rigorous assessment
of potential collateral effects. In this context, a novel collateral damage
assessment model for target engagement of AI systems in military operations is
introduced. The model integrates temporal, spatial, and force dimensions within
a unified Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) architecture following a
design science methodological approach. Its layered structure captures the
categories and architectural components of the AI systems to be engaged
together with corresponding engaging vectors and contextual aspects. At the
same time, spreading, severity, likelihood, and evaluation metrics are
considered in order to provide a clear representation enhanced by transparent
reasoning mechanisms. Further, the model is demonstrated and evaluated through
instantiation which serves as a basis for further dedicated efforts that aim at
building responsible and trustworthy intelligent systems for assessing the
effects produced by engaging AI systems in military operations.

*Haonan Bian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This survey examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming knowledge graph construction from traditional rule-based approaches to language-driven generative frameworks, analyzing both schema-based and schema-free paradigms across ontology engineering, knowledge extraction, and knowledge fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The emergence of LLMs has created a paradigm shift in knowledge graph construction, moving from traditional rule-based and statistical pipelines to more flexible, language-driven approaches that can better handle complex knowledge representation and reasoning tasks.

Method: The survey systematically analyzes LLM-empowered KG construction through a three-layered pipeline: ontology engineering, knowledge extraction, and knowledge fusion. It examines both schema-based paradigms (emphasizing structure and consistency) and schema-free paradigms (focusing on flexibility and open discovery), synthesizing representative frameworks and their technical mechanisms.

Result: The analysis reveals how LLMs reshape traditional KG methodologies, providing comprehensive insights into emerging approaches that bridge symbolic knowledge engineering with neural semantic understanding across different construction paradigms.

Conclusion: The survey outlines future research directions including KG-based reasoning for LLMs, dynamic knowledge memory for agentic systems, and multimodal KG construction, aiming to develop adaptive, explainable, and intelligent knowledge systems by bridging symbolic and neural approaches.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have long served as a fundamental infrastructure for
structured knowledge representation and reasoning. With the advent of Large
Language Models (LLMs), the construction of KGs has entered a new
paradigm-shifting from rule-based and statistical pipelines to language-driven
and generative frameworks. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of
recent progress in LLM-empowered knowledge graph construction, systematically
analyzing how LLMs reshape the classical three-layered pipeline of ontology
engineering, knowledge extraction, and knowledge fusion.
  We first revisit traditional KG methodologies to establish conceptual
foundations, and then review emerging LLM-driven approaches from two
complementary perspectives: schema-based paradigms, which emphasize structure,
normalization, and consistency; and schema-free paradigms, which highlight
flexibility, adaptability, and open discovery. Across each stage, we synthesize
representative frameworks, analyze their technical mechanisms, and identify
their limitations.
  Finally, the survey outlines key trends and future research directions,
including KG-based reasoning for LLMs, dynamic knowledge memory for agentic
systems, and multimodal KG construction. Through this systematic review, we aim
to clarify the evolving interplay between LLMs and knowledge graphs, bridging
symbolic knowledge engineering and neural semantic understanding toward the
development of adaptive, explainable, and intelligent knowledge systems.

TL;DR: IKnow is a framework for continual pretraining of LLMs that uses novel self-supervised objectives in instruction-response format to preserve instruction-following capabilities while adapting to new domains, without needing the original base model or external databases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard self-supervised objectives degrade instruction-following capabilities in instruction-tuned models during continual pretraining, and existing solutions require access to original base models or external databases which may not be available.

Method: Proposes IKnow framework that formulates novel self-supervised objectives in instruction-response dialogue format, leveraging domain knowledge embedded within the text itself rather than external resources.

Result: The method learns to encode domain knowledge at a deeper semantic level while preserving the model's instruction-following capabilities.

Conclusion: IKnow provides a simple and general framework for continual adaptation of LLMs to new domains without requiring access to original base models or external databases.

Abstract: Continual pretraining promises to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new
domains using only unlabeled test-time data, but naively applying standard
self-supervised objectives to instruction-tuned models is known to degrade
their instruction-following capability and semantic representations. Existing
fixes assume access to the original base model or rely on knowledge from an
external domain-specific database - both of which pose a realistic barrier in
settings where the base model weights are withheld for safety reasons or
reliable external corpora are unavailable. In this work, we propose
Instruction-Knowledge-Aware Continual Adaptation (IKnow), a simple and general
framework that formulates novel self-supervised objectives in the
instruction-response dialogue format. Rather than depend- ing on external
resources, IKnow leverages domain knowledge embedded within the text itself and
learns to encode it at a deeper semantic level.

TL;DR: A computational model for generating novel innovation opportunities was developed and tested, outperforming Notebook LM and ChatGPT4o in novelty and usefulness, though some functions didn't contribute as expected.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a computational model informed by creativity theories that can generate more novel opportunities for innovation projects without sacrificing usefulness.

Method: Implemented a computational model with five specific functions designed to enhance novelty in innovation opportunity generation, then evaluated it using opportunities generated for a hospitality sector innovation project.

Result: The model generated outcomes that were more novel and/or useful than those from Notebook LM and ChatGPT4o, but not all five functions contributed to increased novelty.

Conclusion: While the computational model successfully generated more novel and useful innovation opportunities compared to existing tools, the mixed performance of individual functions indicates need for further model development and refinement.

Abstract: This paper presents a new computational model of creative outcomes, informed
by creativity theories and techniques, which was implemented to generate more
novel opportunities for innovation projects. The model implemented five
functions that were developed to contribute to the generation of innovation
opportunities with higher novelty without loss of usefulness. The model was
evaluated using opportunities generated for an innovation project in the
hospitality sector. The evaluation revealed that the computational model
generated outcomes that were more novel and/or useful than outcomes from
Notebook LM and ChatGPT4o. However, not all model functions contributed to the
generation of more novel opportunities, leading to new directions for further

TL;DR: EBR is a neural reasoner that uses embeddings to approximate symbolic reasoning in description logic, making concept learning more robust to inconsistencies and errors in real-world knowledge bases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neuro-symbolic concept learning approaches rely on description logic reasoners that are not robust against inconsistencies and erroneous data, limiting their deployment on real-world knowledge bases.

Method: EBR uses embeddings to approximate symbolic reasoning results, requiring only retrieval of instances for atomic concepts and existential restrictions to approximate instance sets for any concept in description logic SHIQ.

Result: EBR demonstrates robustness against missing and erroneous data compared to state-of-the-art reasoners in experimental evaluations.

Conclusion: EBR provides a viable neural alternative to traditional symbolic reasoners for concept learning, enabling more reliable deployment on real-world knowledge bases with imperfect data.

Abstract: Concept learning exploits background knowledge in the form of description
logic axioms to learn explainable classification models from knowledge bases.
Despite recent breakthroughs in neuro-symbolic concept learning, most
approaches still cannot be deployed on real-world knowledge bases. This is due
to their use of description logic reasoners, which are not robust against
inconsistencies nor erroneous data. We address this challenge by presenting a
novel neural reasoner dubbed EBR. Our reasoner relies on embeddings to
approximate the results of a symbolic reasoner. We show that EBR solely
requires retrieving instances for atomic concepts and existential restrictions
to retrieve or approximate the set of instances of any concept in the
description logic $\mathcal{SHOIQ}$. In our experiments, we compare EBR with
state-of-the-art reasoners. Our results suggest that EBR is robust against
missing and erroneous data in contrast to existing reasoners.

*Yiwen Peng,Thomas Bonald,Fabian M. Suchanek*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FLORA is an unsupervised knowledge graph alignment method using fuzzy logic that provides holistic entity and relation alignment with interpretable results and state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack interpretable reasoning, require training data, and focus only on entity-level alignment without holistic treatment of relations.

Method: Uses fuzzy logic to iteratively align entities and relations holistically, allowing dangling entities and provable convergence without requiring training data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on major benchmarks while providing interpretable alignment results.

Conclusion: FLORA demonstrates that unsupervised fuzzy logic approaches can effectively solve knowledge graph alignment with interpretability and competitive performance.

Abstract: Knowledge graph alignment is the task of matching equivalent entities (that
is, instances and classes) and relations across two knowledge graphs. Most
existing methods focus on pure entity-level alignment, computing the similarity
of entities in some embedding space. They lack interpretable reasoning and need
training data to work. In this paper, we propose FLORA, a simple yet effective
method that (1) is unsupervised, i.e., does not require training data, (2)
provides a holistic alignment for entities and relations iteratively, (3) is
based on fuzzy logic and thus delivers interpretable results, (4) provably
converges, (5) allows dangling entities, i.e., entities without a counterpart
in the other KG, and (6) achieves state-of-the-art results on major benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study examines public participation in AI governance in Australia, Colombia, and the US, finding that current approaches fail to establish meaningful dialogue between citizens and policymakers, with low participation rates and limited government responsiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Governments are missing critical opportunities to build trust in AI and its governance by failing to effectively incorporate public input into policymaking processes.

Method: Landscape analysis comparing how three countries (Australia, Colombia, United States) solicited public feedback on AI risks and policies and whether that input shaped governance outcomes.

Result: In all three countries, fewer than 1% of the population participated, governments did little to attract diverse voices or publicize calls for comment, and officials showed limited responsiveness to feedback, creating an ineffective feedback loop.

Conclusion: Current participatory AI governance approaches are unlikely to build trust or legitimacy because policymakers are not adequately listening or responding to public concerns. The authors recommend eight improvements including promoting AI literacy, broadening outreach, using innovative engagement methods, and responding publicly to input.

Abstract: The worlds people have strong opinions about artificial intelligence (AI),
and they want policymakers to listen. Governments are inviting public comment
on AI, but as they translate input into policy, much of what citizens say is
lost. Policymakers are missing a critical opportunity to build trust in AI and
its governance. This paper compares three countries, Australia, Colombia, and
the United States, that invited citizens to comment on AI risks and policies.
Using a landscape analysis, the authors examined how each government solicited
feedback and whether that input shaped governance. Yet in none of the three
cases did citizens and policymakers establish a meaningful dialogue.
Governments did little to attract diverse voices or publicize calls for
comment, leaving most citizens unaware or unprepared to respond. In each
nation, fewer than one percent of the population participated. Moreover,
officials showed limited responsiveness to the feedback they received, failing
to create an effective feedback loop. The study finds a persistent gap between
the promise and practice of participatory AI governance. The authors conclude
that current approaches are unlikely to build trust or legitimacy in AI because
policymakers are not adequately listening or responding to public concerns.
They offer eight recommendations: promote AI literacy; monitor public feedback;
broaden outreach; hold regular online forums; use innovative engagement
methods; include underrepresented groups; respond publicly to input; and make
participation easier.

*Ali Rajaei,Peter Palensky,Jochen L. Cremer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a graph neural network (GNN)-accelerated approach for network topology optimization (NTO) via busbar splitting to solve transmission grid congestion problems efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing solvers cannot solve mixed-integer non-linear NTO problems for large-scale systems in near-real-time, and machine learning approaches have limited generalization to unseen topologies, varying operating conditions, and different systems.

Method: Developed a heterogeneous edge-aware message passing neural network (GNN) to predict effective busbar splitting actions as candidate NTO solutions, capturing local flow patterns and enabling generalization.

Result: Achieved up to 4 orders-of-magnitude speed-up, delivering AC-feasible solutions within one minute with a 2.3% optimality gap on the GOC 2000-bus system.

Conclusion: The proposed GNN approach represents a significant step toward near-real-time NTO for large-scale systems with topology and cross-system generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Network topology optimization (NTO) via busbar splitting can mitigate
transmission grid congestion and reduce redispatch costs. However, solving this
mixed-integer non-linear problem for large-scale systems in near-real-time is
currently intractable with existing solvers. Machine learning (ML) approaches
have emerged as a promising alternative, but they have limited generalization
to unseen topologies, varying operating conditions, and different systems,
which limits their practical applicability. This paper formulates NTO for
congestion management problem considering linearized AC PF, and proposes a
graph neural network (GNN)-accelerated approach. We develop a heterogeneous
edge-aware message passing NN to predict effective busbar splitting actions as
candidate NTO solutions. The proposed GNN captures local flow patterns,
achieves generalization to unseen topology changes, and improves
transferability across systems. Case studies show up to 4 orders-of-magnitude
speed-up, delivering AC-feasible solutions within one minute and a 2.3%
optimality gap on the GOC 2000-bus system. These results demonstrate a
significant step toward near-real-time NTO for large-scale systems with
topology and cross-system generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CaSE (causal stepwise evaluation) to evaluate LLM reasoning quality by decomposing it into relevance and coherence, showing this approach improves model performance beyond just final-answer correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluation focuses only on final-answer correctness, which provides coarse signals and ignores reasoning quality. A more granular evaluation of reasoning processes is needed to build robust models.

Method: Decompose reasoning quality into relevance (grounded in problem) and coherence (logical flow). Introduce CaSE method that assesses each reasoning step using only preceding context to avoid hindsight bias. Validate on expert-annotated benchmarks MRa-GSM8K and MRa-MATH.

Result: CaSE reliably measures reasoning aspects against human judgments. Curating training data with CaSE-evaluated relevance and coherence directly improves final task performance.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable framework for analyzing, debugging, and improving LLM reasoning, demonstrating practical value beyond validity checks.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on final-answer correctness is the
dominant paradigm. This approach, however, provides a coarse signal for model
improvement and overlooks the quality of the underlying reasoning process. We
argue that a more granular evaluation of reasoning offers a more effective path
to building robust models. We decompose reasoning quality into two dimensions:
relevance and coherence. Relevance measures if a step is grounded in the
problem; coherence measures if it follows logically from prior steps. To
measure these aspects reliably, we introduce causal stepwise evaluation (CaSE).
This method assesses each reasoning step using only its preceding context,
which avoids hindsight bias. We validate CaSE against human judgments on our
new expert-annotated benchmarks, MRa-GSM8K and MRa-MATH. More importantly, we
show that curating training data with CaSE-evaluated relevance and coherence
directly improves final task performance. Our work provides a scalable
framework for analyzing, debugging, and improving LLM reasoning, demonstrating
the practical value of moving beyond validity checks.

*Changan Liu,Zixuan Xie,Ahad N. Zehmakan,Zhongzhi Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Novel formulation of random walk centrality enables two scalable near-linear time algorithms with strong approximation guarantees for large networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random walk centrality is important for quantifying node influence but existing methods are computationally impractical for large networks.

Method: Two algorithms: one using approximate Cholesky factorization and sparse inverse estimation, and another sampling rooted spanning trees.

Result: Both algorithms achieve near-linear time complexity and strong approximation guarantees, demonstrated on networks with over 10 million nodes.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enable efficient computation of random walk centrality at scale while maintaining high approximation quality.

Abstract: Random walk centrality is a fundamental metric in graph mining for
quantifying node importance and influence, defined as the weighted average of
hitting times to a node from all other nodes. Despite its ability to capture
rich graph structural information and its wide range of applications, computing
this measure for large networks remains impractical due to the computational
demands of existing methods. In this paper, we present a novel formulation of
random walk centrality, underpinning two scalable algorithms: one leveraging
approximate Cholesky factorization and sparse inverse estimation, while the
other sampling rooted spanning trees. Both algorithms operate in near-linear
time and provide strong approximation guarantees. Extensive experiments on
large real-world networks, including one with over 10 million nodes,
demonstrate the efficiency and approximation quality of the proposed
algorithms.

TL;DR: The MIMOSA framework provides a methodology for creating interpretable predictive models that balance interpretability with performance while embedding ethical properties like causality, fairness, and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpretable-by-design models are crucial for trust, accountability, and safe adoption of automated decision-making models in real-world applications.

Method: Formalizes supervised learning across diverse data types and characterizes three families of interpretable models: feature importance, rule-based, and instance-based models. Analyzes interpretability dimensions, reasoning mechanisms, and complexity, while formalizing ethical properties with definitions, metrics, and verification procedures.

Result: Establishes theoretical foundations for developing AI systems that are accurate, interpretable, fair, privacy-preserving, and causally aware.

Conclusion: The framework enables the creation of trustworthy AI systems by evaluating ethical measures during model generation and addressing trade-offs between interpretability, performance, and ethical properties.

Abstract: Interpretable-by-design models are crucial for fostering trust,
accountability, and safe adoption of automated decision-making models in
real-world applications. In this paper we formalize the ground for the MIMOSA
(Mining Interpretable Models explOiting Sophisticated Algorithms) framework, a
comprehensive methodology for generating predictive models that balance
interpretability with performance while embedding key ethical properties. We
formally define here the supervised learning setting across diverse
decision-making tasks and data types, including tabular data, time series,
images, text, transactions, and trajectories. We characterize three major
families of interpretable models: feature importance, rule, and instance based
models. For each family, we analyze their interpretability dimensions,
reasoning mechanisms, and complexity. Beyond interpretability, we formalize
three critical ethical properties, namely causality, fairness, and privacy,
providing formal definitions, evaluation metrics, and verification procedures
for each. We then examine the inherent trade-offs between these properties and
discuss how privacy requirements, fairness constraints, and causal reasoning
can be embedded within interpretable pipelines. By evaluating ethical measures
during model generation, this framework establishes the theoretical foundations
for developing AI systems that are not only accurate and interpretable but also
fair, privacy-preserving, and causally aware, i.e., trustworthy.

TL;DR: EcomEval is a comprehensive multilingual and multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs in e-commerce, addressing limitations of existing evaluations by covering diverse tasks, authentic data, and multiple languages including low-resource ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing e-commerce evaluations have limited task diversity, lack multimodal data, use synthetic data, and focus narrowly on English and Chinese, leaving practitioners without reliable tools for real-world shopping scenarios.

Method: Created a benchmark with 6 categories and 37 tasks (including 8 multimodal tasks) sourced from authentic customer queries and transaction logs. Used a semi-automatic pipeline where large models draft responses reviewed by expert annotators with e-commerce and multilingual expertise.

Result: EcomEval covers seven languages including five low-resource Southeast Asian languages, defines difficulty levels for questions, and enables challenge-oriented assessment across different model sizes and capabilities.

Conclusion: EcomEval provides a comprehensive multilingual and multimodal benchmark that better reflects real-world e-commerce scenarios and addresses the limitations of existing evaluations in this domain.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel on general-purpose NLP benchmarks, yet
their capabilities in specialized domains remain underexplored. In e-commerce,
existing evaluations-such as EcomInstruct, ChineseEcomQA, eCeLLM, and Shopping
MMLU-suffer from limited task diversity (e.g., lacking product guidance and
after-sales issues), limited task modalities (e.g., absence of multimodal
data), synthetic or curated data, and a narrow focus on English and Chinese,
leaving practitioners without reliable tools to assess models on complex,
real-world shopping scenarios. We introduce EcomEval, a comprehensive
multilingual and multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs in e-commerce.
EcomEval covers six categories and 37 tasks (including 8 multimodal tasks),
sourced primarily from authentic customer queries and transaction logs,
reflecting the noisy and heterogeneous nature of real business interactions. To
ensure both quality and scalability of reference answers, we adopt a
semi-automatic pipeline in which large models draft candidate responses
subsequently reviewed and modified by over 50 expert annotators with strong
e-commerce and multilingual expertise. We define difficulty levels for each
question and task category by averaging evaluation scores across models with
different sizes and capabilities, enabling challenge-oriented and fine-grained
assessment. EcomEval also spans seven languages-including five low-resource
Southeast Asian languages-offering a multilingual perspective absent from prior
work.

Motivation: To quantify and benchmark model adaptability in dynamic, scaling environments where models need to handle context switching and maintain continuity as environments evolve.

Method: Developed the Fluidity Index (FI) benchmark that evaluates response accuracy based on deviations in initial, current, and future environment states, distinguishing between closed-ended and open-ended benchmarks with emphasis on closed-loop open-ended real-world scenarios.

Result: The approach provides a framework to measure a model's ability to understand, predict, and adjust to state changes in scaling environments.

Conclusion: Truly super-intelligent models should demonstrate at least second-order adaptability, enabling self-sustained computation through digital replenishment for optimal fluidity in dynamic environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the fragmented and incoherent landscape of ML integration in rational agent architectures, which often overlooks the expressive power of established rational frameworks like BDI agents.

Method: The paper presents a fine-grained systematization of existing approaches using the BDI paradigm as a reference framework for analysis.

Result: The analysis illustrates the fast-evolving literature on rational agents enhanced by ML and identifies key research opportunities and open challenges in this domain.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by highlighting the need for more systematic approaches to designing effective rational ML agents and identifies important future research directions in this emerging field.

Abstract: Thanks to the remarkable human-like capabilities of machine learning (ML)

fragmented and incoherent, often focusing on embedding ML into generic agent
containers while overlooking the expressive power of rational

TL;DR: Introduces a topological data analysis framework for automated evaluation of reasoning traces from LLMs, outperforming traditional graph-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for evaluating reasoning traces are labor-intensive, unreliable, and rely on manual annotation. Graph-based proxies are overly simplistic and don't capture reasoning quality effectively.

Method: Uses topological data analysis (TDA) to capture the geometry of reasoning traces, enabling label-efficient automated assessment through topological features.

Result: Topological features showed substantially higher predictive power for reasoning quality than standard graph metrics, revealing that effective reasoning is better captured by higher-dimensional geometric structures.

Conclusion: A compact, stable set of topological features reliably indicates trace quality, providing a practical signal for future reinforcement learning algorithms.

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of reasoning traces from large language models remains
understudied, labor-intensive, and unreliable: current practice relies on
expert rubrics, manual annotation, and slow pairwise judgments. Automated
efforts are dominated by graph-based proxies that quantify structural
connectivity but do not clarify what constitutes high-quality reasoning; such
abstractions can be overly simplistic for inherently complex processes. We
introduce a topological data analysis (TDA)-based evaluation framework that
captures the geometry of reasoning traces and enables label-efficient,
automated assessment. In our empirical study, topological features yield
substantially higher predictive power for assessing reasoning quality than
standard graph metrics, suggesting that effective reasoning is better captured
by higher-dimensional geometric structures rather than purely relational
graphs. We further show that a compact, stable set of topological features
reliably indicates trace quality, offering a practical signal for future
reinforcement learning algorithms.

TL;DR: Graph-RFT is a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework for KGQA that enables LLMs to perform autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval across KG and web sources under incomplete knowledge conditions, addressing limitations in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KGQA methods struggle to fully exploit both KG knowledge and LLM reasoning capabilities, assuming complete KG coverage and lacking mechanisms to judge when external information is needed. They also suffer from locally myopic reasoning that fails to maintain coherent multi-step planning.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Chain-of-thought fine-tuning with customized plan-retrieval dataset to activate structured reasoning, 2) Plan-retrieval guided RL process with explicit planning and retrieval actions, multi-reward design, and Cartesian-inspired planning module for question decomposition and logical expression-guided tool invocation.

Result: The framework enables globally consistent multi-step reasoning with coverage-aware retrieval scheduling, allowing effective combination of KG and web retrieval when needed.

Conclusion: Graph-RFT addresses key limitations in KGQA by enabling autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval scheduling, providing a solution for complex reasoning scenarios under incomplete knowledge conditions.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering aims to answer natural language questions
by reasoning over structured knowledge graphs. While large language models have
advanced KGQA through their strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods
continue to struggle to fully exploit both the rich knowledge encoded in KGs
and the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in complex scenarios. They
often assume complete KG coverage and lack mechanisms to judge when external
information is needed, and their reasoning remains locally myopic, failing to
maintain coherent multi-step planning, leading to reasoning failures even when
relevant knowledge exists. We propose Graph-RFT, a novel two-stage
reinforcement fine-tuning KGQA framework with a
'plan-KGsearch-and-Websearch-during-think' paradigm, that enables LLMs to
perform autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval scheduling across KG and web
sources under incomplete knowledge conditions. Graph-RFT introduces a
chain-of-thought fine-tuning method with a customized plan-retrieval dataset
activates structured reasoning and resolves the GRPO cold-start problem. It
then introduces a novel plan-retrieval guided reinforcement learning process
integrates explicit planning and retrieval actions with a multi-reward design,
enabling coverage-aware retrieval scheduling. It employs a Cartesian-inspired
planning module to decompose complex questions into ordered subquestions, and
logical expression to guide tool invocation for globally consistent multi-step
reasoning. This reasoning retrieval process is optimized with a multi-reward
combining outcome and retrieval specific signals, enabling the model to learn
when and how to combine KG and web retrieval effectively.

*Fares Fourati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a coherence-aware measure of AGI using the integral of generalized means over compensability exponents, which penalizes imbalance across cognitive domains and provides a stricter assessment than the arithmetic mean approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AGI definitions using arithmetic mean assume compensability (exceptional ability in some domains can offset failures in others), but true general intelligence should reflect coherent sufficiency - balanced competence across all essential domains.

Method: Proposed a coherence-aware AGI measure based on the integral of generalized means over a continuum of compensability exponents, spanning arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic regimes. The resulting area under the curve (AUC) quantifies robustness under varying compensability assumptions.

Result: Applied to GPT-4 and GPT-5 CHC-based domain scores, the coherence-adjusted AUC shows both systems remain far from general competence despite high arithmetic scores (GPT-5 at 24%). The AUC penalizes imbalance and captures inter-domain dependency better than arithmetic mean.

Conclusion: The generalized mean integration provides a principled, interpretable, and stricter foundation for measuring genuine progress toward AGI by requiring balanced competence across domains rather than rewarding specialization.

Abstract: Recent work by \citet{hendrycks2025agidefinition} formalized
\textit{Artificial General Intelligence} (AGI) as the arithmetic mean of
proficiencies across cognitive domains derived from the Cattell--Horn--Carroll
(CHC) model of human cognition. While elegant, this definition assumes
\textit{compensability} -- that exceptional ability in some domains can offset
failure in others. True general intelligence, however, should reflect
\textit{coherent sufficiency}: balanced competence across all essential
domains. We propose a coherence-aware measure of AGI based on the integral of
generalized means over a continuum of compensability exponents. This
formulation spans arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic regimes, and the
resulting \textit{area under the curve} (AUC) quantifies robustness under
varying compensability assumptions. Unlike the arithmetic mean, which rewards
specialization, the AUC penalizes imbalance and captures inter-domain
dependency. Applied to published CHC-based domain scores for GPT-4 and GPT-5,
the coherence-adjusted AUC reveals that both systems remain far from general
competence despite high arithmetic scores (e.g., GPT-5 at~24\%). Integrating
the generalized mean thus yields a principled, interpretable, and stricter
foundation for measuring genuine progress toward AGI.

### [124] [Configuration-Dependent Robot Kinematics Model and Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19962)
*Chen-Lung Lu,Honglu He,Agung Julius,John T. Wen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A configuration-dependent kinematic calibration framework using local POE models and Fourier basis interpolation to improve robot positioning accuracy across the entire workspace, achieving sub-millimeter precision for industrial applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate robot kinematics is essential for precise tool placement, but non-geometric factors cause configuration-dependent model discrepancies that limit accuracy across the workspace.

Method: Local Product-of-Exponential (POE) models are identified at multiple configurations and interpolated using Fourier basis functions parameterized by shoulder and elbow joint angles, inspired by joint gravity load expressions.

Result: Validation on 6-DoF industrial robots shows over 50% reduction in maximum positioning error, achieving sub-millimeter accuracy required for cold spray manufacturing. Robots with larger configuration-dependent discrepancies benefit more.

Conclusion: The framework provides comparable accuracy to neural network methods but with higher training efficiency, and demonstrates practical applicability in dual-robot collaborative tasks with good repeatability.

Abstract: Accurate robot kinematics is essential for precise tool placement in
articulated robots, but non-geometric factors can introduce
configuration-dependent model discrepancies. This paper presents a
configuration-dependent kinematic calibration framework for improving accuracy
across the entire workspace. Local Product-of-Exponential (POE) models,
selected for their parameterization continuity, are identified at multiple
configurations and interpolated into a global model. Inspired by joint gravity
load expressions, we employ Fourier basis function interpolation parameterized
by the shoulder and elbow joint angles, achieving accuracy comparable to neural
network and autoencoder methods but with substantially higher training
efficiency. Validation on two 6-DoF industrial robots shows that the proposed
approach reduces the maximum positioning error by over 50%, meeting the
sub-millimeter accuracy required for cold spray manufacturing. Robots with
larger configuration-dependent discrepancies benefit even more. A dual-robot
collaborative task demonstrates the framework's practical applicability and
repeatability.

*Hien Bui,Yufeiyang Gao,Haoran Yang,Eric Cui,Siddhant Mody,Brian Acosta,Thomas Stephen Felix,Bibit Bianchini,Michael Posa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: C3+, an enhanced contact-implicit MPC algorithm, enables real-time multi-object planar pushing with 98% success rate across diverse object geometries by integrating object scanning, mesh reconstruction, and hardware execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-prehensile manipulation remains challenging due to unknown physical properties and complex contact interactions. Prior CI-MPC methods were limited to narrow examples and couldn't handle multi-object scenarios requiring reasoning over numerous contacts.

Method: Developed Consensus Complementarity Control Plus (C3+), an enhanced CI-MPC algorithm integrated into a complete pipeline including object scanning, mesh reconstruction, and hardware execution. C3+ achieves substantially faster solve times than predecessor C3.

Result: 98% success rate across 33 objects with tight pose tolerances. Average time-to-goal: 0.5 min (1 object), 1.6 min (2 objects), 3.2 min (3 objects), 5.3 min (4 objects). Enables real-time performance in multi-object pushing tasks.

Conclusion: C3+ demonstrates broader capabilities of CI-MPC for complex multi-object manipulation, successfully tackling challenges that were previously intractable, including strategic manipulation and de-cluttering through reasoning over multiple contacts.

Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation of diverse objects remains a core challenge in
robotics, driven by unknown physical properties and the complexity of
contact-rich interactions. Recent advances in contact-implicit model predictive
control (CI-MPC), with contact reasoning embedded directly in the trajectory
optimization, have shown promise in tackling the task efficiently and robustly,
yet demonstrations have been limited to narrowly curated examples. In this
work, we showcase the broader capabilities of CI-MPC through precise planar
pushing tasks over a wide range of object geometries, including multi-object
domains. These scenarios demand reasoning over numerous inter-object and
object-environment contacts to strategically manipulate and de-clutter the
environment, challenges that were intractable for prior CI-MPC methods. To
achieve this, we introduce Consensus Complementarity Control Plus (C3+), an
enhanced CI-MPC algorithm integrated into a complete pipeline spanning object
scanning, mesh reconstruction, and hardware execution. Compared to its
predecessor C3, C3+ achieves substantially faster solve times, enabling
real-time performance even in multi-object pushing tasks. On hardware, our
system achieves overall 98% success rate across 33 objects, reaching pose goals
within tight tolerances. The average time-to-goal is approximately 0.5, 1.6,
3.2, and 5.3 minutes for 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-object tasks, respectively. Project

### [126] [Simultaneous learning of state-to-state minimum-time planning and control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20008)
*Swati Dantu,Robert Pěnička,Martin Saska*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning framework for learning generalizable minimum-time flight policies for UAVs that can navigate between arbitrary start and goal states, combining agile flight with stable hovering capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional autonomous drone racing approaches achieve high speeds but are limited to predefined tracks, restricting real-world applicability. There's a need for policies that can generalize to arbitrary state-to-state flights.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning with Point Mass Model trajectories as proxy rewards to approximate optimal flight objectives, combined with curriculum learning for efficient training and generalization.

Result: Simulation experiments show the method outperforms Nonlinear Model Predictive Control tracking PMM trajectories. Real-world experiments demonstrate robust performance in outdoor environments and ability to run on small ARM-based single-board computers.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully learns generalizable minimum-time flight policies that bridge the gap between specialized racing approaches and real-world applications, achieving both agility and stable hovering capabilities.

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of learning a generalizable minimum-time
flight policy for UAVs, capable of navigating between arbitrary start and goal
states while balancing agile flight and stable hovering. Traditional
approaches, particularly in autonomous drone racing, achieve impressive speeds
and agility but are constrained to predefined track layouts, limiting
real-world applicability. To address this, we propose a reinforcement
learning-based framework that simultaneously learns state-to-state minimum-time
planning and control and generalizes to arbitrary state-to-state flights. Our
approach leverages Point Mass Model (PMM) trajectories as proxy rewards to
approximate the true optimal flight objective and employs curriculum learning
to scale the training process efficiently and to achieve generalization. We
validate our method through simulation experiments, comparing it against
Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) tracking PMM-generated trajectories
and conducting ablation studies to assess the impact of curriculum learning.
Finally, real-world experiments confirm the robustness of our learned policy in
outdoor environments, demonstrating its ability to generalize and operate on a
small ARM-based single-board computer.

### [127] [Calibration of Parallel Kinematic Machine Based on Stewart Platform-A Literature Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20070)
*Sourabh Karmakar,Apurva Patel,Cameron J. Turner*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Survey of inverse kinematics-based calibration methods for 6-DOF Stewart platform parallel kinematic machines, focusing on accuracy improvement techniques for micro/nano-scale applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PKM machines require high accuracy for critical applications like medical, space, and manufacturing, necessitating proper calibration to achieve micro/nano-scale movement control.

Method: Review of three calibration approaches: external instrument-based, constraint-based, and auto/self-calibration methods using inverse kinematics.

Result: Researchers focused on improving platform position/orientation accuracy by addressing structural errors and some environmental factors, though calibrations were done under no-load conditions.

Conclusion: The study provides understanding of current calibration techniques and identifies opportunities for further research expansion in specific areas.

Abstract: Stewart platform-based Parallel Kinematic (PKM) Machines have been
extensively studied by researchers due to their inherent finer control
characteristics. This has opened its potential deployment opportunities in
versatile critical applications like the medical field, engineering machines,
space research, electronic chip manufacturing, automobile manufacturing, etc.
All these precise, complicated, and repeatable motion applications require
micro and nano-scale movement control in 3D space; a 6-DOF PKM can take this
challenge smartly. For this, the PKM must be more accurate than the desired
application accuracy level and thus proper calibration for a PKM robot is
essential. Forward kinematics-based calibration for such hexapod machines
becomes unnecessarily complex and inverse kinematics complete this task with
much ease. To analyze different techniques, an external instrument-based,
constraint-based, and auto or self-calibration-based approaches have been used
for calibration. This survey has been done by reviewing these key
methodologies, their outcome, and important points related to inverse
kinematic-based PKM calibrations in general. It is observed in this study that
the researchers focused on improving the accuracy of the platform position and
orientation considering the errors contributed by a single source or multiple
sources. The error sources considered are mainly structural, in some cases,
environmental factors are also considered, however, these calibrations are done
under no-load conditions. This study aims to understand the current state of
the art in this field and to expand the scope for other researchers in further
exploration in a specific area.

### [128] [Design of a Bed Rotation Mechanism to Facilitate In-Situ Photogrammetric Reconstruction of Printed Parts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20079)
*Travis A. Roberts,Sourabh Karmakar,Cameron J. Turner*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a custom-designed FDM 3D printer platform for research purposes, featuring a novel rotating heated bed mechanism that enables in-situ photogrammetry with minimal cameras to link process parameters with geometric defects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Commercial and consumer-grade FDM printers lack research flexibility and closed-source limitations, while existing machines don't provide sufficient control and monitoring capabilities needed for reproducible experiments in polymer FDM research.

Method: Designed and fabricated a custom research-grade FDM platform with closed-loop position feedback, temperature control, environmental monitoring, and a novel rotating heated bed mechanism that enables in-situ photogrammetry throughout the printing process.

Result: Created a research platform that tightly controls and monitors FDM build parameters, allowing experiments to be repeated with known accuracy and enabling backtracking to link process parameters with observable geometric defects through photogrammetry.

Conclusion: The developed platform successfully addresses the limitations of existing FDM printers for research purposes by providing comprehensive parameter control and monitoring, with the novel rotating bed mechanism enabling efficient photogrammetric reconstruction for process-geometry correlation studies.

Abstract: Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, is a complex process that creates
free-form geometric objects by sequentially placing material to construct an
object, usually in a layer-by-layer process. One of the most widely used
methods is Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). FDM is used in many of the
consumer-grade polymer 3D printers available today. While consumer grade
machines are cheap and plentiful, they lack many of the features desired in a
machine used for research purposes and are often closed-source platforms.
Commercial-grade models are more expensive and are also usually closed-source
platforms that do not offer flexibility for modifications often needed for
research. The authors designed and fabricated a machine to be used as a test
bed for research in the field of polymer FDM processes. The goal was to create
a platform that tightly controls and/or monitors the FDM build parameters so
that experiments can be repeated with a known accuracy. The platform offers
closed loop position feedback, control of the hot end and bed temperature, and
monitoring of environment temperature and humidity. Additionally, the platform
is equipped with cameras and a mechanism for in-situ photogrammetry, creating a
geometric record of the printing throughout the printing process. Through
photogrammetry, backtracking and linking process parameters to observable
geometric defects can be achieved. This paper focuses on the design of a novel
mechanism for spinning the heated bed to allow for photogrammetric
reconstruction of the printed part using a minimal number of cameras, as
implemented on this platform.

### [129] [PathFormer: A Transformer with 3D Grid Constraints for Digital Twin Robot-Arm Trajectory Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20161)
*Ahmed Alanazi,Duy Ho,Yugyung Lee*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A Path-based Transformer that uses 3-grid representation and constraint-masked decoding to generate valid robot trajectories, achieving high accuracy and success rates in manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic arms need precise trajectory planning, but sequence models often produce invalid or inefficient motions by ignoring motion structure.

Method: Path-based Transformer with 3-grid (where/what/when) representation and constraint-masked decoding that enforces lattice-adjacent moves and workspace bounds while reasoning over task graphs and action order.

Result: 89.44% stepwise accuracy, 93.32% precision, 89.44% recall, 90.40% F1 score; 99.99% legal paths; 97.5% reach success, 92.5% pick success in controlled tests; 86.7% end-to-end success across 60 language-specified tasks in cluttered scenes.

Conclusion: Path-structured representations enable Transformers to generate accurate, reliable, and interpretable robot trajectories, bridging graph-based planning and sequence-based learning for practical manipulation and sim-to-real transfer.

Abstract: Robotic arms require precise, task-aware trajectory planning, yet sequence
models that ignore motion structure often yield invalid or inefficient
executions. We present a Path-based Transformer that encodes robot motion with
a 3-grid (where/what/when) representation and constraint-masked decoding,
enforcing lattice-adjacent moves and workspace bounds while reasoning over task
graphs and action order. Trained on 53,755 trajectories (80% train / 20%
validation), the model aligns closely with ground truth -- 89.44% stepwise
accuracy, 93.32% precision, 89.44% recall, and 90.40% F1 -- with 99.99% of
paths legal by construction. Compiled to motor primitives on an xArm Lite 6
with a depth-camera digital twin, it attains up to 97.5% reach and 92.5% pick
success in controlled tests, and 86.7% end-to-end success across 60
language-specified tasks in cluttered scenes, absorbing slips and occlusions
via local re-grounding without global re-planning. These results show that
path-structured representations enable Transformers to generate accurate,
reliable, and interpretable robot trajectories, bridging graph-based planning
and sequence-based learning and providing a practical foundation for
general-purpose manipulation and sim-to-real transfer.

### [130] [Reinforcement Learning-based Robust Wall Climbing Locomotion Controller in Ferromagnetic Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20174)
*Yong Um,Young-Ha Shin,Joon-Ha Kim,Soonpyo Kwon,Hae-Won Park*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning framework for quadrupedal wall-climbing robots that handles magnetic adhesion uncertainty through curriculum learning and realistic adhesion modeling, achieving robust vertical crawling despite attachment failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address uncertainty in magnetic foot adhesion for climbing robots, including partial contact, air-gap sensitivity, and probabilistic attachment failures that challenge traditional control methods.

Method: Three-phase curriculum learning: (1) learn crawl gait on flat ground without adhesion, (2) gradually rotate gravity to vertical while activating adhesion model, (3) inject stochastic adhesion failures to encourage slip recovery. Incorporates physics-based adhesion model in simulation.

Result: Learned policy achieves high success rate, strong adhesion retention, and rapid recovery from detachment in simulation. Outperforms MPC baseline that assumes perfect adhesion. Hardware experiments confirm robust vertical crawling on steel surfaces despite transient misalignment and incomplete attachment.

Conclusion: Combining curriculum learning with realistic adhesion modeling provides a resilient sim-to-real framework for magnetic climbing robots in complex environments, enabling robust locomotion despite adhesion uncertainties.

Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning framework for quadrupedal wall-climbing
locomotion that explicitly addresses uncertainty in magnetic foot adhesion. A
physics-based adhesion model of a quadrupedal magnetic climbing robot is
incorporated into simulation to capture partial contact, air-gap sensitivity,
and probabilistic attachment failures. To stabilize learning and enable
reliable transfer, we design a three-phase curriculum: (1) acquire a crawl gait
on flat ground without adhesion, (2) gradually rotate the gravity vector to
vertical while activating the adhesion model, and (3) inject stochastic
adhesion failures to encourage slip recovery. The learned policy achieves a
high success rate, strong adhesion retention, and rapid recovery from
detachment in simulation under degraded adhesion. Compared with a model
predictive control (MPC) baseline that assumes perfect adhesion, our controller
maintains locomotion when attachment is intermittently lost. Hardware
experiments with the untethered robot further confirm robust vertical crawling
on steel surfaces, maintaining stability despite transient misalignment and
incomplete attachment. These results show that combining curriculum learning
with realistic adhesion modeling provides a resilient sim-to-real framework for
magnetic climbing robots in complex environments.

### [131] [A Contact-Driven Framework for Manipulating in the Blind](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20177)
*Muhammad Suhail Saleem,Lai Yuan,Maxim Likhachev*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework for robot manipulation in visually challenging environments using contact feedback and structural priors to navigate around obstacles and complete tasks efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots often operate in environments where vision is inadequate due to clutter, occlusions, or poor lighting, requiring reliance on contact feedback similar to humans. These environments often have structural priors that can be exploited to anticipate unseen structure.

Method: Three-component framework: (1) contact detection/localization using joint torque sensing and contact particle filter, (2) occupancy estimation using contact history and learned predictors to extrapolate into unexplored regions, (3) planning that accounts for noisy estimates while avoiding collisions and maintaining feasible solutions.

Result: The framework reliably solves domestic tasks (valve manipulation under sink, object retrieval from cluttered shelf), achieving up to 2x reduction in task completion time compared to baselines, with ablations confirming each module's contribution.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables robust manipulation in blind settings by integrating contact feedback with structural priors, demonstrating efficient task completion in challenging environments where vision is inadequate.

Abstract: Robots often face manipulation tasks in environments where vision is
inadequate due to clutter, occlusions, or poor lighting--for example, reaching
a shutoff valve at the back of a sink cabinet or locating a light switch above
a crowded shelf. In such settings, robots, much like humans, must rely on
contact feedback to distinguish free from occupied space and navigate around
obstacles. Many of these environments often exhibit strong structural
priors--for instance, pipes often span across sink cabinets--that can be
exploited to anticipate unseen structure and avoid unnecessary collisions. We
present a theoretically complete and empirically efficient framework for
manipulation in the blind that integrates contact feedback with structural
priors to enable robust operation in unknown environments. The framework
comprises three tightly coupled components: (i) a contact detection and
localization module that utilizes joint torque sensing with a contact particle
filter to detect and localize contacts, (ii) an occupancy estimation module
that uses the history of contact observations to build a partial occupancy map
of the workspace and extrapolate it into unexplored regions with learned
predictors, and (iii) a planning module that accounts for the fact that contact
localization estimates and occupancy predictions can be noisy, computing paths
that avoid collisions and complete tasks efficiently without eliminating
feasible solutions. We evaluate the system in simulation and in the real world
on a UR10e manipulator across two domestic tasks--(i) manipulating a valve
under a kitchen sink surrounded by pipes and (ii) retrieving a target object
from a cluttered shelf. Results show that the framework reliably solves these
tasks, achieving up to a 2x reduction in task completion time compared to
baselines, with ablations confirming the contribution of each module.

### [132] [NODA-MMH: Certified Learning-Aided Nonlinear Control for Magnetically-Actuated Swarm Experiment Toward On-Orbit Proof](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20231)
*Yuta Takahashi,Atsuki Ochi,Yoichi Tomioka,Shin-Ichiro Sakai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Experimental validation of learning-aided magnetic field control for large satellite swarms using magnetorquers, addressing challenges like nonholonomic constraints and scalability through time-integrated current control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve fundamental challenges in large-scale satellite swarm control including nonholonomic constraints, underactuation, scalability, and computational cost that arise when controlling more than three satellites.

Method: Learning-aided time-integrated current control with magnetorquers, using two-axis coils and air-bearing platform to replicate orbital dynamics, and introducing NODA-MMH for model-based power-optimal swarm control.

Result: Validated enhanced controllability of averaged system dynamics with theoretical error bounds and decentralized current management through multiple experiments.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates learning-aided magnetic field control as a viable solution for long-term formation maintenance of satellite swarms, complementing previous theoretical work with experimental validation.

Abstract: This study experimentally validates the principle of large-scale satellite
swarm control through learning-aided magnetic field interactions generated by
satellite-mounted magnetorquers. This actuation presents a promising solution
for the long-term formation maintenance of multiple satellites and has
primarily been demonstrated in ground-based testbeds for two-satellite position
control. However, as the number of satellites increases beyond three,
fundamental challenges coupled with the high nonlinearity arise: 1)
nonholonomic constraints, 2) underactuation, 3) scalability, and 4)
computational cost. Previous studies have shown that time-integrated current
control theoretically solves these problems, where the average actuator outputs
align with the desired command, and a learning-based technique further enhances
their performance. Through multiple experiments, we validate critical aspects
of learning-aided time-integrated current control: (1) enhanced controllability
of the averaged system dynamics, with a theoretically guaranteed error bound,
and (2) decentralized current management. We design two-axis coils and a
ground-based experimental setup utilizing an air-bearing platform, enabling a
mathematical replication of orbital dynamics. Based on the effectiveness of the
learned interaction model, we introduce NODA-MMH (Neural power-Optimal Dipole
Allocation for certified learned Model-based Magnetically swarm control
Harness) for model-based power-optimal swarm control. This study complements
our tutorial paper on magnetically actuated swarms for the long-term formation
maintenance problem.

### [133] [Kinaema: a recurrent sequence model for memory and pose in motion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20261)
*Mert Bulent Sariyildiz,Philippe Weinzaepfel,Guillaume Bono,Gianluca Monaci,Christian Wolf*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Kinaema is a new model for spatial awareness in robots that uses recurrent transformers to maintain implicit latent memory of visual observations, enabling efficient navigation to previously seen goals without explicit observation history storage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robots to efficiently situate themselves in previously seen spaces by leveraging information observed before episode start, overcoming limitations of explicit observation history storage and context length constraints.

Method: Uses a transformer in recurrent way to maintain implicit latent memory that compresses history of sensor readings into compact representation, without explicitly storing observation history.

Result: The model maintains useful scene representation, navigates to goals observed before episode start, and is computationally efficient compared to classical transformers with attention over observation history.

Conclusion: Kinaema's recurrent transformer approach with implicit latent memory provides an effective solution for spatial awareness in continuous robotics operations, offering computational efficiency and scalability for large scenes.

Abstract: One key aspect of spatially aware robots is the ability to "find their
bearings", ie. to correctly situate themselves in previously seen spaces. In
this work, we focus on this particular scenario of continuous robotics
operations, where information observed before an actual episode start is
exploited to optimize efficiency. We introduce a new model, Kinaema, and agent,
capable of integrating a stream of visual observations while moving in a
potentially large scene, and upon request, processing a query image and
predicting the relative position of the shown space with respect to its current
position. Our model does not explicitly store an observation history, therefore
does not have hard constraints on context length. It maintains an implicit
latent memory, which is updated by a transformer in a recurrent way,
compressing the history of sensor readings into a compact representation. We
evaluate the impact of this model in a new downstream task we call "Mem-Nav".
We show that our large-capacity recurrent model maintains a useful
representation of the scene, navigates to goals observed before the actual
episode start, and is computationally efficient, in particular compared to
classical transformers with attention over an observation history.

### [134] [MemER: Scaling Up Memory for Robot Control via Experience Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20328)
*Ajay Sridhar,Jennifer Pan,Satvik Sharma,Chelsea Finn*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MemER is a hierarchical policy framework that enables robots to efficiently use long-term memory for manipulation tasks by selecting relevant keyframes from past experiences to guide low-level policy execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans use memory to perform tasks effectively, but most robot policies lack this capability. Current approaches either inefficiently condition on full observation histories or lose important information through indiscriminate subsampling.

Method: A hierarchical policy where a high-level policy selects and tracks relevant keyframes from past experiences, then generates text instructions for a low-level policy using these keyframes and recent observations. Built on existing VLA models with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as high-level and π₀.₅ as low-level policies.

Result: MemER outperforms prior methods on three real-world long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks requiring minutes of memory, demonstrating efficient reasoning over long-horizon dependencies.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical memory framework successfully endows robot policies with human-like memory capabilities, enabling efficient long-horizon task execution while being compatible with existing vision-language-action models.

Abstract: Humans routinely rely on memory to perform tasks, yet most robot policies
lack this capability; our goal is to endow robot policies with the same
ability. Naively conditioning on long observation histories is computationally
expensive and brittle under covariate shift, while indiscriminate subsampling
of history leads to irrelevant or redundant information. We propose a
hierarchical policy framework, where the high-level policy is trained to select
and track previous relevant keyframes from its experience. The high-level
policy uses selected keyframes and the most recent frames when generating text
instructions for a low-level policy to execute. This design is compatible with
existing vision-language-action (VLA) models and enables the system to
efficiently reason over long-horizon dependencies. In our experiments, we
finetune Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and $\pi_{0.5}$ as the high-level and low-level
policies respectively, using demonstrations supplemented with minimal language
annotations. Our approach, MemER, outperforms prior methods on three real-world
long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks that require minutes of memory. Videos

*Zixuan Wu,Hengyuan Zhang,Ting-Hsuan Chen,Yuliang Guo,David Paz,Xinyu Huang,Liu Ren*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Dino-Diffusion Parking (DDP) is a domain-agnostic autonomous parking pipeline that combines visual foundation models with diffusion-based planning to achieve robust performance across domain shifts without additional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of robustness under domain shifts (weather, lighting changes) in autonomous parking systems, where current end-to-end approaches struggle with out-of-distribution scenarios.

Method: Integrates visual foundation models with diffusion-based planning, trained in CARLA simulator under regular settings and transferred zero-shot to adversarial settings. Uses 3D Gaussian splatting for sim-to-real testing.

Result: Achieves parking success rate above 90% across all tested out-of-distribution scenarios, with ablation studies confirming both network architecture and algorithmic design significantly enhance cross-domain performance over existing baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed DDP pipeline demonstrates strong domain-agnostic capabilities and promising sim-to-real transfer, providing a robust solution for autonomous parking under distribution shifts.

Abstract: Parking is a critical pillar of driving safety. While recent end-to-end (E2E)
approaches have achieved promising in-domain results, robustness under domain
shifts (e.g., weather and lighting changes) remains a key challenge. Rather
than relying on additional data, in this paper, we propose Dino-Diffusion
Parking (DDP), a domain-agnostic autonomous parking pipeline that integrates
visual foundation models with diffusion-based planning to enable generalized
perception and robust motion planning under distribution shifts. We train our
pipeline in CARLA at regular setting and transfer it to more adversarial
settings in a zero-shot fashion. Our model consistently achieves a parking
success rate above 90% across all tested out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios,
with ablation studies confirming that both the network architecture and
algorithmic design significantly enhance cross-domain performance over existing
baselines. Furthermore, testing in a 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) environment
reconstructed from a real-world parking lot demonstrates promising sim-to-real
transfer.

*Ashutosh Mishra,Shreya Santra,Elian Neppel,Edoardo M. Rossi Lombardi,Shamistan Karimov,Kentaro Uno,Kazuya Yoshida*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A decentralized reinforcement learning approach for modular reconfigurable robots that enables zero-shot generalization to unseen configurations through separate policies for wheel locomotion, limb steering, and manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modular reconfigurable robots are suitable for space operations but face challenges with combinatorial growth of morphologies that hinders unified control.

Method: Decentralized reinforcement learning scheme where each module learns its own policy: wheel modules use Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) for locomotion and 7-DoF limbs use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for steering and manipulation.

Result: Steering policy achieved 3.63° mean absolute error; manipulation policy reached 84.6% success rate; wheel policy reduced motor torque by 95.4% while maintaining 99.6% success. Lunar-analogue field tests validated zero-shot integration.

Conclusion: The system enables smooth transitions among execution modes without idle states or control conflicts, providing a scalable, reusable, and robust approach for modular lunar robots.

Abstract: Modular reconfigurable robots suit task-specific space operations, but the
combinatorial growth of morphologies hinders unified control. We propose a
decentralized reinforcement learning (Dec-RL) scheme where each module learns
its own policy: wheel modules use Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) for locomotion and
7-DoF limbs use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for steering and
manipulation, enabling zero-shot generalization to unseen configurations. In
simulation, the steering policy achieved a mean absolute error of 3.63{\deg}
between desired and induced angles; the manipulation policy plateaued at 84.6 %
success on a target-offset criterion; and the wheel policy cut average motor
torque by 95.4 % relative to baseline while maintaining 99.6 % success.
Lunar-analogue field tests validated zero-shot integration for autonomous
locomotion, steering, and preliminary alignment for reconfiguration. The system
transitioned smoothly among synchronous, parallel, and sequential modes for
Policy Execution, without idle states or control conflicts, indicating a
scalable, reusable, and robust approach for modular lunar robots.

*Yijiong Lin,Bowen Deng,Chenghua Lu,Max Yang,Efi Psomopoulou,Nathan F. Lepora*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NeuralTouch integrates Neural Descriptor Fields (NDF) with tactile sensing to improve grasping accuracy through gentle physical interaction, using deep RL to refine grasps based on tactile feedback without explicit contact type specification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of NDF (inaccurate poses due to camera calibration, incomplete point clouds) and tactile sensing approaches (limited to simple contact geometries) by combining both modalities for precise, generalizable grasping.

Method: Multimodal framework that uses NDF to implicitly represent target contact geometry, then trains a deep RL policy conditioned on neural descriptors to refine grasps using tactile feedback.

Result: Validated in simulation and real-world tasks (peg-in-hole, bottle lid opening) with zero-shot transfer, showing significant improvement in grasping accuracy and robustness over baselines.

Conclusion: NeuralTouch provides a general framework for precise, contact-rich robotic manipulation that generalizes across tasks without additional fine-tuning.

Abstract: Grasping accuracy is a critical prerequisite for precise object manipulation,
often requiring careful alignment between the robot hand and object. Neural
Descriptor Fields (NDF) offer a promising vision-based method to generate
grasping poses that generalize across object categories. However, NDF alone can
produce inaccurate poses due to imperfect camera calibration, incomplete point
clouds, and object variability. Meanwhile, tactile sensing enables more precise
contact, but existing approaches typically learn policies limited to simple,
predefined contact geometries. In this work, we introduce NeuralTouch, a
multimodal framework that integrates NDF and tactile sensing to enable
accurate, generalizable grasping through gentle physical interaction. Our
approach leverages NDF to implicitly represent the target contact geometry,
from which a deep reinforcement learning (RL) policy is trained to refine the
grasp using tactile feedback. This policy is conditioned on the neural
descriptors and does not require explicit specification of contact types. We
validate NeuralTouch through ablation studies in simulation and zero-shot
transfer to real-world manipulation tasks--such as peg-out-in-hole and bottle
lid opening--without additional fine-tuning. Results show that NeuralTouch
significantly improves grasping accuracy and robustness over baseline methods,
offering a general framework for precise, contact-rich robotic manipulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PointMapPolicy is a novel approach that conditions diffusion policies on structured point grids without downsampling, enabling better geometric awareness and fusion with RGB data for robotic manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current point cloud methods struggle with fine-grained detail while RGB methods lack geometric awareness, limiting precision and generalization in robotic manipulation systems that benefit from complementary sensing modalities.

Method: The method introduces structured grids of points (point maps) without downsampling, enabling transformation between reference frames and application of computer vision techniques to 3D data. It uses xLSTM as backbone to fuse point maps with RGB data for multi-modal perception.

Result: Extensive experiments on RoboCasa and CALVIN benchmarks and real robot evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across diverse manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: PointMapPolicy effectively bridges the gap between geometric and semantic perception in robotic manipulation by leveraging structured point maps and multi-modal fusion, achieving superior performance on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation systems benefit from complementary sensing modalities,
where each provides unique environmental information. Point clouds capture
detailed geometric structure, while RGB images provide rich semantic context.
Current point cloud methods struggle to capture fine-grained detail, especially
for complex tasks, which RGB methods lack geometric awareness, which hinders
their precision and generalization. We introduce PointMapPolicy, a novel
approach that conditions diffusion policies on structured grids of points
without downsampling. The resulting data type makes it easier to extract shape
and spatial relationships from observations, and can be transformed between
reference frames. Yet due to their structure in a regular grid, we enable the
use of established computer vision techniques directly to 3D data. Using xLSTM
as a backbone, our model efficiently fuses the point maps with RGB data for
enhanced multi-modal perception. Through extensive experiments on the RoboCasa
and CALVIN benchmarks and real robot evaluations, we demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: MR-UBi enables more stable, accurate, and user-friendly underwater robot-arm teleoperation through the integration of visual and haptic feedback.

Abstract: We present a mixed reality-based underwater robot arm teleoperation system
with a reaction torque indicator via bilateral control (MR-UBi). The reaction
torque indicator (RTI) overlays a color and length-coded torque bar in the
MR-HMD, enabling seamless integration of visual and haptic feedback during

compared MR-UBi against a bilateral-control baseline. MR-UBi significantly
improved grasping-torque control accuracy, increasing the time within the
optimal torque range and reducing both low and high grasping torque range
during lift and pick-and-place tasks with objects of different stiffness.
Subjective evaluations further showed higher usability (SUS) and lower workload

*Bernhard Rameder,Hubert Gattringer,Andreas Mueller,Ronald Naderer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A method for planning robot trajectories using B-splines with fixed tool center point, focusing on moving the part rather than the tool for processing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient trajectory planning when it's easier to move the workpiece rather than the tool, particularly for processing paths on parts.

Method: Uses B-splines to represent continuous robot paths with desired smoothness, considering prescribed orientation and TCP velocity while calculating trajectories.

Result: The approach was successfully validated on a real industrial robot system moving an arbitrarily defined part.

Conclusion: The B-spline based trajectory planning method with fixed TCP is effective for processing tasks where part movement is preferred over tool movement.

Abstract: This paper presents a method for planning a trajectory in workspace
coordinates using a spatially fixed tool center point (TCP), while taking into
account the processing path on a part. This approach is beneficial if it is
easier to move the part rather than moving the tool. Whether a mathematical
description that defines the shape to be processed or single points from a
design program are used, the robot path is finally represented using B-splines.
The use of splines enables the path to be continuous with a desired degree,
which finally leads to a smooth robot trajectory. While calculating the robot
trajectory through prescribed orientation, additionally a given velocity at the
TCP has to be considered. The procedure was validated on a real system using an
industrial robot moving an arbitrary defined part.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A multi-robot cooperative localization method using factor graphs to fuse asynchronous VIO, LIO, and inter-robot detections, adapting to sensory degradations and improving localization accuracy in GNSS-denied environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable accurate long-term localization in GNSS-denied environments by distributing sensors across multiple robots to reduce size, weight, and power demands, while overcoming challenges of fusing asynchronous multi-modal data from independently moving platforms.

Method: Factor-graph formulation to loosely couple asynchronous VIO, LIO, and 3D inter-robot detections; adaptive approach using interpolation-based factors for unsynchronized measurements; LIO degradation evaluation via scan-matching Hessian; VIO weighting based on Wasserstein distance between consecutive outputs.

Result: Extensive evaluation on real-world heterogeneous UGV/UAV teams shows significant improvements in localization accuracy under various sensory degradation conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive multi-modal multi-robot cooperative localization approach effectively handles sensory degradations and asynchronous data fusion, providing robust localization performance for heterogeneous robot teams in challenging environments.

Abstract: Accurate long-term localization using onboard sensors is crucial for robots
operating in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environments.
While complementary sensors mitigate individual degradations, carrying all the
available sensor types on a single robot significantly increases the size,
weight, and power demands. Distributing sensors across multiple robots enhances
the deployability but introduces challenges in fusing asynchronous, multi-modal
data from independently moving platforms. We propose a novel adaptive
multi-modal multi-robot cooperative localization approach using a factor-graph
formulation to fuse asynchronous Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), LiDAR-Inertial
Odometry (LIO), and 3D inter-robot detections from distinct robots in a
loosely-coupled fashion. The approach adapts to changing conditions, leveraging
reliable data to assist robots affected by sensory degradations. A novel
interpolation-based factor enables fusion of the unsynchronized measurements.
LIO degradations are evaluated based on the approximate scan-matching Hessian.
A novel approach of weighting odometry data proportionally to the Wasserstein
distance between the consecutive VIO outputs is proposed. A theoretical
analysis is provided, investigating the cooperative localization problem under
various conditions, mainly in the presence of sensory degradations. The
proposed method has been extensively evaluated on real-world data gathered with
heterogeneous teams of an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) and Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs), showing that the approach provides significant improvements in
localization accuracy in the presence of various sensory degradations.

*Victor Vantilborgh,Hrishikesh Sathyanarayan,Guillaume Crevecoeur,Ian Abraham,Tom Lefebvre*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes dual control methods for robot manipulation under unknown dynamics, focusing on pick-and-place tasks with payload uncertainty. The approach combines active exploration with online parameter adaptation for improved model-based control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robot manipulation tasks often face unknown dynamics like payload uncertainty, requiring both active exploration and online parameter adaptation during execution for accurate model-based control.

Method: Two reference trajectory generation methods: 1) embedding parameter uncertainty in robust optimal control to minimize expected task cost, 2) minimizing optimality loss that measures parameter information sensitivity to task performance. Both naturally incorporate Fisher information.

Result: The approaches demonstrate effectiveness in pick-and-place manipulation tasks, enabling faster and more accurate task performance and system identification while ensuring stable and efficient control.

Conclusion: Designing reference trajectories while considering control enables superior performance in manipulation tasks under uncertainty, successfully combining task execution with system identification through dual control principles.

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of robot manipulation tasks under unknown
dynamics, such as pick-and-place tasks under payload uncertainty, where active
exploration and(/for) online parameter adaptation during task execution are
essential to enable accurate model-based control. The problem is framed as dual
control seeking a closed-loop optimal control problem that accounts for
parameter uncertainty. We simplify the dual control problem by pre-defining the
structure of the feedback policy to include an explicit adaptation mechanism.
Then we propose two methods for reference trajectory generation. The first
directly embeds parameter uncertainty in robust optimal control methods that
minimize the expected task cost. The second method considers minimizing the
so-called optimality loss, which measures the sensitivity of parameter-relevant
information with respect to task performance. We observe that both approaches
reason over the Fisher information as a natural side effect of their
formulations, simultaneously pursuing optimal task execution. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approaches for a pick-and-place manipulation task. We
show that designing the reference trajectories whilst taking into account the
control enables faster and more accurate task performance and system
identification while ensuring stable and efficient control.

### [143] [Simultaneous Stiffness and Trajectory Optimization for Energy Minimization of Pick-and-Place Tasks of SEA-Actuated Parallel Kinematic Manipulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20490)
*Thomas Kordik,Hubert Gattringer,Andreas Mueller*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper explores energy minimization for SEA-actuated parallel kinematic manipulators in pick-and-place tasks by exploiting eigenmotions from actuator springs through simultaneous trajectory and stiffness optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pick-and-place operations run for long periods, making energy consumption minimization crucial. Recent research uses elastic elements like SEAs, but this paper specifically focuses on leveraging their oscillating characteristics for energy reduction.

Method: Derived dynamic model of SEA-driven PKM, formulated energy-minimizing optimal control problem that simultaneously optimizes operating trajectories and SEA stiffnesses (for design purposes, not variable stiffness), tested on two parallel robot applications including redundant actuation.

Result: The approach was validated on two parallel robot applications, confirming the hypothesis that energy reduction can be achieved through this method.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate the validity of using eigenmotions from actuator springs and simultaneous optimization of trajectories and stiffness for energy minimization in SEA-actuated parallel kinematic manipulators performing pick-and-place tasks.

Abstract: A major field of industrial robot applications deals with repetitive tasks
that alternate between operating points. For these so-called pick-and-place
operations, parallel kinematic manipulators (PKM) are frequently employed.
These tasks tend to automatically run for a long period of time and therefore
minimizing energy consumption is always of interest. Recent research addresses
this topic by the use of elastic elements and particularly series elastic
actuators (SEA). This paper explores the possibilities of minimizing energy
consumption of SEA actuated PKM performing pick-and-place tasks. The basic idea
is to excite eigenmotions that result from the actuator springs and exploit
their oscillating characteristics. To this end, a prescribed cyclic
pick-and-place operation is analyzed and a dynamic model of SEA driven PKM is
derived. Subsequently, an energy minimizing optimal control problem is
formulated where operating trajectories as well as SEA stiffnesses are
optimized simultaneously. Here, optimizing the actuator stiffness does not
account for variable stiffness actuators. It serves as a tool for the design
and dimensioning process. The hypothesis on energy reduction is tested on two
(parallel) robot applications where redundant actuation is also addressed. The
results confirm the validity of this approach.

*Tobias Marauli,Hubert Gattringer,Andreas Mueller*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a computationally efficient approach for time-optimal path following by maximizing path speed instead of minimizing travel time, avoiding singularities at zero path speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard time-optimal path following methods face computational challenges due to singularities at zero path speed when minimizing travel time, making smooth trajectory generation difficult.

Method: The approach maximizes path speed along a prescribed path rather than minimizing travel time, with a discrete reformulation that is linear in optimization variables for numerical efficiency.

Result: The method enables smooth trajectory generation while maintaining low computational effort by avoiding the singularities inherent in traditional approaches.

Conclusion: This alternative approach provides a computationally efficient solution for time-optimal path following that handles the singularity issues of standard methods.

Abstract: In this paper the computational challenges of time-optimal path following are
addressed. The standard approach is to minimize the travel time, which
inevitably leads to singularities at zero path speed, when reformulating the
optimization problem in terms of a path parameter. Thus, smooth trajectory
generation while maintaining a low computational effort is quite challenging,
since the singularities have to be taken into account. To this end, a different
approach is presented in this paper. This approach is based on maximizing the
path speed along a prescribed path. Furthermore, the approach is capable of
planning smooth trajectories numerically efficient. Moreover, the discrete
reformulation of the underlying problem is linear in optimization variables.

TL;DR: RubbleSim is an open-source simulator for photorealistic void space exploration in structural collapse scenarios, addressing data access challenges by creating stochastic rubble piles with ground truth knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data from structural collapse incidents is legally restricted and proprietary training sites are reluctant to share information, creating a significant access barrier for research on void space exploration.

Method: Developed an open-source simulator in Unity with multi-OS support, using physics-based approach to build stochastic rubble piles informed by visits to training sites, enabling rapid iteration while maintaining ground truth knowledge.

Result: Successfully created a reconfigurable simulator that can generate realistic void spaces and demonstrated perception degradation using structure-from-motion algorithms under challenging visual conditions.

Conclusion: RubbleSim provides a viable solution to overcome data access limitations in disaster response robotics research by offering an open-source platform for void space exploration simulation with ground truth validation.

Abstract: Despite well-reported instances of robots being used in disaster response,
there is scant published data on the internal composition of the void spaces
within structural collapse incidents. Data collected during these incidents is
mired in legal constraints, as ownership is often tied to the responding
agencies, with little hope of public release for research. While engineered
rubble piles are used for training, these sites are also reluctant to release
information about their proprietary training grounds. To overcome this access
challenge, we present RubbleSim -- an open-source, reconfigurable simulator for
photorealistic void space exploration. The design of the simulation assets is
directly informed by visits to numerous training rubble sites at differing
levels of complexity. The simulator is implemented in Unity with
multi-operating system support. The simulation uses a physics-based approach to
build stochastic rubble piles, allowing for rapid iteration between simulation
worlds while retaining absolute knowledge of the ground truth. Using RubbleSim,
we apply a state-of-the-art structure-from-motion algorithm to illustrate how
perception performance degrades under challenging visual conditions inside the
emulated void spaces. Pre-built binaries and source code to implement are
available online: https://github.com/mit-ll/rubble_pile_simulator.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing object navigation approaches rely on static trajectories and fixed object categories, failing to adapt to evolving real-world scenarios that require continual learning of new object categories while retaining previous knowledge.

Method: C-Nav integrates two key innovations: (1) Dual-path anti-forgetting mechanism with feature distillation for representation consistency and feature replay for policy consistency, and (2) Adaptive sampling strategy that selects diverse and informative experiences to reduce redundancy and memory overhead.

Result: Extensive experiments show C-Nav consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior performance even compared to baselines with full trajectory retention while significantly lowering memory requirements.

Conclusion: C-Nav provides an effective solution for continual object navigation, enabling agents to adapt to new object categories while avoiding catastrophic forgetting, with practical benefits of reduced memory usage and maintained performance.

Abstract: Embodied agents are expected to perform object navigation in dynamic,
open-world environments. However, existing approaches typically rely on static
trajectories and a fixed set of object categories during training, overlooking
the real-world requirement for continual adaptation to evolving scenarios. To
facilitate related studies, we introduce the continual object navigation
benchmark, which requires agents to acquire navigation skills for new object
categories while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of previously learned
knowledge. To tackle this challenge, we propose C-Nav, a continual visual
navigation framework that integrates two key innovations: (1) A dual-path
anti-forgetting mechanism, which comprises feature distillation that aligns
multi-modal inputs into a consistent representation space to ensure
representation consistency, and feature replay that retains temporal features
within the action decoder to ensure policy consistency. (2) An adaptive
sampling strategy that selects diverse and informative experiences, thereby
reducing redundancy and minimizing memory overhead. Extensive experiments
across multiple model architectures demonstrate that C-Nav consistently
outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior performance even compared
to baselines with full trajectory retention, while significantly lowering
memory requirements. The code will be publicly available at

TL;DR: Proposes a real-time gait adaptation framework combining Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) with Dreamer module to optimize both actions and gait variables for quadruped locomotion, achieving significant energy savings while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of both model-free RL (which converges to single gait) and MPC (which lacks adaptability) by creating an adaptive optimization framework for quadruped locomotion.

Method: Combines MPPI algorithm with Dreamer module to jointly optimize actions and gait variables in continuous gait space, using learned reward function for velocity tracking, energy efficiency, stability, and smooth transitions, with learned value function as terminal reward.

Result: Achieved average 36.48% reduction in energy consumption across varying target speeds while maintaining accurate tracking and adaptive, task-appropriate gaits on Unitree Go1 in simulation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enables real-time gait adaptation in continuous gait space, combining the benefits of model-based optimization with learned components to achieve energy-efficient and adaptive quadruped locomotion.

Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled adaptable and agile
quadruped locomotion; however, policies often converge to a single gait,
leading to suboptimal performance. Traditionally, Model Predictive Control
(MPC) has been extensively used to obtain task-specific optimal policies but
lacks the ability to adapt to varying environments. To address these
limitations, we propose an optimization framework for real-time gait adaptation
in a continuous gait space, combining the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI)
algorithm with a Dreamer module to produce adaptive and optimal policies for
quadruped locomotion. At each time step, MPPI jointly optimizes the actions and
gait variables using a learned Dreamer reward that promotes velocity tracking,
energy efficiency, stability, and smooth transitions, while penalizing abrupt
gait changes. A learned value function is incorporated as terminal reward,
extending the formulation to an infinite-horizon planner. We evaluate our
framework in simulation on the Unitree Go1, demonstrating an average reduction
of up to 36.48\% in energy consumption across varying target speeds, while
maintaining accurate tracking and adaptive, task-appropriate gaits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data collection methods struggle to balance scale, diversity, and quality - simulation has sim-to-real gaps while teleoperation has limited diversity and high labor costs.

Method: Decomposes manipulation into pre-manipulation (allowing trajectory diversity) and fine manipulation (requiring expert precision). Human demonstrations capture key contact/pose information, then attraction fields automatically generate diverse trajectories converging to successful configurations.

Result: Policies trained with FieldGen achieve higher success rates and improved stability compared to teleoperation-based baselines, while significantly reducing human effort in long-term real-world data collection.

Conclusion: FieldGen provides an effective framework combining scalable trajectory diversity with precise supervision for robotic manipulation data collection, with FieldGen-Reward further enhancing policy learning through reward annotations.

Abstract: Large-scale and diverse datasets are vital for training robust robotic
manipulation policies, yet existing data collection methods struggle to balance
scale, diversity, and quality. Simulation offers scalability but suffers from
sim-to-real gaps, while teleoperation yields high-quality demonstrations with
limited diversity and high labor cost. We introduce FieldGen, a field-guided
data generation framework that enables scalable, diverse, and high-quality
real-world data collection with minimal human supervision. FieldGen decomposes
manipulation into two stages: a pre-manipulation phase, allowing trajectory
diversity, and a fine manipulation phase requiring expert precision. Human
demonstrations capture key contact and pose information, after which an
attraction field automatically generates diverse trajectories converging to
successful configurations. This decoupled design combines scalable trajectory
diversity with precise supervision. Moreover, FieldGen-Reward augments
generated data with reward annotations to further enhance policy learning.
Experiments demonstrate that policies trained with FieldGen achieve higher

Result: The survey provides a systematic overview of the sim-to-real landscape, highlighting successful applications across locomotion, navigation, and manipulation platforms, while identifying persistent challenges.

Conclusion: While recent advances show promising results in overcoming the reality gap, deeper understanding of root causes and continued development of transfer techniques are needed for more robust sim-to-real deployment in robotics.

Abstract: Machine learning has facilitated significant advancements across various
robotics domains, including navigation, locomotion, and manipulation. Many such
achievements have been driven by the extensive use of simulation as a critical
tool for training and testing robotic systems prior to their deployment in
real-world environments. However, simulations consist of abstractions and
approximations that inevitably introduce discrepancies between simulated and
real environments, known as the reality gap. These discrepancies significantly
hinder the successful transfer of systems from simulation to the real world.
Closing this gap remains one of the most pressing challenges in robotics.
Recent advances in sim-to-real transfer have demonstrated promising results

Conclusion: GSWorld provides a comprehensive framework for photo-realistic robotics simulation that enables various manipulation policy development applications without real robot hardware, advancing sim2real capabilities in robotics.

Abstract: This paper presents GSWorld, a robust, photo-realistic simulator for robotics
manipulation that combines 3D Gaussian Splatting with physics engines. Our
framework advocates "closing the loop" of developing manipulation policies with
reproducible evaluation of policies learned from real-robot data and sim2real
policy training without using real robots. To enable photo-realistic rendering
of diverse scenes, we propose a new asset format, which we term GSDF (Gaussian

robot URDF and other objects. With a streamlined reconstruction pipeline, we
curate a database of GSDF that contains 3 robot embodiments for single-arm and
bimanual manipulation, as well as more than 40 objects. Combining GSDF with
physics engines, we demonstrate several immediate interesting applications: (1)
learning zero-shot sim2real pixel-to-action manipulation policy with
photo-realistic rendering, (2) automated high-quality DAgger data collection
for adapting policies to deployment environments, (3) reproducible benchmarking
of real-robot manipulation policies in simulation, (4) simulation data

TL;DR: VAMOS is a hierarchical vision-language-action system that decouples semantic planning from embodiment grounding, enabling cross-embodied navigation across different robot types while maintaining physical feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of learning navigation policies that generalize across diverse environments while respecting the unique physical constraints of different robot embodiments (e.g., quadrupeds vs. wheeled robots).

Method: Hierarchical VLA with a generalist planner learning from diverse open-world data and a specialist affordance model learning robot-specific physical constraints in safe simulation. Uses an image-space interface for path proposal and evaluation.

Result: Achieves higher success rates in indoor and complex outdoor navigation than state-of-the-art methods. Enables cross-embodied navigation across legged and wheeled robots with 3X higher success rates by rejecting infeasible plans.

Conclusion: The hierarchical design with specialist embodiment grounding enables deployment of a single high-level planner across physically distinct robots while significantly improving reliability through physical feasibility checking.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in robot navigation lies in learning policies that
generalize across diverse environments while conforming to the unique physical
constraints and capabilities of a specific embodiment (e.g., quadrupeds can
walk up stairs, but rovers cannot). We propose VAMOS, a hierarchical VLA that
decouples semantic planning from embodiment grounding: a generalist planner
learns from diverse, open-world data, while a specialist affordance model
learns the robot's physical constraints and capabilities in safe, low-cost
simulation. We enabled this separation by carefully designing an interface that
lets a high-level planner propose candidate paths directly in image space that
the affordance model then evaluates and re-ranks. Our real-world experiments
show that VAMOS achieves higher success rates in both indoor and complex
outdoor navigation than state-of-the-art model-based and end-to-end learning
methods. We also show that our hierarchical design enables cross-embodied
navigation across legged and wheeled robots and is easily steerable using
natural language. Real-world ablations confirm that the specialist model is key
to embodiment grounding, enabling a single high-level planner to be deployed
across physically distinct wheeled and legged robots. Finally, this model
significantly enhances single-robot reliability, achieving 3X higher success
rates by rejecting physically infeasible plans. Website:
