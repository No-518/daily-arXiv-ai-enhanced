### [1] [Reading or Reasoning? Format Decoupled Reinforcement Learning for Document OCR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08834)
*Yufeng Zhong,Lei Chen,Zhixiong Zeng,Xuanle Zhao,Deyang Jiang,Liming Zheng,Jing Huang,Haibo Qiu,Peng Shi,Siqi Yang,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FD-RL uses entropy-based filtering and format-decoupled rewards to reduce OCR uncertainty in formatted text, achieving SOTA 90.41 on OmniDocBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advanced OCR models show much higher entropy (uncertainty) when reading formatted text (formulas, tables) vs plain text, indicating they struggle with format-sensitive documents despite being treated as simple perceptual tasks.

Method: Format Decoupled Reinforcement Learning (FD-RL): 1) Entropy-based data filtration to identify format-intensive instances, 2) Format-decoupled rewards tailored to different format types for format-level validation instead of token-level memorization.

Result: Achieves average score of 90.41 on OmniDocBench, setting new record for end-to-end models on this popular benchmark. Comprehensive ablation studies validate effectiveness of data, training, filtering, and rewarding strategies.

Conclusion: Format-sensitive OCR requires reasoning over diverse reading pathways, not just enriched data engineering. FD-RL's targeted optimization through entropy patterns and format-decoupled rewards effectively addresses OCR uncertainty in formatted documents.

Abstract: Reading text from images or scanned documents via OCR models has been a longstanding focus of researchers. Intuitively, text reading is perceived as a straightforward perceptual task, and existing work primarily focuses on constructing enriched data engineering to enhance SFT capabilities. In this work, we observe that even advanced OCR models exhibit significantly higher entropy in formatted text (\emph{e.g.}, formula, table, etc.) compared to plain text, often by an order of magnitude. These statistical patterns reveal that advanced OCR models struggle with high output uncertainty when dealing with format sensitive document, suggesting that reasoning over diverse reading pathways may improve OCR performance. To address this, we propose format decoupled reinforcement learning (FD-RL), which leverages high-entropy patterns for targeted optimization. Our approach employs entropy-based data filtration strategy to identify format-intensive instances, and adopt format decoupled rewards tailored to different format types, enabling format-level validation rather than token-level memorization. FD-RL achieves an average score of 90.41 on OmniDocBench, setting a new record for end-to-end models on this highly popular benchmark. More importantly, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies over data, training, filtering, and rewarding strategies, thoroughly validating their effectiveness.

*Tarannum Mithila*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs and generative models show robustness and fairness issues under image rotation and distribution shifts; proposed mitigation strategies improve robustness and reduce bias without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite strong performance, VLMs and generative image models have unexplored robustness and fairness issues under input transformations like image rotation and distributional shifts.

Method: Analyze bias propagation and robustness degradation in state-of-the-art models, focusing on rotation effects, then propose rotation-robust mitigation strategies combining data augmentation, representation alignment, and model-level regularization.

Result: Proposed methods significantly improve robustness while reducing bias amplification across multiple datasets without sacrificing overall performance.

Conclusion: Study reveals critical limitations in current multimodal systems and provides practical mitigation techniques for building more reliable and fair AI models.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and generative image models have achieved remarkable performance across multimodal tasks, yet their robustness and fairness under input transformations remain insufficiently explored. This work investigates bias propagation and robustness degradation in state-of-the-art vision-language and generative models, with a particular focus on image rotation and distributional shifts. We analyze how rotation-induced perturbations affect model predictions, confidence calibration, and demographic bias patterns. To address these issues, we propose rotation-robust mitigation strategies that combine data augmentation, representation alignment, and model-level regularization. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly improve robustness while reducing bias amplification without sacrificing overall performance. This study highlights critical limitations of current multimodal systems and provides practical mitigation techniques for building more reliable and fair AI models.

### [3] [R$^2$BD: A Reconstruction-Based Method for Generalizable and Efficient Detection of Fake Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08867)
*Qingyu Liu,Zhongjie Ba,Jianmin Guo,Qiu Wang,Zhibo Wang,Jie Shi,Kui Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R²BD is a novel fake image detection framework that uses a unified reconstruction model (G-LDM) to simulate multiple generative paradigms and a single-step residual bias calculation, achieving 22× speedup and 13.87% better cross-dataset accuracy than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reconstruction-based AIGC detection methods are inefficient due to multi-step inversion/reconstruction and limited to diffusion models, failing to generalize to other generative paradigms like GANs.

Method: R²BD uses two key designs: (1) G-LDM - a unified reconstruction model that simulates VAE, GAN, and diffusion generation behaviors, and (2) a residual bias calculation module that distinguishes real/fake images in a single inference step.

Result: R²BD is over 22× faster than existing reconstruction methods while achieving superior detection accuracy. In cross-dataset evaluations, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 13.87% across 10 public datasets.

Conclusion: R²BD demonstrates strong efficiency and generalization across diverse generative methods, addressing key limitations of previous reconstruction-based approaches through unified modeling and single-step inference.

Abstract: Recently, reconstruction-based methods have gained attention for AIGC image detection. These methods leverage pre-trained diffusion models to reconstruct inputs and measure residuals for distinguishing real from fake images. Their key advantage lies in reducing reliance on dataset-specific artifacts and improving generalization under distribution shifts. However, they are limited by significant inefficiency due to multi-step inversion and reconstruction, and their reliance on diffusion backbones further limits generalization to other generative paradigms such as GANs.
  In this paper, we propose a novel fake image detection framework, called R$^2$BD, built upon two key designs: (1) G-LDM, a unified reconstruction model that simulates the generation behaviors of VAEs, GANs, and diffusion models, thereby broadening the detection scope beyond prior diffusion-only approaches; and (2) a residual bias calculation module that distinguishes real and fake images in a single inference step, which is a significant efficiency improvement over existing methods that typically require 20$+$ steps.
  Extensive experiments on the benchmark from 10 public datasets demonstrate that R$^2$BD is over 22$\times$ faster than existing reconstruction-based methods while achieving superior detection accuracy. In cross-dataset evaluations, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 13.87\%, showing strong efficiency and generalization across diverse generative methods.

### [4] [Residual Cross-Modal Fusion Networks for Audio-Visual Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08868)
*Yi Wang,Yinfeng Yu,Bin Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRFN uses bidirectional residual interactions between audio and visual streams for better multimodal fusion in audio-visual navigation, outperforming SOTA methods and showing dataset-dependent modality preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio-visual navigation methods struggle with heterogeneous feature fusion, often leading to single-modality dominance or information degradation, especially in cross-domain scenarios where agents need to generalize to unseen environments.

Method: Proposes Cross-Modal Residual Fusion Network (CRFN) with bidirectional residual interactions between audio and visual streams, enabling complementary modeling and fine-grained alignment while maintaining representation independence. Uses residual connections and stabilization techniques instead of simple concatenation or attention gating.

Result: CRFN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fusion baselines on Replica and Matterport3D datasets, achieves stronger cross-domain generalization, and reveals that agents exhibit differentiated modality dependence across different datasets.

Conclusion: The bidirectional residual fusion approach effectively addresses multimodal interaction challenges in audio-visual navigation, and the discovery of dataset-dependent modality preferences provides new insights into cross-modal collaboration mechanisms for embodied agents.

Abstract: Audio-visual embodied navigation aims to enable an agent to autonomously localize and reach a sound source in unseen 3D environments by leveraging auditory cues. The key challenge of this task lies in effectively modeling the interaction between heterogeneous features during multimodal fusion, so as to avoid single-modality dominance or information degradation, particularly in cross-domain scenarios. To address this, we propose a Cross-Modal Residual Fusion Network, which introduces bidirectional residual interactions between audio and visual streams to achieve complementary modeling and fine-grained alignment, while maintaining the independence of their representations. Unlike conventional methods that rely on simple concatenation or attention gating, CRFN explicitly models cross-modal interactions via residual connections and incorporates stabilization techniques to improve convergence and robustness. Experiments on the Replica and Matterport3D datasets demonstrate that CRFN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fusion baselines and achieves stronger cross-domain generalization. Notably, our experiments also reveal that agents exhibit differentiated modality dependence across different datasets. The discovery of this phenomenon provides a new perspective for understanding the cross-modal collaboration mechanism of embodied agents.

### [5] [ForensicFormer: Hierarchical Multi-Scale Reasoning for Cross-Domain Image Forgery Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08873)
*Hema Hariharan Samson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ForensicFormer: A hierarchical transformer framework for cross-domain forgery detection that achieves 86.8% accuracy across diverse manipulation types, outperforming single-paradigm approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional forensic methods are ineffective against modern AI-generated imagery and sophisticated editing tools, requiring a unified approach that can handle unknown manipulation techniques in real-world scenarios.

Method: Hierarchical multi-scale framework combining low-level artifact detection, mid-level boundary analysis, and high-level semantic reasoning using cross-attention transformers, bridging classical image forensics with modern deep learning.

Result: Achieves 86.8% average accuracy across seven diverse test sets (traditional manipulations, GAN-generated, diffusion outputs), maintains 83% accuracy under JPEG compression (Q=70), and provides pixel-level localization with 0.76 F1-score.

Conclusion: ForensicFormer offers a practical solution for real-world forgery detection where manipulation techniques are unknown, significantly improving robustness and accuracy over state-of-the-art universal detectors.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated imagery and sophisticated editing tools has rendered traditional forensic methods ineffective for cross-domain forgery detection. We present ForensicFormer, a hierarchical multi-scale framework that unifies low-level artifact detection, mid-level boundary analysis, and high-level semantic reasoning via cross-attention transformers. Unlike prior single-paradigm approaches, which achieve <75% accuracy on out-of-distribution datasets, our method maintains 86.8% average accuracy across seven diverse test sets, spanning traditional manipulations, GAN-generated images, and diffusion model outputs - a significant improvement over state-of-the-art universal detectors. We demonstrate superior robustness to JPEG compression (83% accuracy at Q=70 vs. 66% for baselines) and provide pixel-level forgery localization with a 0.76 F1-score. Extensive ablation studies validate that each hierarchical component contributes 4-10% accuracy improvement, and qualitative analysis reveals interpretable forensic features aligned with human expert reasoning. Our work bridges classical image forensics and modern deep learning, offering a practical solution for real-world deployment where manipulation techniques are unknown a priori.

### [6] [Learning Domain-Invariant Representations for Cross-Domain Image Registration via Scene-Appearance Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08875)
*Jiahao Qin,Yiwen Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAR-Net disentangles scene and appearance for cross-domain image registration, achieving 3.1x improvement over baselines on microscopy data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image registration fails under domain shift where systematic intensity differences violate brightness constancy assumptions, making correspondence estimation ill-posed.

Method: Proposes SAR-Net framework that decomposes images into domain-invariant scene representations and domain-specific appearance codes, enabling registration via re-rendering rather than direct intensity matching. Includes theoretical guarantees and uses scene consistency and domain alignment losses.

Result: Achieves 0.885 SSIM and 0.979 NCC on bidirectional scanning microscopy data, representing 3.1x improvement over strongest baseline while maintaining real-time performance (77 fps). Ablation shows both losses are critical.

Conclusion: Scene-appearance disentanglement provides a principled solution to cross-domain registration, with theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance on challenging real-world microscopy data.

Abstract: Image registration under domain shift remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and medical imaging: when source and target images exhibit systematic intensity differences, the brightness constancy assumption underlying conventional registration methods is violated, rendering correspondence estimation ill-posed. We propose SAR-Net, a unified framework that addresses this challenge through principled scene-appearance disentanglement. Our key insight is that observed images can be decomposed into domain-invariant scene representations and domain-specific appearance codes, enabling registration via re-rendering rather than direct intensity matching. We establish theoretical conditions under which this decomposition enables consistent cross-domain alignment (Proposition 1) and prove that our scene consistency loss provides a sufficient condition for geometric correspondence in the shared latent space (Proposition 2). Empirically, we validate SAR-Net on bidirectional scanning microscopy, where coupled domain shift and geometric distortion create a challenging real-world testbed. Our method achieves 0.885 SSIM and 0.979 NCC, representing 3.1x improvement over the strongest baseline, while maintaining real-time performance (77 fps). Ablation studies confirm that both scene consistency and domain alignment losses are necessary: removing either degrades performance by 90% SSIM or causes 223x increase in latent alignment error, respectively. Code and data are available at https://github.com/D-ST-Sword/SAR-NET.

### [7] [The Semantic Lifecycle in Embodied AI: Acquisition, Representation and Storage via Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08876)
*Shuai Chen,Hao Chen,Yuanchen Bei,Tianyang Zhao,Zhibo Zhou,Feiran Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Survey paper proposing a "Semantic Lifecycle" framework to analyze how foundation models transform semantic processing in embodied AI, covering acquisition, representation, and storage stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic information in embodied AI is multi-source and multi-stage, making stable perception-to-action loops challenging. Traditional approaches with manual engineering and deep networks work for specific tasks but struggle with complex environments and open-ended tasks requiring more generalizable semantic processing.

Method: Proposes the "Semantic Lifecycle" as a unified framework to characterize semantic knowledge evolution in embodied AI driven by foundation models. This holistic perspective captures continuous flow and maintenance of semantic knowledge, departing from traditional isolated module approaches.

Result: Framework enables systematic analysis and comparison of recent advances across three key stages: acquisition, representation, and storage of semantic knowledge in embodied AI systems.

Conclusion: Foundation models reshape embodied AI research through cross-domain generalization and rich semantic priors. The Semantic Lifecycle framework provides a comprehensive way to understand and advance semantic processing capabilities for more robust embodied agents.

Abstract: Semantic information in embodied AI is inherently multi-source and multi-stage, making it challenging to fully leverage for achieving stable perception-to-action loops in real-world environments. Early studies have combined manual engineering with deep neural networks, achieving notable progress in specific semantic-related embodied tasks. However, as embodied agents encounter increasingly complex environments and open-ended tasks, the demand for more generalizable and robust semantic processing capabilities has become imperative. Recent advances in foundation models (FMs) address this challenge through their cross-domain generalization abilities and rich semantic priors, reshaping the landscape of embodied AI research. In this survey, we propose the Semantic Lifecycle as a unified framework to characterize the evolution of semantic knowledge within embodied AI driven by foundation models. Departing from traditional paradigms that treat semantic processing as isolated modules or disjoint tasks, our framework offers a holistic perspective that captures the continuous flow and maintenance of semantic knowledge. Guided by this embodied semantic lifecycle, we further analyze and compare recent advances across three key stages: acquisition, representation, and storage. Finally, we summarize existing challenges and outline promising directions for future research.

### [8] [TAG-MoE: Task-Aware Gating for Unified Generative Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08881)
*Yu Xu,Hongbin Yan,Juan Cao,Yiji Cheng,Tiankai Hang,Runze He,Zijin Yin,Shiyi Zhang,Yuxin Zhang,Jintao Li,Chunyu Wang,Qinglin Lu,Tong-Yee Lee,Fan Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a semantic-aware MoE framework for unified image generation/editing that injects task intent into routing to resolve task interference, outperforming dense baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified image generation/editing models suffer from task interference in dense diffusion transformers where shared parameters must compromise between conflicting objectives. Current sparse MoE approaches have task-agnostic gating networks that operate on local features without global task awareness, preventing meaningful specialization.

Method: Introduces Hierarchical Task Semantic Annotation to create structured task descriptors (scope, type, preservation). Designs Predictive Alignment Regularization to align internal routing decisions with high-level task semantics, evolving gating networks from task-agnostic to semantic-aware dispatch centers.

Result: Effectively mitigates task interference, outperforming dense baselines in fidelity and quality. Analysis shows experts naturally develop clear and semantically correlated specializations.

Conclusion: The proposed semantic-aware MoE framework successfully resolves task interference in unified image generation/editing models by injecting task intent into routing, enabling meaningful expert specialization and improved performance.

Abstract: Unified image generation and editing models suffer from severe task interference in dense diffusion transformers architectures, where a shared parameter space must compromise between conflicting objectives (e.g., local editing v.s. subject-driven generation). While the sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm is a promising solution, its gating networks remain task-agnostic, operating based on local features, unaware of global task intent. This task-agnostic nature prevents meaningful specialization and fails to resolve the underlying task interference. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to inject semantic intent into MoE routing. We introduce a Hierarchical Task Semantic Annotation scheme to create structured task descriptors (e.g., scope, type, preservation). We then design Predictive Alignment Regularization to align internal routing decisions with the task's high-level semantics. This regularization evolves the gating network from a task-agnostic executor to a dispatch center. Our model effectively mitigates task interference, outperforming dense baselines in fidelity and quality, and our analysis shows that experts naturally develop clear and semantically correlated specializations.

*Thomas Snyder,H. Lexie Yang,Stefan Schnake,Steffen Schotthöfer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DLRT framework compresses geospatial vision transformers for edge deployment by enforcing low-dimensional parameterizations during transfer learning, achieving strong compression with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geospatial foundation models are too large for resource-constrained edge devices, and existing compression methods cause significant accuracy loss, limiting practical adoption.

Method: Uses manifold-constrained optimization framework DLRT to compress large vision transformer-based geospatial models during transfer learning by enforcing structured low-dimensional parameterizations aligned with downstream objectives.

Result: Outperforms standard low-rank methods like LoRA, achieves substantial parameter reduction with minimal accuracy loss across diverse geospatial benchmarks, enabling high-performing on-device models.

Conclusion: DLRT enables effective compression of geospatial foundation models for edge deployment while preserving task-specific accuracy, overcoming limitations of existing compression techniques.

Abstract: Deploying geospatial foundation models on resource-constrained edge devices demands compact architectures that maintain high downstream performance. However, their large parameter counts and the accuracy loss often induced by compression limit practical adoption. In this work, we leverage manifold-constrained optimization framework DLRT to compress large vision transformer-based geospatial foundation models during transfer learning. By enforcing structured low-dimensional parameterizations aligned with downstream objectives, this approach achieves strong compression while preserving task-specific accuracy. We show that the method outperforms of-the-shelf low-rank methods as LoRA. Experiments on diverse geospatial benchmarks confirm substantial parameter reduction with minimal accuracy loss, enabling high-performing, on-device geospatial models.

### [10] [Adaptive few-shot learning for robust part quality classification in two-photon lithography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08885)
*Sixian Jia,Ruo-Syuan Mei,Chenhui Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adaptive computer vision framework for TPL quality control using statistical testing for novelty detection, few-shot incremental learning, and domain adaptation to handle dynamic manufacturing environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing static computer vision models for TPL quality control fail in dynamic manufacturing environments - they can't detect new defect classes, update efficiently from scarce data, or adapt to new part geometries.

Method: Three-component framework: 1) LDA-based statistical hypothesis testing for novelty detection, 2) rehearsal-based few-shot incremental learning for new classes, 3) few-shot Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) for domain adaptation between different part geometries.

Result: Novelty detection achieved 99-100% accuracy; incremental learning reached 92% accuracy with only 20 samples per new class; domain adaptation achieved 96.19% accuracy on target domain with just 5 shots, bridging severe domain gap between hemisphere and cube structures.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust, data-efficient solution for deploying and maintaining CV models in evolving production scenarios, addressing key limitations of static models in dynamic manufacturing environments.

Abstract: Two-photon lithography (TPL) is an advanced additive manufacturing (AM) technique for fabricating high-precision micro-structures. While computer vision (CV) is proofed for automated quality control, existing models are often static, rendering them ineffective in dynamic manufacturing environments. These models typically cannot detect new, unseen defect classes, be efficiently updated from scarce data, or adapt to new part geometries. To address this gap, this paper presents an adaptive CV framework for the entire life-cycle of quality model maintenance. The proposed framework is built upon a same, scale-robust backbone model and integrates three key methodologies: (1) a statistical hypothesis testing framework based on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for novelty detection, (2) a two-stage, rehearsal-based strategy for few-shot incremental learning, and (3) a few-shot Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) for few-shot domain adaptation. The framework was evaluated on a TPL dataset featuring hemisphere as source domain and cube as target domain structures, with each domain categorized into good, minor damaged, and damaged quality classes. The hypothesis testing method successfully identified new class batches with 99-100% accuracy. The incremental learning method integrated a new class to 92% accuracy using only K=20 samples. The domain adaptation model bridged the severe domain gap, achieving 96.19% accuracy on the target domain using only K=5 shots. These results demonstrate a robust and data-efficient solution for deploying and maintaining CV models in evolving production scenarios.

*Satyaki Roy Chowdhury,Golrokh Mirzaei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UAMSA-UNet improves brain tumor segmentation with uncertainty-aware multi-scale attention and Bayesian smoothing, achieving better accuracy and efficiency than U-Net variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNN and U-Net based brain tumor segmentation methods produce noisy boundaries in tumor infiltration regions, which is problematic for diagnosis and treatment planning.

Method: UAMSA-UNet combines Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty-aware Bayesian predictions, multi-scale feature fusion, attention mechanisms, and a smoothing-regularized loss that penalizes prediction variance across stochastic forward passes.

Result: On BraTS2023: 3.3% Dice and 2.7% IoU improvement over U-Net. On BraTS2024: 4.5% Dice and 4.0% IoU gains over best baseline. Also reduces FLOPs by 42.5% relative to U-Net++ while maintaining higher accuracy.

Conclusion: Combining multi-scale attention with learned smoothing prior achieves better segmentation quality and computational efficiency, providing a flexible foundation for future integration with transformer-based modules.

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is essential for diagnosis and treatment planning, yet many CNN and U-Net based approaches produce noisy boundaries in regions of tumor infiltration. We introduce UAMSA-UNet, an Uncertainty-Aware Multi-Scale Attention-based Bayesian U-Net that in- stead leverages Monte Carlo Dropout to learn a data-driven smoothing prior over its predictions, while fusing multi-scale features and attention maps to capture both fine details and global context. Our smoothing-regularized loss augments binary cross-entropy with a variance penalty across stochas- tic forward passes, discouraging spurious fluctuations and yielding spatially coherent masks. On BraTS2023, UAMSA- UNet improves Dice Similarity Coefficient by up to 3.3% and mean IoU by up to 2.7% over U-Net; on BraTS2024, it delivers up to 4.5% Dice and 4.0% IoU gains over the best baseline. Remarkably, it also reduces FLOPs by 42.5% rel- ative to U-Net++ while maintaining higher accuracy. These results demonstrate that, by combining multi-scale attention with a learned smoothing prior, UAMSA-UNet achieves both better segmentation quality and computational efficiency, and provides a flexible foundation for future integration with transformer-based modules for further enhanced segmenta- tion results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 2D thermography is limited for complex geometries, inaccessible areas, and subsurface defects in construction. There's a need for better methods to assess temperature distributions and detect structural defects in large-scale civil infrastructure.

Method: Developed multimodal fusion method combining thermal imaging and LiDAR with precise calibration/synchronization, then integrated with LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) for full coverage of large structures and detailed temperature monitoring across inspection cycles.

Result: Experimental validations on bridge and hall building show Thermo-LIO detects thermal anomalies and structural defects more accurately than traditional methods, enhances diagnostic precision, enables real-time processing, and expands inspection coverage.

Conclusion: Thermo-LIO demonstrates the crucial role of multimodal sensor integration in advancing SHM methodologies for large-scale civil infrastructure, providing superior defect detection and comprehensive thermal monitoring capabilities.

Abstract: Traditional two-dimensional thermography, despite being non-invasive and useful for defect detection in the construction field, is limited in effectively assessing complex geometries, inaccessible areas, and subsurface defects. This paper introduces Thermo-LIO, a novel multi-sensor system that can enhance Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) by fusing thermal imaging with high-resolution LiDAR. To achieve this, the study first develops a multimodal fusion method combining thermal imaging and LiDAR, enabling precise calibration and synchronization of multimodal data streams to create accurate representations of temperature distributions in buildings. Second, it integrates this fusion approach with LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO), enabling full coverage of large-scale structures and allowing for detailed monitoring of temperature variations and defect detection across inspection cycles. Experimental validations, including case studies on a bridge and a hall building, demonstrate that Thermo-LIO can detect detailed thermal anomalies and structural defects more accurately than traditional methods. The system enhances diagnostic precision, enables real-time processing, and expands inspection coverage, highlighting the crucial role of multimodal sensor integration in advancing SHM methodologies for large-scale civil infrastructure.

*Constantin Kolomiiets,Miroslav Purkrabek,Jiri Matas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adapting SAM 2.1 for pose-guided human segmentation with occlusion handling using PoseMaskRefine fine-tuning


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM struggles with occlusion where keypoints are partially or fully invisible, needing improved robustness for human segmentation in challenging conditions

Method: Fine-tune SAM 2.1 with PoseMaskRefine strategy, incorporating high-visibility pose keypoints into SAM's iterative correction process, using only top-3 visible keypoints during inference

Result: Improved robustness and accuracy across multiple datasets, accurate mask prediction from as few as one keypoint, reduced sensitivity to missing body parts or clothing errors

Conclusion: Pose-guided fine-tuning enables effective occlusion-aware human segmentation while preserving SAM's generalization capabilities

Abstract: Segment Anything (SAM) provides an unprecedented foundation for human segmentation, but may struggle under occlusion, where keypoints may be partially or fully invisible. We adapt SAM 2.1 for pose-guided segmentation with minimal encoder modifications, retaining its strong generalization. Using a fine-tuning strategy called PoseMaskRefine, we incorporate pose keypoints with high visibility into the iterative correction process originally employed by SAM, yielding improved robustness and accuracy across multiple datasets. During inference, we simplify prompting by selecting only the three keypoints with the highest visibility. This strategy reduces sensitivity to common errors, such as missing body parts or misclassified clothing, and allows accurate mask prediction from as few as a single keypoint. Our results demonstrate that pose-guided fine-tuning of SAM enables effective, occlusion-aware human segmentation while preserving the generalization capabilities of the original model. The code and pretrained models will be available at https://mirapurkrabek.github.io/BBox-MaskPose.

### [14] [Instance camera focus prediction for crystal agglomeration classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09004)
*Xiaoyu Ji,Chenhao Zhang,Tyler James Downard,Zoltan Nagy,Ali Shakouri,Fengqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed method combines instance camera focus prediction network with instance segmentation to improve crystal agglomeration classification from microscopic images by distinguishing true agglomeration from overlapping crystals at different depth layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Crystal agglomeration analysis from 2D microscopic images is challenging because overlapping crystals at different depth layers may appear connected but don't constitute true agglomeration, requiring depth information to distinguish real agglomerates.

Method: First developed an instance camera focus prediction network to quantify camera focus and predict 2-class focus levels (better than traditional focus measures), then combined this with an instance segmentation model for agglomeration classification.

Result: The proposed method achieves higher agglomeration classification and segmentation accuracy than baseline models on both ammonium perchlorate crystal and sugar crystal datasets.

Conclusion: Using focus level prediction to incorporate depth information improves crystal agglomeration analysis from microscopic images by distinguishing true agglomerates from overlapping crystals at different depths.

Abstract: Agglomeration refers to the process of crystal clustering due to interparticle forces. Crystal agglomeration analysis from microscopic images is challenging due to the inherent limitations of two-dimensional imaging. Overlapping crystals may appear connected even when located at different depth layers. Because optical microscopes have a shallow depth of field, crystals that are in-focus and out-of-focus in the same image typically reside on different depth layers and do not constitute true agglomeration. To address this, we first quantified camera focus with an instance camera focus prediction network to predict 2 class focus level that aligns better with visual observations than traditional image processing focus measures. Then an instance segmentation model is combined with the predicted focus level for agglomeration classification. Our proposed method has a higher agglomeration classification and segmentation accuracy than the baseline models on ammonium perchlorate crystal and sugar crystal dataset.

### [15] [Changes in Visual Attention Patterns for Detection Tasks due to Dependencies on Signal and Background Spatial Frequencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09008)
*Amar Kavuri,Howard C. Gifford,Mini Das*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study investigates how image properties affect visual attention in medical image analysis, using breast tomosynthesis images with different lesions and backgrounds, finding that detection performance is constrained by perceptual stages and influenced by target-background interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how image and signal properties impact visual attention mechanisms during signal detection tasks in digital images, particularly in medical imaging where accurate detection is critical but misdiagnosis still occurs despite radiologists' expertise.

Method: Used simulated tomographic breast images (DBT) with digital breast phantoms (Bakic and XCAT) containing two types of lesions (3-mm sphere and 6-mm spicule) with distinct spatial frequency properties. Conducted observer study with 6 human participants performing locating/detection tasks while collecting eye-gaze data to analyze visual attention mechanisms.

Result: Detection performance in complex visual environments is strongly constrained by later perceptual stages, with decision failures accounting for most errors. Signal detectability is jointly influenced by target morphology and background complexity, showing critical interaction between local signal features and global anatomical noise. Spiculated lesions received longer fixation durations, indicating differential visual attention engagement based on background and signal spatial frequency dependencies.

Conclusion: Visual attention mechanisms in medical image analysis are significantly affected by both target characteristics and background complexity, with decision-making failures being a major source of detection errors. The findings have implications for improving signal detection in complex heterogeneous backgrounds across various digital imaging applications.

Abstract: We aim to investigate the impact of image and signal properties on visual attention mechanisms during a signal detection task in digital images. The application of insight yielded from this work spans many areas of digital imaging where signal or pattern recognition is involved in complex heterogenous background. We used simulated tomographic breast images as the platform to investigate this question. While radiologists are highly effective at analyzing medical images to detect and diagnose diseases, misdiagnosis still occurs. We selected digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images as a sample medical images with different breast densities and structures using digital breast phantoms (Bakic and XCAT). Two types of lesions (with distinct spatial frequency properties) were randomly inserted in the phantoms during projections to generate abnormal cases. Six human observers participated in observer study designed for a locating and detection of an 3-mm sphere lesion and 6-mm spicule lesion in reconstructed in-plane DBT slices. We collected eye-gaze data to estimate gaze metrics and to examine differences in visual attention mechanisms. We found that detection performance in complex visual environments is strongly constrained by later perceptual stages, with decision failures accounting for the largest proportion of errors. Signal detectability is jointly influenced by both target morphology and background complexity, revealing a critical interaction between local signal features and global anatomical noise. Increased fixation duration on spiculated lesions suggests that visual attention is differentially engaged depending on background and signal spatial frequency dependencies.

### [16] [Depth-Wise Representation Development Under Blockwise Self-Supervised Learning for Video Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09040)
*Jonas Römer,Timo Dickscheid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Blockwise self-supervised learning applied to masked video transformers achieves comparable performance to end-to-end training while revealing different learning dynamics and representation development patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether masked video transformers can be trained without end-to-end backpropagation, and to compare blockwise self-supervised learning with end-to-end training in terms of learning dynamics and depth-wise representation development.

Method: Apply blockwise learning to masked autoencoding video vision transformers by partitioning the encoder into blocks, each optimized with a local masked reconstruction loss, and analyze depth-wise decodability, inter-block similarity, and patch-level diagnostics.

Result: Blockwise training converges and yields representations close to matched end-to-end baselines under linear-probe and retrieval metrics, while exposing higher-level structure earlier and showing different token-level patterns.

Conclusion: Blockwise training is viable for masked video modeling, with late-block saturation and interface formation contributing to remaining performance gaps, revealing different learning dynamics than end-to-end approaches.

Abstract: End-to-end backpropagation couples all layers through a global error signal, enabling coordinated learning but requiring long-range credit assignment. Motivated by recent progress in blockwise self-supervised learning (BWSSL), we ask whether masked video transformers can be trained without end-to-end backpropagation. Applying BWSSL to masked video modeling remains relatively underexplored and must handle spatiotemporal context and long-range temporal structure. More broadly, analyses that compare BWSSL and end-to-end training in terms of learning dynamics and depth-wise representation development remain sparse. We apply blockwise learning to a masked autoencoding video vision transformer by partitioning the encoder into blocks, each of which is optimized with a local masked reconstruction loss. Across model sizes and partition granularities, training converges and yields representations close to matched end-to-end baselines under linear-probe and retrieval proxies. In order to compare intermediate representations, we analyze depth-wise decodability, inter-block similarity, and patch-level diagnostics. Blockwise training exposes higher-level structure earlier, while later blocks saturate and operate in a more geometry-preserving regime. It can also induce token-level shifts consistent with stronger early mixing that pooled metrics can miss. These findings point to late-block saturation and interface formation as contributors to the remaining gap.

*Junze Shi,Yang Yu,Jian Shi,Haibo Luo*

TL;DR: STDTrack introduces spatiotemporal dependencies into lightweight tracking via dense video sampling, temporal propagation tokens, and multi-frame fusion, achieving SOTA performance at real-time speeds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lightweight trackers use sparse training sampling (one template + one search image per sequence), limiting spatiotemporal information utilization and creating a performance gap with high-performance trackers.

Method: Proposes STDTrack with: 1) Dense video sampling for comprehensive spatiotemporal exploration, 2) Temporally propagating spatiotemporal tokens for per-frame guidance, 3) Multi-frame Information Fusion Module (MFIFM) for historical context augmentation, 4) Spatiotemporal Token Maintainer (STM) with quality-based updates, and 5) Multi-scale prediction head for size adaptation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results across six benchmarks. On GOT-10k, rivals high-performance non-real-time trackers like MixFormer while operating at 192 FPS (GPU) and 41 FPS (CPU).

Conclusion: STDTrack successfully bridges the performance gap between lightweight and high-performance trackers by effectively integrating spatiotemporal dependencies while maintaining real-time efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based lightweight object tracking have established new standards across benchmarks, leveraging the global receptive field and powerful feature extraction capabilities of attention mechanisms. Despite these achievements, existing methods universally employ sparse sampling during training--utilizing only one template and one search image per sequence--which fails to comprehensively explore spatiotemporal information in videos. This limitation constrains performance and cause the gap between lightweight and high-performance trackers. To bridge this divide while maintaining real-time efficiency, we propose STDTrack, a framework that pioneers the integration of reliable spatiotemporal dependencies into lightweight trackers. Our approach implements dense video sampling to maximize spatiotemporal information utilization. We introduce a temporally propagating spatiotemporal token to guide per-frame feature extraction. To ensure comprehensive target state representation, we disign the Multi-frame Information Fusion Module (MFIFM), which augments current dependencies using historical context. The MFIFM operates on features stored in our constructed Spatiotemporal Token Maintainer (STM), where a quality-based update mechanism ensures information reliability. Considering the scale variation among tracking targets, we develop a multi-scale prediction head to dynamically adapt to objects of different sizes. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results across six benchmarks. Notably, on GOT-10k, STDTrack rivals certain high-performance non-real-time trackers (e.g., MixFormer) while operating at 192 FPS(GPU) and 41 FPS(CPU).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Future planetary missions require advanced autonomy and accurate localization. While ground-aerial robotic teams show promise, real space data with ground-truth position labels for training machine learning models is scarce.

Method: Proposed cross-view-localising dual-encoder deep neural networks using semantic segmentation with vision foundation models and high-volume synthetic data. Uses particle filters for state estimation with sequences of ground-view images.

Result: Developed new cross-view dataset of real-world rover trajectories with ground-truth localization from planetary analogue facility, plus synthetic image pairs. Method enables accurate position estimation over simple and complex trajectories.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges domain gap between synthetic and real images, enabling accurate rover localization in aerial maps using limited field-of-view monocular ground-view RGB images, supporting future planetary mission autonomy.

Abstract: Accurate localisation in planetary robotics enables the advanced autonomy required to support the increased scale and scope of future missions. The successes of the Ingenuity helicopter and multiple planetary orbiters lay the groundwork for future missions that use ground-aerial robotic teams. In this paper, we consider rovers using machine learning to localise themselves in a local aerial map using limited field-of-view monocular ground-view RGB images as input. A key consideration for machine learning methods is that real space data with ground-truth position labels suitable for training is scarce. In this work, we propose a novel method of localising rovers in an aerial map using cross-view-localising dual-encoder deep neural networks. We leverage semantic segmentation with vision foundation models and high volume synthetic data to bridge the domain gap to real images. We also contribute a new cross-view dataset of real-world rover trajectories with corresponding ground-truth localisation data captured in a planetary analogue facility, plus a high volume dataset of analogous synthetic image pairs. Using particle filters for state estimation with the cross-view networks allows accurate position estimation over simple and complex trajectories based on sequences of ground-view images.

TL;DR: MANGO is an unpaired image translation method that uses segmentation-conditioned InfoNCE loss and regularized discriminator design to maintain viewpoint consistency for sim2real transfer in robot manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-based robot manipulation policies are brittle to camera viewpoint variations, and real-world robot demonstration data is scarce and lacks viewpoint diversity. Simulation can provide comprehensive viewpoint coverage but faces visual sim2real challenges.

Method: Proposes MANGO - an unpaired image translation method with three key components: 1) novel segmentation-conditioned InfoNCE loss, 2) highly-regularized discriminator design, and 3) modified PatchNCE loss to maintain viewpoint consistency during sim2real translation.

Result: MANGO outperforms other image translation methods tested. Imitation-learning policies trained on MANGO-augmented data achieve up to 60% success rates on views where non-augmented policies fail completely, using only small amounts of fixed-camera real-world data.

Conclusion: MANGO effectively bridges the sim2real gap for robot manipulation by enabling viewpoint-consistent translation of simulated observations to real-world visual domains, significantly improving policy robustness to viewpoint variations.

Abstract: Vision-based policies for robot manipulation have achieved significant recent success, but are still brittle to distribution shifts such as camera viewpoint variations. Robot demonstration data is scarce and often lacks appropriate variation in camera viewpoints. Simulation offers a way to collect robot demonstrations at scale with comprehensive coverage of different viewpoints, but presents a visual sim2real challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose MANGO -- an unpaired image translation method with a novel segmentation-conditioned InfoNCE loss, a highly-regularized discriminator design, and a modified PatchNCE loss. We find that these elements are crucial for maintaining viewpoint consistency during sim2real translation. When training MANGO, we only require a small amount of fixed-camera data from the real world, but show that our method can generate diverse unseen viewpoints by translating simulated observations. In this domain, MANGO outperforms all other image translation methods we tested. Imitation-learning policies trained on data augmented by MANGO are able to achieve success rates as high as 60\% on views that the non-augmented policy fails completely on.

*Yanguang Sun,Chao Wang,Jian Yang,Lei Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WEFT: Dynamic wavelet expert-guided fine-tuning paradigm for efficient adaptation of large-scale foundation models to optical remote sensing image segmentation with fewer trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale foundation models offer stronger performance potential for remote sensing image segmentation, but full-parameter fine-tuning is impractical due to massive GPU memory consumption and computational costs. Existing methods use moderate-scale models, limiting exploration of large-scale models.

Method: Proposes WEFT with two key components: 1) Task-specific wavelet expert extractor that models wavelet experts from different perspectives and dynamically regulates outputs to generate trainable features, and 2) Expert-guided conditional adapter that enhances frozen features with trainable features and iteratively updates both feature types for efficient fine-tuning.

Result: Outperforms 21 state-of-the-art methods on three optical remote sensing image datasets, and achieves optimal results in camouflage, natural, and medical scenarios.

Conclusion: WEFT provides an efficient fine-tuning paradigm that enables practical use of large-scale foundation models for remote sensing image segmentation with significantly reduced computational requirements while achieving superior performance across multiple domains.

Abstract: Accurately localizing and segmenting relevant objects from optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) is critical for advancing remote sensing applications. Existing methods are typically built upon moderate-scale pre-trained models and employ diverse optimization strategies to achieve promising performance under full-parameter fine-tuning. In fact, deeper and larger-scale foundation models can provide stronger support for performance improvement. However, due to their massive number of parameters, directly adopting full-parameter fine-tuning leads to pronounced training difficulties, such as excessive GPU memory consumption and high computational costs, which result in extremely limited exploration of large-scale models in existing works. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic wavelet expert-guided fine-tuning paradigm with fewer trainable parameters, dubbed WEFT, which efficiently adapts large-scale foundation models to ORSIs segmentation tasks by leveraging the guidance of wavelet experts. Specifically, we introduce a task-specific wavelet expert extractor to model wavelet experts from different perspectives and dynamically regulate their outputs, thereby generating trainable features enriched with task-specific information for subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we construct an expert-guided conditional adapter that first enhances the fine-grained perception of frozen features for specific tasks by injecting trainable features, and then iteratively updates the information of both types of feature, allowing for efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that our WEFT not only outperforms 21 state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three ORSIs datasets, but also achieves optimal results in camouflage, natural, and medical scenarios.

TL;DR: Fast-ThinkAct is an efficient VLA framework that uses verbalizable latent reasoning to achieve compact planning with 89.3% reduced inference latency while maintaining strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning VLAs using explicit chain-of-thought suffer from high inference latency due to lengthy reasoning traces, creating a need for more efficient reasoning frameworks for vision-language-action tasks.

Method: Learns verbalizable latent reasoning through distillation from a teacher model, using preference-guided objective to align manipulation trajectories, transferring both linguistic and visual planning capabilities for embodied control.

Result: Achieves strong performance with up to 89.3% reduced inference latency over state-of-the-art reasoning VLAs while maintaining effective long-horizon planning, few-shot adaptation, and failure recovery across diverse embodied manipulation benchmarks.

Conclusion: Fast-ThinkAct demonstrates that efficient reasoning-enhanced policy learning can effectively connect compact reasoning to action execution, offering a practical solution for real-time embodied AI applications.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) tasks require reasoning over complex visual scenes and executing adaptive actions in dynamic environments. While recent studies on reasoning VLAs show that explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) can improve generalization, they suffer from high inference latency due to lengthy reasoning traces. We propose Fast-ThinkAct, an efficient reasoning framework that achieves compact yet performant planning through verbalizable latent reasoning. Fast-ThinkAct learns to reason efficiently with latent CoTs by distilling from a teacher, driven by a preference-guided objective to align manipulation trajectories that transfers both linguistic and visual planning capabilities for embodied control. This enables reasoning-enhanced policy learning that effectively connects compact reasoning to action execution. Extensive experiments across diverse embodied manipulation and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-ThinkAct achieves strong performance with up to 89.3\% reduced inference latency over state-of-the-art reasoning VLAs, while maintaining effective long-horizon planning, few-shot adaptation, and failure recovery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM-Aug uses Segment Anything Model's geometry-aware segmentation to improve few-shot land cover mapping from time-series remote sensing images without additional labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot semantic segmentation of remote sensing images is challenging due to scarce labeled data. While state-of-the-art models perform well with full supervision, their performance degrades significantly under limited labeling, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: Constructs cloud-free composite images from temporal sequences, applies SAM in unsupervised manner to generate geometry-aware mask priors, integrates priors through RegionSmoothLoss that enforces prediction consistency within SAM-derived regions across temporal frames.

Result: Achieves mean test mIoU of 36.21% (outperforming SOTA by +2.33pp, 6.89% relative improvement). On most favorable split reaches 40.28% mIoU (11.2% relative gain). Consistent improvement across all seeds confirms generalization power.

Conclusion: Vision models like SAM can serve as useful regularizers in few-shot remote sensing learning, offering scalable plug-and-play solution for land cover monitoring without requiring manual annotations or model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation of time-series remote sensing images remains a critical challenge, particularly in regions where labeled data is scarce or costly to obtain. While state-of-the-art models perform well under full supervision, their performance degrades significantly under limited labeling, limiting their real-world applicability. In this work, we propose SAM-Aug, a new annotation-efficient framework that leverages the geometry-aware segmentation capability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to improve few-shot land cover mapping. Our approach constructs cloud-free composite images from temporal sequences and applies SAM in a fully unsupervised manner to generate geometry-aware mask priors. These priors are then integrated into training through a proposed loss function called RegionSmoothLoss, which enforces prediction consistency within each SAM-derived region across temporal frames, effectively regularizing the model to respect semantically coherent structures. Extensive experiments on the PASTIS-R benchmark under a 5 percent labeled setting demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SAM-Aug. Averaged over three random seeds (42, 2025, 4090), our method achieves a mean test mIoU of 36.21 percent, outperforming the state-of-the-art baseline by +2.33 percentage points, a relative improvement of 6.89 percent. Notably, on the most favorable split (seed=42), SAM-Aug reaches a test mIoU of 40.28 percent, representing an 11.2 percent relative gain with no additional labeled data. The consistent improvement across all seeds confirms the generalization power of leveraging foundation model priors under annotation scarcity. Our results highlight that vision models like SAM can serve as useful regularizers in few-shot remote sensing learning, offering a scalable and plug-and-play solution for land cover monitoring without requiring manual annotations or model fine-tuning.

*Yang Li,Aming Wu,Zihao Zhang,Yahong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes slow4fast-VLN, a dynamic interactive fast-slow reasoning framework for Vision-Language Navigation that enables agents to adapt to unseen environments and instructions through experience accumulation and reflection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VLN methods follow a close-set assumption where training and test data share similar styles, but real-world navigation requires adaptation to diverse unseen environments and inconsistent instructions. The General Scene Adaptation (GSA-VLN) task aims to address this by learning generalized navigation ability.

Method: Proposes slow4fast-VLN framework with two interactive modules: 1) Fast-reasoning module - an end-to-end strategy network that outputs actions in real-time and accumulates execution records in a history repository; 2) Slow-reasoning module - analyzes memories from fast-reasoning, extracts generalization-enhancing experiences through deep reflection, and structurally stores them to continuously optimize the fast-reasoning module.

Result: The framework enables continuous adaptation and efficient execution of navigation tasks in unseen scenarios by leveraging experience-based interaction between fast and slow reasoning systems, unlike traditional methods that treat them as independent mechanisms.

Conclusion: The proposed slow4fast-VLN framework successfully addresses the General Scene Adaptation challenge in VLN by establishing a dynamic interactive fast-slow reasoning system that enhances generalization ability through experience accumulation and reflection, enabling better adaptation to diverse real-world environments.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation aims to enable agents to navigate to a target location based on language instructions. Traditional VLN often follows a close-set assumption, i.e., training and test data share the same style of the input images and instructions. However, the real world is open and filled with various unseen environments, posing enormous difficulties for close-set methods. To this end, we focus on the General Scene Adaptation (GSA-VLN) task, aiming to learn generalized navigation ability by introducing diverse environments and inconsistent intructions.Towards this task, when facing unseen environments and instructions, the challenge mainly lies in how to enable the agent to dynamically produce generalized strategies during the navigation process. Recent research indicates that by means of fast and slow cognition systems, human beings could generate stable policies, which strengthen their adaptation for open world. Inspired by this idea, we propose the slow4fast-VLN, establishing a dynamic interactive fast-slow reasoning framework. The fast-reasoning module, an end-to-end strategy network, outputs actions via real-time input. It accumulates execution records in a history repository to build memory. The slow-reasoning module analyze the memories generated by the fast-reasoning module. Through deep reflection, it extracts experiences that enhance the generalization ability of decision-making. These experiences are structurally stored and used to continuously optimize the fast-reasoning module. Unlike traditional methods that treat fast-slow reasoning as independent mechanisms, our framework enables fast-slow interaction. By leveraging the experiences from slow reasoning. This interaction allows the system to continuously adapt and efficiently execute navigation tasks when facing unseen scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: End-to-end structure-aware multimodal reasoning framework for degraded license plate recognition using character slot queries and residual modulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current two-stage "restoration-then-recognition" approach suffers from misalignment between pixel-level restoration objectives and semantic recognition goals, causing artifacts and error accumulation. Vision-language models lack explicit structural modeling for license plate character sequences.

Method: Proposes Character-Aware Multimodal Reasoning Module (CMRM) with learnable Character Slot Queries that retrieve fine-grained evidence from visual features via cross-attention, then inject character-aware representations back into visual tokens via residual modulation for autoregressive generation with structural priors. Uses LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing restoration-recognition combinations and general VLMs on both synthetic and real-world severely degraded datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating structured reasoning into large models is superior for low-quality text recognition tasks, validating the effectiveness of explicit structural modeling for license plate recognition under severe degradations.

Abstract: Real-world License Plate Recognition (LPR) faces significant challenges from severe degradations such as motion blur, low resolution, and complex illumination. The prevailing "restoration-then-recognition" two-stage paradigm suffers from a fundamental flaw: the pixel-level optimization objectives of image restoration models are misaligned with the semantic goals of character recognition, leading to artifact interference and error accumulation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated powerful general capabilities, they lack explicit structural modeling for license plate character sequences (e.g., fixed length, specific order). To address this, we propose an end-to-end structure-aware multimodal reasoning framework based on Qwen3-VL. The core innovation lies in the Character-Aware Multimodal Reasoning Module (CMRM), which introduces a set of learnable Character Slot Queries. Through a cross-attention mechanism, these queries actively retrieve fine-grained evidence corresponding to character positions from visual features. Subsequently, we inject these character-aware representations back into the visual tokens via residual modulation, enabling the language model to perform autoregressive generation based on explicit structural priors. Furthermore, combined with the LoRA parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, the model achieves domain adaptation while retaining the generalization capabilities of the large model. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world severely degraded datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing restoration-recognition combinations and general VLMs, validating the superiority of incorporating structured reasoning into large models for low-quality text recognition tasks.

Motivation: Current vision-based rail defect detection methods suffer from high computational complexity, excessive parameters, and suboptimal accuracy, limiting practical deployment in industrial settings.

Conclusion: LPCANet effectively bridges traditional and deep learning approaches for industrial defect inspection, offering practical value with future work focused on further compression for real-time deployment.

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of current vision-based rail defect detection methods, including high computational complexity, excessive parameter counts, and suboptimal accuracy. We propose a Lightweight Pyramid Cross-Attention Network (LPCANet) that leverages RGB-D data for efficient and accurate defect identification. The architecture integrates MobileNetv2 as a backbone for RGB feature extraction with a lightweight pyramid module (LPM) for depth processing, coupled with a cross-attention mechanism (CAM) for multimodal fusion and a spatial feature extractor (SFE) for enhanced structural analysis. Comprehensive evaluations on three unsupervised RGB-D rail datasets (NEU-RSDDS-AUG, RSDD-TYPE1, RSDD-TYPE2) demonstrate that LPCANet achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 9.90 million parameters, 2.50 G FLOPs, and 162.60 fps inference speed. Compared to 18 existing methods, LPCANet shows significant improvements, including +1.48\% in $S_α$, +0.86\% in IOU, and +1.77\% in MAE over the best-performing baseline. Ablation studies confirm the critical roles of CAM and SFE, while experiments on non-rail datasets (DAGM2007, MT, Kolektor-SDD2) validate its generalization capability. The proposed framework effectively bridges traditional and deep learning approaches, offering substantial practical value for industrial defect inspection. Future work will focus on further model compression for real-time deployment.

*Xin Yuan,Meiqi Wan,Wei Liu,Xin Xu,Zheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CenterPolar is a novel SDG-DML framework that uses class-centric polarization with centrifugal expansion and centripetal constraint to improve generalization to unseen categories and domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-domain generalized deep metric learning faces challenges with both category and domain shifts during testing, limiting real-world applications. Existing methods using proxy-based expansion generate samples clustered near class proxies, failing to simulate broad domain shifts.

Method: CenterPolar uses two collaborative class-centric polarization phases: (1) Class-Centric Centrifugal Expansion (C³E) that shifts source data away from class centroids to generalize to unseen domains, and (2) Class-Centric Centripetal Constraint (C⁴) that pulls all samples toward class centroids while enforcing inter-class separation.

Result: Extensive experiments on CUB-200-2011 Ext., Cars196 Ext., DomainNet, PACS, and Office-Home datasets demonstrate superiority and effectiveness over existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CenterPolar effectively addresses the dual challenge of category and domain shifts in SDG-DML by dynamically expanding and constraining domain distributions, learning a generalizable DML model for wider target domain distributions.

Abstract: Single-domain generalized deep metric learning (SDG-DML) faces the dual challenge of both category and domain shifts during testing, limiting real-world applications. Therefore, aiming to learn better generalization ability on both unseen categories and domains is a realistic goal for the SDG-DML task. To deliver the aspiration, existing SDG-DML methods employ the domain expansion-equalization strategy to expand the source data and generate out-of-distribution samples. However, these methods rely on proxy-based expansion, which tends to generate samples clustered near class proxies, failing to simulate the broad and distant domain shifts encountered in practice. To alleviate the problem, we propose CenterPolar, a novel SDG-DML framework that dynamically expands and constrains domain distributions to learn a generalizable DML model for wider target domain distributions. Specifically, \textbf{CenterPolar} contains two collaborative class-centric polarization phases: (1) Class-Centric Centrifugal Expansion ($C^3E$) and (2) Class-Centric Centripetal Constraint ($C^4$). In the first phase, $C^3E$ drives the source domain distribution by shifting the source data away from class centroids using centrifugal expansion to generalize to more unseen domains. In the second phase, to consolidate domain-invariant class information for the generalization ability to unseen categories, $C^4$ pulls all seen and unseen samples toward their class centroids while enforcing inter-class separation via centripetal constraint. Extensive experimental results on widely used CUB-200-2011 Ext., Cars196 Ext., DomainNet, PACS, and Office-Home datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our CenterPolar over existing state-of-the-art methods. The code will be released after acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SkinFlow introduces a framework optimizing visual information flow for dermatology diagnosis, achieving state-of-the-art results with a 7B model by using dynamic vision encoding and reinforcement learning, outperforming much larger general-purpose models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose LVLMs struggle in dermatology due to "diffuse attention" - they can't separate subtle pathological lesions from background noise, and the paper challenges the assumption that parameter scaling alone leads to medical precision.

Method: SkinFlow uses a Virtual-Width Dynamic Vision Encoder to unfold complex pathological manifolds without parameter expansion, coupled with a two-stage Reinforcement Learning strategy that aligns explicit medical descriptions (Stage I) and reconstructs implicit diagnostic textures (Stage II) in a constrained semantic space.

Result: The 7B model achieves new state-of-the-art on Fitzpatrick17k benchmark: +12.06% gain in Top-1 accuracy and +28.57% boost in Top-6 accuracy over massive general-purpose models like Qwen3VL-235B and GPT-5.2.

Conclusion: Optimizing geometric capacity and information flow yields superior diagnostic reasoning compared to raw parameter scaling, demonstrating that medical precision can be achieved through architectural innovation rather than just model size.

Abstract: General-purpose Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), despite their massive scale, often falter in dermatology due to "diffuse attention" - the inability to disentangle subtle pathological lesions from background noise. In this paper, we challenge the assumption that parameter scaling is the only path to medical precision. We introduce SkinFlow, a framework that treats diagnosis as an optimization of visual information transmission efficiency. Our approach utilizes a Virtual-Width Dynamic Vision Encoder (DVE) to "unfold" complex pathological manifolds without physical parameter expansion, coupled with a two-stage Reinforcement Learning strategy. This strategy sequentially aligns explicit medical descriptions (Stage I) and reconstructs implicit diagnostic textures (Stage II) within a constrained semantic space. Furthermore, we propose a clinically grounded evaluation protocol that prioritizes diagnostic safety and hierarchical relevance over rigid label matching. Empirical results are compelling: our 7B model establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Fitzpatrick17k benchmark, achieving a +12.06% gain in Top-1 accuracy and a +28.57% boost in Top-6 accuracy over the massive general-purpose models (e.g., Qwen3VL-235B and GPT-5.2).

TL;DR: SSVP is a zero-shot anomaly detection method that fuses DINOv3's structural priors with CLIP's semantic space using hierarchical synergy and vision-conditioned prompting to improve fine-grained anomaly perception without supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot anomaly detection methods rely on single visual backbones that struggle to balance global semantic generalization with fine-grained structural discriminability, limiting their effectiveness in industrial inspection.

Method: Proposes Synergistic Semantic-Visual Prompting (SSVP) with three components: 1) Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Synergy (HSVS) integrates DINOv3's multi-scale structural priors into CLIP semantic space; 2) Vision-Conditioned Prompt Generator (VCPG) uses cross-modal attention for dynamic prompt generation; 3) Visual-Text Anomaly Mapper (VTAM) establishes dual-gated calibration to address global-local discrepancy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on seven industrial benchmarks: 93.0% Image-AUROC and 92.2% Pixel-AUROC on MVTec-AD, significantly outperforming existing zero-shot approaches.

Conclusion: SSVP effectively bridges the gap between global semantic understanding and fine-grained structural perception in zero-shot anomaly detection, demonstrating robust performance across diverse industrial inspection scenarios without requiring supervision.

Abstract: Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enable supervision-free industrial inspection. However, existing ZSAD paradigms are constrained by single visual backbones, which struggle to balance global semantic generalization with fine-grained structural discriminability. To bridge this gap, we propose Synergistic Semantic-Visual Prompting (SSVP), that efficiently fuses diverse visual encodings to elevate model's fine-grained perception. Specifically, SSVP introduces the Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Synergy (HSVS) mechanism, which deeply integrates DINOv3's multi-scale structural priors into the CLIP semantic space. Subsequently, the Vision-Conditioned Prompt Generator (VCPG) employs cross-modal attention to guide dynamic prompt generation, enabling linguistic queries to precisely anchor to specific anomaly patterns. Furthermore, to address the discrepancy between global scoring and local evidence, the Visual-Text Anomaly Mapper (VTAM) establishes a dual-gated calibration paradigm. Extensive evaluations on seven industrial benchmarks validate the robustness of our method; SSVP achieves state-of-the-art performance with 93.0\% Image-AUROC and 92.2\% Pixel-AUROC on MVTec-AD, significantly outperforming existing zero-shot approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robustness to natural corruptions is critical for reliable deep learning in safety-sensitive domains like traffic sign recognition, where current methods may not adequately handle realistic environmental variations.

Method: Proposes model-based training approaches using learned nuisance variation models to generate realistic corruptions, including hybrid strategies combining random coverage with adversarial refinement in nuisance space. Evaluated on CURE-TSR dataset with Snow and Rain corruptions.

Result: Model-based methods consistently outperform Vanilla, Adversarial Training, and AugMix baselines. Model-based adversarial training provides strongest robustness across all corruptions but with higher computation. Model-based data augmentation achieves comparable robustness with significantly less computational complexity without statistically significant performance drop.

Conclusion: Learned nuisance models are important for capturing natural variability, offering a promising path toward more resilient and calibrated models under challenging conditions, with trade-offs between robustness and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Robustness to natural corruptions remains a critical challenge for reliable deep learning, particularly in safety-sensitive domains. We study a family of model-based training approaches that leverage a learned nuisance variation model to generate realistic corruptions, as well as new hybrid strategies that combine random coverage with adversarial refinement in nuisance space. Using the Challenging Unreal and Real Environments for Traffic Sign Recognition dataset (CURE-TSR), with Snow and Rain corruptions, we evaluate accuracy, calibration, and training complexity across corruption severities. Our results show that model-based methods consistently outperform baselines Vanilla, Adversarial Training, and AugMix baselines, with model-based adversarial training providing the strongest robustness under across all corruptions but at the expense of higher computation and model-based data augmentation achieving comparable robustness with $T$ less computational complexity without incurring a statistically significant drop in performance. These findings highlight the importance of learned nuisance models for capturing natural variability, and suggest a promising path toward more resilient and calibrated models under challenging conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenAI text-to-image systems produce inaccurate architectural imagery, with only 42% average accuracy across major platforms, showing better performance on common vs rare architectural prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how well generative AI text-to-image systems can reproduce accurate architectural imagery, given their increasing use in a historically rule-bound field where accuracy matters.

Method: Tested 5 GenAI platforms (Adobe Firefly, DALL-E 3, Google Imagen 3, Microsoft Image Generator, Midjourney) using 30 architectural prompts spanning styles, typologies, and codified elements. Each prompt-generator pair produced 4 images (600 total). Two architectural historians independently scored images for accuracy against predefined criteria, with disagreements resolved by consensus.

Result: Overall accuracy was limited (mean 42%, range 32-52%). Common prompts were 2.7x more accurate than rare prompts. All-correct outcomes were similar across platforms, but all-incorrect outcomes varied substantially (Imagen 3 had fewest failures, Microsoft Image Generator had most). Qualitative analysis revealed recurring errors: over-embellishment, confusion between medieval styles and revivals, and misrepresentation of descriptive prompts.

Conclusion: GenAI systems currently produce inaccurate architectural imagery, supporting the need for visible labeling of synthetic content, provenance standards for training datasets, and cautious educational use of GenAI architectural imagery.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) text-to-image systems are increasingly used to generate architectural imagery, yet their capacity to reproduce accurate images in a historically rule-bound field remains poorly characterized. We evaluated five widely used GenAI image platforms (Adobe Firefly, DALL-E 3, Google Imagen 3, Microsoft Image Generator, and Midjourney) using 30 architectural prompts spanning styles, typologies, and codified elements. Each prompt-generator pair produced four images (n = 600 images total). Two architectural historians independently scored each image for accuracy against predefined criteria, resolving disagreements by consensus. Set-level performance was summarized as zero to four accurate images per four-image set. Image output from Common prompts was 2.7-fold more accurate than from Rare prompts (p < 0.05). Across platforms, overall accuracy was limited (highest accuracy score 52 percent; lowest 32 percent; mean 42 percent). All-correct (4 out of 4) outcomes were similar across platforms. By contrast, all-incorrect (0 out of 4) outcomes varied substantially, with Imagen 3 exhibiting the fewest failures and Microsoft Image Generator exhibiting the highest number of failures. Qualitative review of the image dataset identified recurring patterns including over-embellishment, confusion between medieval styles and their later revivals, and misrepresentation of descriptive prompts (for example, egg-and-dart, banded column, pendentive). These findings support the need for visible labeling of GenAI synthetic content, provenance standards for future training datasets, and cautious educational use of GenAI architectural imagery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: N EIoU YOLOv9 is a lightweight detection framework using a novel bounding box regression loss (N EIoU) that improves localization for small, low-contrast agricultural disease targets, achieving 90.3% mAP on rice leaf images and efficient edge deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agricultural disease detection often involves small, low-contrast targets in field conditions, requiring improved localization accuracy and optimization stability for edge-based monitoring systems.

Method: Proposed N EIoU loss combines non-monotonic gradient focusing with geometric decoupling principles to reshape localization gradients, enhancing weak regression signals for hard samples while reducing gradient interference. Integrated into lightweight YOLOv9t architecture.

Result: Achieved 90.3% mean Average Precision on self-collected rice leaf dataset (5908 images, 4 disease categories + healthy leaves), representing 4.3% improvement over CIoU baseline. Deployed on Android with TensorFlow Lite Float16 quantization achieving 156ms average inference time per frame.

Conclusion: The N EIoU YOLOv9 framework effectively balances accuracy, optimization stability, and computational efficiency for edge-based agricultural monitoring systems, demonstrating practical viability for real-world deployment.

Abstract: In this work, we propose N EIoU YOLOv9, a lightweight detection framework based on a signal aware bounding box regression loss derived from non monotonic gradient focusing and geometric decoupling principles, referred to as N EIoU (Non monotonic Efficient Intersection over Union). The proposed loss reshapes localization gradients by combining non monotonic focusing with decoupled width and height optimization, thereby enhancing weak regression signals for hard samples with low overlap while reducing gradient interference. This design is particularly effective for small and low contrast targets commonly observed in agricultural disease imagery. The proposed N EIoU loss is integrated into a lightweight YOLOv9t architecture and evaluated on a self collected field dataset comprising 5908 rice leaf images across four disease categories and healthy leaves. Experimental results demonstrate consistent performance gains over the standard CIoU loss, achieving a mean Average Precision of 90.3 percent, corresponding to a 4.3 percent improvement over the baseline, with improved localization accuracy under stricter evaluation criteria. For practical validation, the optimized model is deployed on an Android device using TensorFlow Lite with Float16 quantization, achieving an average inference time of 156 milliseconds per frame while maintaining accuracy. These results confirm that the proposed approach effectively balances accuracy, optimization stability, and computational efficiency for edge based agricultural monitoring systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical deployment of medical image segmentation models is constrained by on-premises infrastructure with fixed computational resources and governance restrictions. High-capacity models have strong accuracy but impractical computational demands for hospital environments.

Method: Deployment-oriented framework using knowledge distillation to translate high-performing segmentation models into scalable family of compact student models without modifying inference pipeline. Preserves architectural compatibility while enabling systematic capacity reduction.

Result: With 94% parameter reduction, distilled student model preserves 98.7% of teacher's segmentation accuracy, achieves 67% reduction in CPU inference latency without additional deployment overhead. Evaluated on multi-site brain MRI (1,104 3D volumes) and abdominal CT for cross-modality generalizability.

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation provides practical and reliable pathway for converting research-grade segmentation models into maintainable, deployment-ready components for on-premises clinical workflows in real-world health systems.

Abstract: Deploying medical image segmentation models in routine clinical workflows is often constrained by on-premises infrastructure, where computational resources are fixed and cloud-based inference may be restricted by governance and security policies. While high-capacity models achieve strong segmentation accuracy, their computational demands hinder practical deployment and long-term maintainability in hospital environments. We present a deployment-oriented framework that leverages knowledge distillation to translate a high-performing segmentation model into a scalable family of compact student models, without modifying the inference pipeline. The proposed approach preserves architectural compatibility with existing clinical systems while enabling systematic capacity reduction. The framework is evaluated on a multi-site brain MRI dataset comprising 1,104 3D volumes, with independent testing on 101 curated cases, and is further examined on abdominal CT to assess cross-modality generalizability. Under aggressive parameter reduction (94%), the distilled student model preserves nearly all of the teacher's segmentation accuracy (98.7%), while achieving substantial efficiency gains, including up to a 67% reduction in CPU inference latency without additional deployment overhead. These results demonstrate that knowledge distillation provides a practical and reliable pathway for converting research-grade segmentation models into maintainable, deployment-ready components for on-premises clinical workflows in real-world health systems.

TL;DR: Point-Seg uses point tracking as temporal cue for myocardium segmentation in echocardiography videos, improving consistency without memory-based feature accumulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Myocardium segmentation in echocardiography is challenging due to low contrast, noise, and anatomical variability. Traditional deep learning models either ignore temporal information or use memory-based feature propagation that accumulates errors over time.

Method: Proposes Point-Seg, a transformer-based segmentation framework that integrates point tracking as temporal cue. Uses a point-tracking module trained on synthetic echocardiography data to track key anatomical landmarks across video sequences. Tracked trajectories provide explicit motion-aware signal to guide segmentation, reducing drift. Also incorporates temporal smoothing loss for enhanced temporal consistency.

Result: Evaluated on public and private echocardiography datasets. Achieves statistically similar Dice accuracy to SOTA models in high-quality echo data, better accuracy in lower-quality echo with improved temporal stability. Provides pixel-level myocardium motion information essential for downstream tasks like myocardial strain measurement and regional wall motion abnormality detection.

Conclusion: Point-Seg demonstrates that point tracking can serve as effective temporal cue for consistent video segmentation, offering reliable and generalizable approach for myocardium segmentation in echocardiography videos.

Abstract: Purpose: Myocardium segmentation in echocardiography videos is a challenging task due to low contrast, noise, and anatomical variability. Traditional deep learning models either process frames independently, ignoring temporal information, or rely on memory-based feature propagation, which accumulates error over time. Methods: We propose Point-Seg, a transformer-based segmentation framework that integrates point tracking as a temporal cue to ensure stable and consistent segmentation of myocardium across frames. Our method leverages a point-tracking module trained on a synthetic echocardiography dataset to track key anatomical landmarks across video sequences. These tracked trajectories provide an explicit motion-aware signal that guides segmentation, reducing drift and eliminating the need for memory-based feature accumulation. Additionally, we incorporate a temporal smoothing loss to further enhance temporal consistency across frames. Results: We evaluate our approach on both public and private echocardiography datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that Point-Seg has statistically similar accuracy in terms of Dice to state-of-the-art segmentation models in high quality echo data, while it achieves better segmentation accuracy in lower quality echo with improved temporal stability. Furthermore, Point-Seg has the key advantage of pixel-level myocardium motion information as opposed to other segmentation methods. Such information is essential in the computation of other downstream tasks such as myocardial strain measurement and regional wall motion abnormality detection. Conclusion: Point-Seg demonstrates that point tracking can serve as an effective temporal cue for consistent video segmentation, offering a reliable and generalizable approach for myocardium segmentation in echocardiography videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PaGKD enables cross-modal knowledge distillation from NBI to WLI for endoscopic cancer screening without requiring paired images, using group-level learning instead of instance alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for transferring diagnostic knowledge from Narrow-Band Imaging (NBI) to White-Light Imaging (WLI) models require paired NBI-WLI images of the same lesion, which is costly and impractical, leaving most clinical data unused.

Method: PaGKD (Pairing-free Group-level Knowledge Distillation) uses two complementary modules: GKD-Pro distills modality-invariant semantic prototypes via shared lesion-aware queries, and GKD-Den performs dense cross-modal alignment using group-aware attention with activation-derived relation maps.

Result: Extensive experiments on four clinical datasets show PaGKD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods with relative AUC improvements of 3.3%, 1.1%, 2.8%, and 3.2%.

Conclusion: PaGKD establishes a new direction for cross-modal learning from unpaired data by operating at group level rather than instance level, enabling effective knowledge transfer without requiring image-level correspondence.

Abstract: White-Light Imaging (WLI) is the standard for endoscopic cancer screening, but Narrow-Band Imaging (NBI) offers superior diagnostic details. A key challenge is transferring knowledge from NBI to enhance WLI-only models, yet existing methods are critically hampered by their reliance on paired NBI-WLI images of the same lesion, a costly and often impractical requirement that leaves vast amounts of clinical data untapped. In this paper, we break this paradigm by introducing PaGKD, a novel Pairing-free Group-level Knowledge Distillation framework that that enables effective cross-modal learning using unpaired WLI and NBI data. Instead of forcing alignment between individual, often semantically mismatched image instances, PaGKD operates at the group level to distill more complete and compatible knowledge across modalities. Central to PaGKD are two complementary modules: (1) Group-level Prototype Distillation (GKD-Pro) distills compact group representations by extracting modality-invariant semantic prototypes via shared lesion-aware queries; (2) Group-level Dense Distillation (GKD-Den) performs dense cross-modal alignment by guiding group-aware attention with activation-derived relation maps. Together, these modules enforce global semantic consistency and local structural coherence without requiring image-level correspondence. Extensive experiments on four clinical datasets demonstrate that PaGKD consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving relative AUC improvements of 3.3%, 1.1%, 2.8%, and 3.2%, respectively, establishing a new direction for cross-modal learning from unpaired data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods only predict affordance regions on visible surfaces, but real-world applications require understanding affordances on complete object shapes including unobserved regions. The paper addresses the limitation of partial observation in affordance grounding.

Method: Three core contributions: 1) Generative multi-view reconstruction via sparse voxel fusion that extrapolates unseen geometry while maintaining constant token complexity, 2) Flow-based affordance grounding that captures inherent ambiguity in affordance distributions, and 3) Affordance-driven active view selection that leverages predicted affordances for intelligent viewpoint sampling.

Result: Achieves 19.1 aIoU on affordance grounding (40.4% improvement) and 32.67 IoU for 3D reconstruction (67.7% improvement), enabling accurate affordance prediction on complete shapes.

Conclusion: Affostruction successfully addresses the problem of affordance grounding from partial observations by reconstructing complete geometry and grounding affordances on full shapes, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of affordance grounding from RGBD images of an object, which aims to localize surface regions corresponding to a text query that describes an action on the object. While existing methods predict affordance regions only on visible surfaces, we propose Affostruction, a generative framework that reconstructs complete geometry from partial observations and grounds affordances on the full shape including unobserved regions. We make three core contributions: generative multi-view reconstruction via sparse voxel fusion that extrapolates unseen geometry while maintaining constant token complexity, flow-based affordance grounding that captures inherent ambiguity in affordance distributions, and affordance-driven active view selection that leverages predicted affordances for intelligent viewpoint sampling. Affostruction achieves 19.1 aIoU on affordance grounding (40.4\% improvement) and 32.67 IoU for 3D reconstruction (67.7\% improvement), enabling accurate affordance prediction on complete shapes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COOL-SD introduces annealed relaxed speculative decoding with theoretical grounding to accelerate autoregressive image generation while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive image generation is slow due to sequential token generation and token ambiguity, and existing relaxed speculative decoding methods lack theoretical foundation.

Method: COOL-SD uses annealed relaxation of speculative decoding based on two theoretical insights: 1) optimal resampling distribution minimizing TV distance upper bound, and 2) perturbation analysis revealing annealing behavior.

Result: COOL-SD generates images faster with comparable quality or achieves better quality at similar latency, showing consistent improvements in speed-quality trade-offs over prior methods.

Conclusion: The paper establishes theoretical basis for relaxed speculative decoding and demonstrates COOL-SD's effectiveness in accelerating autoregressive image generation while maintaining quality.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in autoregressive image generation, inference remains slow due to the sequential nature of AR models and the ambiguity of image tokens, even when using speculative decoding. Recent works attempt to address this with relaxed speculative decoding but lack theoretical grounding. In this paper, we establish the theoretical basis of relaxed SD and propose COOL-SD, an annealed relaxation of speculative decoding built on two key insights. The first analyzes the total variation (TV) distance between the target model and relaxed speculative decoding and yields an optimal resampling distribution that minimizes an upper bound of the distance. The second uses perturbation analysis to reveal an annealing behaviour in relaxed speculative decoding, motivating our annealed design. Together, these insights enable COOL-SD to generate images faster with comparable quality, or achieve better quality at similar latency. Experiments validate the effectiveness of COOL-SD, showing consistent improvements over prior methods in speed-quality trade-offs.

Motivation: Reconstructing natural visual scenes from neural activity is a key challenge in neuroscience and computer vision, with spike data offering superior temporal and spatial resolution compared to fMRI.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) VDVAE produces low-resolution reconstructions from neural spike signals, 2) regression models map spikes to CLIP features enabling Versatile Diffusion to refine images via image-to-image generation.

Result: Evaluation on Allen Visual Coding-Neuropixels dataset shows VISI region exhibits most prominent activation and plays key role in reconstruction quality; specific brain regions significantly enhance performance.

Conclusion: SpikeVAEDiff effectively reconstructs high-resolution images from neural spike data, with brain region analysis revealing VISI's importance and demonstrating advantages over fMRI-based approaches.

Abstract: Reconstructing natural visual scenes from neural activity is a key challenge in neuroscience and computer vision. We present SpikeVAEDiff, a novel two-stage framework that combines a Very Deep Variational Autoencoder (VDVAE) and the Versatile Diffusion model to generate high-resolution and semantically meaningful image reconstructions from neural spike data. In the first stage, VDVAE produces low-resolution preliminary reconstructions by mapping neural spike signals to latent representations. In the second stage, regression models map neural spike signals to CLIP-Vision and CLIP-Text features, enabling Versatile Diffusion to refine the images via image-to-image generation.
  We evaluate our approach on the Allen Visual Coding-Neuropixels dataset and analyze different brain regions. Our results show that the VISI region exhibits the most prominent activation and plays a key role in reconstruction quality. We present both successful and unsuccessful reconstruction examples, reflecting the challenges of decoding neural activity. Compared with fMRI-based approaches, spike data provides superior temporal and spatial resolution. We further validate the effectiveness of the VDVAE model and conduct ablation studies demonstrating that data from specific brain regions significantly enhances reconstruction performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-language representation learning for infrared object detection using textual supervision to disentangle object features from noisy infrared images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared object detection is challenging due to low contrast and weak edge information in infrared images, making it difficult to extract discriminative features. Visible imaging fails in poor illumination conditions (dark, snow, rain), creating a need for robust infrared detection methods.

Method: Proposes a vision-language representation learning paradigm with textual supervision. Uses Semantic Feature Alignment (SFA) module to align object features with text features, and Object Feature Disentanglement (OFD) module to disentangle text-aligned object features from non-object features by minimizing their correlation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks: 83.7% mAP on M³FD and 86.1% mAP on FLIR datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed vision-language approach with textual supervision effectively enhances infrared object detection by learning more discriminative and less noisy features through semantic alignment and feature disentanglement.

Abstract: Infrared object detection focuses on identifying and locating objects in complex environments (\eg, dark, snow, and rain) where visible imaging cameras are disabled by poor illumination. However, due to low contrast and weak edge information in infrared images, it is challenging to extract discriminative object features for robust detection. To deal with this issue, we propose a novel vision-language representation learning paradigm for infrared object detection. An additional textual supervision with rich semantic information is explored to guide the disentanglement of object and non-object features. Specifically, we propose a Semantic Feature Alignment (SFA) module to align the object features with the corresponding text features. Furthermore, we develop an Object Feature Disentanglement (OFD) module that disentangles text-aligned object features and non-object features by minimizing their correlation. Finally, the disentangled object features are entered into the detection head. In this manner, the detection performance can be remarkably enhanced via more discriminative and less noisy features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on two benchmarks: M\textsuperscript{3}FD (83.7\% mAP), FLIR (86.1\% mAP). Our code will be publicly available once the paper is accepted.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forensic investigations face challenges when traditional DNA identification means are unavailable. Current deep learning face recognition methods lack effective mechanisms to model cross-domain structural correspondence between different forensic modalities like skeleton/sketch and face images.

Method: Constructs superpixel-based graphs from images, uses GNN backbones to extract graph embeddings, and establishes cross-domain correspondence through attention-guided optimal transport mechanism.

Result: Significant improvement in identification metrics (Recall, mAP) over existing graph-based baselines on IIT_Mandi_S2F and CUFS datasets. Framework proves highly effective for matching skulls and sketches to faces in forensic investigations.

Conclusion: SPOT-Face provides an effective unified framework for cross-domain forensic face identification, addressing the structural correspondence challenge between different forensic modalities through graph-based representation and optimal transport alignment.

Abstract: Person identification in forensic investigations becomes very challenging when common identification means for DNA (i.e., hair strands, soft tissue) are not available. Current methods utilize deep learning methods for face recognition. However, these methods lack effective mechanisms to model cross-domain structural correspondence between two different forensic modalities. In this paper, we introduce a SPOT-Face, a superpixel graph-based framework designed for cross-domain forensic face identification of victims using their skeleton and sketch images. Our unified framework involves constructing a superpixel-based graph from an image and then using different graph neural networks(GNNs) backbones to extract the embeddings of these graphs, while cross-domain correspondence is established through attention-guided optimal transport mechanism. We have evaluated our proposed framework on two publicly available dataset: IIT\_Mandi\_S2F (S2F) and CUFS. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate our proposed framework. The experimental results show significant improvement in identification metrics ( i.e., Recall, mAP) over existing graph-based baselines. Furthermore, our framework demonstrates to be highly effective for matching skulls and sketches to faces in forensic investigations.

Conclusion: CLIDD delivers high-precision local feature matching with minimal computational overhead, providing a robust and scalable solution for real-time spatial intelligence tasks by effectively balancing accuracy and efficiency through novel architectural and optimization strategies.

Abstract: Robust local feature representations are essential for spatial intelligence tasks such as robot navigation and augmented reality. Establishing reliable correspondences requires descriptors that provide both high discriminative power and computational efficiency. To address this, we introduce Cross-Layer Independent Deformable Description (CLIDD), a method that achieves superior distinctiveness by sampling directly from independent feature hierarchies. This approach utilizes learnable offsets to capture fine-grained structural details across scales while bypassing the computational burden of unified dense representations.

Furthermore, we develop a scalable framework that integrates lightweight architectures with a training protocol leveraging both metric learning and knowledge distillation. This scheme generates a wide spectrum of model variants optimized for diverse deployment constraints. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves superior matching accuracy and exceptional computational efficiency simultaneously. Specifically, the ultra-compact variant matches the precision of SuperPoint while utilizing only 0.004M parameters, achieving a 99.7% reduction in model size.

Method: Three-stage approach: 1) DreamBooth-style knowledge embedding to bridge domain gap, 2) geometric crack modeling for parameterized control maps, 3) lightweight hypernetwork for dynamic denoising modulation.

Result: Method outperforms baselines with 32.7% FID reduction, increased diversity, and 15.3% mAP boost for downstream defect detectors when trained on augmented data.

Conclusion: Framework provides practical, high-quality data synthesis solution for industrial inspection where defect samples are rare, enabling realistic and controllable defect image generation.

Abstract: Substation meters play a critical role in monitoring and ensuring the stable operation of power grids, yet their detection of cracks and other physical defects is often hampered by a severe scarcity of annotated samples. To address this few-shot generation challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates Knowledge Embedding and Hypernetwork-Guided Conditional Control into a Stable Diffusion pipeline, enabling realistic and controllable synthesis of defect images from limited data.
  First, we bridge the substantial domain gap between natural-image pre-trained models and industrial equipment by fine-tuning a Stable Diffusion backbone using DreamBooth-style knowledge embedding. This process encodes the unique structural and textural priors of substation meters, ensuring generated images retain authentic meter characteristics.
  Second, we introduce a geometric crack modeling module that parameterizes defect attributes--such as location, length, curvature, and branching pattern--to produce spatially constrained control maps. These maps provide precise, pixel-level guidance during generation.
  Third, we design a lightweight hypernetwork that dynamically modulates the denoising process of the diffusion model in response to the control maps and high-level defect descriptors, achieving a flexible balance between generation fidelity and controllability.
  Extensive experiments on a real-world substation meter dataset demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms existing augmentation and generation baselines. It reduces Frechet Inception Distance (FID) by 32.7%, increases diversity metrics, and--most importantly--boosts the mAP of a downstream defect detector by 15.3% when trained on augmented data. The framework offers a practical, high-quality data synthesis solution for industrial inspection systems where defect samples are rare.

*Jiajun Chen,Jing Xiao,Shaohan Cao,Yuming Zhu,Liang Liao,Jun Pan,Mi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeTracker is a joint detection-and-tracking framework for unstabilized satellite videos that addresses platform jitter and tiny object tracking through motion decoupling and temporal feature fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Satellite videos face challenges in multi-object tracking due to platform jitter (unstabilized conditions) and weak appearance of tiny objects, which jointly degrade tracking performance.

Method: Proposes DeTracker with two key modules: 1) Global-Local Motion Decoupling (GLMD) to separate satellite platform motion from true object motion, and 2) Temporal Dependency Feature Pyramid (TDFP) for cross-frame temporal feature fusion. Also constructs SDM-Car-SU benchmark dataset for systematic evaluation.

Result: DeTracker significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 61.1% MOTA on the simulated SDM-Car-SU dataset and 47.3% MOTA on real satellite video data.

Conclusion: DeTracker effectively addresses the challenges of multi-object tracking in unstabilized satellite videos through motion decoupling and temporal feature enhancement, demonstrating superior performance on both simulated and real-world data.

Abstract: Satellite videos provide continuous observations of surface dynamics but pose significant challenges for multi-object tracking (MOT), especially under unstabilized conditions where platform jitter and the weak appearance of tiny objects jointly degrade tracking performance. To address this problem, we propose DeTracker, a joint detection-and-tracking framework tailored for unstabilized satellite videos. DeTracker introduces a Global--Local Motion Decoupling (GLMD) module that explicitly separates satellite platform motion from true object motion through global alignment and local refinement, leading to improved trajectory stability and motion estimation accuracy. In addition, a Temporal Dependency Feature Pyramid (TDFP) module is developed to perform cross-frame temporal feature fusion, enhancing the continuity and discriminability of tiny-object representations. We further construct a new benchmark dataset, SDM-Car-SU, which simulates multi-directional and multi-speed platform motions to enable systematic evaluation of tracking robustness under varying motion perturbations. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real unstabilized satellite videos demonstrate that DeTracker significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 61.1% MOTA on SDM-Car-SU and 47.3% MOTA on real satellite video data.

*Sheng-Chi Hsu,Ting-Yu Yen,Shih-Hsuan Hung,Hung-Kuo Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A²TG introduces anisotropic textures for Gaussian Splatting with adaptive resolution/aspect ratio allocation, reducing memory while improving quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing textured Gaussian methods use fixed square textures per primitive, leading to inefficient memory usage and limited adaptability to scene variability.

Method: Introduces adaptive anisotropic textured Gaussians (A²TG) with gradient-guided adaptive rule to jointly determine texture resolution and aspect ratio for non-uniform, detail-aware allocation aligned with Gaussian anisotropy.

Result: Outperforms fixed-texture Gaussian Splatting methods on multiple benchmark datasets, achieving comparable rendering fidelity with substantially lower memory requirements.

Conclusion: A²TG provides a more efficient and effective representation for textured Gaussian Splatting through anisotropic texture adaptation.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a powerful representation for high-quality, real-time 3D scene rendering. While recent works extend Gaussians with learnable textures to enrich visual appearance, existing approaches allocate a fixed square texture per primitive, leading to inefficient memory usage and limited adaptability to scene variability. In this paper, we introduce adaptive anisotropic textured Gaussians (A$^2$TG), a novel representation that generalizes textured Gaussians by equipping each primitive with an anisotropic texture. Our method employs a gradient-guided adaptive rule to jointly determine texture resolution and aspect ratio, enabling non-uniform, detail-aware allocation that aligns with the anisotropic nature of Gaussian splats. This design significantly improves texture efficiency, reducing memory consumption while enhancing image quality. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that A TG consistently outperforms fixed-texture Gaussian Splatting methods, achieving comparable rendering fidelity with substantially lower memory requirements.

*Yiwei Zhang,Jin Gao,Hanshi Wang,Fudong Ge,Guan Luo,Weiming Hu,Zhipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoRA-DETR enhances DETR-style object detectors by using multiple LoRA branches with diverse one-to-many assignment strategies during training to accelerate convergence without inference cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: One-to-one matching in DETR suffers from slow convergence due to sparse supervision. Existing one-to-many approaches add complex modifications and lack unified design. The paper finds that assignment diversity, not just quantity, drives performance gains.

Method: Proposes LoRA-DETR: adds multiple Low-Rank Adaptation branches during training, each implementing different one-to-many assignment rules. These auxiliary branches inject diverse supervisory gradients and are discarded at inference, preserving original architecture.

Result: Extensive experiments show effectiveness across different baselines. Achieves state-of-the-art results by integrating diverse supervision without compromising model elegance or adding inference cost.

Conclusion: Diverse one-to-many supervision through LoRA branches provides a parameter-efficient paradigm for enhancing DETR detectors, enabling robust optimization while maintaining architectural simplicity.

Abstract: Label assignment is a critical component in object detectors, particularly within DETR-style frameworks where the one-to-one matching strategy, despite its end-to-end elegance, suffers from slow convergence due to sparse supervision. While recent works have explored one-to-many assignments to enrich supervisory signals, they often introduce complex, architecture-specific modifications and typically focus on a single auxiliary strategy, lacking a unified and scalable design. In this paper, we first systematically investigate the effects of ``one-to-many'' supervision and reveal a surprising insight that performance gains are driven not by the sheer quantity of supervision, but by the diversity of the assignment strategies employed. This finding suggests that a more elegant, parameter-efficient approach is attainable. Building on this insight, we propose LoRA-DETR, a flexible and lightweight framework that seamlessly integrates diverse assignment strategies into any DETR-style detector. Our method augments the primary network with multiple Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) branches during training, each instantiating a different one-to-many assignment rule. These branches act as auxiliary modules that inject rich, varied supervisory gradients into the main model and are discarded during inference, thus incurring no additional computational cost. This design promotes robust joint optimization while maintaining the architectural simplicity of the original detector. Extensive experiments on different baselines validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our work presents a new paradigm for enhancing detectors, demonstrating that diverse ``one-to-many'' supervision can be integrated to achieve state-of-the-art results without compromising model elegance.

TL;DR: Event-based VAE with spiking neural networks enables compact, robust visual place recognition for mobile robots in GPS-denied indoor environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile robots need precise localization in GPS-denied indoor environments, but current VPR models are either too memory-intensive for mobile deployment or lack robustness and generalization capabilities.

Method: Combines event-based vision sensors with a guided variational autoencoder (VAE) using spiking neural network encoder compatible with neuromorphic hardware for power-efficient processing.

Result: Successfully disentangles visual features of 16 distinct places with classification performance comparable to state-of-the-art, shows robustness under various illumination conditions, and demonstrates generalization to novel scenes.

Conclusion: The compact, robust guided VAE with generalization capabilities is a promising model for visual place recognition that can significantly enhance mobile robot navigation in known and unknown indoor environments.

Abstract: Autonomous agents such as cars, robots and drones need to precisely localize themselves in diverse environments, including in GPS-denied indoor environments. One approach for precise localization is visual place recognition (VPR), which estimates the place of an image based on previously seen places. State-of-the-art VPR models require high amounts of memory, making them unwieldy for mobile deployment, while more compact models lack robustness and generalization capabilities. This work overcomes these limitations for robotics using a combination of event-based vision sensors and an event-based novel guided variational autoencoder (VAE). The encoder part of our model is based on a spiking neural network model which is compatible with power-efficient low latency neuromorphic hardware. The VAE successfully disentangles the visual features of 16 distinct places in our new indoor VPR dataset with a classification performance comparable to other state-of-the-art approaches while, showing robust performance also under various illumination conditions. When tested with novel visual inputs from unknown scenes, our model can distinguish between these places, which demonstrates a high generalization capability by learning the essential features of location. Our compact and robust guided VAE with generalization capabilities poses a promising model for visual place recognition that can significantly enhance mobile robot navigation in known and unknown indoor environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhyRPR is a three-stage training-free pipeline that decouples physical reasoning from visual synthesis to improve physical plausibility in video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based video generation models struggle with physical constraints because they entangle high-level physical understanding with low-level visual synthesis in a single stage, making explicit physical reasoning difficult.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) PhyReason - uses large multimodal model for physical state reasoning and image generator for keyframes; 2) PhyPlan - creates deterministic coarse motion scaffold; 3) PhyRefine - injects scaffold into diffusion sampling via latent fusion to refine appearance while preserving planned dynamics.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method consistently improves physical plausibility and motion controllability under physics constraints.

Conclusion: The staged design enables explicit physical control during generation by decoupling physical understanding from visual synthesis, addressing limitations of single-stage approaches.

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based video generation models can synthesize visually plausible videos, yet they often struggle to satisfy physical constraints. A key reason is that most existing approaches remain single-stage: they entangle high-level physical understanding with low-level visual synthesis, making it hard to generate content that require explicit physical reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose a training-free three-stage pipeline,\textit{PhyRPR}:\textit{Phy\uline{R}eason}--\textit{Phy\uline{P}lan}--\textit{Phy\uline{R}efine}, which decouples physical understanding from visual synthesis. Specifically, \textit{PhyReason} uses a large multimodal model for physical state reasoning and an image generator for keyframe synthesis; \textit{PhyPlan} deterministically synthesizes a controllable coarse motion scaffold; and \textit{PhyRefine} injects this scaffold into diffusion sampling via a latent fusion strategy to refine appearance while preserving the planned dynamics. This staged design enables explicit physical control during generation. Extensive experiments under physics constraints show that our method consistently improves physical plausibility and motion controllability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning approaches for wildfire mapping require high-resolution multispectral data, but operational needs for quick burn scar delineation are limited by the trade-off between spatial resolution and temporal revisit frequency of satellite systems.

Method: Proposes BAM-MRCD, a novel deep learning model that employs multi-resolution, multi-source satellite imagery (combining MODIS and Sentinel-2 data) to overcome resolution-revisit trade-offs.

Result: The model successfully detects even small-scale wildfires with high accuracy, surpassing similar change detection models and solid baselines.

Conclusion: BAM-MRCD enables timely production of detailed burnt area maps with high spatial and temporal resolution, addressing operational limitations in wildfire monitoring. All code and data are publicly available.

Abstract: Delineating wildfire affected areas using satellite imagery remains challenging due to irregular and spatially heterogeneous spectral changes across the electromagnetic spectrum. While recent deep learning approaches achieve high accuracy when high-resolution multispectral data are available, their applicability in operational settings, where a quick delineation of the burn scar shortly after a wildfire incident is required, is limited by the trade-off between spatial resolution and temporal revisit frequency of current satellite systems. To address this limitation, we propose a novel deep learning model, namely BAM-MRCD, which employs multi-resolution, multi-source satellite imagery (MODIS and Sentinel-2) for the timely production of detailed burnt area maps with high spatial and temporal resolution. Our model manages to detect even small scale wildfires with high accuracy, surpassing similar change detection models as well as solid baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whole-brain parcellation is critical but challenging due to complex, irregular brain regions. Traditional template-registration methods and large models like SAM lack the precision needed for fine-grained anatomical brain segmentation.

Method: BrainSegNet enhances SAM by integrating U-Net skip connections into its encoder and decoder, adding a hybrid encoder combining U-Net skip connections with SAM's transformer blocks, a multi-scale attention decoder with pyramid pooling, and a boundary refinement module for edge sharpening.

Result: On the Human Connectome Project dataset, BrainSegNet outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher accuracy and robustness in complex, multi-label parcellation.

Conclusion: The proposed BrainSegNet framework successfully adapts SAM for precise whole-brain parcellation, demonstrating superior performance through architectural enhancements tailored for fine-grained anatomical segmentation.

Abstract: Whole-brain parcellation from MRI is a critical yet challenging task due to the complexity of subdividing the brain into numerous small, irregular shaped regions. Traditionally, template-registration methods were used, but recent advances have shifted to deep learning for faster workflows. While large models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offer transferable feature representations, they are not tailored for the high precision required in brain parcellation. To address this, we propose BrainSegNet, a novel framework that adapts SAM for accurate whole-brain parcellation into 95 regions. We enhance SAM by integrating U-Net skip connections and specialized modules into its encoder and decoder, enabling fine-grained anatomical precision. Key components include a hybrid encoder combining U-Net skip connections with SAM's transformer blocks, a multi-scale attention decoder with pyramid pooling for varying-sized structures, and a boundary refinement module to sharpen edges. Experimental results on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset demonstrate that BrainSegNet outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher accuracy and robustness in complex, multi-label parcellation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaussianFluent enables realistic brittle fracture simulation and rendering using 3D Gaussians by synthesizing photorealistic interiors and integrating optimized continuum damage simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting methods focus on soft, deformable materials but lack capability for brittle fracture simulation due to missing volumetric interiors with coherent textures and fracture-aware simulation methods for Gaussians.

Method: 1) Synthesizes photorealistic interiors by densifying internal Gaussians guided by generative models; 2) Integrates optimized Continuum Damage Material Point Method (CD-MPM) for high-speed brittle fracture simulation.

Result: Handles complex scenarios including mixed-material objects and multi-stage fracture propagation, achieving photo-realistic, real-time rendering with structurally consistent interiors previously infeasible.

Conclusion: GaussianFluent demonstrates potential for downstream applications like VR and Robotics by enabling realistic simulation and rendering of dynamic object states with brittle fracture.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a prominent 3D representation for high-fidelity and real-time rendering. Prior work has coupled physics simulation with Gaussians, but predominantly targets soft, deformable materials, leaving brittle fracture largely unresolved. This stems from two key obstacles: the lack of volumetric interiors with coherent textures in GS representation, and the absence of fracture-aware simulation methods for Gaussians. To address these challenges, we introduce GaussianFluent, a unified framework for realistic simulation and rendering of dynamic object states. First, it synthesizes photorealistic interiors by densifying internal Gaussians guided by generative models. Second, it integrates an optimized Continuum Damage Material Point Method (CD-MPM) to enable brittle fracture simulation at remarkably high speed. Our approach handles complex scenarios including mixed-material objects and multi-stage fracture propagation, achieving results infeasible with previous methods. Experiments clearly demonstrate GaussianFluent's capability for photo-realistic, real-time rendering with structurally consistent interiors, highlighting its potential for downstream application, such as VR and Robotics.

*Lianying Chao,Haoran Cai,Xubin Li,Kai Zhang,Sijie Wu,Rui Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a multi-stage training strategy for Domain-specific Image Captioning Model (DICModel) in ICT, achieving better performance than larger models with only 7B parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICT industry needs domain knowledge from both text and images, but traditional methods lack image captioning ability and MLLMs lack sufficient domain knowledge.

Method: Three-stage progressive training: 1) 7K synthetic image-text pairs using Mermaid+LLMs for SFT, 2) 2K expert-annotated pairs for SFT, 3) 1.5K visual QA data for instruction-based SFT.

Result: DICModel with 7B parameters outperforms 32B SOTA models: +56.8% BLEU vs 7B models, +20.8% vs 32B models, and beats Qwen2.5-VL 32B by 1% accuracy on expert questions.

Conclusion: The approach efficiently extracts logical text from ICT images, promoting multimodal model development in the ICT domain.

Abstract: In the information and communications technology (ICT) industry, training a domain-specific large language model (LLM) or constructing a retrieval-augmented generation system requires a substantial amount of high-value domain knowledge. However, the knowledge is not only hidden in the textual modality but also in the image modality. Traditional methods can parse text from domain documents but dont have image captioning ability. Multi-modal LLM (MLLM) can understand images, but they do not have sufficient domain knowledge. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a multi-stage progressive training strategy to train a Domain-specific Image Captioning Model (DICModel) in ICT, and constructs a standard evaluation system to validate the performance of DICModel. Specifically, this work first synthesizes about 7K image-text pairs by combining the Mermaid tool and LLMs, which are used for the first-stage supervised-fine-tuning (SFT) of DICModel. Then, ICT-domain experts manually annotate about 2K image-text pairs for the second-stage SFT of DICModel. Finally, experts and LLMs jointly synthesize about 1.5K visual question answering data for the instruction-based SFT. Experimental results indicate that our DICModel with only 7B parameters performs better than other state-of-the-art models with 32B parameters. Compared to the SOTA models with 7B and 32B parameters, our DICModel increases the BLEU metric by approximately 56.8% and 20.8%, respectively. On the objective questions constructed by ICT domain experts, our DICModel outperforms Qwen2.5-VL 32B by 1% in terms of accuracy rate. In summary, this work can efficiently and accurately extract the logical text from images, which is expected to promote the development of multimodal models in the ICT domain.

TL;DR: Proposes JUF-MRI: a frequency error-guided framework for multi-contrast MRI reconstruction that jointly optimizes under-sampling patterns and reconstruction using diffusion models and deep unfolding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI suffers from long acquisition times and motion artifacts. Existing multi-contrast reconstruction methods have limitations: superficial reference fusion, insufficient complementary information utilization, and fixed under-sampling patterns.

Method: Uses conditional diffusion model to learn Frequency Error Prior (FEP), incorporates it into unified framework for joint optimization of under-sampling patterns and reconstruction. Employs model-driven deep unfolding with spatial alignment and reference feature decomposition.

Result: Demonstrates consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods across multiple imaging modalities, acceleration rates (4-30x), and sampling schemes in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.

Conclusion: Proposed JUF-MRI framework effectively addresses limitations of existing multi-contrast MRI reconstruction methods, providing efficient and interpretable reconstruction with improved physical interpretability.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a vital role in clinical diagnostics, yet it remains hindered by long acquisition times and motion artifacts. Multi-contrast MRI reconstruction has emerged as a promising direction by leveraging complementary information from fully-sampled reference scans. However, existing approaches suffer from three major limitations: (1) superficial reference fusion strategies, such as simple concatenation, (2) insufficient utilization of the complementary information provided by the reference contrast, and (3) fixed under-sampling patterns. We propose an efficient and interpretable frequency error-guided reconstruction framework to tackle these issues. We first employ a conditional diffusion model to learn a Frequency Error Prior (FEP), which is then incorporated into a unified framework for jointly optimizing both the under-sampling pattern and the reconstruction network. The proposed reconstruction model employs a model-driven deep unfolding framework that jointly exploits frequency- and image-domain information. In addition, a spatial alignment module and a reference feature decomposition strategy are incorporated to improve reconstruction quality and bridge model-based optimization with data-driven learning for improved physical interpretability. Comprehensive validation across multiple imaging modalities, acceleration rates (4-30x), and sampling schemes demonstrates consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hierarchical multimodal deep learning approach combining radiomic features with image data improves osteosarcoma necrosis quantification by addressing patient-level generalization issues and enhancing interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual histopathological assessment of osteosarcoma tumor viability after chemotherapy is labor-intensive, subjective, and variable. Existing deep learning models show significant performance drops when evaluated at patient-level generalization rather than tile-level, highlighting the need for more robust approaches.

Method: Two key innovations: 1) Incorporating radiomic features as multimodal input alongside images to improve classification and interpretability; 2) Using hierarchical binary classification (tumor-vs-non-tumor and viable-vs-non-viable) with trainable weighting instead of flat three-class classification, enabling hierarchical loss optimization.

Result: The proposed approaches individually and in combination significantly improve classification performance on the TCIA OS Tumor Assessment dataset, establishing new state-of-the-art results for osteosarcoma necrosis quantification.

Conclusion: Multimodal radiomic features and hierarchical classification with optimized loss weighting effectively address patient-level generalization challenges in osteosarcoma assessment, providing more accurate and interpretable automated necrosis quantification for clinical prognosis and treatment planning.

Abstract: Osteosarcoma (OS) is an aggressive primary bone malignancy. Accurate histopathological assessment of viable versus non-viable tumor regions after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is critical for prognosis and treatment planning, yet manual evaluation remains labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to inter-observer variability. Recent advances in digital pathology have enabled automated necrosis quantification. Evaluating on test data, independently sampled on patient-level, revealed that the deep learning model performance dropped significantly from the tile-level generalization ability reported in previous studies. First, this work proposes the use of radiomic features as additional input in model training. We show that, despite that they are derived from the images, such a multimodal input effectively improved the classification performance, in addition to its added benefits in interpretability. Second, this work proposes to optimize two binary classification tasks with hierarchical classes (i.e. tumor-vs-non-tumor and viable-vs-non-viable), as opposed to the alternative ``flat'' three-class classification task (i.e. non-tumor, non-viable tumor, viable tumor), thereby enabling a hierarchical loss. We show that such a hierarchical loss, with trainable weightings between the two tasks, the per-class performance can be improved significantly. Using the TCIA OS Tumor Assessment dataset, we experimentally demonstrate the benefits from each of the proposed new approaches and their combination, setting a what we consider new state-of-the-art performance on this open dataset for this application.

TL;DR: Attentive probing that fuses representations from all Vision Transformer layers outperforms standard linear probing by dynamically identifying task-relevant layers across the network hierarchy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard linear probing is computationally efficient but limited to last-layer representations, while task-relevant information is actually distributed across all network layers rather than concentrated in final layers.

Method: Proposes an attentive probing mechanism that dynamically fuses representations from all layers of a Vision Transformer, learning to identify the most relevant layers for each target task and combining low-level structural cues with high-level semantic abstractions.

Result: Across 20 diverse datasets and multiple pretrained foundation models, the method achieves consistent, substantial gains over standard linear probes. Attention heatmaps reveal that tasks different from the pre-training domain benefit most from intermediate representations.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the value of intermediate layer information and demonstrate a principled, task-aware approach for unlocking their potential in probing-based adaptation of foundation models.

Abstract: With the rise of large-scale foundation models, efficiently adapting them to downstream tasks remains a central challenge. Linear probing, which freezes the backbone and trains a lightweight head, is computationally efficient but often restricted to last-layer representations. We show that task-relevant information is distributed across the network hierarchy rather than solely encoded in any of the last layers. To leverage this distribution of information, we apply an attentive probing mechanism that dynamically fuses representations from all layers of a Vision Transformer. This mechanism learns to identify the most relevant layers for a target task and combines low-level structural cues with high-level semantic abstractions. Across 20 diverse datasets and multiple pretrained foundation models, our method achieves consistent, substantial gains over standard linear probes. Attention heatmaps further reveal that tasks different from the pre-training domain benefit most from intermediate representations. Overall, our findings underscore the value of intermediate layer information and demonstrate a principled, task aware approach for unlocking their potential in probing-based adaptation.

Conclusion: The SMORE framework successfully enhances memory efficiency while maintaining high information resolution for video understanding, enabling efficient video moment retrieval without exceeding memory budgets.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have improved image recognition and reasoning, but video-related tasks remain challenging due to memory constraints from dense frame processing. Existing Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) methodologies rely on sparse frame sampling, risking potential information loss, especially in lengthy videos. We propose SMORE (See MORE, store less), a framework that enhances memory efficiency while maintaining high information resolution. SMORE (1) uses query-guided captions to encode semantics aligned with user intent, (2) applies query-aware importance modulation to highlight relevant segments, and (3) adaptively compresses frames to preserve key content while reducing redundancy. This enables efficient video understanding without exceeding memory budgets. Experimental validation reveals that SMORE achieves state-of-the-art performance on QVHighlights, Charades-STA, and ActivityNet-Captions benchmarks.

### [56] [Spectral Complex Autoencoder Pruning: A Fidelity-Guided Criterion for Extreme Structured Channel Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09352)
*Wei Liu,Xing Deng,Haijian Shao,Yingtao Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCAP uses spectral reconstruction fidelity of complex interaction fields to measure channel redundancy for network pruning, achieving 90% FLOP reduction with minimal accuracy drop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pruning methods need better ways to measure functional redundancy at the individual channel level for more effective network compression while maintaining accuracy.

Method: Construct complex interaction fields pairing input activations (real) with single output-channel activations (imaginary), transform to frequency domain, train low-capacity autoencoder to reconstruct normalized spectra, and use reconstruction fidelity as importance score for pruning.

Result: On VGG16/CIFAR-10: 90.11% FLOP reduction, 96.30% parameter reduction with only 1.67% absolute Top-1 accuracy drop from 93.44% baseline after fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Spectral reconstruction fidelity of complex interaction fields effectively identifies channel-level redundancy, enabling aggressive compression with minimal performance degradation.

Abstract: We propose Spectral Complex Autoencoder Pruning (SCAP), a reconstruction-based criterion that measures functional redundancy at the level of individual output channels. For each convolutional layer, we construct a complex interaction field by pairing the full multi-channel input activation as the real part with a single output-channel activation (spatially aligned and broadcast across input channels) as the imaginary part. We transform this complex field to the frequency domain and train a low-capacity autoencoder to reconstruct normalized spectra. Channels whose spectra are reconstructed with high fidelity are interpreted as lying close to a low-dimensional manifold captured by the autoencoder and are therefore more compressible; conversely, channels with low fidelity are retained as they encode information that cannot be compactly represented by the learned manifold. This yields an importance score (optionally fused with the filter L1 norm) that supports simple threshold-based pruning and produces a structurally consistent pruned network. On VGG16 trained on CIFAR-10, at a fixed threshold of 0.6, we obtain 90.11% FLOP reduction and 96.30% parameter reduction with an absolute Top-1 accuracy drop of 1.67% from a 93.44% baseline after fine-tuning, demonstrating that spectral reconstruction fidelity of complex interaction fields is an effective proxy for channel-level redundancy under aggressive compression.

*Shuyang Xiang,Hao Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Chinese character images (8×8 pixels) can replace token IDs in language models, achieving similar accuracy with faster early training convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs treat Chinese characters as discrete tokens, ignoring their visual structure which contains semantic and phonetic information that could improve modeling.

Method: Replace token IDs with grayscale images of individual Chinese characters at low resolution (8×8 pixels) as input to a decoder model.

Result: Visual inputs achieve 39.2% accuracy vs 39.1% for index-based baseline, with much faster early training convergence (12% vs 6% accuracy at 0.4% of training).

Conclusion: Minimal visual structure provides robust and efficient signal for Chinese language modeling, offering an alternative to traditional index-based approaches.

Abstract: Large language models typically represent Chinese characters as discrete index-based tokens, largely ignoring their visual form. For logographic scripts, visual structure carries semantic and phonetic information, which may aid prediction. We investigate whether low-resolution visual inputs can serve as an alternative for character-level modeling. Instead of token IDs, our decoder receives grayscale images of individual characters, with resolutions as low as $8 \times 8$ pixels. Remarkably, these inputs achieve 39.2\% accuracy, comparable to the index-based baseline of 39.1\%. Such low-resource settings also exhibit a pronounced \emph{hot-start} effect: by 0.4\% of total training, accuracy reaches above 12\%, while index-based models lag at below 6\%. Overall, our results demonstrate that minimal visual structure can provide a robust and efficient signal for Chinese language modeling, offering an alternative perspective on character representation that complements traditional index-based approaches.

*Sangjun Han,Youngmi Hur*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes two methods to enhance high-frequency details in super-resolution images: a Laplacian pyramid-based detail loss and repeated upscaling/downscaling, which improve both CNN-based and attention-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Since enhancing fine details is crucial for super-resolution tasks, pixels contributing to high-frequency information should be emphasized to improve image quality.

Method: Two main methods: 1) Laplacian pyramid-based detail loss that guides models by separately generating and controlling super-resolution and detail images, 2) Repeated upscaling and downscaling process that amplifies detail loss effectiveness by extracting diverse information from multiple low-resolution features.

Result: The CNN-based model incorporating these methods achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing all available CNN-based and some attention-based models. When applied to existing attention-based models, all show improvements compared to originals.

Conclusion: The proposed approaches effectively enhance super-resolution images across different model structures, demonstrating broad applicability and effectiveness in improving high-frequency details.

Abstract: With advances in artificial intelligence, image processing has gained significant interest. Image super-resolution is a vital technology closely related to real-world applications, as it enhances the quality of existing images. Since enhancing fine details is crucial for the super-resolution task, pixels that contribute to high-frequency information should be emphasized. This paper proposes two methods to enhance high-frequency details in super-resolution images: a Laplacian pyramid-based detail loss and a repeated upscaling and downscaling process. Total loss with our detail loss guides a model by separately generating and controlling super-resolution and detail images. This approach allows the model to focus more effectively on high-frequency components, resulting in improved super-resolution images. Additionally, repeated upscaling and downscaling amplify the effectiveness of the detail loss by extracting diverse information from multiple low-resolution features. We conduct two types of experiments. First, we design a CNN-based model incorporating our methods. This model achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing all currently available CNN-based and even some attention-based models. Second, we apply our methods to existing attention-based models on a small scale. In all our experiments, attention-based models adding our detail loss show improvements compared to the originals. These results demonstrate our approaches effectively enhance super-resolution images across different model structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing railway intrusion systems focus on object classification with rule-based heuristics, overlooking latent intrusion risks that require spatial-temporal reasoning of object context and dynamics

Method: Introduce CogRail benchmark with curated datasets and cognitive QA annotations; evaluate SOTA VLMs; propose joint fine-tuning framework integrating position perception, movement prediction, and threat analysis tasks

Result: Current large multimodal models struggle with complex spatial-temporal reasoning for intrusion perception; proposed joint fine-tuning framework significantly enhances performance through targeted domain adaptation

Conclusion: Cognitive intrusion perception requires specialized spatial-temporal reasoning; structured multi-task learning enables effective adaptation of foundation models to safety-critical railway domains

Abstract: Accurate and early perception of potential intrusion targets is essential for ensuring the safety of railway transportation systems. However, most existing systems focus narrowly on object classification within fixed visual scopes and apply rule-based heuristics to determine intrusion status, often overlooking targets that pose latent intrusion risks. Anticipating such risks requires the cognition of spatial context and temporal dynamics for the object of interest (OOI), which presents challenges for conventional visual models. To facilitate deep intrusion perception, we introduce a novel benchmark, CogRail, which integrates curated open-source datasets with cognitively driven question-answer annotations to support spatio-temporal reasoning and prediction. Building upon this benchmark, we conduct a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art visual-language models (VLMs) using multimodal prompts to identify their strengths and limitations in this domain. Furthermore, we fine-tune VLMs for better performance and propose a joint fine-tuning framework that integrates three core tasks, position perception, movement prediction, and threat analysis, facilitating effective adaptation of general-purpose foundation models into specialized models tailored for cognitive intrusion perception. Extensive experiments reveal that current large-scale multimodal models struggle with the complex spatial-temporal reasoning required by the cognitive intrusion perception task, underscoring the limitations of existing foundation models in this safety-critical domain. In contrast, our proposed joint fine-tuning framework significantly enhances model performance by enabling targeted adaptation to domain-specific reasoning demands, highlighting the advantages of structured multi-task learning in improving both accuracy and interpretability.

TL;DR: Video-MSR is the first benchmark for evaluating multi-hop spatial reasoning in dynamic video scenarios, revealing MLLMs' limitations in complex spatial reasoning despite surface-level perception proficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on single-step perception-to-judgment tasks, leaving complex visual-spatial logical chains underexplored. There's a need to evaluate multi-hop spatial reasoning capabilities in dynamic video scenarios.

Method: Created Video-MSR benchmark with 3,052 video instances and 4,993 QA pairs through scalable pipeline combining model generation with human verification. Includes four tasks: Constrained Localization, Chain-based Reference Retrieval, Route Planning, and Counterfactual Physical Deduction.

Result: Evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs shows significant limitations - models perform well on surface-level perception but struggle with multi-hop spatial reasoning, suffering from spatial disorientation and hallucination. Fine-tuning Qwen-VL with MSR-9K dataset achieved +7.82% improvement.

Conclusion: Video-MSR establishes a vital foundation for spatial reasoning research, revealing current MLLMs' limitations in complex spatial reasoning and demonstrating the efficacy of specialized instruction-tuning data for improving multi-hop spatial reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), drawing increasing attention and rapid advancement. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on single-step perception-to-judgment tasks, leaving scenarios requiring complex visual-spatial logical chains significantly underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Video-MSR, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate Multi-hop Spatial Reasoning (MSR) in dynamic video scenarios. Video-MSR systematically probes MSR capabilities through four distinct tasks: Constrained Localization, Chain-based Reference Retrieval, Route Planning, and Counterfactual Physical Deduction. Our benchmark comprises 3,052 high-quality video instances with 4,993 question-answer pairs, constructed via a scalable, visually-grounded pipeline combining advanced model generation with rigorous human verification. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we uncover significant limitations, revealing that while models demonstrate proficiency in surface-level perception, they exhibit distinct performance drops in MSR tasks, frequently suffering from spatial disorientation and hallucination during multi-step deductions. To mitigate these shortcomings and empower models with stronger MSR capabilities, we further curate MSR-9K, a specialized instruction-tuning dataset, and fine-tune Qwen-VL, achieving a +7.82% absolute improvement on Video-MSR. Our results underscore the efficacy of multi-hop spatial instruction data and establish Video-MSR as a vital foundation for future research.

*Ahmad Rahimi,Valentin Gerard,Eloi Zablocki,Matthieu Cord,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Efficient adaptation of general video diffusion models into controllable driving world models through motion-appearance decoupling, achieving SOTA performance with minimal compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video diffusion models lack structured motion and physical consistency needed for autonomous driving world models, and adapting them typically requires massive domain data and costly fine-tuning.

Method: Two-stage decoupling approach: first adapt model to predict structured motion using skeletonized agents/scene elements, then reuse same backbone to synthesize realistic RGB videos conditioned on motion sequences (reasoning-rendering paradigm).

Result: Achieves SOTA performance with less than 6% compute of prior methods when adapting SVD; MAD-LTX outperforms all open-source competitors and supports comprehensive text, ego, and object controls.

Conclusion: Decoupled motion-appearance learning enables efficient adaptation of generalist video diffusion models into reliable driving world models with minimal supervision, matching reasoning-rendering paradigm.

Abstract: Recent video diffusion models generate photorealistic, temporally coherent videos, yet they fall short as reliable world models for autonomous driving, where structured motion and physically consistent interactions are essential. Adapting these generalist video models to driving domains has shown promise but typically requires massive domain-specific data and costly fine-tuning. We propose an efficient adaptation framework that converts generalist video diffusion models into controllable driving world models with minimal supervision. The key idea is to decouple motion learning from appearance synthesis. First, the model is adapted to predict structured motion in a simplified form: videos of skeletonized agents and scene elements, focusing learning on physical and social plausibility. Then, the same backbone is reused to synthesize realistic RGB videos conditioned on these motion sequences, effectively "dressing" the motion with texture and lighting. This two-stage process mirrors a reasoning-rendering paradigm: first infer dynamics, then render appearance. Our experiments show this decoupled approach is exceptionally efficient: adapting SVD, we match prior SOTA models with less than 6% of their compute. Scaling to LTX, our MAD-LTX model outperforms all open-source competitors, and supports a comprehensive suite of text, ego, and object controls.

*Ritabrata Chakraborty,Hrishit Mitra,Shivakumara Palaiahnakote,Umapada Pal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cross-dataset object detection reveals clear structure: transfer within same setting type (agnostic-agnostic or specific-specific) is stable, but cross-setting transfer drops substantially, especially from specific to agnostic datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object detectors degrade sharply on different benchmarks despite performing well in-distribution. The paper aims to understand cross-dataset object detection through the lens of setting specificity to characterize transfer patterns and breakdowns.

Method: Group benchmarks into setting-agnostic (diverse everyday scenes) and setting-specific (narrow environment) datasets. Evaluate standard detector family across all train-test pairs. Compare closed-label transfer with open-label protocol using CLIP similarity to map predicted classes to nearest target label, disentangling domain shift from label mismatch.

Result: Reveals clear structure: transfer within same setting type is relatively stable, while cross-setting transfer drops substantially and is often asymmetric. Most severe breakdowns occur when transferring from specific sources to agnostic targets. Open-label evaluation yields consistent but bounded gains, with many corrected cases corresponding to semantic near-misses supported by image evidence.

Conclusion: Provides principled characterization of cross-dataset object detection under setting specificity and practical guidance for evaluating detectors under distribution shift. Domain shift dominates in hardest regimes, and label mismatch can be partially addressed through semantic similarity mapping.

Abstract: Object detectors often perform well in-distribution, yet degrade sharply on a different benchmark. We study cross-dataset object detection (CD-OD) through a lens of setting specificity. We group benchmarks into setting-agnostic datasets with diverse everyday scenes and setting-specific datasets tied to a narrow environment, and evaluate a standard detector family across all train--test pairs. This reveals a clear structure in CD-OD: transfer within the same setting type is relatively stable, while transfer across setting types drops substantially and is often asymmetric. The most severe breakdowns occur when transferring from specific sources to agnostic targets, and persist after open-label alignment, indicating that domain shift dominates in the hardest regimes. To disentangle domain shift from label mismatch, we compare closed-label transfer with an open-label protocol that maps predicted classes to the nearest target label using CLIP similarity. Open-label evaluation yields consistent but bounded gains, and many corrected cases correspond to semantic near-misses supported by the image evidence. Overall, we provide a principled characterization of CD-OD under setting specificity and practical guidance for evaluating detectors under distribution shift.

*Edgar Sucar,Eldar Insafutdinov,Zihang Lai,Andrea Vedaldi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: V-DPM extends Dynamic Point Maps to video input, achieving SOTA 3D/4D reconstruction by adapting VGGT with synthetic data to predict full 3D motion of every scene point.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Dynamic Point Maps (DPMs) are limited to image pairs and require optimization for multiple views, making them impractical for video applications where dynamic 3D reconstruction is needed.

Method: Formulate DPMs for video input to maximize representational power and enable neural prediction, then adapt VGGT (a static scene reconstructor) using synthetic data to create V-DPM predictor that recovers both depth and full 3D motion.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D and 4D reconstruction for dynamic scenes, recovering not only dynamic depth but also full 3D motion of every point in the scene.

Conclusion: V-DPM successfully extends DPMs to video applications, demonstrating that modest synthetic data can adapt powerful static reconstructors to handle dynamic scenes effectively.

Abstract: Powerful 3D representations such as DUSt3R invariant point maps, which encode 3D shape and camera parameters, have significantly advanced feed forward 3D reconstruction. While point maps assume static scenes, Dynamic Point Maps (DPMs) extend this concept to dynamic 3D content by additionally representing scene motion. However, existing DPMs are limited to image pairs and, like DUSt3R, require post processing via optimization when more than two views are involved. We argue that DPMs are more useful when applied to videos and introduce V-DPM to demonstrate this. First, we show how to formulate DPMs for video input in a way that maximizes representational power, facilitates neural prediction, and enables reuse of pretrained models. Second, we implement these ideas on top of VGGT, a recent and powerful 3D reconstructor. Although VGGT was trained on static scenes, we show that a modest amount of synthetic data is sufficient to adapt it into an effective V-DPM predictor. Our approach achieves state of the art performance in 3D and 4D reconstruction for dynamic scenes. In particular, unlike recent dynamic extensions of VGGT such as P3, DPMs recover not only dynamic depth but also the full 3D motion of every point in the scene.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of conventional pixel-level reconstruction pre-training methods that capture irrelevant information, and to explore purely embedding-based approaches for facial expression recognition.

Method: Use Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) pre-training where the model learns by predicting embeddings of masked regions from unmasked regions, then train shallow classifiers on RAVDESS and CREMA-D datasets.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on RAVDESS and outperformed all other vision-based methods on CREMA-D (+1.48 WAR). Cross-dataset evaluations showed strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: V-JEPA's embedding-based pre-training approach shows strong potential for advancing facial expression recognition by learning relevant features while ignoring irrelevant information.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel application of Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (V-JEPAs) for Facial Expression Recognition (FER). Departing from conventional pre-training methods for video understanding that rely on pixel-level reconstructions, V-JEPAs learn by predicting embeddings of masked regions from the embeddings of unmasked regions. This enables the trained encoder to not capture irrelevant information about a given video like the color of a region of pixels in the background. Using a pre-trained V-JEPA video encoder, we train shallow classifiers using the RAVDESS and CREMA-D datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on RAVDESS and outperforming all other vision-based methods on CREMA-D (+1.48 WAR). Furthermore, cross-dataset evaluations reveal strong generalization capabilities, demonstrating the potential of purely embedding-based pre-training approaches to advance FER.

*Yue Yao,Ruining Yang,Tom Gedeon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes hierarchical data server with bipartite mode matching (BMM) to construct optimal training sets from large-scale data servers when real-time target domain annotation is infeasible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Target domains have distinct semantic modes, and traditional training sets often miss these modes, compromising model performance. Existing works focus on algorithmic improvements, but this paper explores optimizing data server structure instead.

Method: Introduces hierarchical data server inspired by web search engines, with bipartite mode matching (BMM) algorithm to align source and target modes one-on-one. For each target mode, searches data tree for best mode match regardless of size.

Result: BMM-matched training sets show consistently smaller domain gaps than existing methods across re-ID and detection tasks. Models trained on these sets achieve higher accuracy. BMM is orthogonal to model-centric UDA methods and further improves when combined with techniques like pseudo-labeling.

Conclusion: Data-centric UDA via BMM offers a novel approach complementary to existing model-centric methods, enabling better training set construction from large-scale data servers without real-time target annotation.

Abstract: We explore a situation in which the target domain is accessible, but real-time data annotation is not feasible. Instead, we would like to construct an alternative training set from a large-scale data server so that a competitive model can be obtained. For this problem, because the target domain usually exhibits distinct modes (i.e., semantic clusters representing data distribution), if the training set does not contain these target modes, the model performance would be compromised. While prior existing works improve algorithms iteratively, our research explores the often-overlooked potential of optimizing the structure of the data server. Inspired by the hierarchical nature of web search engines, we introduce a hierarchical data server, together with a bipartite mode matching algorithm (BMM) to align source and target modes. For each target mode, we look in the server data tree for the best mode match, which might be large or small in size. Through bipartite matching, we aim for all target modes to be optimally matched with source modes in a one-on-one fashion. Compared with existing training set search algorithms, we show that the matched server modes constitute training sets that have consistently smaller domain gaps with the target domain across object re-identification (re-ID) and detection tasks. Consequently, models trained on our searched training sets have higher accuracy than those trained otherwise. BMM allows data-centric unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) orthogonal to existing model-centric UDA methods. By combining the BMM with existing UDA methods like pseudo-labeling, further improvement is observed.

Conclusion: DF-DiffCom provides a trustworthy and flexible solution for longitudinal brain image completion, addressing key limitations of existing methods while enabling versatile application scenarios across different MRI modalities.

Abstract: Longitudinal brain MRI is essential for lifespan study, yet high attrition rates often lead to missing data, complicating analysis. Deep generative models have been explored, but most rely solely on image intensity, leading to two key limitations: 1) the fidelity or trustworthiness of the generated brain images are limited, making downstream studies questionable; 2) the usage flexibility is restricted due to fixed guidance rooted in the model structure, restricting full ability to versatile application scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce DF-DiffCom, a Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)-enhanced diffusion model that smartly leverages deformation fields for trustworthy longitudinal brain image completion. Trained on OASIS-3, DF-DiffCom outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving PSNR by 5.6% and SSIM by 0.12. More importantly, its modality-agnostic nature allows smooth extension to varied MRI modalities, even to attribute maps such as brain tissue segmentation results.

TL;DR: OpenVoxel is a training-free algorithm for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding that groups sparse voxels and generates captions using VLMs/MLLMs without CLIP/BERT embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding without requiring training or introducing CLIP/BERT text embeddings, allowing for direct text-to-text search using MLLMs for tasks like open-vocabulary segmentation and referring expression segmentation.

Method: Uses sparse voxel rasterization from multi-view images, groups voxels into meaningful object segments, then leverages Vision Language Models and Multi-modal Large Language Models to caption each group and build an informative scene map through text-to-text search.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance compared to recent studies, particularly in complex referring expression segmentation tasks, while being training-free and not requiring CLIP/BERT embeddings.

Conclusion: OpenVoxel provides an effective training-free approach for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding that outperforms existing methods, especially for complex referring expression segmentation, with code to be made publicly available.

Abstract: We propose OpenVoxel, a training-free algorithm for grouping and captioning sparse voxels for the open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding tasks. Given the sparse voxel rasterization (SVR) model obtained from multi-view images of a 3D scene, our OpenVoxel is able to produce meaningful groups that describe different objects in the scene. Also, by leveraging powerful Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), our OpenVoxel successfully build an informative scene map by captioning each group, enabling further 3D scene understanding tasks such as open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) or referring expression segmentation (RES). Unlike previous methods, our method is training-free and does not introduce embeddings from a CLIP/BERT text encoder. Instead, we directly proceed with text-to-text search using MLLMs. Through extensive experiments, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to recent studies, particularly in complex referring expression segmentation (RES) tasks.

### [71] [Iterative Differential Entropy Minimization (IDEM) method for fine rigid pairwise 3D Point Cloud Registration: A Focus on the Metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09601)
*Emmanuele Barberi,Felice Sfravara,Filippo Cucinotta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IDEM: A novel differential entropy-based metric for robust 3D point cloud registration that handles density differences, noise, holes, and partial overlap better than traditional Euclidean distance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional point cloud registration methods using Euclidean distances (RMSE, Chamfer, Hausdorff) are sensitive to issues like density differences, noise, holes, and limited overlap. They also lack commutativity, requiring selection of a fixed point cloud, which is problematic when both point clouds have issues in real scenarios.

Method: Introduces Iterative Differential Entropy Minimization (IDEM), a novel differential entropy-based metric that serves as an objective function for fine rigid pairwise 3D point cloud registration. The metric is commutative (doesn't require choosing a fixed point cloud) and shows clear minima at optimal alignment during transformations.

Result: IDEM proves effective in multiple case studies, outperforming traditional metrics (RMSE, Chamfer, Hausdorff distance) especially when dealing with density differences, noise, holes, and partial overlap where RMSE fails to yield optimal alignment.

Conclusion: The differential entropy-based IDEM metric provides a robust alternative to Euclidean distance metrics for point cloud registration, addressing key limitations of traditional methods and performing well in challenging real-world scenarios with imperfect data.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a central theme in computer vision, with alignment algorithms continuously improving for greater robustness. Commonly used methods evaluate Euclidean distances between point clouds and minimize an objective function, such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). However, these approaches are most effective when the point clouds are well-prealigned and issues such as differences in density, noise, holes, and limited overlap can compromise the results. Traditional methods, such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP), require choosing one point cloud as fixed, since Euclidean distances lack commutativity. When only one point cloud has issues, adjustments can be made, but in real scenarios, both point clouds may be affected, often necessitating preprocessing. The authors introduce a novel differential entropy-based metric, designed to serve as the objective function within an optimization framework for fine rigid pairwise 3D point cloud registration, denoted as Iterative Differential Entropy Minimization (IDEM). This metric does not depend on the choice of a fixed point cloud and, during transformations, reveals a clear minimum corresponding to the best alignment. Multiple case studies are conducted, and the results are compared with those obtained using RMSE, Chamfer distance, and Hausdorff distance. The proposed metric proves effective even with density differences, noise, holes, and partial overlap, where RMSE does not always yield optimal alignment.

### [72] [GRCF: Two-Stage Groupwise Ranking and Calibration Framework for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09606)
*Manning Gao,Leheng Zhang,Shiqin Han,Haifeng Hu,Yuncheng Jiang,Sijie Mai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes GRCF, a two-stage framework for multimodal sentiment analysis that addresses limitations of both point-wise regression and pairwise ordinal learning by adaptively focusing on hard samples and using dynamic margins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point-wise regression is sensitive to label noise and ignores relative ordering between samples, while pairwise ordinal learning treats all comparisons equally and uses static margins that don't reflect varying semantic distances between sentiment groups.

Method: Two-stage framework: Stage 1 uses GRPO-inspired Advantage-Weighted Dynamic Margin Ranking Loss to build fine-grained ordinal structure, adaptively focusing on hard samples. Stage 2 uses MAE-driven objective to align prediction magnitudes for calibration.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on core regression benchmarks and shows strong generalizability in classification tasks including multimodal humor detection and sarcasm detection.

Conclusion: GRCF effectively addresses trade-offs in existing approaches by simultaneously preserving relative ordinal structure, ensuring absolute score calibration, and adaptively focusing on difficult samples, demonstrating broad applicability across regression and classification tasks.

Abstract: Most Multimodal Sentiment Analysis research has focused on point-wise regression. While straightforward, this approach is sensitive to label noise and neglects whether one sample is more positive than another, resulting in unstable predictions and poor correlation alignment. Pairwise ordinal learning frameworks emerged to address this gap, capturing relative order by learning from comparisons. Yet, they introduce two new trade-offs: First, they assign uniform importance to all comparisons, failing to adaptively focus on hard-to-rank samples. Second, they employ static ranking margins, which fail to reflect the varying semantic distances between sentiment groups. To address this, we propose a Two-Stage Group-wise Ranking and Calibration Framework (GRCF) that adapts the philosophy of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our framework resolves these trade-offs by simultaneously preserving relative ordinal structure, ensuring absolute score calibration, and adaptively focusing on difficult samples. Specifically, Stage 1 introduces a GRPO-inspired Advantage-Weighted Dynamic Margin Ranking Loss to build a fine-grained ordinal structure. Stage 2 then employs an MAE-driven objective to align prediction magnitudes. To validate its generalizability, we extend GRCF to classification tasks, including multimodal humor detection and sarcasm detection. GRCF achieves state-of-the-art performance on core regression benchmarks, while also showing strong generalizability in classification tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T2I model anonymity in voting-based leaderboards can be broken by clustering image embeddings, enabling accurate deanonymization without prompt control or training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose security flaws in text-to-image model leaderboards that rely on anonymized outputs for fair comparison, showing that such anonymity can be easily compromised.

Method: Centroid-based method using image embeddings from 22 models and 280 prompts (150K images) to cluster generations, revealing distinctive model-specific signatures in embedding space.

Result: Achieves high deanonymization accuracy, introduces prompt-level distinguishability metric, and shows certain prompts lead to near-perfect model distinguishability.

Conclusion: Reveals fundamental security flaws in T2I leaderboards and motivates the need for stronger anonymization defenses to ensure fair model comparison.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are increasingly popular, producing a large share of AI-generated images online. To compare model quality, voting-based leaderboards have become the standard, relying on anonymized model outputs for fairness. In this work, we show that such anonymity can be easily broken. We find that generations from each T2I model form distinctive clusters in the image embedding space, enabling accurate deanonymization without prompt control or training data. Using 22 models and 280 prompts (150K images), our centroid-based method achieves high accuracy and reveals systematic model-specific signatures. We further introduce a prompt-level distinguishability metric and conduct large-scale analyses showing how certain prompts can lead to near-perfect distinguishability. Our findings expose fundamental security flaws in T2I leaderboards and motivate stronger anonymization defenses.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Single-image garment estimation framework that predicts simulation-ready physics parameters by combining vision-language material inference with physics parameter mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require multi-view capture with expensive differentiable simulation or only predict geometry without material properties needed for realistic simulation.

Method: Fine-tune vision-language model to infer material composition/fabric attributes from images, then train lightweight predictor to map attributes to physical fabric parameters using material-physics dataset.

Result: Superior accuracy in material composition estimation and fabric attribute prediction, achieving higher-fidelity simulations compared to state-of-the-art image-to-garment methods.

Conclusion: Proposed feed-forward framework enables simulation-ready garment estimation from single images without iterative optimization, introducing two new datasets (FTAG and T2P).

Abstract: Estimating physically accurate, simulation-ready garments from a single image is challenging due to the absence of image-to-physics datasets and the ill-posed nature of this problem. Prior methods either require multi-view capture and expensive differentiable simulation or predict only garment geometry without the material properties required for realistic simulation. We propose a feed-forward framework that sidesteps these limitations by first fine-tuning a vision-language model to infer material composition and fabric attributes from real images, and then training a lightweight predictor that maps these attributes to the corresponding physical fabric parameters using a small dataset of material-physics measurements. Our approach introduces two new datasets (FTAG and T2P) and delivers simulation-ready garments from a single image without iterative optimization. Experiments show that our estimator achieves superior accuracy in material composition estimation and fabric attribute prediction, and by passing them through our physics parameter estimator, we further achieve higher-fidelity simulations compared to state-of-the-art image-to-garment methods.

*Aishwarya Agarwal,Srikrishna Karanam,Vineet Gandhi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiteEmbed is a lightweight framework for few-shot personalization of CLIP that adds new classes without retraining, using subspace-guided optimization of text embeddings with coarse alignment and fine separation objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP struggles with rare, emerging, or culturally specific classes that were underrepresented during pretraining, creating a need for efficient adaptation methods that don't require full model retraining.

Method: Uses PCA-based decomposition to disentangle semantic directions, then optimizes text embeddings with two objectives: coarse alignment for global consistency and fine separation for discriminability among similar classes.

Result: Demonstrates substantial gains over prior methods, enabling plug-and-play substitution of original CLIP text features across multiple tasks including classification, retrieval, segmentation, and detection.

Conclusion: LiteEmbed establishes an effective approach for adapting CLIP to underrepresented, rare, or unseen classes through lightweight few-shot personalization without encoder retraining.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot recognition but struggle with classes that are rarely seen during pretraining, including newly emerging entities and culturally specific categories. We introduce LiteEmbed, a lightweight framework for few-shot personalization of CLIP that enables new classes to be added without retraining its encoders. LiteEmbed performs subspace-guided optimization of text embeddings within CLIP's vocabulary, leveraging a PCA-based decomposition that disentangles coarse semantic directions from fine-grained variations. Two complementary objectives, coarse alignment and fine separation, jointly preserve global semantic consistency while enhancing discriminability among visually similar classes. Once optimized, the embeddings are plug-and-play, seamlessly substituting CLIP's original text features across classification, retrieval, segmentation, and detection tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial gains over prior methods, establishing LiteEmbed as an effective approach for adapting CLIP to underrepresented, rare, or unseen classes.

*Xuyang Fang,Sion Hannuna,Edwin Simpson,Neill Campbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised animal ID method using global clustering instead of tracking, achieving >97% accuracy with <1GB GPU memory by sampling frame pairs and using Hungarian algorithm for pseudo-label assignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional animal identification requires extensive manual annotation, while existing self-supervised methods are computationally demanding and unsuitable for long videos due to memory constraints and temporal error propagation.

Method: Reframes animal ID as global clustering rather than sequential tracking. Assumes known fixed number of individuals, uses only bounding boxes and total count. Samples frame pairs, employs frozen pre-trained backbone with self-bootstrapping using Hungarian algorithm for in-batch pseudo-label assignment, and adapts Binary Cross Entropy loss from vision-language models.

Result: Achieves >97% accuracy while consuming less than 1GB GPU memory per batch (order of magnitude less than standard contrastive methods). Matches or surpasses supervised baselines trained on 1000+ labeled frames on challenging datasets (3D-POP pigeons and 8-calves feeding videos).

Conclusion: Enables practical, high-accuracy animal identification on consumer-grade hardware, removing manual annotation bottleneck with broad applicability in resource-constrained research settings.

Abstract: Identifying individual animals in long-duration videos is essential for behavioral ecology, wildlife monitoring, and livestock management. Traditional methods require extensive manual annotation, while existing self-supervised approaches are computationally demanding and ill-suited for long sequences due to memory constraints and temporal error propagation. We introduce a highly efficient, self-supervised method that reframes animal identification as a global clustering task rather than a sequential tracking problem. Our approach assumes a known, fixed number of individuals within a single video -- a common scenario in practice -- and requires only bounding box detections and the total count. By sampling pairs of frames, using a frozen pre-trained backbone, and employing a self-bootstrapping mechanism with the Hungarian algorithm for in-batch pseudo-label assignment, our method learns discriminative features without identity labels. We adapt a Binary Cross Entropy loss from vision-language models, enabling state-of-the-art accuracy ($>$97\%) while consuming less than 1 GB of GPU memory per batch -- an order of magnitude less than standard contrastive methods. Evaluated on challenging real-world datasets (3D-POP pigeons and 8-calves feeding videos), our framework matches or surpasses supervised baselines trained on over 1,000 labeled frames, effectively removing the manual annotation bottleneck. This work enables practical, high-accuracy animal identification on consumer-grade hardware, with broad applicability in resource-constrained research settings.

TL;DR: SCE-SLAM: A monocular visual SLAM system that uses learned scene coordinate embeddings to maintain scale consistency and reduce drift, achieving 36 FPS with significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular visual SLAM suffers from scale drift - gradual divergence of estimated scale over long sequences. Existing frame-to-frame methods accumulate drift due to lack of global constraints between independent windows.

Method: End-to-end SLAM system with scene coordinate embeddings (learned patch-level representations encoding 3D geometric relationships under canonical scale). Two key modules: 1) geometry-guided aggregation using 3D spatial proximity to propagate scale info via geometry-modulated attention, 2) scene coordinate bundle adjustment anchoring current estimates to reference scale through explicit 3D coordinate constraints.

Result: Substantial improvements on KITTI, Waymo, and vKITTI: reduces absolute trajectory error by 8.36m on KITTI compared to best prior approach, maintains 36 FPS, achieves scale consistency across large-scale scenes.

Conclusion: SCE-SLAM effectively addresses scale drift in monocular SLAM through learned scene coordinate embeddings and geometry-aware optimization, enabling accurate, real-time 3D reconstruction and navigation with consistent scale across long sequences.

Abstract: Monocular visual SLAM enables 3D reconstruction from internet video and autonomous navigation on resource-constrained platforms, yet suffers from scale drift, i.e., the gradual divergence of estimated scale over long sequences. Existing frame-to-frame methods achieve real-time performance through local optimization but accumulate scale drift due to the lack of global constraints among independent windows. To address this, we propose SCE-SLAM, an end-to-end SLAM system that maintains scale consistency through scene coordinate embeddings, which are learned patch-level representations encoding 3D geometric relationships under a canonical scale reference. The framework consists of two key modules: geometry-guided aggregation that leverages 3D spatial proximity to propagate scale information from historical observations through geometry-modulated attention, and scene coordinate bundle adjustment that anchors current estimates to the reference scale through explicit 3D coordinate constraints decoded from the scene coordinate embeddings. Experiments on KITTI, Waymo, and vKITTI demonstrate substantial improvements: our method reduces absolute trajectory error by 8.36m on KITTI compared to the best prior approach, while maintaining 36 FPS and achieving scale consistency across large-scale scenes.

TL;DR: STEP3-VL-10B is a 10B parameter open-source multimodal model that achieves frontier-level performance rivaling models 10-20x larger through unified pre-training on 1.2T tokens and scaled reinforcement learning post-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To redefine the trade-off between compact efficiency and frontier-level multimodal intelligence by creating a lightweight yet powerful open-source foundation model that can compete with much larger proprietary models.

Method: Two strategic shifts: 1) Unified fully unfrozen pre-training on 1.2T multimodal tokens integrating language-aligned Perception Encoder with Qwen3-8B decoder, 2) Scaled post-training with over 1k reinforcement learning iterations, plus Parallel Coordinated Reasoning (PaCoRe) for test-time compute scaling.

Conclusion: STEP3-VL-10B delivers best-in-class performance in a compact 10B package, providing the community with a powerful, efficient, and reproducible baseline for multimodal AI research.

Abstract: We present STEP3-VL-10B, a lightweight open-source foundation model designed to redefine the trade-off between compact efficiency and frontier-level multimodal intelligence. STEP3-VL-10B is realized through two strategic shifts: first, a unified, fully unfrozen pre-training strategy on 1.2T multimodal tokens that integrates a language-aligned Perception Encoder with a Qwen3-8B decoder to establish intrinsic vision-language synergy; and second, a scaled post-training pipeline featuring over 1k iterations of reinforcement learning. Crucially, we implement Parallel Coordinated Reasoning (PaCoRe) to scale test-time compute, allocating resources to scalable perceptual reasoning that explores and synthesizes diverse visual hypotheses. Consequently, despite its compact 10B footprint, STEP3-VL-10B rivals or surpasses models 10$\times$-20$\times$ larger (e.g., GLM-4.6V-106B, Qwen3-VL-235B) and top-tier proprietary flagships like Gemini 2.5 Pro and Seed-1.5-VL. Delivering best-in-class performance, it records 92.2% on MMBench and 80.11% on MMMU, while excelling in complex reasoning with 94.43% on AIME2025 and 75.95% on MathVision. We release the full model suite to provide the community with a powerful, efficient, and reproducible baseline.

*Jieying Chen,Jeffrey Hu,Joan Lasenby,Ayush Tewari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SRENDER: Efficient video generation by using diffusion models for sparse keyframes, then 3D reconstruction and rendering for full videos, achieving 40x speedup over diffusion baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based video generation models are computationally inefficient (minutes of GPU time for seconds of video), creating barriers for real-time applications like embodied AI and VR/AR.

Method: Generate sparse keyframes with diffusion models, lift them into 3D representation, render intermediate views for full video, and predict optimal number of keyframes based on camera trajectory complexity.

Result: 40x faster than diffusion baseline for generating 20-second videos while maintaining high visual fidelity and temporal stability, with adaptive keyframe allocation based on camera motion complexity.

Conclusion: SRENDER offers a practical path toward efficient and controllable video synthesis by amortizing generation costs across frames and enforcing geometric consistency through 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Modern video generative models based on diffusion models can produce very realistic clips, but they are computationally inefficient, often requiring minutes of GPU time for just a few seconds of video. This inefficiency poses a critical barrier to deploying generative video in applications that require real-time interactions, such as embodied AI and VR/AR. This paper explores a new strategy for camera-conditioned video generation of static scenes: using diffusion-based generative models to generate a sparse set of keyframes, and then synthesizing the full video through 3D reconstruction and rendering. By lifting keyframes into a 3D representation and rendering intermediate views, our approach amortizes the generation cost across hundreds of frames while enforcing geometric consistency. We further introduce a model that predicts the optimal number of keyframes for a given camera trajectory, allowing the system to adaptively allocate computation. Our final method, SRENDER, uses very sparse keyframes for simple trajectories and denser ones for complex camera motion. This results in video generation that is more than 40 times faster than the diffusion-based baseline in generating 20 seconds of video, while maintaining high visual fidelity and temporal stability, offering a practical path toward efficient and controllable video synthesis.

*Tony Danjun Wang,Tolga Birdal,Nassir Navab,Lennart Bastian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COMPOSE formulates multi-view 3D pose correspondence as hypergraph partitioning instead of pairwise associations, using geometric pruning for efficiency, achieving up to 23% improvement over optimization-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-view 3D pose estimation rely on brittle pairwise associations that propagate errors when reconciling cycle consistency across multiple views, especially with spurious associations.

Method: COMPOSE formulates multi-view pose correspondence matching as a hypergraph partitioning problem rather than pairwise association, using an efficient geometric pruning strategy to reduce the exponential search space of the resulting integer linear program.

Result: COMPOSE achieves improvements of up to 23% in average precision over previous optimization-based methods and up to 11% over self-supervised end-to-end learned methods.

Conclusion: COMPOSE offers a promising solution to the widely studied problem of 3D pose estimation from sparse multi-views by addressing the fundamental correspondence challenge through hypergraph partitioning.

Abstract: 3D pose estimation from sparse multi-views is a critical task for numerous applications, including action recognition, sports analysis, and human-robot interaction. Optimization-based methods typically follow a two-stage pipeline, first detecting 2D keypoints in each view and then associating these detections across views to triangulate the 3D pose. Existing methods rely on mere pairwise associations to model this correspondence problem, treating global consistency between views (i.e., cycle consistency) as a soft constraint. Yet, reconciling these constraints for multiple views becomes brittle when spurious associations propagate errors. We thus propose COMPOSE, a novel framework that formulates multi-view pose correspondence matching as a hypergraph partitioning problem rather than through pairwise association. While the complexity of the resulting integer linear program grows exponentially in theory, we introduce an efficient geometric pruning strategy to substantially reduce the search space. COMPOSE achieves improvements of up to 23% in average precision over previous optimization-based methods and up to 11% over self-supervised end-to-end learned methods, offering a promising solution to a widely studied problem.

*Ruiqi Shen,Chang Liu,Henghui Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM3-DMS improves multi-object tracking by using individual memory selection instead of synchronized group decisions, achieving better identity preservation especially in dense target scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original SAM3's group-level collective memory selection is suboptimal for complex multi-object scenarios because it uses synchronized decisions based on average performance across all targets, which often overlooks individual reliability of objects.

Method: SAM3-DMS is a training-free decoupled strategy that utilizes fine-grained memory selection on individual objects rather than synchronized group decisions.

Result: Experiments demonstrate robust identity preservation and tracking stability, with advantages becoming more pronounced as target density increases.

Conclusion: SAM3-DMS establishes a solid foundation for simultaneous multi-target video segmentation in the wild by addressing the limitations of SAM3's group-level memory selection.

Abstract: Segment Anything 3 (SAM3) has established a powerful foundation that robustly detects, segments, and tracks specified targets in videos. However, in its original implementation, its group-level collective memory selection is suboptimal for complex multi-object scenarios, as it employs a synchronized decision across all concurrent targets conditioned on their average performance, often overlooking individual reliability. To this end, we propose SAM3-DMS, a training-free decoupled strategy that utilizes fine-grained memory selection on individual objects. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves robust identity preservation and tracking stability. Notably, our advantage becomes more pronounced with increased target density, establishing a solid foundation for simultaneous multi-target video segmentation in the wild.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a utility-aware fairness metric for robotic decision-making that jointly analyzes fairness with user-data privacy, showing privacy budgets can be used to meet fairness targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative AI-driven autonomous systems pose critical fairness concerns, but robotic applications lack precise, implementable fairness definitions that capture user utility and data randomness while considering privacy requirements.

Method: Develop a utility-aware fairness metric for robotic decision making, analyze fairness jointly with user-data privacy, derive conditions where privacy budgets govern fairness metrics, and create a unified framework formalizing fairness-privacy interplay.

Result: The framework shows privacy budgets can be jointly used to meet fairness targets, tested in a robot navigation task, revealing surprising connections between privacy enforcement and fairness achievement.

Conclusion: Addressing fairness concerns through combined consideration of privacy is crucial for ethical AI use and strengthens trust in autonomous robots deployed in everyday environments.

Abstract: Complex decision-making by autonomous machines and algorithms could underpin the foundations of future society. Generative AI is emerging as a powerful engine for such transitions. However, we show that Generative AI-driven developments pose a critical pitfall: fairness concerns. In robotic applications, although intuitions about fairness are common, a precise and implementable definition that captures user utility and inherent data randomness is missing. Here we provide a utility-aware fairness metric for robotic decision making and analyze fairness jointly with user-data privacy, deriving conditions under which privacy budgets govern fairness metrics. This yields a unified framework that formalizes and quantifies fairness and its interplay with privacy, which is tested in a robot navigation task. In view of the fact that under legal requirements, most robotic systems will enforce user privacy, the approach shows surprisingly that such privacy budgets can be jointly used to meet fairness targets. Addressing fairness concerns in the creative combined consideration of privacy is a step towards ethical use of AI and strengthens trust in autonomous robots deployed in everyday environments.

Method: Proposes RGMP-S with two key components: 1) Long-horizon Geometric Prior Skill Selector using lightweight 2D geometric inductive biases for precise 3D scene understanding within vision-language models, and 2) Recursive Adaptive Spiking Network parameterizing robot-object interactions via recursive spiking for spatiotemporal consistency and efficient learning from sparse demonstrations.

Result: Extensive experiments on Maniskill simulation benchmark and three heterogeneous real-world robotic systems (custom humanoid, desktop manipulator, commercial platform) show superiority over state-of-the-art baselines and validate efficacy in diverse generalization scenarios.

Conclusion: RGMP-S effectively addresses critical challenges in humanoid robot manipulation by combining geometric reasoning with spiking neural networks, achieving robust generalization and data-efficient learning while making source code publicly available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Humanoid robot manipulation is a crucial research area for executing diverse human-level tasks, involving high-level semantic reasoning and low-level action generation. However, precise scene understanding and sample-efficient learning from human demonstrations remain critical challenges, severely hindering the applicability and generalizability of existing frameworks. This paper presents a novel RGMP-S, Recurrent Geometric-prior Multimodal Policy with Spiking features, facilitating both high-level skill reasoning and data-efficient motion synthesis. To ground high-level reasoning in physical reality, we leverage lightweight 2D geometric inductive biases to enable precise 3D scene understanding within the vision-language model. Specifically, we construct a Long-horizon Geometric Prior Skill Selector that effectively aligns the semantic instructions with spatial constraints, ultimately achieving robust generalization in unseen environments. For the data efficiency issue in robotic action generation, we introduce a Recursive Adaptive Spiking Network. We parameterize robot-object interactions via recursive spiking for spatiotemporal consistency, fully distilling long-horizon dynamic features while mitigating the overfitting issue in sparse demonstration scenarios. Extensive experiments are conducted across the Maniskill simulation benchmark and three heterogeneous real-world robotic systems, encompassing a custom-developed humanoid, a desktop manipulator, and a commercial robotic platform. Empirical results substantiate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines and validate the efficacy of the proposed modules in diverse generalization scenarios.

### [85] [Design Methodology of Hydraulically-driven Soft Robotic Gripper for a Large and Heavy Object](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09104)
*Ko Yamamoto,Kyosuke Ishibashi,Hiroki Ishikawa,Osamu Azami*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Hydraulically-driven soft robotic gripper designed for grasping large, heavy objects (10-20 kg) using high-pressure hydraulic actuation instead of pneumatic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pneumatic soft grippers with several hundred kPa pressure cannot generate sufficient force for large, heavy objects (10-20 kg, 20-30 cm diameter). Hydraulic actuation offers potential for much larger power generation through several MPa pressure.

Method: Developed a hydraulically-driven soft gripper using mathematical modeling to determine design parameters (pressure, bending angle, object mass, grasping force relationship). Used finite element analysis for material selection and detailed design optimization.

Result: Successfully demonstrated grasping of 20 kg objects and implemented closed-loop control of finger bending angle.

Conclusion: Hydraulic actuation enables soft robotic grippers to handle significantly larger and heavier objects than pneumatic systems, with mathematical modeling and FEA providing effective design optimization.

Abstract: This paper presents a design methodology of a hydraulically-driven soft robotic gripper for grasping a large and heavy object -- approximately 10 - 20 kg with 20 - 30 cm diameter. Most existing soft grippers are pneumatically actuated with several hundred kPa pressure, and cannot generate output force sufficient for such a large and heavy object. Instead of pneumatic actuation, hydraulic actuation has a potential to generate much larger power by several MPa pressure. In this study, we develop a hydraulically-driven soft gripper, in which its basic design parameters are determined based on a mathematical model that represents the relationship among the driving pressure, bending angle, object mass and grasping force. Moreover, we selected materials suitable for grasping a heavier object, based on the finite element analysis result of the detailed design. We report experimental results on a 20 kg object grasping and closed-loop control of the finger bending angle.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Cross-Embodiment Interface (CEI) enables transfer of robotic demonstrations across different robot arms and end-effectors by aligning trajectories through functional similarity and gradient optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic foundation models trained on large datasets often overfit to specific viewpoints, robot arms, and parallel-jaw grippers due to dataset biases, limiting their generalizability across different robot embodiments.

Method: CEI introduces functional similarity measured by Directional Chamfer Distance, aligns robot trajectories through gradient-based optimization, and synthesizes observations/actions for unseen robot arms and end-effectors.

Result: CEI successfully transfers data and policies across 16 different embodiments in simulation and achieves bidirectional transfer between different robot setups in 6 real-world tasks with 82.4% average transfer ratio.

Conclusion: CEI provides an effective framework for cross-embodiment learning that overcomes dataset biases and can be extended with spatial generalization and multimodal motion generation capabilities.

Abstract: Robotic foundation models trained on large-scale manipulation datasets have shown promise in learning generalist policies, but they often overfit to specific viewpoints, robot arms, and especially parallel-jaw grippers due to dataset biases. To address this limitation, we propose Cross-Embodiment Interface (\CEI), a framework for cross-embodiment learning that enables the transfer of demonstrations across different robot arm and end-effector morphologies. \CEI introduces the concept of \textit{functional similarity}, which is quantified using Directional Chamfer Distance. Then it aligns robot trajectories through gradient-based optimization, followed by synthesizing observations and actions for unseen robot arms and end-effectors. In experiments, \CEI transfers data and policies from a Franka Panda robot to \textbf{16} different embodiments across \textbf{3} tasks in simulation, and supports bidirectional transfer between a UR5+AG95 gripper robot and a UR5+Xhand robot across \textbf{6} real-world tasks, achieving an average transfer ratio of 82.4\%. Finally, we demonstrate that \CEI can also be extended with spatial generalization and multimodal motion generation capabilities using our proposed techniques.

*Paul Brunzema,Thomas Lew,Ray Zhang,Takeru Shirasawa,John Subosits,Marcus Greiff*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Vision-conditioned variational Bayesian model enables proactive adaptation to changing environmental conditions for autonomous vehicle racing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional modeling struggles with abrupt environmental changes, while adaptive methods are reactive and may adapt too late for safety-critical applications like autonomous racing.

Method: Vision-conditioned variational Bayesian last-layer dynamics model that learns nominal vehicle dynamics and fine-tunes with feature-wise affine transformations of latent features using visual context.

Result: With vision-conditioning, the system completed all 12 attempted laps under varying conditions (water puddles), while all baselines without visual context consistently lost control.

Conclusion: Proactive dynamics adaptation using visual context is crucial for high-performance autonomous applications, enabling safe operation under rapidly changing environmental conditions.

Abstract: Agile control of robotic systems often requires anticipating how the environment affects system behavior. For example, a driver must perceive the road ahead to anticipate available friction and plan actions accordingly. Achieving such proactive adaptation within autonomous frameworks remains a challenge, particularly under rapidly changing conditions. Traditional modeling approaches often struggle to capture abrupt variations in system behavior, while adaptive methods are inherently reactive and may adapt too late to ensure safety. We propose a vision-conditioned variational Bayesian last-layer dynamics model that leverages visual context to anticipate changes in the environment. The model first learns nominal vehicle dynamics and is then fine-tuned with feature-wise affine transformations of latent features, enabling context-aware dynamics prediction. The resulting model is integrated into an optimal controller for vehicle racing. We validate our method on a Lexus LC500 racing through water puddles. With vision-conditioning, the system completed all 12 attempted laps under varying conditions. In contrast, all baselines without visual context consistently lost control, demonstrating the importance of proactive dynamics adaptation in high-performance applications.

### [88] [Online Trajectory Optimization for Arbitrary-Shaped Mobile Robots via Polynomial Separating Hypersurfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09231)
*Shuoye Li,Zhiyuan Song,Yulin Li,Zhihai Bi,Jun Ma*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes using polynomial hypersurfaces instead of linear hyperplanes for collision avoidance in trajectory optimization, enabling nonconvex robot and obstacle geometries without conservative approximations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use linear separating hyperplanes that require convex approximations of both robot and obstacles, which is overly conservative in cluttered/narrow environments and fails with nonconvex geometries.

Method: Generalizes separating hyperplane theorem to prove any two disjoint bounded closed sets can be separated by polynomial hypersurfaces. Formulates NLP problem that jointly optimizes robot trajectory and polynomial coefficients for geometry-aware collision avoidance.

Result: Method achieves smooth, collision-free, and agile maneuvers in environments where convex-approximation baselines fail, as demonstrated in simulation and real-world experiments with nonconvex robots.

Conclusion: Removes the convexity limitation of previous methods by introducing polynomial hypersurfaces, enabling efficient collision avoidance for arbitrary nonconvex geometries using standard NLP solvers.

Abstract: An emerging class of trajectory optimization methods enforces collision avoidance by jointly optimizing the robot's configuration and a separating hyperplane. However, as linear separators only apply to convex sets, these methods require convex approximations of both the robot and obstacles, which becomes an overly conservative assumption in cluttered and narrow environments. In this work, we unequivocally remove this limitation by introducing nonlinear separating hypersurfaces parameterized by polynomial functions. We first generalize the classical separating hyperplane theorem and prove that any two disjoint bounded closed sets in Euclidean space can be separated by a polynomial hypersurface, serving as the theoretical foundation for nonlinear separation of arbitrary geometries. Building on this result, we formulate a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem that jointly optimizes the robot's trajectory and the coefficients of the separating polynomials, enabling geometry-aware collision avoidance without conservative convex simplifications. The optimization remains efficiently solvable using standard NLP solvers. Simulation and real-world experiments with nonconvex robots demonstrate that our method achieves smooth, collision-free, and agile maneuvers in environments where convex-approximation baselines fail.

TL;DR: Construction of polynomial navigation functions for 3D motion planning with spherical/cylindrical obstacles, ensuring unique target minimum without local minima.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for reliable motion planning in 3D environments with obstacles, requiring navigation functions that guarantee convergence to target without getting stuck in local minima, especially when obstacles intersect.

Method: Model workspace as bounded spherical region, encode obstacles using smooth polynomial implicit functions, construct navigation functions with conditions ensuring unique non-degenerate minimum at target, analyze gradient and Hessian properties.

Result: Established conditions for navigation functions to avoid local minima even with intersecting obstacles, provided gradient/Hessian analyses, validated through numerical simulations in obstacle-rich 3D environments.

Conclusion: Polynomial navigation functions provide theoretically sound solution for 3D motion planning with guaranteed convergence to target, robust to obstacle intersections, validated through simulations.

Abstract: This technical report presents the construction and analysis of polynomial navigation functions for motion planning in 3-D workspaces populated by spherical and cylindrical obstacles. The workspace is modeled as a bounded spherical region, and obstacles are encoded using smooth polynomial implicit functions. We establish conditions under which the proposed navigation functions admit a unique non-degenerate minimum at the target while avoiding local minima, including in the presence of pairwise intersecting obstacles. Gradient and Hessian analyses are provided, and the theoretical results are validated through numerical simulations in obstacle rich 3-D environments.

### [90] [ReflexDiffusion: Reflection-Enhanced Trajectory Planning for High-lateral-acceleration Scenarios in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09377)
*Xuemei Yao,Xiao Yang,Jianbin Sun,Liuwei Xie,Xuebin Shao,Xiyu Fang,Hang Su,Kewei Yang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ReflexDiffusion improves autonomous vehicle trajectory planning for sharp turns by amplifying critical conditioning signals during diffusion denoising, achieving 14.1% better driving scores on challenging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing trajectory planners fail in high-lateral-acceleration maneuvers (sharp turns) due to data imbalance, leading to insufficient modeling of vehicle dynamics and road geometry when vehicles operate near physical limits.

Method: ReflexDiffusion introduces a gradient-based adjustment mechanism during iterative denoising: after each standard trajectory update, it computes gradient between conditional/unconditional noise predictions to amplify critical conditioning signals (road curvature, lateral dynamics), enforcing strict physical constraints.

Result: On nuPlan Test14-hard benchmark, achieves 14.1% improvement in driving score for high-lateral-acceleration scenarios over SOTA methods, demonstrating effective compensation for training data sparsity.

Conclusion: Inference-time trajectory optimization can effectively reinforce safety-critical constraints near handling limits; architecture-agnostic design enables direct deployment to existing diffusion-based planners for improved autonomous vehicle safety.

Abstract: Generating safe and reliable trajectories for autonomous vehicles in long-tail scenarios remains a significant challenge, particularly for high-lateral-acceleration maneuvers such as sharp turns, which represent critical safety situations. Existing trajectory planners exhibit systematic failures in these scenarios due to data imbalance. This results in insufficient modelling of vehicle dynamics, road geometry, and environmental constraints in high-risk situations, leading to suboptimal or unsafe trajectory prediction when vehicles operate near their physical limits. In this paper, we introduce ReflexDiffusion, a novel inference-stage framework that enhances diffusion-based trajectory planners through reflective adjustment. Our method introduces a gradient-based adjustment mechanism during the iterative denoising process: after each standard trajectory update, we compute the gradient between the conditional and unconditional noise predictions to explicitly amplify critical conditioning signals, including road curvature and lateral vehicle dynamics. This amplification enforces strict adherence to physical constraints, particularly improving stability during high-lateral-acceleration maneuvers where precise vehicle-road interaction is paramount. Evaluated on the nuPlan Test14-hard benchmark, ReflexDiffusion achieves a 14.1% improvement in driving score for high-lateral-acceleration scenarios over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. This demonstrates that inference-time trajectory optimization can effectively compensate for training data sparsity by dynamically reinforcing safety-critical constraints near handling limits. The framework's architecture-agnostic design enables direct deployment to existing diffusion-based planners, offering a practical solution for improving autonomous vehicle safety in challenging driving conditions.

TL;DR: Large-scale study shows data diversity (geographic locations) is more important than data quantity for zero-shot generalization of imitation-learned navigation policies to unseen real-world environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalization of imitation-learned navigation policies to unseen environments remains a major challenge, requiring better understanding of how training data characteristics affect real-world performance.

Method: Used 4,565-hour crowd-sourced dataset from 161 locations in 35 countries to train policies for point goal navigation, then evaluated on sidewalk robots in four countries covering 125 km of autonomous driving.

Result: Data diversity (geographic locations) is far more important than data quantity - doubling locations decreases navigation errors by ~15%, while adding data from existing locations saturates quickly. Simple regression models outperform generative/sequence models with noisy crowd-sourced data.

Conclusion: Large-scale diverse training data enables zero-shot navigation in unknown environments approaching environment-specific policy performance, with data diversity being the critical factor for generalization.

Abstract: Generalization of imitation-learned navigation policies to environments unseen in training remains a major challenge. We address this by conducting the first large-scale study of how data quantity and data diversity affect real-world generalization in end-to-end, map-free visual navigation. Using a curated 4,565-hour crowd-sourced dataset collected across 161 locations in 35 countries, we train policies for point goal navigation and evaluate their closed-loop control performance on sidewalk robots operating in four countries, covering 125 km of autonomous driving.
  Our results show that large-scale training data enables zero-shot navigation in unknown environments, approaching the performance of policies trained with environment-specific demonstrations. Critically, we find that data diversity is far more important than data quantity. Doubling the number of geographical locations in a training set decreases navigation errors by ~15%, while performance benefit from adding data from existing locations saturates with very little data. We also observe that, with noisy crowd-sourced data, simple regression-based models outperform generative and sequence-based architectures. We release our policies, evaluation setup and example videos on the project page.

### [92] [CLARE: Continual Learning for Vision-Language-Action Models via Autonomous Adapter Routing and Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09512)
*Ralf Römer,Yi Zhang,Angela P. Schoellig*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CLARE is a parameter-efficient framework for exemplar-free continual learning with vision-language-action models that uses lightweight modular adapters and autoencoder-based routing to prevent catastrophic forgetting in robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fine-tuning approaches for vision-language-action models in robotics cause catastrophic forgetting when adapting to new tasks, and existing continual learning methods require storing previous data, struggle with long task sequences, or need task identifiers during deployment.

Method: CLARE introduces lightweight modular adapters into selected feedforward layers of VLAs, autonomously expands the model only where necessary based on layer-wise feature similarity, and uses an autoencoder-based routing mechanism to dynamically activate relevant adapters without task labels during deployment.

Result: On the LIBERO benchmark, CLARE achieves high performance on new tasks without catastrophic forgetting of earlier tasks, significantly outperforming even exemplar-based continual learning methods.

Conclusion: CLARE provides a general, parameter-efficient framework for exemplar-free continual learning with VLAs that enables robots to continually adapt to new tasks and environments while retaining previously acquired knowledge.

Abstract: To teach robots complex manipulation tasks, it is now a common practice to fine-tune a pre-trained vision-language-action model (VLA) on task-specific data. However, since this recipe updates existing representations, it is unsuitable for long-term operation in the real world, where robots must continually adapt to new tasks and environments while retaining the knowledge they have already acquired. Existing continual learning methods for robotics commonly require storing previous data (exemplars), struggle with long task sequences, or rely on task identifiers for deployment. To address these limitations, we propose CLARE, a general, parameter-efficient framework for exemplar-free continual learning with VLAs. CLARE introduces lightweight modular adapters into selected feedforward layers and autonomously expands the model only where necessary when learning a new task, guided by layer-wise feature similarity. During deployment, an autoencoder-based routing mechanism dynamically activates the most relevant adapters without requiring task labels. Through extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark, we show that CLARE achieves high performance on new tasks without catastrophic forgetting of earlier tasks, significantly outperforming even exemplar-based methods.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PAIR + D-STAR pipeline enables humanoid robots to learn complex whole-body interactions from human-human data by addressing contact preservation and interactive understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid robots need to physically interact with humans, but progress is limited by scarce Human-Humanoid Interaction (HHoI) data. Using abundant Human-Human Interaction (HHI) data is promising but existing methods fail to preserve essential contacts and lack interactive understanding.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) PAIR (Physics-Aware Interaction Retargeting) - contact-centric pipeline that preserves contact semantics across morphology differences to generate physically consistent HHoI data. 2) D-STAR (Decoupled Spatio-Temporal Action Reasoner) - hierarchical policy with Phase Attention (when to act) and Multi-Scale Spatial module (where to act) fused by diffusion head to produce synchronized whole-body behaviors.

Result: Significant performance gains over baseline approaches in extensive simulations. The complete pipeline effectively learns complex whole-body interactions from HHI data, enabling responsive, synchronized collaboration.

Conclusion: The PAIR + D-STAR framework provides a complete, effective solution for learning complex whole-body humanoid interactions from human-human data by addressing both contact preservation and interactive understanding challenges.

Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to physically interact with humans is a critical frontier, but progress is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality Human-Humanoid Interaction (HHoI) data. While leveraging abundant Human-Human Interaction (HHI) data presents a scalable alternative, we first demonstrate that standard retargeting fails by breaking the essential contacts. We address this with PAIR (Physics-Aware Interaction Retargeting), a contact-centric, two-stage pipeline that preserves contact semantics across morphology differences to generate physically consistent HHoI data. This high-quality data, however, exposes a second failure: conventional imitation learning policies merely mimic trajectories and lack interactive understanding. We therefore introduce D-STAR (Decoupled Spatio-Temporal Action Reasoner), a hierarchical policy that disentangles when to act from where to act. In D-STAR, Phase Attention (when) and a Multi-Scale Spatial module (where) are fused by the diffusion head to produce synchronized whole-body behaviors beyond mimicry. By decoupling these reasoning streams, our model learns robust temporal phases without being distracted by spatial noise, leading to responsive, synchronized collaboration. We validate our framework through extensive and rigorous simulations, demonstrating significant performance gains over baseline approaches and a complete, effective pipeline for learning complex whole-body interactions from HHI data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous robot navigation and environmental perception in complex environments require enhanced SLAM technology that goes beyond geometric accuracy to include semantic understanding, particularly for applications like disaster assessment and industrial preventive maintenance where temperature information is critical.

Method: The method performs pixel-level fusion of visible and infrared images, projects real-time LiDAR point clouds onto this fused image stream, segments heat source features in the thermal channel to identify high temperature targets, and applies temperature information as a semantic layer on the final 3D map.

Result: The approach generates 3D maps that have both accurate geometry and critical semantic understanding of the environment through temperature information, enabling identification of high temperature targets in real-time.

Conclusion: The thermal-semantic mapping method provides valuable capabilities for specific applications like rapid disaster assessment and industrial preventive maintenance by creating maps with both geometric accuracy and temperature-based semantic understanding.

Abstract: In complex environments, autonomous robot navigation and environmental perception pose higher requirements for SLAM technology. This paper presents a novel method for semantically enhancing 3D point cloud maps with thermal information. By first performing pixel-level fusion of visible and infrared images, the system projects real-time LiDAR point clouds onto this fused image stream. It then segments heat source features in the thermal channel to instantly identify high temperature targets and applies this temperature information as a semantic layer on the final 3D map. This approach generates maps that not only have accurate geometry but also possess a critical semantic understanding of the environment, making it highly valuable for specific applications like rapid disaster assessment and industrial preventive maintenance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs in education tend to reveal solutions rather than support dialogic learning, lacking core pedagogical dimensions needed for effective tutoring.

Method: Created ConvoLearn dataset with 1250 tutor-student dialogues grounded in knowledge building theory, covering six pedagogical dimensions. Fine-tuned Mistral 7B using QLoRA on this semi-synthetic dataset.

Result: Fine-tuned Mistral 7B (M=4.10) significantly outperformed base Mistral 7B (M=2.59) and Claude Sonnet 4.5 (M=2.87) in evaluations by 31 teachers.

Conclusion: The work establishes a framework for developing constructivist AI tutors that move beyond solution-revealing to support knowledge-building dialogic learning.

Abstract: In educational applications, LLMs exhibit several fundamental pedagogical limitations, such as their tendency to reveal solutions rather than support dialogic learning. We introduce ConvoLearn (https://huggingface.co/datasets/masharma/convolearn ), a dataset grounded in knowledge building theory that operationalizes six core pedagogical dimensions: cognitive engagement, formative assessment, accountability, cultural responsiveness, metacognition, and power dynamics. We construct a semi-synthetic dataset of 1250 tutor-student dialogues (20 turns each) in middle school Earth Science through controlled interactions between human teachers and a simulated student. Using QLoRA, we demonstrate that training on this dataset meaningfully shifts LLM behavior toward knowledge-building strategies. Human evaluation by 31 teachers shows our fine-tuned Mistral 7B (M = 4.10, SD = 1.03) significantly outperforms both its base version (M = 2.59, SD = 1.11) and Claude Sonnet 4.5 (M = 2.87, SD = 1.29) overall.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks inadequately assess medical AI agents' ability to perform safe, multi-step reasoning over structured EHR data for clinical decision support, particularly for action-based tasks involving threshold evaluation, temporal aggregation, and conditional logic.

Method: Developed ART benchmark using a four-stage pipeline: (1) scenario identification from real EHR data, (2) task generation targeting reasoning weaknesses, (3) quality audit, and (4) evaluation. Evaluated GPT-4o-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet on 600 clinically validated tasks.

Result: Models showed near-perfect retrieval after prompt refinement, but substantial performance gaps: 28-64% errors in aggregation tasks and 32-38% errors in threshold reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: ART exposes critical failure modes in action-oriented EHR reasoning, advancing toward more reliable clinical AI agents that can reduce cognitive load and administrative burden in high-demand care settings.

Abstract: Reliable clinical decision support requires medical AI agents capable of safe, multi-step reasoning over structured electronic health records (EHRs). While large language models (LLMs) show promise in healthcare, existing benchmarks inadequately assess performance on action-based tasks involving threshold evaluation, temporal aggregation, and conditional logic. We introduce ART, an Action-based Reasoning clinical Task benchmark for medical AI agents, which mines real-world EHR data to create challenging tasks targeting known reasoning weaknesses. Through analysis of existing benchmarks, we identify three dominant error categories: retrieval failures, aggregation errors, and conditional logic misjudgments. Our four-stage pipeline -- scenario identification, task generation, quality audit, and evaluation -- produces diverse, clinically validated tasks grounded in real patient data. Evaluating GPT-4o-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet on 600 tasks shows near-perfect retrieval after prompt refinement, but substantial gaps in aggregation (28--64%) and threshold reasoning (32--38%). By exposing failure modes in action-oriented EHR reasoning, ART advances toward more reliable clinical agents, an essential step for AI systems that reduce cognitive load and administrative burden, supporting workforce capacity in high-demand care settings

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLM-based agents shift from single-turn response assessment to multi-step task completion in interactive environments, there's a need to evaluate frontier AI models on realistic workplace tasks to understand their capabilities and limitations for real-world deployment.

Method: Empirical study evaluating frontier AI models on 150 workplace tasks within a realistic e-commerce RL environment from Surge, using task-centric design methodology emphasizing diversity and domain expert contributions.

Result: Revealed empirically-derived hierarchy of agentic capabilities: tool use, planning/goal formation, adaptability, groundedness, and common-sense reasoning. Best-performing models fail ~40% of tasks, with failures clustering predictably along this hierarchy. Weaker models struggle with tool use and planning, while stronger models fail on contextual inference tasks.

Conclusion: Current frontier models demonstrate coherent multi-step behavior but have substantial capability gaps before achieving human-level task completion in realistic workplace settings, highlighting the need for continued development in agentic capabilities.

Abstract: The advancement of large language model (LLM) based agents has shifted AI evaluation from single-turn response assessment to multi-step task completion in interactive environments. We present an empirical study evaluating frontier AI models on 150 workplace tasks within a realistic e-commerce RL environment from Surge. Our analysis reveals an empirically-derived \emph{hierarchy of agentic capabilities} that models must master for real-world deployment: (1) tool use, (2) planning and goal formation, (3) adaptability, (4) groundedness, and (5) common-sense reasoning. Even the best-performing models fail approximately 40\% of the tasks, with failures clustering predictably along this hierarchy. Weaker models struggle with fundamental tool use and planning, whereas stronger models primarily fail on tasks requiring contextual inference beyond explicit instructions. We introduce a task-centric design methodology for RL environments that emphasizes diversity and domain expert contributions, provide detailed failure analysis, and discuss implications for agent development. Our findings suggest that while current frontier models can demonstrate coherent multi-step behavior, substantial capability gaps remain before achieving human-level task completion in realistic workplace settings.

TL;DR: HACHI is a human-in-the-loop framework that uses AI agents to accelerate development of interpretable clinical prediction models by exploring concepts in clinical notes, with experts providing iterative feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional clinical prediction model development requires intensive collaboration between clinical experts, data scientists, and informaticists, making the process time-consuming and resource-intensive. This challenge worsens when incorporating unstructured clinical notes containing numerous concepts, resulting in few models reaching clinical practice.

Method: HACHI alternates between: (1) AI agents rapidly exploring and evaluating candidate concepts in clinical notes, and (2) clinical/domain experts providing feedback to improve the learning process. Concepts are defined as simple yes-no questions used in linear models for transparent review and validation.

Result: In acute kidney injury and traumatic brain injury prediction tasks, HACHI outperforms existing approaches, surfaces new clinically relevant concepts not in commonly-used models, and improves model generalizability across clinical sites and time periods.

Conclusion: HACHI demonstrates the critical role of clinical AI teams in directing AI agents, adjusting concept granularity, aligning objectives with clinical goals, and identifying data bias issues, enabling faster development of interpretable clinical prediction models.

Abstract: Developing safe, effective, and practically useful clinical prediction models (CPMs) traditionally requires iterative collaboration between clinical experts, data scientists, and informaticists. This process refines the often small but critical details of the model building process, such as which features/patients to include and how clinical categories should be defined. However, this traditional collaboration process is extremely time- and resource-intensive, resulting in only a small fraction of CPMs reaching clinical practice. This challenge intensifies when teams attempt to incorporate unstructured clinical notes, which can contain an enormous number of concepts. To address this challenge, we introduce HACHI, an iterative human-in-the-loop framework that uses AI agents to accelerate the development of fully interpretable CPMs by enabling the exploration of concepts in clinical notes. HACHI alternates between (i) an AI agent rapidly exploring and evaluating candidate concepts in clinical notes and (ii) clinical and domain experts providing feedback to improve the CPM learning process. HACHI defines concepts as simple yes-no questions that are used in linear models, allowing the clinical AI team to transparently review, refine, and validate the CPM learned in each round. In two real-world prediction tasks (acute kidney injury and traumatic brain injury), HACHI outperforms existing approaches, surfaces new clinically relevant concepts not included in commonly-used CPMs, and improves model generalizability across clinical sites and time periods. Furthermore, HACHI reveals the critical role of the clinical AI team, such as directing the AI agent to explore concepts that it had not previously considered, adjusting the granularity of concepts it considers, changing the objective function to better align with the clinical objectives, and identifying issues of data bias and leakage.

*Derrick Goh Xin Deik,Quanyu Long,Zhengyuan Liu,Nancy F. Chen,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SCOPE is a framework that separates reasoning from code execution for multi-constraint planning, achieving state-of-the-art performance with lower cost and latency compared to existing LLM approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM approaches for multi-constraint planning have fundamental limitations: pure reasoning methods suffer from inconsistency and error accumulation, while coding/solver-based approaches lack flexibility and generalizability across diverse problems.

Method: SCOPE (Scalable COde Planning Engine) disentangles query-specific reasoning from generic code execution, producing solver functions that are consistent, deterministic, and reusable across queries with minimal parameter changes.

Result: SCOPE achieves 93.1% success on TravelPlanner (61.6% gain over best baseline), while reducing inference cost by 1.4x and time by ~4.67x using GPT-4o.

Conclusion: Separating reasoning from execution enables consistent, deterministic, and reusable solver functions that outperform existing approaches while being more cost-effective and faster.

Abstract: Multi-constraint planning involves identifying, evaluating, and refining candidate plans while satisfying multiple, potentially conflicting constraints. Existing large language model (LLM) approaches face fundamental limitations in this domain. Pure reasoning paradigms, which rely on long natural language chains, are prone to inconsistency, error accumulation, and prohibitive cost as constraints compound. Conversely, LLMs combined with coding- or solver-based strategies lack flexibility: they often generate problem-specific code from scratch or depend on fixed solvers, failing to capture generalizable logic across diverse problems. To address these challenges, we introduce the Scalable COde Planning Engine (SCOPE), a framework that disentangles query-specific reasoning from generic code execution. By separating reasoning from execution, SCOPE produces solver functions that are consistent, deterministic, and reusable across queries while requiring only minimal changes to input parameters. SCOPE achieves state-of-the-art performance while lowering cost and latency. For example, with GPT-4o, it reaches 93.1% success on TravelPlanner, a 61.6% gain over the best baseline (CoT) while cutting inference cost by 1.4x and time by ~4.67x.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional production scheduling approaches struggle with dynamic disruptions (processing time variations, machine availability changes, unexpected tasks) due to reliance on event-specific models and explicit analytical formulations, limiting adaptability to unseen disturbances.

Method: Proposes DScheLLM with unified LLM framework for dynamic events, using fine-tuned Huawei OpenPangu Embedded-7B model with LoRA. Training datasets generated from exact schedules via operations research solver. Implements dual-system reasoning: fast-thinking for quick schedules, slow-thinking for solver-compatible decision inputs.

Result: Experimental evaluations on standard job shop scheduling benchmarks show fast-thinking mode efficiently generates high-quality schedules, while slow-thinking mode produces solver-compatible and well-formatted decision inputs.

Conclusion: One of the earliest studies applying LLMs to dynamic job shop scheduling, demonstrating significant potential for intelligent and adaptive scheduling optimization in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Production scheduling is highly susceptible to dynamic disruptions, such as variations in processing times, machine availability, and unexpected task insertions. Conventional approaches typically rely on event-specific models and explicit analytical formulations, which limits their adaptability and generalization across previously unseen disturbances. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes DScheLLM, a dynamic scheduling approach that leverages fine-tuned large language models within a dual-system (fast-slow) reasoning architecture to address disturbances of different scales. A unified large language model-based framework is constructed to handle dynamic events, where training datasets for both fast and slow reasoning modes are generated using exact schedules obtained from an operations research solver. The Huawei OpenPangu Embedded-7B model is subsequently fine-tuned under the hybrid reasoning paradigms using LoRA. Experimental evaluations on standard job shop scheduling benchmarks demonstrate that the fast-thinking mode can efficiently generate high-quality schedules and the slow-thinking mode can produce solver-compatible and well-formatted decision inputs. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents one of the earliest studies applying large language models to job shop scheduling in dynamic environments, highlighting their considerable potential for intelligent and adaptive scheduling optimization.

TL;DR: Survey paper on memory mechanisms in LLMs and multi-modal LLMs, categorizing approaches into implicit, explicit, and agentic memory paradigms with discussion of architectural advances and challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory is crucial for enhancing reasoning, adaptability, and contextual fidelity in LLMs as they evolve from static predictors to interactive systems capable of continual learning and personalized inference.

Method: Comprehensive survey organizing literature into taxonomy of three memory paradigms: implicit (knowledge in model parameters), explicit (external storage/retrieval), and agentic (persistent memory for autonomous agents).

Result: Structured synthesis of memory approaches across text and multi-modal settings, covering architectural advances, benchmark tasks, and integration challenges across vision, language, audio, and action modalities.

Conclusion: Memory mechanisms are central to LLM evolution, with open challenges including memory capacity, alignment, factual consistency, and cross-system interoperability that require further research.

Abstract: Memory plays a foundational role in augmenting the reasoning, adaptability, and contextual fidelity of modern Large Language Models and Multi-Modal LLMs. As these models transition from static predictors to interactive systems capable of continual learning and personalized inference, the incorporation of memory mechanisms has emerged as a central theme in their architectural and functional evolution. This survey presents a comprehensive and structured synthesis of memory in LLMs and MLLMs, organizing the literature into a cohesive taxonomy comprising implicit, explicit, and agentic memory paradigms. Specifically, the survey delineates three primary memory frameworks. Implicit memory refers to the knowledge embedded within the internal parameters of pre-trained transformers, encompassing their capacity for memorization, associative retrieval, and contextual reasoning. Recent work has explored methods to interpret, manipulate, and reconfigure this latent memory. Explicit memory involves external storage and retrieval components designed to augment model outputs with dynamic, queryable knowledge representations, such as textual corpora, dense vectors, and graph-based structures, thereby enabling scalable and updatable interaction with information sources. Agentic memory introduces persistent, temporally extended memory structures within autonomous agents, facilitating long-term planning, self-consistency, and collaborative behavior in multi-agent systems, with relevance to embodied and interactive AI. Extending beyond text, the survey examines the integration of memory within multi-modal settings, where coherence across vision, language, audio, and action modalities is essential. Key architectural advances, benchmark tasks, and open challenges are discussed, including issues related to memory capacity, alignment, factual consistency, and cross-system interoperability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond population-level sentiment analysis and enable simulation of user-specific privacy reasoning, capturing how individual users form privacy concerns based on their personal histories and contextual factors.

Method: PRA reconstructs each user's "privacy mind," uses a contextual filter to activate relevant privacy memory (emulating bounded rationality), generates synthetic comments reflecting likely responses to new privacy scenarios, and employs an LLM-as-a-Judge evaluator calibrated against an established privacy concern taxonomy.

Result: PRA outperforms baseline agents in privacy concern prediction on real-world Hacker News discussions and captures transferable reasoning patterns across domains including AI, e-commerce, and healthcare.

Conclusion: The PRA framework successfully simulates individual privacy concern formation, demonstrating the value of integrating privacy theories with personal histories for more accurate and transferable privacy reasoning simulations.

Abstract: This paper introduces PRA, an AI-agent design for simulating how individual users form privacy concerns in response to real-world news. Moving beyond population-level sentiment analysis, PRA integrates privacy and cognitive theories to simulate user-specific privacy reasoning grounded in personal comment histories and contextual cues. The agent reconstructs each user's "privacy mind", dynamically activates relevant privacy memory through a contextual filter that emulates bounded rationality, and generates synthetic comments reflecting how that user would likely respond to new privacy scenarios. A complementary LLM-as-a-Judge evaluator, calibrated against an established privacy concern taxonomy, quantifies the faithfulness of generated reasoning. Experiments on real-world Hacker News discussions show that \PRA outperforms baseline agents in privacy concern prediction and captures transferable reasoning patterns across domains including AI, e-commerce, and healthcare.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAXS is a meta-adaptive reasoning framework for LLM agents that uses lookahead planning and trajectory convergence to improve multi-tool reasoning while balancing computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agent methods suffer from locally myopic generation (no lookahead) and trajectory instability (minor early errors escalate), making it difficult to balance global effectiveness and computational efficiency.

Method: MAXS employs lookahead strategy to extend reasoning paths, estimates advantage values of tool usage, uses step consistency variance and inter-step trend slopes to select stable reasoning steps, and introduces trajectory convergence mechanism to control computational cost.

Result: Extensive empirical studies across three base models (MiMo-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-32B) and five datasets show MAXS consistently outperforms existing methods in both performance and inference efficiency.

Conclusion: MAXS effectively addresses myopic generation and trajectory instability in LLM agents through meta-adaptive exploration, balancing resource efficiency and global effectiveness in multi-tool reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) Agents exhibit inherent reasoning abilities through the collaboration of multiple tools. However, during agent inference, existing methods often suffer from (i) locally myopic generation, due to the absence of lookahead, and (ii) trajectory instability, where minor early errors can escalate into divergent reasoning paths. These issues make it difficult to balance global effectiveness and computational efficiency. To address these two issues, we propose meta-adaptive exploration with LLM agents https://github.com/exoskeletonzj/MAXS, a meta-adaptive reasoning framework based on LLM Agents that flexibly integrates tool execution and reasoning planning. MAXS employs a lookahead strategy to extend reasoning paths a few steps ahead, estimating the advantage value of tool usage, and combines step consistency variance and inter-step trend slopes to jointly select stable, consistent, and high-value reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce a trajectory convergence mechanism that controls computational cost by halting further rollouts once path consistency is achieved, enabling a balance between resource efficiency and global effectiveness in multi-tool reasoning. We conduct extensive empirical studies across three base models (MiMo-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-32B) and five datasets, demonstrating that MAXS consistently outperforms existing methods in both performance and inference efficiency. Further analysis confirms the effectiveness of our lookahead strategy and tool usage.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoT-Flow is a framework that treats reasoning steps as continuous probabilistic flow to quantify step-wise information gain, enabling flow-guided decoding for efficiency and flow-based RL for optimization without external verifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current chain-of-thought paradigms treat reasoning as indivisible sequences without quantifying step-wise information gain, leading to inference inefficiency from redundant exploration and optimization difficulty due to sparse supervision or costly external verifiers.

Method: CoT-Flow reconceptualizes discrete reasoning steps as continuous probabilistic flow to quantify each step's contribution toward the ground-truth answer. This enables two complementary methodologies: flow-guided decoding (greedy flow-based decoding for efficient reasoning paths) and flow-based reinforcement learning (verifier-free dense reward function).

Result: Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that CoT-Flow achieves a superior balance between inference efficiency and reasoning performance.

Conclusion: CoT-Flow provides a principled framework for quantifying step-wise information gain in reasoning processes, addressing both inference efficiency and optimization challenges in chain-of-thought reasoning.

Abstract: High-quality chain-of-thought has demonstrated strong potential for unlocking the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, current paradigms typically treat the reasoning process as an indivisible sequence, lacking an intrinsic mechanism to quantify step-wise information gain. This granularity gap manifests in two limitations: inference inefficiency from redundant exploration without explicit guidance, and optimization difficulty due to sparse outcome supervision or costly external verifiers. In this work, we propose CoT-Flow, a framework that reconceptualizes discrete reasoning steps as a continuous probabilistic flow, quantifying the contribution of each step toward the ground-truth answer. Built on this formulation, CoT-Flow enables two complementary methodologies: flow-guided decoding, which employs a greedy flow-based decoding strategy to extract information-efficient reasoning paths, and flow-based reinforcement learning, which constructs a verifier-free dense reward function. Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that CoT-Flow achieves a superior balance between inference efficiency and reasoning performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human pandemic responses are often fragmented and reactive, with policies made in isolation and adjusted only after outbreaks escalate, undermining proactive intervention and global mitigation.

Method: Assign LLM agents to each administrative region as AI policymaking assistants; agents reason over region-specific epidemiological dynamics while communicating with other agents to account for cross-regional interdependencies; integrate real-world data, pandemic simulator, and structured inter-agent communication for joint exploration of counterfactual scenarios.

Result: Framework reduces cumulative infections by up to 63.7% and deaths by 40.1% at individual state level, and by 39.0% and 27.0% when aggregated across states, using US COVID-19 data from April-December 2020.

Conclusion: LLM multi-agent systems can enable more effective pandemic control through coordinated policymaking, demonstrating significant improvements over real-world fragmented responses.

Abstract: Effective pandemic control requires timely and coordinated policymaking across administrative regions that are intrinsically interdependent. However, human-driven responses are often fragmented and reactive, with policies formulated in isolation and adjusted only after outbreaks escalate, undermining proactive intervention and global pandemic mitigation. To address this challenge, here we propose a large language model (LLM) multi-agent policymaking framework that supports coordinated and proactive pandemic control across regions. Within our framework, each administrative region is assigned an LLM agent as an AI policymaking assistant. The agent reasons over region-specific epidemiological dynamics while communicating with other agents to account for cross-regional interdependencies. By integrating real-world data, a pandemic evolution simulator, and structured inter-agent communication, our framework enables agents to jointly explore counterfactual intervention scenarios and synthesize coordinated policy decisions through a closed-loop simulation process. We validate the proposed framework using state-level COVID-19 data from the United States between April and December 2020, together with real-world mobility records and observed policy interventions. Compared with real-world pandemic outcomes, our approach reduces cumulative infections and deaths by up to 63.7% and 40.1%, respectively, at the individual state level, and by 39.0% and 27.0%, respectively, when aggregated across states. These results demonstrate that LLM multi-agent systems can enable more effective pandemic control with coordinated policymaking...

TL;DR: RISER is a plug-and-play framework that uses a lightweight Router to dynamically compose reusable reasoning vectors for adaptive activation steering in LLMs, achieving significant accuracy gains with high token efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing activation steering methods use static, manual interventions that don't adapt to the dynamic nature of complex reasoning, while training-intensive approaches require parameter updates. There's a need for parameter-efficient, adaptive steering methods.

Method: RISER constructs a library of reusable reasoning vectors and employs a lightweight Router optimized via reinforcement learning under task-level rewards to dynamically compose these vectors for each input, activating latent cognitive primitives compositionally.

Result: Across seven diverse benchmarks, RISER yields 3.4-6.5% average zero-shot accuracy improvements over base models, surpasses CoT-style reasoning with 2-3x higher token efficiency, and shows robust accuracy gains. The framework autonomously combines vectors into interpretable control strategies.

Conclusion: RISER demonstrates that adaptive, compositional activation steering enables more controllable and efficient LLM reasoning without parameter updates, pointing toward emergent cognitive primitives that can be dynamically combined for complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Recent work on domain-specific reasoning with large language models (LLMs) often relies on training-intensive approaches that require parameter updates. While activation steering has emerged as a parameter efficient alternative, existing methods apply static, manual interventions that fail to adapt to the dynamic nature of complex reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose RISER (Router-based Intervention for Steerable Enhancement of Reasoning), a plug-and-play intervention framework that adaptively steers LLM reasoning in activation space. RISER constructs a library of reusable reasoning vectors and employs a lightweight Router to dynamically compose them for each input. The Router is optimized via reinforcement learning under task-level rewards, activating latent cognitive primitives in an emergent and compositional manner. Across seven diverse benchmarks, RISER yields 3.4-6.5% average zero-shot accuracy improvements over the base model while surpassing CoT-style reasoning with 2-3x higher token efficiency and robust accuracy gains. Further analysis shows that RISER autonomously combines multiple vectors into interpretable, precise control strategies, pointing toward more controllable and efficient LLM reasoning.

Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on final answers or step-by-step coherence but overlook memory-driven mechanisms underlying human reasoning, which involves activating anchors and attractors to enhance reasoning consistency and stability.

Method: Created A³-Bench with 2,198 annotated science problems using SAPM process (subject, anchor & attractor, problem, memory developing). Introduced dual-scale memory evaluation framework using anchors and attractors with AAUI metric to measure memory activation rates.

Result: Validated A³-Bench through experiments with various base models and paradigms, analyzing how memory activation impacts reasoning performance and providing insights into memory-driven scientific reasoning.

Conclusion: A³-Bench addresses the gap in evaluating memory-driven scientific reasoning mechanisms and provides a framework for understanding how memory activation influences reasoning performance across different domains.

Abstract: Scientific reasoning relies not only on logical inference but also on activating prior knowledge and experiential structures. Memory can efficiently reuse knowledge and enhance reasoning consistency and stability. However, existing benchmarks mainly evaluate final answers or step-by-step coherence, overlooking the \textit{memory-driven} mechanisms that underlie human reasoning, which involves activating anchors and attractors, then integrating them into multi-step inference. To address this gap, we propose $A^3$-Bench~ https://a3-bench.github.io, a benchmark designed to evaluate scientific reasoning through dual-scale memory-driven activation, grounded in Anchor and Attractor Activation. First, we annotate 2,198 science reasoning problems across domains using the SAPM process(subject, anchor & attractor, problem, and memory developing). Second, we introduce a dual-scale memory evaluation framework utilizing anchors and attractors, along with the AAUI(Anchor--Attractor Utilization Index) metric to measure memory activation rates. Finally, through experiments with various base models and paradigms, we validate $A^3$-Bench and analyze how memory activation impacts reasoning performance, providing insights into memory-driven scientific reasoning.

Motivation: Existing DeepResearch-style agents are limited to text modality, while extending to multimodal settings faces challenges: specialization-generalization trade-off in training multimodal tool-use models at scale, and severe scarcity of training data for complex multimodal search trajectories.

Method: Proposes M³Searcher, a modular multimodal agent that explicitly decouples information acquisition from answer derivation. Uses retrieval-oriented multi-objective reward optimizing for factual accuracy, reasoning soundness, and retrieval fidelity.

Conclusion: The proposed modular approach with explicit decoupling of information acquisition and answer derivation, combined with retrieval-oriented multi-objective optimization and specialized training data, effectively addresses challenges in multimodal information-seeking agents.

Abstract: Recent advances in DeepResearch-style agents have demonstrated strong capabilities in autonomous information acquisition and synthesize from real-world web environments. However, existing approaches remain fundamentally limited to text modality. Extending autonomous information-seeking agents to multimodal settings introduces critical challenges: the specialization-generalization trade-off that emerges when training models for multimodal tool-use at scale, and the severe scarcity of training data capturing complex, multi-step multimodal search trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose M$^3$Searcher, a modular multimodal information-seeking agent that explicitly decouples information acquisition from answer derivation. M$^3$Searcher is optimized with a retrieval-oriented multi-objective reward that jointly encourages factual accuracy, reasoning soundness, and retrieval fidelity. In addition, we develop MMSearchVQA, a multimodal multi-hop dataset to support retrieval centric RL training. Experimental results demonstrate that M$^3$Searcher outperforms existing approaches, exhibits strong transfer adaptability and effective reasoning in complex multimodal tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STaR is a parameter-free inference-time unlearning framework that protects privacy throughout LRM reasoning chains by detecting sensitive content, injecting safety constraints, suppressing sensitive trajectories, and filtering tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models generate complex Chain-of-Thought trajectories that embed sensitive information throughout intermediate steps, creating severe privacy risks that existing LLM unlearning approaches fail to address.

Method: Four-step framework: 1) semantic-aware sensitive content detection, 2) global safety constraint injection via secure prompt prefix, 3) trajectory-aware suppression to block sensitive content across reasoning chains, 4) token-level adaptive filtering to prevent exact and paraphrased sensitive tokens.

Result: Experiments on R-TOFU benchmark show STaR achieves comprehensive and stable unlearning with minimal utility loss, outperforming existing approaches that only modify final answers.

Conclusion: STaR sets a new standard for privacy-preserving reasoning in LRMs by providing robust protection throughout the reasoning process while introducing novel evaluation metrics for better assessment of unlearning effectiveness.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have advanced automated multi-step reasoning, but their ability to generate complex Chain-of-Thought (CoT) trajectories introduces severe privacy risks, as sensitive information may be deeply embedded throughout the reasoning process. Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) unlearning approaches that typically focus on modifying only final answers are insufficient for LRMs, as they fail to remove sensitive content from intermediate steps, leading to persistent privacy leakage and degraded security. To address these challenges, we propose Sensitive Trajectory Regulation (STaR), a parameter-free, inference-time unlearning framework that achieves robust privacy protection throughout the reasoning process. Specifically, we first identify sensitive content via semantic-aware detection. Then, we inject global safety constraints through secure prompt prefix. Next, we perform trajectory-aware suppression to dynamically block sensitive content across the entire reasoning chain. Finally, we apply token-level adaptive filtering to prevent both exact and paraphrased sensitive tokens during generation. Furthermore, to overcome the inadequacies of existing evaluation protocols, we introduce two metrics: Multi-Decoding Consistency Assessment (MCS), which measures the consistency of unlearning across diverse decoding strategies, and Multi-Granularity Membership Inference Attack (MIA) Evaluation, which quantifies privacy protection at both answer and reasoning-chain levels. Experiments on the R-TOFU benchmark demonstrate that STaR achieves comprehensive and stable unlearning with minimal utility loss, setting a new standard for privacy-preserving reasoning in LRMs.

Motivation: Cluster workload allocation requires complex configurations, creating a usability gap that needs to be addressed through more accessible scheduling approaches.

Method: Developed a semantic, intent-driven scheduling system using LLMs integrated via Kubernetes scheduler extender, with cluster state cache and intent analyzer (AWS Bedrock) to interpret natural language allocation hints.

Result: High LLM parsing accuracy (>95% Subset Accuracy), superior performance of Amazon Nova Pro/Premier and Mistral Pixtral Large over baseline, and better placement in complex/quantitative scenarios with conflicting soft preferences.

Conclusion: LLMs enable accessible semantic scheduling for soft affinity, but synchronous latency limitations suggest need for asynchronous processing for production readiness.

Abstract: Cluster workload allocation often requires complex configurations, creating a usability gap. This paper introduces a semantic, intent-driven scheduling paradigm for cluster systems using Natural Language Processing. The system employs a Large Language Model (LLM) integrated via a Kubernetes scheduler extender to interpret natural language allocation hint annotations for soft affinity preferences. A prototype featuring a cluster state cache and an intent analyzer (using AWS Bedrock) was developed. Empirical evaluation demonstrated high LLM parsing accuracy (>95% Subset Accuracy on an evaluation ground-truth dataset) for top-tier models like Amazon Nova Pro/Premier and Mistral Pixtral Large, significantly outperforming a baseline engine. Scheduling quality tests across six scenarios showed the prototype achieved superior or equivalent placement compared to standard Kubernetes configurations, particularly excelling in complex and quantitative scenarios and handling conflicting soft preferences. The results validate using LLMs for accessible scheduling but highlight limitations like synchronous LLM latency, suggesting asynchronous processing for production readiness. This work confirms the viability of semantic soft affinity for simplifying workload orchestration.

TL;DR: Novel framework combining Coloured Timed Petri Nets and Maskable PPO for dynamic job shop scheduling under uncertainty with stochastic job arrivals and machine failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of dynamic job shop scheduling under uncertainty from stochastic job arrivals and unexpected machine breakdowns in real-world manufacturing scenarios.

Method: Model-based approach using Coloured Timed Petri Nets for environment representation and Maskable Proximal Policy Optimization for dynamic decision-making with action masking. Stochastic job arrivals modeled with Gamma distribution, machine failures with Weibull distribution. Two action-masking strategies: non-gradient probability overriding and gradient-based negative gradient assignment.

Result: Method consistently outperforms traditional heuristic and rule-based approaches in makespan minimization on dynamic JSSP benchmarks.

Conclusion: Combining interpretable Petri-net-based models with adaptive reinforcement learning yields a resilient, scalable, and explainable framework for real-time scheduling in dynamic and uncertain manufacturing environments.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for solving Dynamic Job Shop Scheduling Problems under uncertainty, addressing the challenges introduced by stochastic job arrivals and unexpected machine breakdowns. Our approach follows a model-based paradigm, using Coloured Timed Petri Nets to represent the scheduling environment, and Maskable Proximal Policy Optimization to enable dynamic decision-making while restricting the agent to feasible actions at each decision point. To simulate realistic industrial conditions, dynamic job arrivals are modeled using a Gamma distribution, which captures complex temporal patterns such as bursts, clustering, and fluctuating workloads. Machine failures are modeled using a Weibull distribution to represent age-dependent degradation and wear-out dynamics. These stochastic models enable the framework to reflect real-world manufacturing scenarios better. In addition, we study two action-masking strategies: a non-gradient approach that overrides the probabilities of invalid actions, and a gradient-based approach that assigns negative gradients to invalid actions within the policy network. We conduct extensive experiments on dynamic JSSP benchmarks, demonstrating that our method consistently outperforms traditional heuristic and rule-based approaches in terms of makespan minimization. The results highlight the strength of combining interpretable Petri-net-based models with adaptive reinforcement learning policies, yielding a resilient, scalable, and explainable framework for real-time scheduling in dynamic and uncertain manufacturing environments.

TL;DR: NN-guided MCTS planning for autonomous driving in lane-free traffic improves safety and efficiency while balancing computational constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lane-free traffic environments offer higher capacity but create more challenging autonomous driving scenarios requiring advanced planning approaches.

Method: Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planning with a pre-trained neural network for guidance, formulated as a Markov Decision Process for single-agent autonomous driving in lane-free traffic.

Result: The approach demonstrates: (a) isotropic state information leads to nudging behavior, (b) NN guidance accelerates MCTS performance, and (c) effective trade-off between computational resources and solution quality.

Conclusion: NN-guided MCTS is effective for autonomous driving in lane-free environments, balancing safety, efficiency, and computational constraints while leveraging isotropic information for improved vehicle interactions.

Abstract: Lane-free traffic environments allow vehicles to better harness the lateral capacity of the road without being restricted to lane-keeping, thereby increasing the traffic flow rates. As such, we have a distinct and more challenging setting for autonomous driving. In this work, we consider a Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planning approach for single-agent autonomous driving in lane-free traffic, where the associated Markov Decision Process we formulate is influenced from existing approaches tied to reinforcement learning frameworks. In addition, MCTS is equipped with a pre-trained neural network (NN) that guides the selection phase. This procedure incorporates the predictive capabilities of NNs for a more informed tree search process under computational constraints. In our experimental evaluation, we consider metrics that address both safety (through collision rates) and efficacy (through measured speed). Then, we examine: (a) the influence of isotropic state information for vehicles in a lane-free environment, resulting in nudging behaviour--vehicles' policy reacts due to the presence of faster tailing ones, (b) the acceleration of performance for the NN-guided variant of MCTS, and (c) the trade-off between computational resources and solution quality.

TL;DR: Proactive task-oriented agents that monitor dynamic environments and trigger follow-ups based on user intent, with new benchmark and synthetic data pipeline achieving 85.19% task completion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents are reactive and short-term focused, unable to maintain long-term user intents or adapt to evolving environments, creating a gap between static user needs and dynamic environments.

Method: Proposed proactive paradigm with two capabilities: Intent-Conditioned Monitoring (autonomously formulating trigger conditions from dialog history) and Event-Triggered Follow-up (actively engaging users upon environmental updates). Created data synthesis pipeline for complex multi-turn dialogs in dynamic environments and introduced ChronosBench benchmark.

Result: Fine-tuned model using synthetic data achieved 85.19% task completion rate for complex tasks with intent shifts, outperforming other tested models. ChronosBench revealed flaws in existing models for long-term task-oriented interaction.

Conclusion: The proactive agent paradigm effectively bridges static user needs and dynamic environments, with data-driven strategy validated by superior performance. ChronosBench addresses evaluation gap for dynamic task-oriented interactions.

Abstract: Current large language model agents predominantly operate under a reactive paradigm, responding only to immediate user queries within short-term sessions. This limitation hinders their ability to maintain long-term user's intents and dynamically adapt to evolving external environments. In this paper, we propose a novel interaction paradigm for proactive Task-oriented Agents capable of bridging the gap between relatively static user's needs and a dynamic environment. We formalize proactivity through two key capabilities, (i) Intent-Conditioned Monitoring: The agent autonomously formulates trigger conditions based on dialog history; (ii) Event-Triggered Follow-up: The agent actively engages the user upon detecting useful environmental updates. We introduce a high-quality data synthesis pipeline to construct complex, multi-turn dialog data in a dynamic environment. Furthermore, we attempt to address the lack of evaluation criteria of task-oriented interaction in a dynamic environment by proposing a new benchmark, namely ChronosBench. We evaluated some leading close-source and open-source models at present and revealed their flaws in long-term task-oriented interaction. Furthermore, our fine-tuned model trained using synthetic data for supervised learning achieves a task completion rate of 85.19% for complex tasks including shifts in user intent, outperforming other models under test. And the result validated the effectiveness of our data-driven strategy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EvoFSM is a structured self-evolving framework that evolves Finite State Machines for LLM agents, achieving both adaptability and control by separating flow logic from skill behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based agents use fixed workflows that struggle with open-ended queries, while self-evolution approaches suffer from instability, hallucinations, and instruction drift due to unconstrained optimization.

Method: EvoFSM evolves explicit Finite State Machines by decoupling optimization into macroscopic Flow (state-transition logic) and microscopic Skill (state-specific behaviors). It uses a critic mechanism to refine FSMs through constrained operations and incorporates self-evolving memory that distills successful trajectories as priors and failure patterns as constraints.

Result: Extensive evaluations on five multi-hop QA benchmarks show effectiveness, with EvoFSM achieving 58.0% accuracy on the DeepSearch benchmark. Additional results on interactive decision-making tasks validate its generalization.

Conclusion: EvoFSM provides a structured approach to self-evolution that balances adaptability and control, addressing limitations of both fixed workflows and unconstrained optimization in LLM-based agents.

Abstract: While LLM-based agents have shown promise for deep research, most existing approaches rely on fixed workflows that struggle to adapt to real-world, open-ended queries. Recent work therefore explores self-evolution by allowing agents to rewrite their own code or prompts to improve problem-solving ability, but unconstrained optimization often triggers instability, hallucinations, and instruction drift. We propose EvoFSM, a structured self-evolving framework that achieves both adaptability and control by evolving an explicit Finite State Machine (FSM) instead of relying on free-form rewriting. EvoFSM decouples the optimization space into macroscopic Flow (state-transition logic) and microscopic Skill (state-specific behaviors), enabling targeted improvements under clear behavioral boundaries. Guided by a critic mechanism, EvoFSM refines the FSM through a small set of constrained operations, and further incorporates a self-evolving memory that distills successful trajectories as reusable priors and failure patterns as constraints for future queries. Extensive evaluations on five multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EvoFSM. In particular, EvoFSM reaches 58.0% accuracy on the DeepSearch benchmark. Additional results on interactive decision-making tasks further validate its generalization.

TL;DR: T2QBench introduces a new evaluation paradigm that separates task execution from world-state understanding, revealing that task success doesn't guarantee environment comprehension in LLM agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agent evaluations focus on task success metrics but fail to assess whether agents develop grounded, transferable models of their environments, creating a gap in understanding true agent generalization capabilities.

Method: Proposed Task-to-Quiz (T2Q) paradigm that decouples task execution from world-state understanding, instantiated in T2QBench with 30 environments and 1,967 grounded QA pairs across multiple difficulty levels.

Result: Task success is often a poor proxy for environment understanding, and current memory mechanisms fail to help agents acquire grounded environment models. Proactive exploration and fine-grained state representation are identified as primary bottlenecks.

Conclusion: The T2Q paradigm provides a robust foundation for developing more generalizable autonomous agents by addressing the gap between task execution and true environment understanding.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex decision-making and tool-use tasks, yet their ability to generalize across varying environments remains a under-examined concern. Current evaluation paradigms predominantly rely on trajectory-based metrics that measure task success, while failing to assess whether agents possess a grounded, transferable model of the environment. To address this gap, we propose Task-to-Quiz (T2Q), a deterministic and automated evaluation paradigm designed to decouple task execution from world-state understanding. We instantiate this paradigm in T2QBench, a suite comprising 30 environments and 1,967 grounded QA pairs across multiple difficulty levels. Our extensive experiments reveal that task success is often a poor proxy for environment understanding, and that current memory machanism can not effectively help agents acquire a grounded model of the environment. These findings identify proactive exploration and fine-grained state representation as primary bottlenecks, offering a robust foundation for developing more generalizable autonomous agents.

TL;DR: Omni-R1 introduces unified generative multimodal reasoning that generates intermediate images during reasoning, enabling diverse multimodal tasks through a two-stage SFT+RL framework with perception alignment and reward.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs either use pure text-based reasoning or single task-specific multimodal reasoning patterns, limiting generalizability across diverse multimodal tasks requiring different reasoning skills like region zooming or object marking.

Method: Proposes unified generative multimodal reasoning paradigm with Omni-R1 (two-stage SFT+RL framework with perception alignment loss and perception reward) and Omni-R1-Zero (bootstraps visualizations from text-only data without multimodal annotations).

Result: Omni-R1 achieves unified generative reasoning across wide range of multimodal tasks; Omni-R1-Zero matches or surpasses Omni-R1 on average, showing promise for generative multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: Unified generative multimodal reasoning with intermediate image generation enables diverse multimodal tasks, and bootstrapping from text-only data offers promising direction for scalable multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are making significant progress in multimodal reasoning. Early approaches focus on pure text-based reasoning. More recent studies have incorporated multimodal information into the reasoning steps; however, they often follow a single task-specific reasoning pattern, which limits their generalizability across various multimodal tasks. In fact, there are numerous multimodal tasks requiring diverse reasoning skills, such as zooming in on a specific region or marking an object within an image. To address this, we propose unified generative multimodal reasoning, which unifies diverse multimodal reasoning skills by generating intermediate images during the reasoning process. We instantiate this paradigm with Omni-R1, a two-stage SFT+RL framework featuring perception alignment loss and perception reward, thereby enabling functional image generation. Additionally, we introduce Omni-R1-Zero, which eliminates the need for multimodal annotations by bootstrapping step-wise visualizations from text-only reasoning data. Empirical results show that Omni-R1 achieves unified generative reasoning across a wide range of multimodal tasks, and Omni-R1-Zero can match or even surpass Omni-R1 on average, suggesting a promising direction for generative multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: LEAN-LLM-OPT is a lightweight agentic framework that uses LLM agents to automate large-scale optimization model formulation from problem descriptions and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building large-scale optimization models for business decision-making is labor-intensive and time-consuming, creating a need for automated formulation tools.

Method: Uses a team of LLM agents: two upstream agents dynamically construct step-by-step workflows for similar problems, and a downstream agent follows the workflow to generate final optimization formulations, decomposing tasks and offloading data handling to tools.

Result: Achieves strong performance on large-scale optimization tasks with GPT-4.1 and gpt-oss-20B, competitive with state-of-the-art approaches, and demonstrates practical value in Singapore Airlines revenue management use case with leading performance.

Conclusion: LEAN-LLM-OPT effectively automates optimization model formulation, introduces new benchmarks (Large-Scale-OR and Air-NRM), and shows practical business value while being open-sourced.

Abstract: Large-scale optimization is a key backbone of modern business decision-making. However, building these models is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. We address this by proposing LEAN-LLM-OPT, a LightwEight AgeNtic workflow construction framework for LLM-assisted large-scale OPTimization auto-formulation. LEAN-LLM-OPT takes as input a problem description together with associated datasets and orchestrates a team of LLM agents to produce an optimization formulation. Specifically, upon receiving a query, two upstream LLM agents dynamically construct a workflow that specifies, step-by-step, how optimization models for similar problems can be formulated. A downstream LLM agent then follows this workflow to generate the final output. Leveraging LLMs' text-processing capabilities and common modeling practices, the workflow decomposes the modeling task into a sequence of structured sub-tasks and offloads mechanical data-handling operations to auxiliary tools. This design alleviates the downstream agent's burden related to planning and data handling, allowing it to focus on the most challenging components that cannot be readily standardized. Extensive simulations show that LEAN-LLM-OPT, instantiated with GPT-4.1 and the open source gpt-oss-20B, achieves strong performance on large-scale optimization modeling tasks and is competitive with state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, in a Singapore Airlines choice-based revenue management use case, LEAN-LLM-OPT demonstrates practical value by achieving leading performance across a range of scenarios. Along the way, we introduce Large-Scale-OR and Air-NRM, the first comprehensive benchmarks for large-scale optimization auto-formulation.

TL;DR: PersonalAlign introduces hierarchical implicit intent alignment for GUI agents using long-term user records to resolve vague instructions and anticipate routines, with AndroidIntent benchmark showing HIM-Agent improves performance by 15.7% on execution and 7.3% on proactive tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world GUI agent deployment requires aligning with users' complex implicit intents rather than just explicit instructions, necessitating agents that can leverage long-term user records to understand omitted preferences and anticipate latent routines.

Method: Introduces Hierarchical Intent Memory Agent (HIM-Agent) that maintains continuously updating personal memory and hierarchically organizes user preferences and routines for personalization, evaluated on AndroidIntent benchmark with 775 preferences and 215 routines from 20k long-term records.

Result: HIM-Agent significantly improves both execution and proactive performance by 15.7% and 7.3% respectively compared to other GUI agents (GPT-5, Qwen3-VL, UI-TARS) on the AndroidIntent benchmark.

Conclusion: Hierarchical implicit intent alignment with long-term user records enables GUI agents to better understand vague instructions and provide proactive assistance, with HIM-Agent demonstrating substantial performance improvements over existing approaches.

Abstract: While GUI agents have shown strong performance under explicit and completion instructions, real-world deployment requires aligning with users' more complex implicit intents. In this work, we highlight Hierarchical Implicit Intent Alignment for Personalized GUI Agent (PersonalAlign), a new agent task that requires agents to leverage long-term user records as persistent context to resolve omitted preferences in vague instructions and anticipate latent routines by user state for proactive assistance. To facilitate this study, we introduce AndroidIntent, a benchmark designed to evaluate agents' ability in resolving vague instructions and providing proactive suggestions through reasoning over long-term user records. We annotated 775 user-specific preferences and 215 routines from 20k long-term records across different users for evaluation. Furthermore, we introduce Hierarchical Intent Memory Agent (HIM-Agent), which maintains a continuously updating personal memory and hierarchically organizes user preferences and routines for personalization. Finally, we evaluate a range of GUI agents on AndroidIntent, including GPT-5, Qwen3-VL, and UI-TARS, further results show that HIM-Agent significantly improves both execution and proactive performance by 15.7% and 7.3%.

TL;DR: MATTRL introduces test-time reinforcement learning for multi-agent systems, using structured textual experience injection during inference to improve decision-making without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent RL training is resource-intensive and unstable due to co-adaptation non-stationarity and sparse, high-variance rewards, creating a need for more efficient approaches.

Method: Forms multi-expert teams for discussions, retrieves/integrates test-time experiences, reaches consensus decisions, and studies credit assignment for turn-level experience pool construction and reinjection.

Result: Improves accuracy by 3.67% over multi-agent baselines and 8.67% over single-agent baselines across medicine, math, and education benchmarks.

Conclusion: MATTRL provides a stable, effective, and efficient path to distribution-shift-robust multi-agent reasoning without requiring model tuning.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems have evolved into practical LLM-driven collaborators for many applications, gaining robustness from diversity and cross-checking. However, multi-agent RL (MARL) training is resource-intensive and unstable: co-adapting teammates induce non-stationarity, and rewards are often sparse and high-variance. Therefore, we introduce \textbf{Multi-Agent Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (MATTRL)}, a framework that injects structured textual experience into multi-agent deliberation at inference time. MATTRL forms a multi-expert team of specialists for multi-turn discussions, retrieves and integrates test-time experiences, and reaches consensus for final decision-making. We also study credit assignment for constructing a turn-level experience pool, then reinjecting it into the dialogue. Across challenging benchmarks in medicine, math, and education, MATTRL improves accuracy by an average of 3.67\% over a multi-agent baseline, and by 8.67\% over comparable single-agent baselines. Ablation studies examine different credit-assignment schemes and provide a detailed comparison of how they affect training outcomes. MATTRL offers a stable, effective and efficient path to distribution-shift-robust multi-agent reasoning without tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern supply chains lack visibility beyond Tier-1 suppliers, leaving upstream vulnerabilities undetected until disruptions cascade downstream. Companies need to move from reactive recovery to proactive resilience by gaining visibility across extended supply networks.

Method: Minimally supervised agentic AI framework with seven specialized agents powered by large language models and deterministic tools. The system detects disruption signals from unstructured news, maps them to multi-tier supplier networks, evaluates exposure based on network structure, and recommends mitigations like alternative sourcing options.

Result: Evaluated across 30 synthesized scenarios covering three automotive manufacturers and five disruption classes. Achieved F1 scores between 0.962-0.991, performed full end-to-end analyses in mean 3.83 minutes at $0.0836 per disruption. This represents >3 orders of magnitude reduction in response time compared to multi-day analyst-driven assessments. Real-world case study of 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict demonstrated operational applicability.

Conclusion: Establishes foundational step toward building resilient, proactive, and autonomous supply chains capable of managing disruptions across deep-tier networks, moving from reactive recovery to proactive resilience.

Abstract: Modern supply chains are increasingly exposed to disruptions from geopolitical events, demand shocks, trade restrictions, to natural disasters. While many of these disruptions originate deep in the supply network, most companies still lack visibility beyond Tier-1 suppliers, leaving upstream vulnerabilities undetected until the impact cascades downstream. To overcome this blind-spot and move from reactive recovery to proactive resilience, we introduce a minimally supervised agentic AI framework that autonomously monitors, analyses, and responds to disruptions across extended supply networks. The architecture comprises seven specialised agents powered by large language models and deterministic tools that jointly detect disruption signals from unstructured news, map them to multi-tier supplier networks, evaluate exposure based on network structure, and recommend mitigations such as alternative sourcing options. \rev{We evaluate the framework across 30 synthesised scenarios covering three automotive manufacturers and five disruption classes. The system achieves high accuracy across core tasks, with F1 scores between 0.962 and 0.991, and performs full end-to-end analyses in a mean of 3.83 minutes at a cost of \$0.0836 per disruption. Relative to industry benchmarks of multi-day, analyst-driven assessments, this represents a reduction of more than three orders of magnitude in response time. A real-world case study of the 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict further demonstrates operational applicability. This work establishes a foundational step toward building resilient, proactive, and autonomous supply chains capable of managing disruptions across deep-tier networks.
