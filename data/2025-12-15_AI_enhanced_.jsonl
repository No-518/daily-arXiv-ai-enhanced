This gap prevents manipulation policies from operating within the distribution of their training demonstrations, resulting in frequent execution failures. We address this gap by introducing an object-centric imitation learning framework for last-meter navigation, enabling a quadruped mobile manipulator robot to achieve manipulation-ready positioning using only RGB observations from its onboard cameras. Our method conditions the navigation policy on three inputs: goal images, multi-view RGB observations from the onboard cameras, and a text prompt specifying the target object. A language-driven segmentation module and a spatial score-matrix decoder then supply explicit object grounding and relative pose reasoning. Using real-world data from a single object instance within a category, the system generalizes to unseen object instances across diverse environments with challenging lighting and background conditions. To comprehensively evaluate this, we introduce two metrics: an edge-alignment metric, which uses ground truth orientation, and an object-alignment metric, which evaluates how well the robot visually faces the target. Under these metrics, our policy achieves 73.47% success in edge-alignment and 96.94% success in object-alignment when positioning relative to unseen target objects. These results show that precise last-meter navigation can be achieved at a category-level without depth, LiDAR, or map priors, enabling a scalable pathway toward unified mobile manipulation.

It then performs adaptive MAS topology generation, guiding inter-agent communication via agent representation learning, gating, and latency-aware topology synthesis. Experiments on benchmarks with 14 candidate LLM backbones show that AgentBalance achieves up to 10% and 22% performance gains under matched token-cost and latency budgets, respectively, and yields strong AUC on performance-versus-budget curves across benchmarks. AgentBalance also functions as a plug-in for existing MAS, improving performance under the same token-cost and latency constraints, and it generalizes well to unseen LLMs for practical, budget-aware deployment.

Scenario-based testing is a prominent approach to addressing this challenge, as it involves the systematic simulation of objects and environments. Operational Design Domains (ODDs) are usually described using a taxonomy of qualitative designations for individual objects. However, the process of transitioning from taxonomy to concrete test cases remains unstructured, and completeness is theoretical. This paper introduces a structured method of subdividing the ODD into manageable sections, termed micro-ODDs (mODDs), and deriving test cases with abstract object representations. This concept is demonstrated using a one-dimensional, laterally guided manoeuvre involving a shunting locomotive within a constrained ODD. In this example, mODDs are defined and refined into narrow taxonomies that enable test case generation. Obstacles are represented as generic cubes of varying sizes, providing a simplified yet robust means of evaluating perception performance. A series of tests were conducted in a closed-loop, co-simulated virtual environment featuring photorealistic rendering and simulated LiDAR, GNSS and camera sensors. The results demonstrate how edge cases in obstacle detection can be systematically explored and how perception quality can be evaluated based on observed vehicle behaviour, using crash versus safe stop as the outcome metrics.

More concerningly, even a simple linear model with commonly used baselines contradicts itself by designating different optimal methods. A question then arises: which baseline should we use? We propose to study this problem through two desirable properties of a baseline: (i) that it removes information and (ii) that it does not produce overly out-of-distribution (OOD) images. We first show that none of the tested baselines satisfy both criteria, and there appears to be a trade-off among current baselines: either they remove information or they produce a sequence of OOD images.

In this paper, we propose a Lightweight 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) Compression method based on Video codec (LGSCV). First, a two-stage Morton scan is proposed to generate blockwise 2D maps that are friendly for canonical video codecs in which the coding units (CU) are square blocks. A 3D Morton scan is used to permute GS primitives, followed by a 2D Morton scan to map the ordered GS primitives to 2D maps in a blockwise style. However, although the blockwise 2D maps report close performance to the PLAS map in high-bitrate regions, they show a quality collapse at medium-to-low bitrates. Therefore, a principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of spherical harmonics (SH), and a MiniPLAS, which is flexible and fast, is designed to permute the primitives within certain block sizes. Incorporating SH PCA and MiniPLAS leads to a significant gain in rate-distortion (RD) performance, especially at medium and low bitrates. MiniPLAS can also guide the setting of the codec CU size configuration and significantly reduce encoding time. Experimental results on the MPEG dataset demonstrate that the proposed LGSCV achieves over 20% RD gain compared with state-of-the-art methods, while reducing 2D map generation time to approximately 1 second and cutting encoding time by 50%.

Many recent methods represent the world through images, and reduce forecasting to stochastic video generation. Although such methods excel at realism and visual fidelity, predicting pixels is computationally intensive and not directly useful in many applications, as it requires translating RGB into signals useful for decision making. An alternative approach uses features from vision foundation models (VFMs) as world representations, performing deterministic regression to predict future world states. These features can be directly translated into actionable signals such as semantic segmentation and depth, while remaining computationally efficient. However, deterministic regression averages over multiple plausible futures, undermining forecast accuracy by failing to capture uncertainty.

Our key insight is that generative modeling in this space requires encoding VFM features into a compact latent space suitable for diffusion. We show that this latent space preserves information more effectively than previously used PCA-based alternatives, both for forecasting and other applications, such as image generation. Our latent predictions can be easily decoded into multiple useful and interpretable output modalities: semantic segmentation, depth, surface normals, and even RGB.

To model the evolution of future scenes, we leverage the World Model to represent how the ego vehicle and its environment interact and change over time, which entails complex reasoning. The Chain of Thought (CoT) offers a promising solution by forecasting a sequence of future thoughts that subsequently guide trajectory refinement. In this paper, we propose FutureX, a CoT-driven pipeline that enhances end-to-end planners to perform complex motion planning via future scene latent reasoning and trajectory refinement. Specifically, the Auto-think Switch examines the current scene and decides whether additional reasoning is required to yield a higher-quality motion plan. Once FutureX enters the Thinking mode, the Latent World Model conducts a CoT-guided rollout to predict future scene representation, enabling the Summarizer Module to further refine the motion plan.

Serrated tussock (\\textit{Nassella trichotoma}) is a highly competitive invasive grass species that disrupts native grasslands, reduces pasture productivity, and increases land management costs.

The second is the inability to effectively co-model boundary and region information, making it difficult to accurately reconstruct complete regions and sharp boundaries of objects. To address the first issue, we propose the Channel Information Interaction Module (CIIM), which introduces a horizontal-vertical integration mechanism in the channel dimension. This module performs feature reorganization and interaction across channels to effectively capture complementary cross-channel information. To address the second issue, we construct a collaborative decoding architecture guided by prior knowledge. This architecture generates boundary priors and object localization maps through Boundary Extraction (BE) and Region Extraction (RE) modules, then employs hybrid attention to collaboratively calibrate decoded features, effectively overcoming semantic ambiguity and imprecise boundaries. Additionally, the Multi-scale Enhancement (MSE) module enriches contextual feature representations.

However, the global denoising dynamics of DMs inherently conflate local editing targets with the full-image context, leading to unintended modifications in non-target regions. In this paper, we shift our attention beyond DMs and turn to Masked Generative Transformers (MGTs) as an alternative approach to tackle this challenge. By predicting multiple masked tokens rather than holistic refinement, MGTs exhibit a localized decoding paradigm that endows them with the inherent capacity to explicitly preserve non-relevant regions during the editing process. Building upon this insight, we introduce the first MGT-based image editing framework, termed EditMGT. We first demonstrate that MGT's cross-attention maps provide informative localization signals for localizing edit-relevant regions and devise a multi-layer attention consolidation scheme that refines these maps to achieve fine-grained and precise localization. On top of these adaptive localization results, we introduce region-hold sampling, which restricts token flipping within low-attention areas to suppress spurious edits, thereby confining modifications to the intended target regions and preserving the integrity of surrounding non-target areas. To train EditMGT, we construct CrispEdit-2M, a high-resolution dataset spanning seven diverse editing categories. Without introducing additional parameters, we adapt a pre-trained text-to-image MGT into an image editing model through attention injection.

Traditional change detection methods typically identify all changes between two temporal images without distinguishing the types of transitions, which can lead to results that may not align with specific user needs.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce Referring Change Detection (RCD), which leverages natural language prompts to detect specific classes of changes in remote sensing images. By integrating language understanding with visual analysis, our approach allows users to specify the exact type of change they are interested in.

Extensive validation on an expert-annotated clinical cohort demonstrates superior performance, achieving a Dice score of 85.05% and significantly reducing boundary error (95% Hausdorff Distance improved from 44.79 px to 29.95 px), consistently outperforming strong CNN (ResNet-50 and UNet++) and Transformer (MiT-B5) baselines.

For video models, that means generating motion that preserves fidelity as well as structure. Despite progress in diffusion models, producing realistic structure-preserving motion remains challenging, especially for articulated and deformable objects such as humans and animals. Scaling training data alone, so far, has failed to resolve physically implausible transitions. Existing approaches rely on conditioning with noisy motion representations, such as optical flow or skeletons extracted using an external imperfect model. To address these challenges, we introduce an algorithm to distill structure-preserving motion priors from an autoregressive video tracking model (SAM2) into a bidirectional video diffusion model (CogVideoX). With our method, we train SAM2VideoX, which contains two innovations: (1) a bidirectional feature fusion module that extracts global structure-preserving motion priors from a recurrent model like SAM2; (2) a Local Gram Flow loss that aligns how local features move together. Experiments on VBench and in human studies show that SAM2VideoX delivers consistent gains (+2.60\\% on VBench, 21-22\\% lower FVD, and 71.4\\% human preference) over prior baselines. Specifically, on VBench, we achieve 95.51\\%, surpassing REPA (92.91\\%) by 2.60\\%, and reduce FVD to 360.57, a 21.20\\% and 22.46\\% improvement over REPA- and LoRA-finetuning, respectively.

However, it relies on simplified, order-dependent alpha blending and coarse approximations of the density integral within the rasterizer, thereby limiting its ability to render complex, overlapping semi-transparent objects. In this paper, we extend rasterization-based rendering of 3D Gaussian representations with a novel method for high-fidelity transmittance computation, entirely avoiding the need for ray tracing or per-pixel sample sorting. Building on prior work in moment-based order-independent transparency, our key idea is to characterize the density distribution along each camera ray with a compact and continuous representation based on statistical moments. To this end, we analytically derive and compute a set of per-pixel moments from all contributing 3D Gaussians. From these moments, a continuous transmittance function is reconstructed for each ray, which is then independently sampled within each Gaussian. As a result, our method bridges the gap between rasterization and physical accuracy by modeling light attenuation in complex translucent media, significantly improving overall reconstruction and rendering quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "Extends 3D Gaussian Splatting with moment-based transmittance computation for accurate rendering of complex translucent objects without ray tracing or per-pixel sorting.", "motivation": "3DGS has limitations in rendering complex overlapping semi-transparent objects due to simplified alpha blending and coarse density approximations in rasterization.", "method": "Uses moment-based order-independent transparency to characterize density distribution along camera rays with statistical moments.
