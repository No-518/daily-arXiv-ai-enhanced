In this work, we introduce the\nPredictive-Corrective (PC) paradigm, a framework that decouples the modeling\ntask to fundamentally accelerate learning. Building upon this paradigm, we\npropose a novel network, termed PCMambaNet. PCMambaNet is composed of two\nsynergistic modules. First, the Predictive Prior Module (PPM) generates a\ncoarse approximation at low computational cost, thereby anchoring the search\nspace. Specifically, the PPM leverages anatomical knowledge-bilateral\nsymmetry-to predict a 'focus map' of diagnostically relevant asymmetric\nregions. Next, the Corrective Residual Network (CRN) learns to model the\nresidual error, focusing the network's full capacity on refining these\nchallenging regions and delineating precise pathological boundaries. Extensive\nexperiments on high-resolution brain MRI segmentation demonstrate that\nPCMambaNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while converging within only 1-5\nepochs-a performance unattainable by conventional end-to-end models. This\ndramatic acceleration highlights that by explicitly incorporating domain\nknowledge to simplify the learning objective, PCMambaNet effectively mitigates\ndata inefficiency and overfitting.", "AI": {"tldr": "PCMambaNet introduces a Predictive-Corrective paradigm that accelerates learning by decoupling modeling tasks, achieving state-of-the-art brain MRI segmentation accuracy in only 1-5 epochs.", "motivation": "End-to-end deep learning suffers from slow convergence and heavy reliance on large datasets, limiting efficiency in data-scarce domains like medical imaging.", "method": "Uses two synergistic modules: Predictive Prior Module (PPM) generates coarse approximations using anatomical knowledge (bilateral symmetry) to create focus maps, and Corrective Residual Network (CRN) learns residual errors to refine challenging regions and pathological boundaries.", "result": "Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on high-resolution brain MRI segmentation while converging within only 1-5 epochs, significantly outperforming conventional end-to-end models.", "conclusion": "Explicitly incorporating domain knowledge to simplify learning objectives effectively mitigates data inefficiency and overfitting, enabling dramatic acceleration in convergence."}}

The traditional\ngraphics solution is to explicitly decompose the input image into geometry,\nmaterial and lighting via differentiable rendering; but this is constrained by\nthe multiple assumptions and approximations of the underlying models and\nparameterizations of these scene components. We propose 3DPR, an image-based\nrelighting model that leverages generative priors learnt from multi-view\nOne-Light-at-A-Time (OLAT) images captured in a light stage. We introduce a new\ndiverse and large-scale multi-view 4K OLAT dataset of 139 subjects to learn a\nhigh-quality prior over the distribution of high-frequency face reflectance. We\nleverage the latent space of a pre-trained generative head model that provides\na rich prior over face geometry learnt from in-the-wild image datasets.
