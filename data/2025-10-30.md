### [1] [DrivingScene: A Multi-Task Online Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting Method for Dynamic Driving Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24734)
*Qirui Hou,Wenzhang Sun,Chang Zeng,Chunfeng Wang,Hao Li,Jianxun Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DrivingScene is an online framework that reconstructs 4D dynamic driving scenes from just two consecutive surround-view images using a residual flow network and scene flow modeling, achieving high-quality depth, scene flow, and 3D Gaussian point clouds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time, high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic driving scenes is challenging due to complex dynamics and sparse views, with existing methods struggling to balance quality and efficiency.

Method: Uses a lightweight residual flow network that predicts non-rigid motion of dynamic objects per camera on top of a learned static scene prior, explicitly modeling dynamics via scene flow. Introduces a coarse-to-fine training paradigm to avoid instabilities in end-to-end approaches.

Result: Experiments on nuScenes dataset show the method simultaneously generates high-quality depth, scene flow, and 3D Gaussian point clouds online, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

Conclusion: DrivingScene provides an effective online, feed-forward solution for 4D dynamic scene reconstruction from sparse views, demonstrating superior performance in dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis tasks.

Abstract: Real-time, high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic driving scenes is
challenged by complex dynamics and sparse views, with prior methods struggling
to balance quality and efficiency. We propose DrivingScene, an online,
feed-forward framework that reconstructs 4D dynamic scenes from only two
consecutive surround-view images. Our key innovation is a lightweight residual
flow network that predicts the non-rigid motion of dynamic objects per camera
on top of a learned static scene prior, explicitly modeling dynamics via scene
flow. We also introduce a coarse-to-fine training paradigm that circumvents the
instabilities common to end-to-end approaches. Experiments on nuScenes dataset
show our image-only method simultaneously generates high-quality depth, scene
flow, and 3D Gaussian point clouds online, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in both dynamic reconstruction and novel view
synthesis.

### [2] [Towards Fine-Grained Human Motion Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24767)
*Guorui Song,Guocun Wang,Zhe Huang,Jing Lin,Xuefei Zhe,Jian Li,Haoqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M-ACM is a motion-augmented caption model that improves video captioning by incorporating motion-aware decoding using human mesh recovery to capture fine-grained human body dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video captioning models struggle with capturing fine-grained motion details, leading to vague or semantically inconsistent captions that fail to accurately describe human actions.

Method: M-ACM uses motion representations from human mesh recovery to explicitly highlight human body dynamics through motion-aware decoding, reducing hallucinations and improving semantic fidelity and spatial alignment.

Result: M-ACM significantly outperforms previous methods in accurately describing complex human motions and subtle temporal variations, setting a new standard for motion-centric video captioning.

Conclusion: The proposed M-ACM framework with motion-aware decoding effectively enhances caption quality for human action descriptions, and the introduced HMI Dataset and HMI-Bench provide valuable resources for motion-focused video captioning research.

Abstract: Generating accurate descriptions of human actions in videos remains a
challenging task for video captioning models. Existing approaches often
struggle to capture fine-grained motion details, resulting in vague or
semantically inconsistent captions. In this work, we introduce the
Motion-Augmented Caption Model (M-ACM), a novel generative framework that
enhances caption quality by incorporating motion-aware decoding. At its core,
M-ACM leverages motion representations derived from human mesh recovery to
explicitly highlight human body dynamics, thereby reducing hallucinations and
improving both semantic fidelity and spatial alignment in the generated
captions. To support research in this area, we present the Human Motion Insight
(HMI) Dataset, comprising 115K video-description pairs focused on human
movement, along with HMI-Bench, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating
motion-focused video captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that M-ACM
significantly outperforms previous methods in accurately describing complex
human motions and subtle temporal variations, setting a new standard for
motion-centric video captioning.

### [3] [Combining SAR Simulators to Train ATR Models with Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24768)
*Benjamin Camus,Julien Houssay,Corentin Le Barbu,Eric Monteux,Cédric Saleun,Christian Cochin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper trains Deep Learning models for Automatic Target Recognition (SAR) using synthetic data from two complementary SAR simulators (MOCEM and Salsa) to overcome the lack of real labeled data, achieving 88% accuracy on real MSTAR measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real labeled SAR measurements are scarce, so synthetic data from simulators is used, but synthetic datasets don't generalize well to real measurements due to simplifying assumptions in simulation models.

Method: Proposes combining two SAR simulators with different paradigms (MOCEM using scattering centers model and Salsa using ray tracing) to generate synthetic datasets, then trains ATR models using the ADASCA Deep Learning approach.

Result: Achieves nearly 88% accuracy on real MSTAR measurements, demonstrating improved generalization from synthetic to real data.

Conclusion: Using complementary simulation paradigms can help bridge the domain gap between synthetic and real SAR data, enabling effective ATR model training when real labeled data is unavailable.

Abstract: This work aims to train Deep Learning models to perform Automatic Target
Recognition (ATR) on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. To circumvent the
lack of real labelled measurements, we resort to synthetic data produced by SAR
simulators. Simulation offers full control over the virtual environment, which
enables us to generate large and diversified datasets at will. However,
simulations are intrinsically grounded on simplifying assumptions of the real
world (i.e. physical models). Thus, synthetic datasets are not as
representative as real measurements. Consequently, ATR models trained on
synthetic images cannot generalize well on real measurements. Our contributions
to this problem are twofold: on one hand, we demonstrate and quantify the
impact of the simulation paradigm on the ATR. On the other hand, we propose a
new approach to tackle the ATR problem: combine two SAR simulators that are
grounded on different (but complementary) paradigms to produce synthetic
datasets. To this end, we use two simulators: MOCEM, which is based on a
scattering centers model approach, and Salsa, which resorts on a ray tracing
strategy. We train ATR models using synthetic dataset generated both by MOCEM
and Salsa and our Deep Learning approach called ADASCA. We reach an accuracy of
almost 88 % on the MSTAR measurements.

### [4] [Point-level Uncertainty Evaluation of Mobile Laser Scanning Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24773)
*Ziyang Xu,Olaf Wysocki,Christoph Holst*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a machine learning framework using Random Forest and XGBoost to evaluate point-level uncertainty in Mobile Laser Scanning point clouds by learning relationships between local geometric features and point errors, achieving ROC-AUC above 0.87.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional uncertainty modeling for MLS point clouds requires high-precision reference data that is costly and infeasible at large scales, creating a need for scalable uncertainty evaluation methods.

Method: A machine learning framework using ensemble learning models (Random Forest and XGBoost) trained on spatially partitioned real-world datasets to learn relationships between local geometric features and point-level errors, avoiding data leakage.

Result: Both models effectively captured nonlinear relationships between geometric characteristics and uncertainty, achieving mean ROC-AUC values above 0.87, with elevation variation, point density, and local structural complexity being dominant predictive features.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a scalable, data-driven approach for uncertainty evaluation in large-scale point clouds, offering a foundation for future quality control and error analysis.

Abstract: Reliable quantification of uncertainty in Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point
clouds is essential for ensuring the accuracy and credibility of downstream
applications such as 3D mapping, modeling, and change analysis. Traditional
backward uncertainty modeling heavily rely on high-precision reference data,
which are often costly or infeasible to obtain at large scales. To address this
issue, this study proposes a machine learning-based framework for point-level
uncertainty evaluation that learns the relationship between local geometric
features and point-level errors. The framework is implemented using two
ensemble learning models, Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost, which are trained and
validated on a spatially partitioned real-world dataset to avoid data leakage.
Experimental results demonstrate that both models can effectively capture the
nonlinear relationships between geometric characteristics and uncertainty,
achieving mean ROC-AUC values above 0.87. The analysis further reveals that
geometric features describing elevation variation, point density, and local
structural complexity play a dominant role in predicting uncertainty. The
proposed framework offers a data-driven perspective of uncertainty evaluation,
providing a scalable and adaptable foundation for future quality control and
error analysis of large-scale point clouds.

### [5] [Cross-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion of Eye-Tracking and Facial Features for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24777)
*Yujie Nie,Jianzhang Ni,Yonglong Ye,Yuan-Ting Zhang,Yun Kwok Wing,Xiangqing Xu,Xin Ma,Lizhou Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal framework combining eye-tracking and facial features achieves 95.11% accuracy in Alzheimer's disease detection using cross-attention fusion and directional-aware convolution modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate AD diagnosis is crucial for timely intervention, and multimodal approaches integrating complementary behavioral/perceptual data (eye-tracking and facial features) show promise but haven't been jointly explored for AD diagnosis.

Method: Proposed multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework with: (a) Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module (CEFAM) for inter-modal interactions via cross-attention and global enhancement, (b) Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM) for fine-grained directional facial features using horizontal-vertical receptive fields. Built synchronized dataset of 25 AD patients and 25 healthy controls during visual memory-search tasks.

Result: Achieved 95.11% classification accuracy in distinguishing AD from healthy controls, outperforming traditional late fusion and feature concatenation methods. Demonstrated superior robustness and diagnostic performance.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables adaptive multimodal representation learning by explicitly modeling inter-modal dependencies and modality-specific contributions, providing an effective approach for auxiliary AD diagnosis.

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for enabling
timely intervention and slowing disease progression. Multimodal diagnostic
approaches offer considerable promise by integrating complementary information
across behavioral and perceptual domains. Eye-tracking and facial features, in
particular, are important indicators of cognitive function, reflecting
attentional distribution and neurocognitive state. However, few studies have
explored their joint integration for auxiliary AD diagnosis. In this study, we
propose a multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework that synergistically
leverages eye-tracking and facial features for AD detection. The framework
incorporates two key modules: (a) a Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module
(CEFAM), which models inter-modal interactions through cross-attention and
global enhancement, and (b) a Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM), which
captures fine-grained directional facial features via horizontal-vertical
receptive fields. Together, these modules enable adaptive and discriminative
multimodal representation learning. To support this work, we constructed a
synchronized multimodal dataset, including 25 patients with AD and 25 healthy
controls (HC), by recording aligned facial video and eye-tracking sequences
during a visual memory-search paradigm, providing an ecologically valid
resource for evaluating integration strategies. Extensive experiments on this
dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional late fusion and
feature concatenation methods, achieving a classification accuracy of 95.11% in
distinguishing AD from HC, highlighting superior robustness and diagnostic
performance by explicitly modeling inter-modal dependencies and
modality-specific contributions.

Result: System achieves processing time of 1.17ms per image, outputs lane count, current lane index, and lane boundaries, with enhanced adaptability to environmental conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed FPGA-based LDV architecture provides efficient real-time lane detection suitable for intelligent vehicle applications, with environmental adaptability features.

Abstract: Intelligent vehicles are one of the most important outcomes gained from the
world tendency toward automation. Applications of IVs, whether in urban roads
or robot tracks, do prioritize lane path detection. This paper proposes an
FPGA-based Lane Detector Vehicle LDV architecture that relies on the Sobel
algorithm for edge detection. Operating on 416 x 416 images and 150 MHz, the
system can generate a valid output every 1.17 ms. The valid output consists of
the number of present lanes, the current lane index, as well as its right and
left boundaries. Additionally, the automated light and temperature control
units in the proposed system enhance its adaptability to the surrounding
environmental conditions.

*Mingzhi Zhu,Ding Shang,Sai Qian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ESCA is a full-stack optimization framework that accelerates Photorealistic Codec Avatar (PCA) inference on VR devices through efficient quantization and custom hardware acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Codec Avatar models impose significant computational demands that make real-time inference challenging on resource-constrained VR devices where latency and power efficiency are critical.

Method: Proposed an efficient post-training quantization (PTQ) method for Codec Avatar models and designed a custom hardware accelerator that can be integrated into VR system-on-chips.

Result: ESCA boosts FovVideoVDP quality scores by up to +0.39 over 4-bit baselines, delivers 3.36× latency reduction, and sustains 100 FPS rendering rate in end-to-end tests.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate the feasibility of deploying high-fidelity codec avatars on resource-constrained devices, enabling more immersive and portable VR experiences.

Abstract: Photorealistic Codec Avatars (PCA), which generate high-fidelity human face
renderings, are increasingly being used in Virtual Reality (VR) environments to
enable immersive communication and interaction through deep learning-based
generative models. However, these models impose significant computational
demands, making real-time inference challenging on resource-constrained VR
devices such as head-mounted displays, where latency and power efficiency are
critical. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient post-training
quantization (PTQ) method tailored for Codec Avatar models, enabling
low-precision execution without compromising output quality. In addition, we
design a custom hardware accelerator that can be integrated into the
system-on-chip of VR devices to further enhance processing efficiency. Building
on these components, we introduce ESCA, a full-stack optimization framework
that accelerates PCA inference on edge VR platforms. Experimental results
demonstrate that ESCA boosts FovVideoVDP quality scores by up to $+0.39$ over
the best 4-bit baseline, delivers up to $3.36\times$ latency reduction, and
sustains a rendering rate of 100 frames per second in end-to-end tests,
satisfying real-time VR requirements. These results demonstrate the feasibility
of deploying high-fidelity codec avatars on resource-constrained devices,
opening the door to more immersive and portable VR experiences.

### [8] [The Underappreciated Power of Vision Models for Graph Structural Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24788)
*Xinjian Zhao,Wei Pang,Zhongkai Xue,Xiangru Jian,Lei Zhang,Yaoyao Xu,Xiaozhuang Song,Shu Wu,Tianshu Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision models can match GNN performance on graph tasks while showing different learning patterns, excelling at global structural understanding where GNNs struggle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs use bottom-up message-passing while human vision captures global structures first. Existing benchmarks conflate domain features with topological understanding.

Method: Introduced GraphAbstract benchmark to evaluate models' ability to perceive global graph properties like organizational archetypes, symmetry, connectivity strength, and critical elements.

Result: Vision models significantly outperform GNNs on holistic structural understanding tasks, maintain generalizability across graph scales, while GNNs struggle with global pattern abstraction and degrade with increasing graph size.

Conclusion: Vision models possess remarkable yet underutilized capabilities for graph structural understanding, particularly for global topological awareness and scale-invariant reasoning, opening new avenues for graph foundation models.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks operate through bottom-up message-passing,
fundamentally differing from human visual perception, which intuitively
captures global structures first. We investigate the underappreciated potential
of vision models for graph understanding, finding they achieve performance
comparable to GNNs on established benchmarks while exhibiting distinctly
different learning patterns. These divergent behaviors, combined with
limitations of existing benchmarks that conflate domain features with
topological understanding, motivate our introduction of GraphAbstract. This
benchmark evaluates models' ability to perceive global graph properties as
humans do: recognizing organizational archetypes, detecting symmetry, sensing
connectivity strength, and identifying critical elements. Our results reveal
that vision models significantly outperform GNNs on tasks requiring holistic
structural understanding and maintain generalizability across varying graph
scales, while GNNs struggle with global pattern abstraction and degrade with
increasing graph size. This work demonstrates that vision models possess
remarkable yet underutilized capabilities for graph structural understanding,
particularly for problems requiring global topological awareness and
scale-invariant reasoning. These findings open new avenues to leverage this
underappreciated potential for developing more effective graph foundation
models for tasks dominated by holistic pattern recognition.

### [9] [A Re-node Self-training Approach for Deep Graph-based Semi-supervised Classification on Multi-view Image Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24791)
*Jingjun Bi,Fadi Dornaika*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSGSLM is a graph-based semi-supervised learning method for multi-view data that combines linear feature transformation, multi-view graph fusion, dynamic pseudo-labeling, topological imbalance correction, and unsupervised smoothing loss to improve classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional graph-based methods struggle with multi-view data due to lack of clear graph structures in images and complexity of multi-view integration, limiting efficiency in semi-supervised learning scenarios.

Method: Combines linear feature transformation and multi-view graph fusion in GCN framework, dynamically incorporates pseudo-labels into loss function, corrects topological imbalances by adjusting weights of boundary samples, and adds unsupervised smoothing loss.

Result: Experimental results on multi-view benchmark image datasets show RSGSLM surpasses existing semi-supervised learning approaches in multi-view contexts.

Conclusion: The proposed RSGSLM method effectively addresses challenges in multi-view graph-based semi-supervised learning and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing techniques.

Abstract: Recently, graph-based semi-supervised learning and pseudo-labeling have
gained attention due to their effectiveness in reducing the need for extensive
data annotations. Pseudo-labeling uses predictions from unlabeled data to
improve model training, while graph-based methods are characterized by
processing data represented as graphs. However, the lack of clear graph
structures in images combined with the complexity of multi-view data limits the
efficiency of traditional and existing techniques. Moreover, the integration of
graph structures in multi-view data is still a challenge. In this paper, we
propose Re-node Self-taught Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning for Multi-view
Data (RSGSLM). Our method addresses these challenges by (i) combining linear
feature transformation and multi-view graph fusion within a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) framework, (ii) dynamically incorporating pseudo-labels into the
GCN loss function to improve classification in multi-view data, and (iii)
correcting topological imbalances by adjusting the weights of labeled samples
near class boundaries. Additionally, (iv) we introduce an unsupervised
smoothing loss applicable to all samples. This combination optimizes
performance while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results on
multi-view benchmark image datasets demonstrate that RSGSLM surpasses existing
semi-supervised learning approaches in multi-view contexts.

### [10] [PISA-Bench: The PISA Index as a Multilingual and Multimodal Metric for the Evaluation of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24792)
*Patrick Haller,Fabio Barth,Jonas Golde,Georg Rehm,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PISA-Bench is a multilingual multimodal benchmark derived from expert-created PISA tests, covering six languages with human-verified examples to address limitations in existing vision-language model evaluation datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language benchmarks lack high-quality human-verified examples, often relying on synthetic LLM-generated content and being limited to English, making multilingual evaluation challenging.

Method: Created PISA-Bench using human-extracted instructions, questions, answer options, and images from expert-created PISA tests, translated into five additional languages (Spanish, German, Chinese, French, Italian) to form a fully parallel corpus.

Result: Small VLMs (<20B parameters) fail to achieve high scores, show substantial performance degradation on non-English splits, and have high error rates in spatial and geometric reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: PISA-Bench provides a valuable resource for advancing multilingual multimodal reasoning research, highlighting current limitations in VLMs' cross-lingual and spatial reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
multimodal reasoning. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in terms of
high-quality, human-verified examples. Many current datasets rely on
synthetically generated content by large language models (LLMs). Furthermore,
most datasets are limited to English, as manual quality assurance of translated
samples is time-consuming and costly. To fill this gap, we introduce
PISA-Bench, a multilingual benchmark derived from English examples of the
expert-created PISA tests, a unified framework for the assessment of student
competencies in over eighty countries. Each example consists of human-extracted
instructions, questions, answer options, and images, enriched with question
type categories, and has been translated from English into five additional
languages (Spanish, German, Chinese, French, and Italian), resulting in a fully
parallel corpus covering six languages. We evaluate state-of-the-art
vision-language models on PISA-Bench and find that especially small models
(<20B parameters) fail to achieve high test scores. We further find substantial
performance degradation on non-English splits as well as high error-rates when
models are tasked with spatial and geometric reasoning. By releasing the
dataset and evaluation framework, we provide a resource for advancing research
on multilingual multimodal reasoning.

*Zhaoshu Yu,Bo Wang,Pengpeng Zeng,Haonan Zhang,Ji Zhang,Lianli Gao,Jingkuan Song,Nicu Sebe,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This survey provides the first comprehensive review of Efficient Vision-Language-Action models (Efficient VLAs), addressing computational and data challenges through a unified taxonomy covering efficient model design, training, and data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action models face deployment challenges due to substantial computational and data requirements from large-scale foundation models, creating an urgent need to address these efficiency bottlenecks.

Method: The survey introduces a unified taxonomy organizing techniques into three pillars: Efficient Model Design (architectures and compression), Efficient Training (reducing computational burdens), and Efficient Data Collection (addressing robotic data bottlenecks).

Result: The survey establishes a foundational reference framework, summarizes state-of-the-art methods, delineates representative applications, and identifies key challenges in the Efficient VLA domain.

Conclusion: The work provides a comprehensive roadmap for future research in efficient embodied AI systems and maintains an updated project page to track ongoing developments in the field.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) represent a significant frontier in
embodied intelligence, aiming to bridge digital knowledge with physical-world
interaction. While these models have demonstrated remarkable generalist
capabilities, their deployment is severely hampered by the substantial
computational and data requirements inherent to their underlying large-scale
foundation models. Motivated by the urgent need to address these challenges,
this survey presents the first comprehensive review of Efficient
Vision-Language-Action models (Efficient VLAs) across the entire
data-model-training process. Specifically, we introduce a unified taxonomy to
systematically organize the disparate efforts in this domain, categorizing
current techniques into three core pillars: (1) Efficient Model Design,
focusing on efficient architectures and model compression; (2) Efficient
Training, which reduces computational burdens during model learning; and (3)
Efficient Data Collection, which addresses the bottlenecks in acquiring and
utilizing robotic data. Through a critical review of state-of-the-art methods
within this framework, this survey not only establishes a foundational
reference for the community but also summarizes representative applications,
delineates key challenges, and charts a roadmap for future research. We
maintain a continuously updated project page to track our latest developments:

### [12] [Conflict Adaptation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24804)
*Xiaoyang Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-language models exhibit human-like conflict adaptation in Stroop tasks, with neural analysis revealing specialized supernodes for text/color processing and a conflict-modulated supernode that regulates cognitive control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether AI models exhibit human-like cognitive control mechanisms, specifically conflict adaptation, and understand the neural representations underlying this behavior.

Method: Used sequential Stroop task with 13 vision-language models, analyzed representations using sparse autoencoders to identify task-relevant supernodes in InternVL 3.5 4B model.

Result: 12 of 13 VLMs showed conflict adaptation behavior; identified partially overlapping supernodes for text/color processing that mirror human automaticity asymmetry; isolated conflict-modulated supernode in layers 24-25 whose ablation increases Stroop errors.

Conclusion: VLMs exhibit human-like cognitive control mechanisms, with specialized neural representations for conflict processing that parallel human cognitive architecture.

Abstract: A signature of human cognitive control is conflict adaptation: improved
performance on a high-conflict trial following another high-conflict trial.
This phenomenon offers an account for how cognitive control, a scarce resource,
is recruited. Using a sequential Stroop task, we find that 12 of 13
vision-language models (VLMs) tested exhibit behavior consistent with conflict
adaptation, with the lone exception likely reflecting a ceiling effect. To
understand the representational basis of this behavior, we use sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant supernodes in InternVL 3.5 4B.
Partially overlapping supernodes emerge for text and color in both early and
late layers, and their relative sizes mirror the automaticity asymmetry between
reading and color naming in humans. We further isolate a conflict-modulated
supernode in layers 24-25 whose ablation significantly increases Stroop errors
while minimally affecting congruent trials.

### [13] [DualCap: Enhancing Lightweight Image Captioning via Dual Retrieval with Similar Scenes Visual Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24813)
*Binbin Li,Guimiao Yang,Zisen Qi,Haiping Wang,Yu Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualCap is a lightweight image captioning model that uses dual retrieval (image-to-text and image-to-image) to generate both text and visual prompts, enhancing visual representations for better object details and complex scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lightweight retrieval-augmented caption models only use retrieved data as text prompts, creating a semantic gap by leaving original visual features unenhanced, especially for object details and complex scenes.

Method: Uses dual retrieval: standard image-to-text for text prompts and novel image-to-image retrieval for visually similar scenes. Salient keywords from similar images' captions are encoded and fused with original image features through a lightweight trainable feature fusion network.

Result: Achieves competitive performance while requiring fewer trainable parameters compared to previous visual-prompting captioning approaches.

Conclusion: DualCap effectively bridges the semantic gap in lightweight retrieval-augmented captioning by enriching visual representations through dual retrieval mechanisms.

Abstract: Recent lightweight retrieval-augmented image caption models often utilize
retrieved data solely as text prompts, thereby creating a semantic gap by
leaving the original visual features unenhanced, particularly for object
details or complex scenes. To address this limitation, we propose $DualCap$, a
novel approach that enriches the visual representation by generating a visual
prompt from retrieved similar images. Our model employs a dual retrieval
mechanism, using standard image-to-text retrieval for text prompts and a novel
image-to-image retrieval to source visually analogous scenes. Specifically,
salient keywords and phrases are derived from the captions of visually similar
scenes to capture key objects and similar details. These textual features are
then encoded and integrated with the original image features through a
lightweight, trainable feature fusion network. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while requiring
fewer trainable parameters compared to previous visual-prompting captioning
approaches.

### [14] [Deep Feature Optimization for Enhanced Fish Freshness Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24814)
*Phi-Hung Hoang,Nam-Thuan Trinh,Van-Manh Tran,Thi-Thu-Hong Phan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a three-stage deep learning framework for fish freshness assessment that combines multiple vision architectures with classical ML classifiers and feature selection, achieving 85.99% accuracy on the FFE dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sensory evaluation of fish freshness is subjective and inconsistent, while existing deep learning approaches lack accuracy and feature transparency, creating a need for more reliable automated assessment methods.

Method: A three-stage framework: 1) Fine-tune five vision architectures (ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0, ConvNeXt-Base, Swin-Tiny), 2) Use multi-level deep features to train seven classical ML classifiers, 3) Apply feature selection methods (LGBM, Random Forest, Lasso) to identify compact feature subsets.

Result: The best configuration (Swin-Tiny features + Extra Trees classifier + LGBM feature selection) achieved 85.99% accuracy on the FFE dataset, outperforming recent studies by 8.69-22.78%.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework is effective and generalizable for visual quality evaluation tasks, demonstrating the value of integrating deep visual representations with traditional decision mechanisms.

Abstract: Assessing fish freshness is vital for ensuring food safety and minimizing
economic losses in the seafood industry. However, traditional sensory
evaluation remains subjective, time-consuming, and inconsistent. Although
recent advances in deep learning have automated visual freshness prediction,
challenges related to accuracy and feature transparency persist. This study
introduces a unified three-stage framework that refines and leverages deep
visual representations for reliable fish freshness assessment. First, five
state-of-the-art vision architectures - ResNet-50, DenseNet-121,
EfficientNet-B0, ConvNeXt-Base, and Swin-Tiny - are fine-tuned to establish a
strong baseline. Next, multi-level deep features extracted from these backbones
are used to train seven classical machine learning classifiers, integrating
deep and traditional decision mechanisms. Finally, feature selection methods
based on Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Random Forest, and Lasso
identify a compact and informative subset of features. Experiments on the
Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate that the best
configuration combining Swin-Tiny features, an Extra Trees classifier, and
LGBM-based feature selection achieves an accuracy of 85.99%, outperforming
recent studies on the same dataset by 8.69-22.78%. These findings confirm the
effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed framework for visual quality
evaluation tasks.

Result: The benchmark provides a foundation for task definition and enables in-depth analysis of factors influencing accuracy, including video processing strategies and alignment between video features and model capabilities.

Conclusion: The MVFNDB benchmark lays a solid foundation for future evaluations and advancements of multi-modal large language models in video fake news detection domain.

Abstract: The advent of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has greatly advanced
research into applications for Video fake news detection (VFND) tasks.
Traditional video-based FND benchmarks typically focus on the accuracy of the
final decision, often failing to provide fine-grained assessments for the
entire detection process, making the detection process a black box. Therefore,
we introduce the MVFNDB (Multi-modal Video Fake News Detection Benchmark) based
on the empirical analysis, which provides foundation for tasks definition. The
benchmark comprises 10 tasks and is meticulously crafted to probe MLLMs'
perception, understanding, and reasoning capacities during detection, featuring
9730 human-annotated video-related questions based on a carefully constructed
taxonomy ability of VFND. To validate the impact of combining multiple features
on the final results, we design a novel framework named MVFND-CoT, which
incorporates both creator-added content and original shooting footage
reasoning. Building upon the benchmark, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the
deeper factors influencing accuracy, including video processing strategies and
the alignment between video features and model capabilities. We believe this
benchmark will lay a solid foundation for future evaluations and advancements
of MLLMs in the domain of video fake news detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-round safety editing framework called SafeEditor that serves as a plug-and-play module for text-to-image models, addressing over-refusal and safety-utility imbalance through post-hoc image editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inference-time safety methods for text-to-image models suffer from limitations like over-refusal and poor balance between safety and utility, making safety alignment challenging.

Method: Proposed MR-SafeEdit framework with a multi-round image-text interleaved dataset and SafeEditor MLLM that performs post-hoc safety editing on generated images through iterative refinement.

Result: SafeEditor outperforms prior safety approaches by reducing over-refusal while achieving better safety-utility balance in text-to-image generation.

Conclusion: The multi-round safety editing paradigm effectively addresses safety concerns in text-to-image models without compromising utility, providing a practical solution for real-world deployment.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, ensuring their
safety has become increasingly critical. Existing safety approaches can be
categorized into training-time and inference-time methods. While inference-time
methods are widely adopted due to their cost-effectiveness, they often suffer
from limitations such as over-refusal and imbalance between safety and utility.
To address these challenges, we propose a multi-round safety editing framework
that functions as a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module, enabling efficient
safety alignment for any text-to-image model. Central to this framework is
MR-SafeEdit, a multi-round image-text interleaved dataset specifically
constructed for safety editing in text-to-image generation. We introduce a
post-hoc safety editing paradigm that mirrors the human cognitive process of
identifying and refining unsafe content. To instantiate this paradigm, we
develop SafeEditor, a unified MLLM capable of multi-round safety editing on
generated images. Experimental results show that SafeEditor surpasses prior
safety approaches by reducing over-refusal while achieving a more favorable
safety-utility balance.

TL;DR: MCIHN is a hybrid network model for multimodal emotion recognition that uses adversarial autoencoders for feature learning and cross-modal interaction to reduce modality discrepancies and improve recognition accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal emotion recognition faces challenges due to differences between modalities and difficulty in characterizing unimodal emotional information, which limits accurate emotion recognition in human-computer interaction.

Method: Uses adversarial autoencoders (AAE) for each modality to learn discriminative emotion features, then applies Cross-modal Gate Mechanism (CGMM) to reduce modality discrepancies and generate interaction features, followed by Feature Fusion module (FFM) for multimodal fusion.

Result: Experiments on SIMS and MOSI datasets demonstrate that MCIHN achieves superior performance in multimodal emotion recognition.

Conclusion: The proposed MCIHN model effectively addresses modality differences and improves emotion recognition accuracy through cross-modal interaction and feature fusion techniques.

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition is crucial for future human-computer
interaction. However, accurate emotion recognition still faces significant
challenges due to differences between different modalities and the difficulty
of characterizing unimodal emotional information. To solve these problems, a
hybrid network model based on multipath cross-modal interaction (MCIHN) is
proposed. First, adversarial autoencoders (AAE) are constructed separately for
each modality. The AAE learns discriminative emotion features and reconstructs
the features through a decoder to obtain more discriminative information about
the emotion classes. Then, the latent codes from the AAE of different
modalities are fed into a predefined Cross-modal Gate Mechanism model (CGMM) to
reduce the discrepancy between modalities, establish the emotional relationship
between interacting modalities, and generate the interaction features between
different modalities. Multimodal fusion using the Feature Fusion module (FFM)
for better emotion recognition. Experiments were conducted on publicly
available SIMS and MOSI datasets, demonstrating that MCIHN achieves superior
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow matching has achieved remarkable success but the factors influencing generation quality remain poorly understood. The authors aim to better understand the generation process through a denoising perspective.

Method: The authors design a framework to empirically probe the generation process, establish formal connections between flow matching models and denoisers, and use principled perturbations (noise and drift) to influence sample generation.

Result: The study reveals distinct dynamical phases in the generative process and enables precise characterization of when denoisers succeed or fail during generation.

Conclusion: The denoising perspective provides new insights into flow matching generation processes, allowing better understanding of generation quality factors and denoiser performance at different stages.

Abstract: Flow matching has achieved remarkable success, yet the factors influencing
the quality of its generation process remain poorly understood. In this work,
we adopt a denoising perspective and design a framework to empirically probe
the generation process. Laying down the formal connections between flow
matching models and denoisers, we provide a common ground to compare their
performances on generation and denoising. This enables the design of principled
and controlled perturbations to influence sample generation: noise and drift.
This leads to new insights on the distinct dynamical phases of the generative
process, enabling us to precisely characterize at which stage of the generative
process denoisers succeed or fail and why this matters.

TL;DR: This paper proposes reframing fruit maturity estimation from discrete classification to continuous probabilistic learning, introducing a probabilistic head to RT-DETRv2 that predicts continuous maturity distributions with uncertainty measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning approaches treat fruit maturity as discrete classification, which conflicts with the continuous nature of biological ripening processes, leading to information loss and ambiguous class boundaries.

Method: Proposes architectural modification to RT-DETRv2 object detector by adding a dedicated probabilistic head that predicts continuous distribution over maturity spectrum, learning mean maturity state and associated uncertainty simultaneously.

Result: Achieves mean Average Precision (mAP) of 85.6% on challenging fruit dataset while providing richer, more biologically plausible maturity representations with uncertainty measures for robotic decision-making.

Conclusion: The probabilistic approach offers more granular and accurate maturity assessments than classification-based methods, enabling more intelligent, uncertainty-aware automated systems in modern agriculture.

Abstract: Maturity estimation of fruits and vegetables is a critical task for
agricultural automation, directly impacting yield prediction and robotic
harvesting. Current deep learning approaches predominantly treat maturity as a
discrete classification problem (e.g., unripe, ripe, overripe). This rigid
formulation, however, fundamentally conflicts with the continuous nature of the
biological ripening process, leading to information loss and ambiguous class
boundaries. In this paper, we challenge this paradigm by reframing maturity
estimation as a continuous, probabilistic learning task. We propose a novel
architectural modification to the state-of-the-art, real-time object detector,
RT-DETRv2, by introducing a dedicated probabilistic head. This head enables the
model to predict a continuous distribution over the maturity spectrum for each
detected object, simultaneously learning the mean maturity state and its
associated uncertainty. This uncertainty measure is crucial for downstream
decision-making in robotics, providing a confidence score for tasks like
selective harvesting. Our model not only provides a far richer and more
biologically plausible representation of plant maturity but also maintains
exceptional detection performance, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of
85.6\% on a challenging, large-scale fruit dataset. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments that our probabilistic approach offers more granular and
accurate maturity assessments than its classification-based counterparts,
paving the way for more intelligent, uncertainty-aware automated systems in
modern agriculture

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper shows that careful selection of body landmarks combined with spline-based imputation enables efficient and accurate isolated sign recognition in Brazilian Sign Language (LIBRAS), achieving comparable or better performance than state-of-the-art methods while reducing processing time by over 5X.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous skeleton-based approaches using OpenPose for landmark extraction achieved good recognition performance but suffered from poor time performance. Simply replacing OpenPose with lightweight MediaPipe improved speed but significantly reduced accuracy, creating a need for optimization strategies.

Method: The authors explored landmark subset selection strategies to optimize recognition performance, combined with spline-based imputation to handle missing landmarks. This approach aims to balance processing speed and accuracy in sign language recognition.

Result: Experimental results demonstrated that proper landmark subset selection achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art methods while reducing processing time by more than 5X compared to previous approaches. Spline-based imputation also provided substantial accuracy gains by mitigating missing landmark issues.

Conclusion: Careful landmark selection combined with simple imputation techniques enables efficient and accurate isolated sign recognition, paving the way for scalable Sign Language Recognition systems that balance both speed and accuracy requirements.

Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of using lightweight body landmark
detection for the recognition of isolated signs in Brazilian Sign Language
(LIBRAS). Although the skeleton-based approach by Alves et al. (2024) enabled
substantial improvements in recognition performance, the use of OpenPose for
landmark extraction hindered time performance. In a preliminary investigation,
we observed that simply replacing OpenPose with the lightweight MediaPipe,
while improving processing speed, significantly reduced accuracy. To overcome
this limitation, we explored landmark subset selection strategies aimed at
optimizing recognition performance. Experimental results showed that a proper
landmark subset achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art
methods while reducing processing time by more than 5X compared to Alves et al.
(2024). As an additional contribution, we demonstrated that spline-based
imputation effectively mitigates missing landmark issues, leading to
substantial accuracy gains. These findings highlight that careful landmark
selection, combined with simple imputation techniques, enables efficient and
accurate isolated sign recognition, paving the way for scalable Sign Language
Recognition systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traffic congestion causes increasing delays and inefficiencies in rapidly growing urban cities, requiring solutions to optimize traffic flow and minimize delays.

Method: Analyzes sequential camera frames to compute background by averaging pixel values over time, then extracts foreground and applies DBSCAN clustering algorithm for vehicle detection.

Result: Developed a computationally efficient vehicle detection system that requires minimal infrastructure modifications.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology offers a practical and scalable solution for real-world deployment in traffic management systems.

Abstract: Traffic congestion is becoming a challenge in the rapidly growing urban

designed to optimize traffic flow and minimize delays. The framework is
structured with three primary components: (a) vehicle detection, (b) traffic
prediction, and (c) traffic signal optimization. This paper presents the first
component, vehicle detection. The methodology involves analyzing multiple
sequential frames from a camera feed to compute the background, i.e. the
underlying roadway, by averaging pixel values over time. The computed
background is then utilized to extract the foreground, where the Density-Based
Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is applied to
detect vehicles. With its computational efficiency and minimal infrastructure
modification requirements, the proposed methodology offers a practical and
scalable solution for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: VividCam enables text-to-video models to learn complex camera motions from synthetic videos instead of relying on realistic training data, using disentanglement strategies to isolate motion learning from appearance artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video models struggle with unconventional camera motions due to lack of sufficient training data with intended uncommon camera movements, which limits artistic video creation.

Method: Proposes a training paradigm using synthetic videos from engines like Unity, incorporating multiple disentanglement strategies to isolate camera motion learning from synthetic appearance artifacts and mitigate domain shift.

Result: The method successfully synthesizes a wide range of precisely controlled and complex camera motions using surprisingly simple synthetic data consisting of basic geometries in low-poly 3D scenes.

Conclusion: VividCam demonstrates that complex camera motions can be effectively learned from simple synthetic data, releasing the reliance on collecting realistic training videos for text-to-video generation.

Abstract: Although recent text-to-video generative models are getting more capable of
following external camera controls, imposed by either text descriptions or
camera trajectories, they still struggle to generalize to unconventional camera
motions, which is crucial in creating truly original and artistic videos. The
challenge lies in the difficulty of finding sufficient training videos with the
intended uncommon camera motions. To address this challenge, we propose
VividCam, a training paradigm that enables diffusion models to learn complex
camera motions from synthetic videos, releasing the reliance on collecting
realistic training videos. VividCam incorporates multiple disentanglement
strategies that isolates camera motion learning from synthetic appearance
artifacts, ensuring more robust motion representation and mitigating domain
shift. We demonstrate that our design synthesizes a wide range of precisely
controlled and complex camera motions using surprisingly simple synthetic data.
Notably, this synthetic data often consists of basic geometries within a
low-poly 3D scene and can be efficiently rendered by engines like Unity. Our

Motivation: Multi-view transformers have become black-box systems where inner mechanisms are unclear, making improvements challenging and complicating usage in safety-critical applications. Understanding how these models work is crucial for further development and reliable deployment.

Method: The authors developed an approach for probing and visualizing 3D representations from the residual connections of multi-view transformers' layers, specifically analyzing a DUSt3R model variant to examine latent state development across blocks and individual layer roles.

Result: The analysis revealed how DUSt3R develops its latent state across layers, the role of individual layers, and differences from methods with stronger inductive biases. It also showed that DUSt3R estimates correspondences that are refined with reconstructed geometry.

Conclusion: The proposed probing and visualization method successfully illuminates the inner workings of multi-view transformers, providing insights into their operation that could enable further improvements and safer deployment in critical applications.

Abstract: Multi-view transformers such as DUSt3R are revolutionizing 3D vision by
solving 3D tasks in a feed-forward manner. However, contrary to previous
optimization-based pipelines, the inner mechanisms of multi-view transformers
are unclear. Their black-box nature makes further improvements beyond data
scaling challenging and complicates usage in safety- and reliability-critical
applications. Here, we present an approach for probing and visualizing 3D
representations from the residual connections of the multi-view transformers'
layers. In this manner, we investigate a variant of the DUSt3R model, shedding
light on the development of its latent state across blocks, the role of the
individual layers, and suggest how it differs from methods with stronger
inductive biases of explicit global pose. Finally, we show that the
investigated variant of DUSt3R estimates correspondences that are refined with
reconstructed geometry. The code used for the analysis is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation where dominant modalities overshadow others in multimodal learning, which restricts generalization and balanced learning across all modalities.

Method: Three-step iterative optimization: 1) Identify dominant modality using Shapley values based on accuracy contributions, 2) Decompose loss landscape by modulating loss to prioritize robustness for dominant modality, 3) Update weights via backpropagation of modulated gradients.

Result: Extensive experiments on four diverse datasets show M-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art optimization and gradient manipulation methods, significantly balancing and improving multimodal learning performance.

Conclusion: M-SAM effectively ensures robust learning for dominant modalities while enhancing contributions from others, enabling models to explore and exploit complementary features that strengthen overall multimodal performance.

Abstract: In multimodal learning, dominant modalities often overshadow others, limiting
generalization. We propose Modality-Aware Sharpness-Aware Minimization (M-SAM),
a model-agnostic framework that applies to many modalities and supports early
and late fusion scenarios. In every iteration, M-SAM in three steps optimizes
learning. \textbf{First, it identifies the dominant modality} based on
modalities' contribution in the accuracy using Shapley. \textbf{Second, it
decomposes the loss landscape}, or in another language, it modulates the loss
to prioritize the robustness of the model in favor of the dominant modality,
and \textbf{third, M-SAM updates the weights} by backpropagation of modulated
gradients. This ensures robust learning for the dominant modality while
enhancing contributions from others, allowing the model to explore and exploit
complementary features that strengthen overall performance. Extensive
experiments on four diverse datasets show that M-SAM outperforms the latest
state-of-the-art optimization and gradient manipulation methods and
significantly balances and improves multimodal learning.

Abstract: Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a serious and prevalent healthcare concern.
Accurate classification of PU severity (Stages I-IV) is essential for proper
treatment but remains challenging due to subtle visual distinctions and
subjective interpretation, leading to variability among clinicians. Prior
AI-based approaches using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision

self-reflection mechanism for pressure ulcer severity classification. Inspired
by clinician-style diagnostic reassessment, FT-ARM iteratively refines its
predictions by reasoning over visual features and encoded clinical knowledge
from text, enhancing both accuracy and consistency. On the publicly available
Pressure Injury Image Dataset (PIID), FT-ARM, fine-tuned from LLaMA 3.2 90B,
achieved 85% accuracy in classifying PU stages I-IV, surpassing prior CNN-based
models by +4%. Unlike earlier CNN/ViT studies that relied solely on offline
evaluations, FT-ARM is designed and tested for live inference, reflecting
real-time deployment conditions. Furthermore, it produces clinically grounded
natural-language explanations, improving interpretability and trust. By
integrating fine-tuning and reflective reasoning across multimodal inputs,

Motivation: ALPR systems face challenges from environmental factors, vehicle speeds, camera angles, and low-quality images, while being vital for traffic control, parking, vehicle tracking, toll collection, and law enforcement.

Method: Uses YOLOv8 for license plate detection and recognition, combined with semi-supervised learning framework that integrates manually labeled data with pseudo-labels generated by Grounding DINO for automatic annotation.

Result: Achieved 94% recall on CENPARMI dataset and 91% on UFPR-ALPR dataset, with character error rates reported for both datasets.

Conclusion: The semi-supervised approach with Grounding DINO enables efficient dataset scaling while maintaining label quality, significantly enhancing training process and overall model performance in license plate recognition.

Abstract: Developing a highly accurate automatic license plate recognition system
(ALPR) is challenging due to environmental factors such as lighting, rain, and
dust. Additional difficulties include high vehicle speeds, varying camera
angles, and low-quality or low-resolution images. ALPR is vital in traffic
control, parking, vehicle tracking, toll collection, and law enforcement
applications. This paper proposes a deep learning strategy using YOLOv8 for
license plate detection and recognition tasks. This method seeks to enhance the
performance of the model using datasets from Ontario, Quebec, California, and
New York State. It achieved an impressive recall rate of 94% on the dataset
from the Center for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (CENPARMI) and
91% on the UFPR-ALPR dataset. In addition, our method follows a semi-supervised
learning framework, combining a small set of manually labeled data with
pseudo-labels generated by Grounding DINO to train our detection model.
Grounding DINO, a powerful vision-language model, automatically annotates many
images with bounding boxes for license plates, thereby minimizing the reliance
on labor-intensive manual labeling. By integrating human-verified and
model-generated annotations, we can scale our dataset efficiently while
maintaining label quality, which significantly enhances the training process
and overall model performance. Furthermore, it reports character error rates
for both datasets, providing additional insight into system performance.

Method: Synergistic integration of convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with language representations using innovative tokenization modules to combine visual features from mammograms with structured textual descriptors from clinical metadata and synthesized reports.

Result: Superior performance in cancer detection and calcification identification compared to unimodal baselines, with particular improvements across diverse populations in multi-national cohort screening mammograms.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for clinically viable VLM-based CAD systems that effectively leverage imaging data and contextual patient information through effective fusion mechanisms.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among women in
the developed world. Early detection through mammography screening plays a
pivotal role in reducing mortality rates. While computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
systems have shown promise in assisting radiologists, existing approaches face
critical limitations in clinical deployment - particularly in handling the
nuanced interpretation of multi-modal data and feasibility due to the
requirement of prior clinical history. This study introduces a novel framework
that synergistically combines visual features from 2D mammograms with
structured textual descriptors derived from easily accessible clinical metadata
and synthesized radiological reports through innovative tokenization modules.
Our proposed methods in this study demonstrate that strategic integration of
convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with language representations achieves
superior performance to vision transformer-based models while handling
high-resolution images and enabling practical deployment across diverse
populations. By evaluating it on multi-national cohort screening mammograms,
our multi-modal approach achieves superior performance in cancer detection and
calcification identification compared to unimodal baselines, with particular
improvements. The proposed method establishes a new paradigm for developing
clinically viable VLM-based CAD systems that effectively leverage imaging data
and contextual patient information through effective fusion mechanisms.

*Zongxi Yu,Xiaolong Qian,Shaohua Gao,Qi Jiang,Yao Gao,Kailun Yang,Kaiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI), a co-designed framework using bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lenses that naturally encode depth into depth-varying PSFs, enabling joint recovery of high-fidelity All-in-Focus images and precise depth maps from single coded captures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the dual challenge in compact RGBD imaging where conventional optics struggle with RGB sharpness across depth-of-field and software-only Monocular Depth Estimation relies on unreliable semantic priors, while avoiding the fabrication complexity and chromatic aberrations of deep optics with elements like DOEs.

Method: Introduces a bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens that naturally encodes depth into depth-varying PSFs without complex elements. Establishes a physically-based forward model for synthetic dataset generation, co-designed with a dual-head, multi-scale reconstruction network using shared encoder to jointly recover AiF images and depth maps.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance: depth estimation with Abs Rel of 0.026 and RMSE of 0.130, outperforming software-only approaches and other deep optics systems; image restoration with SSIM of 0.960 and LPIPS of 0.082, confirming superior balance between image fidelity and depth accuracy.

Conclusion: Integration of bio-inspired fully spherical optics with joint reconstruction algorithm effectively addresses intrinsic challenges in high-performance compact RGBD imaging, demonstrating that simple spherical optics can achieve superior performance without complex diffractive or freeform elements.

Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity, compact RGBD imaging presents a dual challenge:
conventional compact optics struggle with RGB sharpness across the entire
depth-of-field, while software-only Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is an
ill-posed problem reliant on unreliable semantic priors. While deep optics with
elements like DOEs can encode depth, they introduce trade-offs in fabrication
complexity and chromatic aberrations, compromising simplicity. To address this,
we first introduce a novel bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens, around
which we build the Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI) framework, a holistic
co-design. This optical design naturally encodes depth into its depth-varying
Point Spread Functions (PSFs) without requiring complex diffractive or freeform
elements. We establish a rigorous physically-based forward model to generate a
synthetic dataset by precisely simulating the optical degradation process. This
simulation pipeline is co-designed with a dual-head, multi-scale reconstruction
network that employs a shared encoder to jointly recover a high-fidelity
All-in-Focus (AiF) image and a precise depth map from a single coded capture.
Extensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed
framework. In depth estimation, the method attains an Abs Rel of 0.026 and an
RMSE of 0.130, markedly outperforming leading software-only approaches and
other deep optics systems. For image restoration, the system achieves an SSIM
of 0.960 and a perceptual LPIPS score of 0.082, thereby confirming a superior
balance between image fidelity and depth accuracy. This study illustrates that
the integration of bio-inspired, fully spherical optics with a joint
reconstruction algorithm constitutes an effective strategy for addressing the
intrinsic challenges in high-performance compact RGBD imaging. Source code will

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models require expensive large-scale pretraining, creating efficiency concerns that discourage researchers from pretraining from scratch.

Method: Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP) adapts to input images and dynamically merges tokens in deeper layers of visual encoders.

Result: Significant GFLOP reduction while maintaining comparable classification/zero-shot performance on ImageNet and CLIP pretraining, with validation on biology datasets.

Conclusion: DRIP provides an effective approach to improve efficiency in vision-language model pretraining without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Recently, the advances in vision-language models, including contrastive
pretraining and instruction tuning, have greatly pushed the frontier of
multimodal AI. However, owing to the large-scale and hence expensive
pretraining, the efficiency concern has discouraged researchers from attempting
to pretrain a vision language model from scratch. In this work, we propose
Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP), which adapts to the
input images and dynamically merges tokens in the deeper layers of a visual
encoder. Our results on both ImageNet training from scratch and CLIP
contrastive pretraining demonstrate a significant GFLOP reduction while
maintaining comparable classification/zero-shot performance. To further
validate our proposed method, we conduct continual pretraining on a large
biology dataset, extending its impact into scientific domains.

*Xiang liu,Zhaoxiang Liu,Huan Hu,Zipeng Wang,Ping Chen,Zezhou Chen,Kai Wang,Shiguo Lian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel per-subject-tuning-free (PSTF) method for personalized image generation that enables precise control over facial attributes while preserving facial identity, using face recognition features mapped to StyleGAN2's latent space and a Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with precise facial attribute control in PSTF approaches, while tuning-based methods require extensive expertise and training data. There's a need for a solution that combines precise attribute control with PSTF simplicity.

Method: Uses face recognition model to extract identity features, maps them to StyleGAN2's W+ latent space via e4e encoder, and employs Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module to integrate identity, attribute features, and text embeddings in UNet architecture.

Result: The method successfully generates personalized images with fine-grained facial attribute control while preserving identity, without requiring additional fine-tuning or training data for individual identities.

Conclusion: The approach balances personalization with precise facial attribute control, offering an efficient and user-friendly solution for high-quality facial image synthesis that outperforms existing PSTF methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in personalized image generation have significantly
improved facial identity preservation, particularly in fields such as
entertainment and social media. However, existing methods still struggle to
achieve precise control over facial attributes in a per-subject-tuning-free
(PSTF) way. Tuning-based techniques like PreciseControl have shown promise by
providing fine-grained control over facial features, but they often require
extensive technical expertise and additional training data, limiting their
accessibility. In contrast, PSTF approaches simplify the process by enabling
image generation from a single facial input, but they lack precise control over
facial attributes. In this paper, we introduce a novel, PSTF method that
enables both precise control over facial attributes and high-fidelity
preservation of facial identity. Our approach utilizes a face recognition model
to extract facial identity features, which are then mapped into the $W^+$
latent space of StyleGAN2 using the e4e encoder. We further enhance the model
with a Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module, which integrates facial
identity, attribute features, and text embeddings into the UNet architecture,
ensuring clean separation of identity and attribute information. Trained on the
FFHQ dataset, our method allows for the generation of personalized images with
fine-grained control over facial attributes, while without requiring additional
fine-tuning or training data for individual identities. We demonstrate that our
approach successfully balances personalization with precise facial attribute
control, offering a more efficient and user-friendly solution for high-quality,
adaptable facial image synthesis. The code is publicly available at

*Chanhyeong Yang,Taehoon Song,Jihwan Park,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VDRP is a framework for zero-shot human-object interaction detection that addresses visual complexity through diversity-aware prompt learning and region-specific concept retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches fail to handle visual complexity in interactions, including intra-class diversity (same verb appearing in different poses/contexts) and inter-class entanglement (different verbs having similar visual patterns).

Method: Uses visual diversity-aware prompt learning with group-wise variance injection and Gaussian perturbation, plus region-specific concept retrieval from human/object/union regions to create region-aware prompts.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on HICO-DET benchmark under four zero-shot evaluation settings, effectively addressing both intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement.

Conclusion: The proposed VDRP framework successfully handles visual complexity in zero-shot HOI detection through diversity-aware and region-aware prompt learning strategies.

Abstract: Zero-shot Human-Object Interaction detection aims to localize humans and
objects in an image and recognize their interaction, even when specific
verb-object pairs are unseen during training. Recent works have shown promising
results using prompt learning with pretrained vision-language models such as
CLIP, which align natural language prompts with visual features in a shared
embedding space. However, existing approaches still fail to handle the visual
complexity of interaction, including (1) intra-class visual diversity, where
instances of the same verb appear in diverse poses and contexts, and (2)
inter-class visual entanglement, where distinct verbs yield visually similar
patterns. To address these challenges, we propose VDRP, a framework for Visual
Diversity and Region-aware Prompt learning. First, we introduce a visual
diversity-aware prompt learning strategy that injects group-wise visual
variance into the context embedding. We further apply Gaussian perturbation to
encourage the prompts to capture diverse visual variations of a verb. Second,
we retrieve region-specific concepts from the human, object, and union regions.
These are used to augment the diversity-aware prompt embeddings, yielding
region-aware prompts that enhance verb-level discrimination. Experiments on the
HICO-DET benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance under four zero-shot evaluation settings, effectively addressing
both intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Atlanta-world guided implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting for smooth indoor/urban scene reconstruction that preserves details while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing geometric priors lack global consistency for low-texture regions, and current methods (Gaussian Splatting, implicit SDF) suffer from discontinuities or computational inefficiencies causing detail loss.

Method: Combines Atlanta-world model for accurate surface reconstruction in low-texture regions with novel implicit-structured GS representations. Uses semantic GS representation to predict semantic region probabilities and structure plane regularization with learnable plane indicators.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both indoor and urban scenes, delivering superior surface reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: The proposed approach achieves smooth reconstruction while preserving high-frequency details and rendering efficiency, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of indoor and urban environments is a prominent research
topic with various downstream applications. However, existing geometric priors
for addressing low-texture regions in indoor and urban settings often lack
global consistency. Moreover, Gaussian Splatting and implicit SDF fields often
suffer from discontinuities or exhibit computational inefficiencies, resulting
in a loss of detail. To address these issues, we propose an Atlanta-world
guided implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting that achieves smooth indoor and
urban scene reconstruction while preserving high-frequency details and
rendering efficiency. By leveraging the Atlanta-world model, we ensure the
accurate surface reconstruction for low-texture regions, while the proposed
novel implicit-structured GS representations provide smoothness without
sacrificing efficiency and high-frequency details. Specifically, we propose a
semantic GS representation to predict the probability of all semantic regions
and deploy a structure plane regularization with learnable plane indicators for
global accurate surface reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both indoor and urban
scenes, delivering superior surface reconstruction quality.

*Qingdong Cai,Charith Abhayaratne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Region-CAM is a novel activation method that improves upon conventional CAM by generating more complete object coverage and precise boundaries through semantic information maps and propagation using both gradients and features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional CAM methods only highlight the most discriminative regions, failing to cover entire objects and having poor boundary alignment, which limits performance in weakly supervised semantic segmentation tasks.

Method: Region-CAM generates activation maps by extracting semantic information maps (SIMs) and performing semantic information propagation (SIP) using both gradients and features from all stages of the baseline classification model.

Result: Achieved 60.12% mIoU on PASCAL VOC training set (13.61% improvement over CAM), 58.43% on validation set (13.13% improvement), and 36.38% on MS COCO (16.23% improvement). Also achieved 51.7% Top-1 localization accuracy on ILSVRC2012, outperforming LayerCAM by 4.5%.

Conclusion: Region-CAM significantly outperforms conventional CAM methods by providing more complete object coverage and precise boundaries, making it highly effective for weakly supervised learning tasks.

Abstract: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods are widely applied in weakly
supervised learning tasks due to their ability to highlight object regions.
However, conventional CAM methods highlight only the most discriminative
regions of the target. These highlighted regions often fail to cover the entire
object and are frequently misaligned with object boundaries, thereby limiting
the performance of downstream weakly supervised learning tasks, particularly
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which demands pixel-wise
accurate activation maps to get the best results. To alleviate the above
problems, we propose a novel activation method, Region-CAM. Distinct from
network feature weighting approaches, Region-CAM generates activation maps by
extracting semantic information maps (SIMs) and performing semantic information
propagation (SIP) by considering both gradients and features in each of the
stages of the baseline classification model. Our approach highlights a greater
proportion of object regions while ensuring activation maps to have precise
boundaries that align closely with object edges. Region-CAM achieves 60.12% and
58.43% mean intersection over union (mIoU) using the baseline model on the
PASCAL VOC training and validation datasets, respectively, which are
improvements of 13.61% and 13.13% over the original CAM (46.51% and 45.30%). On
the MS COCO validation set, Region-CAM achieves 36.38%, a 16.23% improvement
over the original CAM (20.15%). We also demonstrate the superiority of
Region-CAM in object localization tasks, using the ILSVRC2012 validation set.
Region-CAM achieves 51.7% in Top-1 Localization accuracy Loc1. Compared with
LayerCAM, an activation method designed for weakly supervised object
localization, Region-CAM achieves 4.5% better performance in Loc1.

Motivation: Existing reconstruction-based methods for detecting AI-generated images lack theoretical foundations, rely on empirical heuristics, and have limitations in interpretability and reliability.

Conclusion: The proposed ReGap method provides a more reliable and interpretable approach for AI-generated image detection by addressing limitations of static reconstruction error methods through dynamic error measurement.

Abstract: The rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made detecting
AI-generated images a critical challenge for ensuring authenticity. Existing
reconstruction-based methods lack theoretical foundations and on empirical
heuristics, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this paper, we
introduce the Jacobian-Spectral Lower Bound for reconstruction error from a
geometric perspective, showing that real images off the reconstruction manifold
exhibit a non-trivial error lower bound, while generated images on the manifold
have near-zero error. Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of existing
methods that rely on static reconstruction error from a single pass. These
methods often fail when some real images exhibit lower error than generated
ones. This counterintuitive behavior reduces detection accuracy and requires
data-specific threshold tuning, limiting their applicability in real-world
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReGap, a training-free
method that computes dynamic reconstruction error by leveraging structured
editing operations to introduce controlled perturbations. This enables
measuring error changes before and after editing, improving detection accuracy
by enhancing error separation. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms existing baselines, exhibits robustness to common post-processing
operations and generalizes effectively across diverse conditions.

Conclusion: Establishes a unified and efficient framework for joint online 3D reconstruction and holistic scene understanding, enabling a broad range of downstream tasks.

Abstract: Current 3D scene understanding methods are limited by offline-collected
multi-view data or pre-constructed 3D geometry. In this paper, we present
ExtractAnything3D (EA3D), a unified online framework for open-world 3D object
extraction that enables simultaneous geometric reconstruction and holistic
scene understanding. Given a streaming video, EA3D dynamically interprets each

Gaussian feature map via a feed-forward online update strategy. We then
iteratively estimate visual odometry from historical frames and incrementally
update online Gaussian features with new observations. A recurrent joint
optimization module directs the model's attention to regions of interest,
simultaneously enhancing both geometric reconstruction and semantic
understanding. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and tasks,
including photo-realistic rendering, semantic and instance segmentation, 3D

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical translation of thin film interferometry is hindered by challenges in reconstructing thickness profiles from interference patterns - an ill-posed inverse problem complicated by phase periodicity, imaging noise, and ambient artifacts. Traditional methods are computationally intensive, noise-sensitive, or require manual expert analysis.

Abstract: Thin film interferometry is a powerful technique for non-invasively measuring
liquid film thickness with applications in ophthalmology, but its clinical
translation is hindered by the challenges in reconstructing thickness profiles
from interference patterns - an ill-posed inverse problem complicated by phase
periodicity, imaging noise and ambient artifacts. Traditional reconstruction
methods are either computationally intensive, sensitive to noise, or require
manual expert analysis, which is impractical for real-time diagnostics. To
address this challenge, here we present a vision transformer-based approach for
real-time inference of thin liquid film thickness profiles directly from
isolated interferograms. Trained on a hybrid dataset combining
physiologically-relevant synthetic and experimental tear film data, our model
leverages long-range spatial correlations to resolve phase ambiguities and
reconstruct temporally coherent thickness profiles in a single forward pass
from dynamic interferograms acquired in vivo and ex vivo. The network
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on noisy, rapidly-evolving films with
motion artifacts, overcoming limitations of conventional phase-unwrapping and
iterative fitting methods. Our data-driven approach enables automated,
consistent thickness reconstruction at real-time speeds on consumer hardware,
opening new possibilities for continuous monitoring of pre-lens ocular tear
films and non-invasive diagnosis of conditions such as the dry eye disease.

*Wenhao Zheng,Chenwei Sun,Wenbo Zhang,Jiancheng Lv,Xianggen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TGBFN is a novel framework for quantitatively constrained CAD generation that handles multi-modal CAD sequences in a unified continuous parameter space using guided Bayesian flow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models lag in multi-modal data generation like parametric CAD sequences due to challenges with long-range constraints and parameter sensitivity.

Method: TGBFN handles discrete commands and continuous parameters in a unified continuous differentiable space, introduces guided Bayesian flow to control CAD properties, and constructs a new dataset for evaluation.

Result: Extensive comparisons show TGBFN achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating high-fidelity, condition-aware CAD sequences across single-condition and multi-condition tasks.

Conclusion: TGBFN successfully addresses the challenges of multi-modal CAD generation and demonstrates superior performance in constrained generation tasks.

Abstract: Deep generative models, such as diffusion models, have shown promising
progress in image generation and audio generation via simplified continuity
assumptions. However, the development of generative modeling techniques for
generating multi-modal data, such as parametric CAD sequences, still lags
behind due to the challenges in addressing long-range constraints and parameter
sensitivity. In this work, we propose a novel framework for quantitatively
constrained CAD generation, termed Target-Guided Bayesian Flow Network (TGBFN).
For the first time, TGBFN handles the multi-modality of CAD sequences (i.e.,
discrete commands and continuous parameters) in a unified continuous and
differentiable parameter space rather than in the discrete data space. In
addition, TGBFN penetrates the parameter update kernel and introduces a guided
Bayesian flow to control the CAD properties. To evaluate TGBFN, we construct a
new dataset for quantitatively constrained CAD generation. Extensive
comparisons across single-condition and multi-condition constrained generation
tasks demonstrate that TGBFN achieves state-of-the-art performance in
generating high-fidelity, condition-aware CAD sequences. The code is available

### [46] [$D^2GS$: Dense Depth Regularization for LiDAR-free Urban Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25173)
*Kejing Xia,Jidong Jia,Ke Jin,Yucai Bai,Li Sun,Dacheng Tao,Youjian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D²GS is a LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework that uses multi-view depth predictions and Gaussian Splatting to achieve geometry quality comparable to LiDAR-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current urban scene reconstruction methods rely on multimodal sensors (LiDAR + images), which face challenges in acquiring accurate LiDAR data due to spatiotemporal calibration requirements and reprojection errors from sensor misalignment.

Method: 1) Initialize dense point cloud from multi-view metric depth predictions with Progressive Pruning optimization; 2) Jointly refine Gaussian geometry and depth via Depth Enhancer using diffusion priors; 3) Improve ground geometry by constraining Gaussian shape/normal attributes in road regions.

Result: Extensive experiments on Waymo dataset show the method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing more accurate geometry even compared to methods using ground-truth LiDAR data.

Conclusion: D²GS successfully achieves LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction with geometry quality comparable to LiDAR-based approaches, overcoming the practical challenges of acquiring accurate LiDAR data.

Abstract: Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown great potential for urban scene
reconstruction in the field of autonomous driving. However, current urban scene
reconstruction methods often depend on multimodal sensors as inputs,
\textit{i.e.} LiDAR and images. Though the geometry prior provided by LiDAR
point clouds can largely mitigate ill-posedness in reconstruction, acquiring
such accurate LiDAR data is still challenging in practice: i) precise
spatiotemporal calibration between LiDAR and other sensors is required, as they
may not capture data simultaneously; ii) reprojection errors arise from spatial
misalignment when LiDAR and cameras are mounted at different locations. To
avoid the difficulty of acquiring accurate LiDAR depth, we propose $D^2GS$, a
LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework. In this work, we obtain
geometry priors that are as effective as LiDAR while being denser and more
accurate. $\textbf{First}$, we initialize a dense point cloud by
back-projecting multi-view metric depth predictions. This point cloud is then
optimized by a Progressive Pruning strategy to improve the global consistency.
$\textbf{Second}$, we jointly refine Gaussian geometry and predicted dense
metric depth via a Depth Enhancer. Specifically, we leverage diffusion priors
from a depth foundation model to enhance the depth maps rendered by Gaussians.
In turn, the enhanced depths provide stronger geometric constraints during
Gaussian training. $\textbf{Finally}$, we improve the accuracy of ground
geometry by constraining the shape and normal attributes of Gaussians within
road regions. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing more
accurate geometry even when compared with those using ground-truth LiDAR data.

### [47] [Classifier Enhancement Using Extended Context and Domain Experts for Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25174)
*Huadong Tang,Youpeng Zhao,Min Xu,Jun Wang,Qiang Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an Extended Context-Aware Classifier (ECAC) that dynamically adjusts semantic segmentation classifiers using both dataset-level and image-level contextual information to address class imbalance and improve pixel-level labeling accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard semantic segmentation classifiers use fixed parameters that don't adapt to individual image characteristics, and class imbalance causes bias toward majority classes, limiting effectiveness for minority class segmentation.

Method: Uses memory bank to learn dataset-level contextual information, incorporates image-specific contextual information, and employs teacher-student network paradigm where teacher dynamically adjusts contextual information with ground truth and transfers knowledge to student.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ADE20K, COCO-Stuff10K, and Pascal-Context datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed ECAC effectively addresses class imbalance and improves semantic segmentation by dynamically adapting classifiers to both global and local contextual information.

Abstract: Prevalent semantic segmentation methods generally adopt a vanilla classifier
to categorize each pixel into specific classes.
  Although such a classifier learns global information from the training data,
this information is represented by a set of fixed parameters (weights and
biases).
  However, each image has a different class distribution, which prevents the
classifier from addressing the unique characteristics of individual images.
  At the dataset level, class imbalance leads to segmentation results being
biased towards majority classes, limiting the model's effectiveness in
identifying and segmenting minority class regions.
  In this paper, we propose an Extended Context-Aware Classifier (ECAC) that
dynamically adjusts the classifier using global (dataset-level) and local
(image-level) contextual information.
  Specifically, we leverage a memory bank to learn dataset-level contextual
information of each class, incorporating the class-specific contextual
information from the current image to improve the classifier for precise pixel
labeling.
  Additionally, a teacher-student network paradigm is adopted, where the domain
expert (teacher network) dynamically adjusts contextual information with ground
truth and transfers knowledge to the student network.
  Comprehensive experiments illustrate that the proposed ECAC can achieve
state-of-the-art performance across several datasets, including ADE20K,
COCO-Stuff10K, and Pascal-Context.

### [48] [Test-Time Adaptive Object Detection with Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25175)
*Yingjie Gao,Yanan Zhang,Zhi Cai,Di Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A foundation model-powered test-time adaptive object detection method that eliminates source data dependency and closed-set limitations, using multi-modal prompt tuning and instance dynamic memory for domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time adaptive object detection methods rely on source data and assume identical category spaces between source and target domains, which limits real-world applicability.

Method: Multi-modal Prompt-based Mean-Teacher framework with text and visual prompt tuning, Test-time Warm-start strategy for visual prompts, and Instance Dynamic Memory module with Memory Enhancement and Memory Hallucination strategies.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent outperformance over state-of-the-art methods on cross-corruption and cross-dataset benchmarks, adapting to arbitrary cross-domain and cross-category target data.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully eliminates source data dependency, overcomes closed-set limitations, and achieves superior performance in test-time adaptive object detection across various domain shifts.

Abstract: In recent years, test-time adaptive object detection has attracted increasing
attention due to its unique advantages in online domain adaptation, which
aligns more closely with real-world application scenarios. However, existing
approaches heavily rely on source-derived statistical characteristics while
making the strong assumption that the source and target domains share an
identical category space. In this paper, we propose the first foundation
model-powered test-time adaptive object detection method that eliminates the
need for source data entirely and overcomes traditional closed-set limitations.
Specifically, we design a Multi-modal Prompt-based Mean-Teacher framework for
vision-language detector-driven test-time adaptation, which incorporates text
and visual prompt tuning to adapt both language and vision representation
spaces on the test data in a parameter-efficient manner. Correspondingly, we
propose a Test-time Warm-start strategy tailored for the visual prompts to
effectively preserve the representation capability of the vision branch.
Furthermore, to guarantee high-quality pseudo-labels in every test batch, we
maintain an Instance Dynamic Memory (IDM) module that stores high-quality
pseudo-labels from previous test samples, and propose two novel
strategies-Memory Enhancement and Memory Hallucination-to leverage IDM's
high-quality instances for enhancing original predictions and hallucinating
images without available pseudo-labels, respectively. Extensive experiments on
cross-corruption and cross-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, and can adapt to
arbitrary cross-domain and cross-category target data. Code is available at

Method: Uses YOLOv5 network trained on proprietary dataset for face detection from students' webcams, followed by residual network for deep feature extraction, and Euclidean distance comparison against student face databases for identity verification.

Result: The proposed system successfully identifies individuals' faces from online camera images and performs accurate identity authentication through deep feature extraction and database comparison.

Conclusion: The deep learning-based authentication approach enhances online education security and stability, enabling it to keep pace with the rapidly evolving educational landscape.

Abstract: In the contemporary landscape, the fusion of information technology and the
rapid advancement of artificial intelligence have ushered school education into
a transformative phase characterized by digitization and heightened
intelligence. Concurrently, the global paradigm shift caused by the Covid-19
pandemic has catalyzed the evolution of e-learning, accentuating its
significance. Amidst these developments, one pivotal facet of the online
education paradigm that warrants attention is the authentication of identities
within the digital learning sphere. Within this context, our study delves into
a solution for online learning authentication, utilizing an enhanced
convolutional neural network architecture, specifically the residual network
model. By harnessing the power of deep learning, this technological approach
aims to galvanize the ongoing progress of online education, while concurrently
bolstering its security and stability. Such fortification is imperative in
enabling online education to seamlessly align with the swift evolution of the
educational landscape. This paper's focal proposition involves the deployment
of the YOLOv5 network, meticulously trained on our proprietary dataset. This
network is tasked with identifying individuals' faces culled from images
captured by students' open online cameras. The resultant facial information is
then channeled into the residual network to extract intricate features at a
deeper level. Subsequently, a comparative analysis of Euclidean distances
against students' face databases is performed, effectively ascertaining the
identity of each student.

### [50] [Learning Disentangled Speech- and Expression-Driven Blendshapes for 3D Talking Face Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25234)
*Yuxiang Mao,Zhijie Zhang,Zhiheng Zhang,Jiawei Liu,Chen Zeng,Shihong Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for generating emotionally expressive 3D talking faces by modeling facial animation as a linear additive problem that combines speech-driven and emotion-driven blendshapes with sparsity constraints for disentanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D facial animation methods focus mainly on speech-driven lip-sync but lack emotional expressivity. The scarcity of real emotional 3D talking-face datasets due to high capture costs motivates the need for a data-efficient approach.

Method: Model facial animation as linear additive problem using speech and emotion blendshapes. Use VOCAset (neutral expressions) and Florence4D (expression sequences) datasets. Apply sparsity constraint loss for disentanglement while capturing cross-domain deformations. Map learned blendshapes to FLAME model parameters for 3D Gaussian avatar animation.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative experiments show natural generation of talking faces with specified expressions while maintaining accurate lip synchronization. Perceptual studies demonstrate superior emotional expressivity compared to existing methods without compromising lip-sync quality.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully generates emotionally expressive 3D talking faces by combining speech and emotion blendshapes with sparsity constraints, achieving both accurate lip-sync and enhanced emotional expressivity using limited training data.

Abstract: Expressions are fundamental to conveying human emotions. With the rapid
advancement of AI-generated content (AIGC), realistic and expressive 3D facial
animation has become increasingly crucial. Despite recent progress in
speech-driven lip-sync for talking-face animation, generating emotionally
expressive talking faces remains underexplored. A major obstacle is the
scarcity of real emotional 3D talking-face datasets due to the high cost of
data capture. To address this, we model facial animation driven by both speech
and emotion as a linear additive problem. Leveraging a 3D talking-face dataset
with neutral expressions (VOCAset) and a dataset of 3D expression sequences
(Florence4D), we jointly learn a set of blendshapes driven by speech and
emotion. We introduce a sparsity constraint loss to encourage disentanglement
between the two types of blendshapes while allowing the model to capture
inherent secondary cross-domain deformations present in the training data. The
learned blendshapes can be further mapped to the expression and jaw pose
parameters of the FLAME model, enabling the animation of 3D Gaussian avatars.
Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method naturally
generates talking faces with specified expressions while maintaining accurate
lip synchronization. Perceptual studies further show that our approach achieves
superior emotional expressivity compared to existing methods, without
compromising lip-sync quality.

Abstract: Early diagnosis of critical diseases can significantly improve patient
survival and reduce treatment costs. However, existing diagnostic techniques
are often costly, invasive, and inaccessible in low-resource regions. This
paper presents a multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic framework
integrating image analysis, thermal imaging, and audio signal processing for
early detection of three major health conditions: skin cancer, vascular blood
clots, and cardiopulmonary abnormalities. A fine-tuned MobileNetV2
convolutional neural network was trained on the ISIC 2019 dataset for skin
lesion classification, achieving 89.3% accuracy, 91.6% sensitivity, and 88.2%
specificity. A support vector machine (SVM) with handcrafted features was
employed for thermal clot detection, achieving 86.4% accuracy (AUC = 0.89) on
synthetic and clinical data. For cardiopulmonary analysis, lung and heart sound
datasets from PhysioNet and Pascal were processed using Mel-Frequency Cepstral
Coefficients (MFCC) and classified via Random Forest, reaching 87.2% accuracy
and 85.7% sensitivity. Comparative evaluation against state-of-the-art models

*Junsheng Zhou,Xingyu Shi,Haichuan Song,Yi Fang,Yu-Shen Liu,Zhizhong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: U-CAN is an unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising using Consistency-Aware Noise2Noise matching, achieving results comparable to supervised methods without requiring clean data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point clouds from scanning sensors often contain noise that negatively impacts downstream tasks. Previous supervised methods require extensive manual effort to create noisy-clean pairs.

Method: U-CAN uses a neural network to infer multi-step denoising paths with Noise2Noise matching, employing statistical reasoning on multiple noisy observations and enforcing denoised geometry consistency constraints.

Result: Significant improvement over state-of-the-art unsupervised methods in point cloud denoising, upsampling, and image denoising benchmarks, producing comparable results to supervised methods.

Conclusion: U-CAN provides an effective unsupervised alternative to supervised denoising methods, with the consistency constraint being generalizable beyond 3D to 2D image denoising.

Abstract: Point clouds captured by scanning sensors are often perturbed by noise, which
have a highly negative impact on downstream tasks (e.g. surface reconstruction
and shape understanding). Previous works mostly focus on training neural
networks with noisy-clean point cloud pairs for learning denoising priors,
which requires extensively manual efforts. In this work, we introduce U-CAN, an
Unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising with Consistency-Aware
Noise2Noise matching. Specifically, we leverage a neural network to infer a
multi-step denoising path for each point of a shape or scene with a noise to
noise matching scheme. We achieve this by a novel loss which enables
statistical reasoning on multiple noisy point cloud observations. We further
introduce a novel constraint on the denoised geometry consistency for learning
consistency-aware denoising patterns. We justify that the proposed constraint
is a general term which is not limited to 3D domain and can also contribute to
the area of 2D image denoising. Our evaluations under the widely used
benchmarks in point cloud denoising, upsampling and image denoising show
significant improvement over the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, where
U-CAN also produces comparable results with the supervised methods.

TL;DR: MSF-Net is a novel photometric stereo framework that extracts multi-stage features with selective update strategy and feature fusion to improve surface normal estimation accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on the DiLiGenT benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based photometric stereo approaches fail to accurately capture features at multiple stages and don't adequately promote interaction between features, leading to redundant feature extraction especially in intricate areas like wrinkles and edges.

Method: Proposed MSF-Net with multi-stage feature extraction, selective update strategy to extract high-quality features, and a feature fusion module to improve interplay among different features for accurate normal construction.

Result: Experimental results on the DiLiGenT benchmark show that MSF-Net significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in surface normal estimation accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed MSF-Net framework effectively addresses limitations of existing photometric stereo methods by enabling better multi-stage feature extraction and interaction, leading to superior performance in surface normal estimation.

Abstract: Photometric stereo is a technique aimed at determining surface normals
through the utilization of shading cues derived from images taken under
different lighting conditions. However, existing learning-based approaches
often fail to accurately capture features at multiple stages and do not
adequately promote interaction between these features. Consequently, these
models tend to extract redundant features, especially in areas with intricate
details such as wrinkles and edges. To tackle these issues, we propose MSF-Net,
a novel framework for extracting information at multiple stages, paired with
selective update strategy, aiming to extract high-quality feature information,
which is critical for accurate normal construction. Additionally, we have
developed a feature fusion module to improve the interplay among different
features. Experimental results on the DiLiGenT benchmark show that our proposed
MSF-Net significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in the
accuracy of surface normal estimation.

*Runxi Huang,Mingxuan Yu,Mingyu Tsoi,Xiaomin Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMEdge is a real-time multimodal inference framework for edge devices that uses pipelined sensing and encoding to reduce latency while maintaining accuracy through temporal aggregation and adaptive optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time multimodal inference on resource-constrained edge devices is essential for applications like autonomous driving and human-computer interaction, but prior work overlooks the coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as inter-modality dependencies.

Method: MMEdge decomposes inference into fine-grained sensing/encoding units for incremental computation, uses temporal aggregation to capture dynamics, incorporates adaptive configuration optimization for resource constraints, and employs cross-modal speculative skipping to bypass slower modalities when early predictions are confident.

Result: Evaluation on multimodal datasets and UAV testbed shows MMEdge significantly reduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various system and data dynamics.

Conclusion: MMEdge provides an effective solution for real-time multimodal inference on edge devices by addressing the tight coupling between sensing and execution through pipelined design and adaptive optimization techniques.

Abstract: Real-time multimodal inference on resource-constrained edge devices is
essential for applications such as autonomous driving, human-computer
interaction, and mobile health. However, prior work often overlooks the tight
coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex
inter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device
multi-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding.
Instead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire
inference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units,
allowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also
introduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that
captures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain
accuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for
fine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during
inference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and
input data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration
optimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for
each modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping
mechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early
predictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public
multimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV)-based multimodal testbed. The results show that MMEdge significantly
reduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various
system and data dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SFDA approaches ignore sample difficulty and struggle with noisy supervision under domain shift, especially in medical imaging with privacy constraints.

Method: Partitions unlabeled images into reliable/unreliable subsets via entropy-similarity analysis, refines pseudo-labels with Monte Carlo-based denoising masks, and uses intra-/inter-domain patch mixing objectives.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art Dice and ASSD scores on benchmark datasets, showing consistent gains over prior SFDA and UDA methods with better boundary delineation.

Conclusion: Progressive adaptation and denoised supervision are crucial for robust medical image segmentation under domain shift in privacy-constrained settings.

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is emerging as a compelling solution for
medical image segmentation under privacy constraints, yet current approaches
often ignore sample difficulty and struggle with noisy supervision under domain
shift. We present a new SFDA framework that leverages Hard Sample Selection and
Denoised Patch Mixing to progressively align target distributions. First,
unlabeled images are partitioned into reliable and unreliable subsets through
entropy-similarity analysis, allowing adaptation to start from easy samples and
gradually incorporate harder ones. Next, pseudo-labels are refined via Monte
Carlo-based denoising masks, which suppress unreliable pixels and stabilize
training. Finally, intra- and inter-domain objectives mix patches between
subsets, transferring reliable semantics while mitigating noise. Experiments on
benchmark datasets show consistent gains over prior SFDA and UDA methods,
delivering more accurate boundary delineation and achieving state-of-the-art
Dice and ASSD scores. Our study highlights the importance of progressive
adaptation and denoised supervision for robust segmentation under domain shift.

*Kim Shin Seong,Mingi Kwon,Jaeseok Jeong,Youngjung Uh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach to improve rectified flow by incorporating real images into training, reducing reliance on large generated datasets while achieving better FID scores and straighter ODE paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rectified flow faces challenges including high computational costs from requiring many generative pairs and bias towards generated data. The authors aim to address these limitations by preserving ODE paths for real images.

Method: The approach incorporates real images into the training process, preserving ODE paths for real images and using a smaller set of generated and real images for efficient reflow.

Result: In CIFAR-10, achieved significantly better FID scores in both one-step and full-step simulations using only a fraction of generative pairs compared to original method. Also induced straighter paths and avoided saturation on generated images.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables more robust ODE learning while preserving real image distribution, demonstrating that reflow can be conducted efficiently with smaller datasets of generated and real images.

Abstract: Rectified flow is a generative model that learns smooth transport mappings
between two distributions through an ordinary differential equation (ODE).
Unlike diffusion-based generative models, which require costly numerical
integration of a generative ODE to sample images with state-of-the-art quality,
rectified flow uses an iterative process called reflow to learn smooth and
straight ODE paths. This allows for relatively simple and efficient generation
of high-quality images. However, rectified flow still faces several challenges.
1) The reflow process requires a large number of generative pairs to preserve
the target distribution, leading to significant computational costs. 2) Since
the model is typically trained using only generated image pairs, its
performance heavily depends on the 1-rectified flow model, causing it to become
biased towards the generated data.
  In this work, we experimentally expose the limitations of the original
rectified flow and propose a novel approach that incorporates real images into
the training process. By preserving the ODE paths for real images, our method
effectively reduces reliance on large amounts of generated data. Instead, we
demonstrate that the reflow process can be conducted efficiently using a much
smaller set of generated and real images. In CIFAR-10, we achieved
significantly better FID scores, not only in one-step generation but also in
full-step simulations, while using only of the generative pairs compared to the
original method. Furthermore, our approach induces straighter paths and avoids
saturation on generated images during reflow, leading to more robust ODE
learning while preserving the distribution of real images.

*Doan-Van-Anh Ly,Thi-Thu-Hien Pham,Thanh-Hai Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResNet-based UNet3+ with CBAM attention module outperforms Transformer and Mamba backbones for liver tumor segmentation in CECT images, achieving best Dice score (0.755), IoU (0.662), and boundary precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Liver structure segmentation in multi-phase CECT is crucial for computer-aided diagnosis and treatment planning of liver diseases including tumor detection.

Method: Evaluated UNet-based architectures with various backbones (ResNet, Transformer, Mamba) pretrained weights, then integrated attention mechanisms including CBAM to improve segmentation quality.

Result: ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM achieved best performance: Dice 0.755, IoU 0.662, HD95 77.911, accuracy 0.925, specificity 0.926. Transformer and Mamba backbones underperformed compared to ResNet.

Conclusion: Classical ResNet architecture combined with modern attention modules remains highly competitive for medical image segmentation, offering promising direction for liver tumor detection in clinical practice.

Abstract: Segmentation of liver structures in multi-phase contrast-enhanced computed
tomography (CECT) plays a crucial role in computer-aided diagnosis and
treatment planning for liver diseases, including tumor detection. In this
study, we investigate the performance of UNet-based architectures for liver
tumor segmentation, starting from the original UNet and extending to UNet3+
with various backbone networks. We evaluate ResNet, Transformer-based, and
State-space (Mamba) backbones, all initialized with pretrained weights.
Surprisingly, despite the advances in modern architecture, ResNet-based models
consistently outperform Transformer- and Mamba-based alternatives across
multiple evaluation metrics. To further improve segmentation quality, we
introduce attention mechanisms into the backbone and observe that incorporating
the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the best performance.
ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM module not only produced the best overlap metrics with a
Dice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, but also achieved the most precise
boundary delineation, evidenced by the lowest HD95 distance of 77.911. The
model's superiority was further cemented by its leading overall accuracy of
0.925 and specificity of 0.926, showcasing its robust capability in accurately
identifying both lesion and healthy tissue. To further enhance
interpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations were employed to highlight the
region's most influential predictions, providing insights into its
decision-making process. These findings demonstrate that classical ResNet
architecture, when combined with modern attention modules, remain highly
competitive for medical image segmentation tasks, offering a promising
direction for liver tumor detection in clinical practice.

### [58] [RegionE: Adaptive Region-Aware Generation for Efficient Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25590)
*Pengtao Chen,Xianfang Zeng,Maosen Zhao,Mingzhu Shen,Peng Ye,Bangyin Xiang,Zhibo Wang,Wei Cheng,Gang Yu,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegionE is a region-aware generation framework that accelerates instruction-based image editing by distinguishing between edited and unedited regions, applying different denoising strategies to each region for faster processing while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing instruction-based image editing models apply uniform generation processes across entire images, failing to account for the significant differences in generation difficulty and computational redundancy between edited and unedited regions.

Method: RegionE framework includes: 1) Adaptive region partition based on trajectory analysis, 2) Region-aware generation with one-step prediction for unedited areas and local iterative denoising for edited regions using Region-Instruction KV Cache, 3) Adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate local denoising by leveraging velocity similarity between adjacent timesteps.

Result: Applied to state-of-the-art IIE models (Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, Qwen-Image-Edit), RegionE achieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06 respectively, while GPT-4o evaluations confirmed preserved semantic and perceptual fidelity.

Conclusion: RegionE provides an effective training-free acceleration framework for instruction-based image editing by exploiting regional differences in generation requirements, achieving significant speed improvements without compromising quality.

Abstract: Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread
attention. In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,
while the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of
regions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational
redundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead
applying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates
us to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that
accelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE
framework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We
observed that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for
multi-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in
the early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited
regions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the
reference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,
we replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.
For edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative
denoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,
we propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost
while incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.
Observing that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity
similarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate
the local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base
models, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE
achieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06. Evaluations by GPT-4o
confirmed that semantic and perceptual fidelity were well preserved.

TL;DR: DeepShield is a novel deepfake detection framework that combines local patch guidance and global forgery diversification to improve robustness across unseen manipulation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detectors perform well in in-domain scenarios but fail to generalize across diverse manipulation techniques due to reliance on forgery-specific artifacts, raising concerns about fraud and misinformation.

Method: DeepShield enhances CLIP-ViT encoder with two components: Local Patch Guidance (LPG) for spatiotemporal artifact modeling and patch-wise supervision, and Global Forgery Diversification (GFD) for domain feature augmentation through domain-bridging and boundary-expanding feature generation.

Result: DeepShield outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation evaluations, achieving superior robustness against unseen deepfake attacks.

Conclusion: The integration of novel local and global analysis in DeepShield provides effective deepfake detection with enhanced cross-domain adaptability and robustness.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative models have made it easier to manipulate
face videos, raising significant concerns about their potential misuse for
fraud and misinformation. Existing detectors often perform well in in-domain
scenarios but fail to generalize across diverse manipulation techniques due to
their reliance on forgery-specific artifacts. In this work, we introduce
DeepShield, a novel deepfake detection framework that balances local
sensitivity and global generalization to improve robustness across unseen
forgeries. DeepShield enhances the CLIP-ViT encoder through two key components:
Local Patch Guidance (LPG) and Global Forgery Diversification (GFD). LPG
applies spatiotemporal artifact modeling and patch-wise supervision to capture
fine-grained inconsistencies often overlooked by global models. GFD introduces
domain feature augmentation, leveraging domain-bridging and boundary-expanding
feature generation to synthesize diverse forgeries, mitigating overfitting and
enhancing cross-domain adaptability. Through the integration of novel local and
global analysis for deepfake detection, DeepShield outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation evaluations, achieving superior
robustness against unseen deepfake attacks.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates deep learning models for classifying Trees Outside Forests (TOF) using high-resolution aerial imagery, comparing six semantic segmentation architectures to map four woody vegetation categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TOF play crucial ecological roles but are often treated as a single class or use rigid thresholds, limiting ecological interpretation and regional adaptability.

Method: Used deep learning with CNNs, vision transformers, and hybrid models across six architectures (ABCNet, LSKNet, FT-UNetFormer, DC-Swin, BANet, U-Net) on high-resolution aerial imagery from four German agricultural landscapes to classify Forest, Patch, Linear, and Tree categories.

Result: Models achieved good accuracy overall, with FT-UNetFormer performing best (mean IoU 0.74; mean F1 score 0.84). Good results for Forest and Linear classes, but challenges with complex Patch and Tree structures with high edge density.

Conclusion: Spatial context understanding is crucial for TOF mapping. Generalization experiments show need for regionally diverse training data for reliable large-scale mapping. Dataset and code are publicly available.

Abstract: Trees Outside Forests (TOF) play an important role in agricultural landscapes
by supporting biodiversity, sequestering carbon, and regulating microclimates.
Yet, most studies have treated TOF as a single class or relied on rigid
rule-based thresholds, limiting ecological interpretation and adaptability
across regions. To address this, we evaluate deep learning for TOF
classification using a newly generated dataset and high-resolution aerial
imagery from four agricultural landscapes in Germany. Specifically, we compare
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers, and hybrid
CNN-transformer models across six semantic segmentation architectures (ABCNet,
LSKNet, FT-UNetFormer, DC-Swin, BANet, and U-Net) to map four categories of
woody vegetation: Forest, Patch, Linear, and Tree, derived from previous
studies and governmental products. Overall, the models achieved good
classification accuracy across the four landscapes, with the FT-UNetFormer
performing best (mean Intersection-over-Union 0.74; mean F1 score 0.84),
underscoring the importance of spatial context understanding in TOF mapping and
classification. Our results show good results for Forest and Linear class and
reveal challenges particularly in classifying complex structures with high edge
density, notably the Patch and Tree class. Our generalization experiments
highlight the need for regionally diverse training data to ensure reliable
large-scale mapping. The dataset and code are openly available at

TL;DR: A distillation framework using Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to enhance lightweight object detectors without increasing deployment overhead, achieving state-of-the-art performance on COCO dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lightweight network designs for high-speed inference often degrade feature representation, limiting performance improvements and practical on-device deployment. The paper aims to leverage VFMs' capabilities to enhance lightweight detectors.

Method: Proposes a distillation framework with Deep Semantic Injector (DSI) module for integrating VFM representations into detector layers, and Gradient-guided Adaptive Modulation (GAM) strategy for dynamic semantic transfer adjustment based on gradient norm ratios.

Result: RT-DETRv4 achieves state-of-the-art results on COCO with AP scores of 49.7/53.5/55.4/57.0 at speeds of 273/169/124/78 FPS respectively, delivering consistent performance gains across diverse DETR-based models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a cost-effective and adaptable solution for enhancing lightweight object detectors using VFMs, enabling practical real-time detection without increasing deployment and inference overhead.

Abstract: Real-time object detection has achieved substantial progress through
meticulously designed architectures and optimization strategies. However, the
pursuit of high-speed inference via lightweight network designs often leads to
degraded feature representation, which hinders further performance improvements
and practical on-device deployment. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective
and highly adaptable distillation framework that harnesses the rapidly evolving
capabilities of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to enhance lightweight object
detectors. Given the significant architectural and learning objective
disparities between VFMs and resource-constrained detectors, achieving stable
and task-aligned semantic transfer is challenging. To address this, on one
hand, we introduce a Deep Semantic Injector (DSI) module that facilitates the
integration of high-level representations from VFMs into the deep layers of the
detector. On the other hand, we devise a Gradient-guided Adaptive Modulation
(GAM) strategy, which dynamically adjusts the intensity of semantic transfer
based on gradient norm ratios. Without increasing deployment and inference
overhead, our approach painlessly delivers striking and consistent performance
gains across diverse DETR-based models, underscoring its practical utility for
real-time detection. Our new model family, RT-DETRv4, achieves state-of-the-art
results on COCO, attaining AP scores of 49.7/53.5/55.4/57.0 at corresponding
speeds of 273/169/124/78 FPS.

TL;DR: LangHOPS is the first MLLM-based framework for open-vocabulary object-part instance segmentation that grounds object-part hierarchies in language space rather than using visual grouping methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of prior approaches that rely on heuristic or learnable visual grouping for object-part segmentation, and to leverage the rich knowledge and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models.

Method: Integrates MLLM into object-part parsing pipeline to ground object-part hierarchies in language space and link multi-granularity concepts within hierarchies, using language-grounded hierarchy and MLLM-driven part query refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results: 5.5% AP improvement (in-domain) and 4.8% AP (cross-dataset) on PartImageNet, and 2.5% mIOU improvement on unseen object parts in ADE20K (zero-shot).

Conclusion: LangHOPS demonstrates the effectiveness of language-grounded hierarchy and MLLM-driven part query refinement for open-vocabulary object-part instance segmentation across multiple challenging scenarios.

Abstract: We propose LangHOPS, the first Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based
framework for open-vocabulary object-part instance segmentation. Given an
image, LangHOPS can jointly detect and segment hierarchical object and part
instances from open-vocabulary candidate categories. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on heuristic or learnable visual grouping, our approach grounds
object-part hierarchies in language space. It integrates the MLLM into the
object-part parsing pipeline to leverage its rich knowledge and reasoning
capabilities, and link multi-granularity concepts within the hierarchies. We
evaluate LangHOPS across multiple challenging scenarios, including in-domain
and cross-dataset object-part instance segmentation, and zero-shot semantic
segmentation. LangHOPS achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing previous
methods by 5.5% Average Precision (AP) (in-domain) and 4.8% (cross-dataset) on
the PartImageNet dataset and by 2.5% mIOU on unseen object parts in ADE20K
(zero-shot). Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the
language-grounded hierarchy and MLLM driven part query refinement strategy. The
code will be released here.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPTM is a novel generation-based SFDA framework that uses target data as references to generate and progressively refine a pseudo-target domain, addressing domain discrepancy limitations in source-free domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SFDA methods are limited by source-target domain discrepancy - non-generation methods suffer from unreliable pseudo-labels in large domain gaps, while generation-based methods degrade due to enlarged discrepancies when creating pseudo-source data.

Method: Divides target samples into trust/non-trust sets based on pseudo-label reliability, uses latent diffusion model to semantically transform non-trust samples while maintaining target distribution, and employs progressive refinement mechanism to iteratively reduce domain discrepancy.

Result: Outperforms existing methods by large margin, achieves SOTA on four SFDA benchmark datasets, and enhances performance by up to 18.6% in scenarios with large source-target gaps.

Conclusion: DPTM effectively addresses domain discrepancy limitations in SFDA through target-driven generation and progressive refinement, demonstrating superior performance especially in challenging scenarios with large domain gaps.

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is a challenging task that tackles
domain shifts using only a pre-trained source model and unlabeled target data.
Existing SFDA methods are restricted by the fundamental limitation of
source-target domain discrepancy. Non-generation SFDA methods suffer from
unreliable pseudo-labels in challenging scenarios with large domain
discrepancies, while generation-based SFDA methods are evidently degraded due
to enlarged domain discrepancies in creating pseudo-source data. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel generation-based framework named
Diffusion-Driven Progressive Target Manipulation (DPTM) that leverages
unlabeled target data as references to reliably generate and progressively
refine a pseudo-target domain for SFDA. Specifically, we divide the target
samples into a trust set and a non-trust set based on the reliability of
pseudo-labels to sufficiently and reliably exploit their information. For
samples from the non-trust set, we develop a manipulation strategy to
semantically transform them into the newly assigned categories, while
simultaneously maintaining them in the target distribution via a latent
diffusion model. Furthermore, we design a progressive refinement mechanism that
progressively reduces the domain discrepancy between the pseudo-target domain
and the real target domain via iterative refinement. Experimental results
demonstrate that DPTM outperforms existing methods by a large margin and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four prevailing SFDA benchmark
datasets with different scales. Remarkably, DPTM can significantly enhance the
performance by up to 18.6% in scenarios with large source-target gaps.

*Yang Jin,Guangyu Guo,Binglu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaTector+ is a unified framework for gaze object detection and gaze following that eliminates head-related priors dependency during inference, using shared backbone with task-specific blocks, head detection branch, attention mechanisms, and a new evaluation metric mSoC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods solve gaze object detection and gaze following separately and depend on head-related prior knowledge, requiring auxiliary networks for head location extraction, which prevents joint optimization and limits practical applicability.

Method: Uses expanded specific-general-specific feature extractor with shared backbone, embeds head detection branch, proposes head-based attention mechanism to fuse features, implements attention supervision for gaze heatmap learning, and introduces mSoC evaluation metric.

Result: Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate effectiveness in both gaze object detection and gaze following tasks.

Conclusion: GaTector+ provides a unified solution that eliminates head-related priors dependency while achieving strong performance across both gaze-related tasks through its novel architecture and attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Gaze object detection and gaze following are fundamental tasks for
interpreting human gaze behavior or intent. However, most previous methods
usually solve these two tasks separately, and their prediction of gaze objects
and gaze following typically depend on head-related prior knowledge during both
the training phase and real-world deployment. This dependency necessitates an
auxiliary network to extract head location, thus precluding joint optimization
across the entire system and constraining the practical applicability. To this
end, we propose GaTector+, a unified framework for gaze object detection and
gaze following, which eliminates the dependence on the head-related priors
during inference. Specifically, GaTector+ uses an expanded
specific-general-specific feature extractor that leverages a shared backbone,
which extracts general features for gaze following and object detection using
the shared backbone while using specific blocks before and after the shared
backbone to better consider the specificity of each sub-task. To obtain
head-related knowledge without prior information, we first embed a head
detection branch to predict the head of each person. Then, before regressing
the gaze point, a head-based attention mechanism is proposed to fuse the sense
feature and gaze feature with the help of head location. Since the
suboptimization of the gaze point heatmap leads to the performance bottleneck,
we propose an attention supervision mechanism to accelerate the learning of the
gaze heatmap. Finally, we propose a novel evaluation metric, mean Similarity
over Candidates (mSoC), for gaze object detection, which is more sensitive to
variations between bounding boxes. The experimental results on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both gaze
object detection and gaze following tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot object detection suffers from base-class bias and unstable calibration when only limited novel samples are available, requiring methods that can work effectively with scarce data.

Method: PDA maintains support-only prototypes in a learnable projection space, uses prototype-conditioned RoI alignment, adapts prototypes via EMA updates during fine-tuning, and employs best-of-K matching with temperature-scaled fusion to combine metric similarities with detector logits.

Result: Experiments on VOC FSOD and GFSOD benchmarks show PDA consistently improves novel-class performance with minimal impact on base classes and negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: PDA provides an effective prototype-driven approach that enhances few-shot object detection by offering complementary metric-based classification while maintaining protocol compliance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) often suffers from base-class bias and
unstable calibration when only a few novel samples are available. We propose
Prototype-Driven Alignment (PDA), a lightweight, plug-in metric head for DeFRCN
that provides a prototype-based "second opinion" complementary to the linear
classifier. PDA maintains support-only prototypes in a learnable
identity-initialized projection space and optionally applies
prototype-conditioned RoI alignment to reduce geometric mismatch. During
fine-tuning, prototypes can be adapted via exponential moving average(EMA)
updates on labeled foreground RoIs-without introducing class-specific
parameters-and are frozen at inference to ensure strict protocol compliance.
PDA employs a best-of-K matching scheme to capture intra-class multi-modality
and temperature-scaled fusion to combine metric similarities with detector
logits. Experiments on VOC FSOD and GFSOD benchmarks show that PDA consistently
improves novel-class performance with minimal impact on base classes and
negligible computational overhead.

TL;DR: StreamingCoT is a new dataset for streaming VideoQA that addresses limitations in temporal dynamics and reasoning process annotations through dynamic hierarchical annotation and explicit reasoning chain generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VideoQA datasets fail to capture evolving answers in temporal video streams and lack explicit reasoning process annotations, limiting model interpretability and logical deduction capabilities.

Method: Dynamic hierarchical annotation architecture with per-second dense descriptions and temporally-dependent semantic segments, plus explicit reasoning chain generation using spatiotemporal object extraction, state transition-based reasoning paths, and human-verified validation.

Result: StreamingCoT establishes the first dataset for temporally evolving reasoning in streaming VideoQA and multimodal Chain-of-Thought tasks, providing a foundation for advancing streaming video understanding.

Conclusion: The dataset addresses critical limitations in current VideoQA approaches and enables research in complex temporal reasoning and multimodal inference for streaming video applications.

Abstract: The rapid growth of streaming video applications demands multimodal models
with enhanced capabilities for temporal dynamics understanding and complex
reasoning. However, current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) datasets suffer
from two critical limitations: 1) Static annotation mechanisms fail to capture
the evolving nature of answers in temporal video streams, and 2) The absence of
explicit reasoning process annotations restricts model interpretability and
logical deduction capabilities. To address these challenges, We introduce
StreamingCoT, the first dataset explicitly designed for temporally evolving
reasoning in streaming VideoQA and multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tasks. Our
framework first establishes a dynamic hierarchical annotation architecture that
generates per-second dense descriptions and constructs temporally-dependent
semantic segments through similarity fusion, paired with question-answer sets
constrained by temporal evolution patterns. We further propose an explicit
reasoning chain generation paradigm that extracts spatiotemporal objects via
keyframe semantic alignment, derives object state transition-based reasoning
paths using large language models, and ensures logical coherence through
human-verified validation. This dataset establishes a foundation for advancing
research in streaming video understanding, complex temporal reasoning, and
multimodal inference. Our StreamingCoT and its construction toolkit can be

*Zhigang Tu,Zhengbo Zhang,Jia Gong,Junsong Yuan,Bo Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach to semi-supervised 3D action recognition using active learning, reformulating it as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to intelligently select informative skeleton sequences for annotation, with enhancements including hyperbolic space projection and meta tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation that representative skeleton sequences may not be the most informative for action recognition, as the model may already have similar knowledge from previously seen samples. The goal is to reduce reliance on costly annotations while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Method: Reformulates semi-supervised 3D action recognition via active learning as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), trains an informative sample selection model, projects state-action pairs from Euclidean to hyperbolic space for enhanced representation, and introduces meta tuning for faster real-world deployment.

Result: Extensive experiments on three 3D action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: The MDP-based approach with hyperbolic space projection and meta tuning provides an effective solution for semi-supervised 3D action recognition, enabling intelligent selection of informative samples for annotation while reducing annotation costs.

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition aims to classify human skeletal
sequences, which are spatiotemporal representations of actions, into predefined
categories. To reduce the reliance on costly annotations of skeletal sequences
while maintaining competitive recognition accuracy, the task of 3D Action
Recognition with Limited Training Samples, also known as semi-supervised 3D
Action Recognition, has been proposed. In addition, active learning, which aims
to proactively select the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation,
has been explored in semi-supervised 3D Action Recognition for training sample
selection. Specifically, researchers adopt an encoder-decoder framework to
embed skeleton sequences into a latent space, where clustering information,
combined with a margin-based selection strategy using a multi-head mechanism,
is utilized to identify the most informative sequences in the unlabeled set for
annotation. However, the most representative skeleton sequences may not
necessarily be the most informative for the action recognizer, as the model may
have already acquired similar knowledge from previously seen skeleton samples.
To solve it, we reformulate Semi-supervised 3D action recognition via active
learning from a novel perspective by casting it as a Markov Decision Process
(MDP). Built upon the MDP framework and its training paradigm, we train an
informative sample selection model to intelligently guide the selection of
skeleton sequences for annotation. To enhance the representational capacity of
the factors in the state-action pairs within our method, we project them from
Euclidean space to hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we introduce a meta tuning
strategy to accelerate the deployment of our method in real-world scenarios.
Extensive experiments on three 3D action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limited annotated data for coronary artery calcium scoring in non-contrast CCTA scans and eliminate need for expert-defined segmentations.

Method: Radiomics-based pipeline with pseudo-labeling for training labels, comparison of radiomics features vs pretrained foundation models (CT-FM, RadImageNet) with traditional classifiers, evaluated on 182-patient CCTA dataset.

Result: Radiomics-based models significantly outperformed CNN-derived embeddings from foundation models (84% accuracy, p<0.05) despite no expert annotations.

Conclusion: Radiomics with pseudo-labeling is effective for CAC scoring without expert annotations, superior to foundation model features for this task.

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring plays a crucial role in the early
detection and risk stratification of coronary artery disease (CAD). In this
study, we focus on non-contrast coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)
scans, which are commonly used for early calcification detection in clinical
settings. To address the challenge of limited annotated data, we propose a
radiomics-based pipeline that leverages pseudo-labeling to generate training
labels, thereby eliminating the need for expert-defined segmentations.
Additionally, we explore the use of pretrained foundation models, specifically
CT-FM and RadImageNet, to extract image features, which are then used with
traditional classifiers. We compare the performance of these deep learning
features with that of radiomics features. Evaluation is conducted on a clinical
CCTA dataset comprising 182 patients, where individuals are classified into two
groups: zero versus non-zero calcium scores. We further investigate the impact
of training on non-contrast datasets versus combined contrast and non-contrast
datasets, with testing performed only on non contrast scans. Results show that
radiomics-based models significantly outperform CNN-derived embeddings from
foundation models (achieving 84% accuracy and p<0.05), despite the
unavailability of expert annotations.

*M Yashwanth,Sharannya Ghosh,Aditay Tripathi,Anirban Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PEP-FedPT is a federated prompt tuning framework for Vision Transformers that achieves both generalization and personalization through Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompts, combining global and class-specific prompts adaptively per sample.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual Prompt Tuning is effective for parameter-efficient fine-tuning but struggles in federated learning - global prompts don't generalize well across heterogeneous clients, while personalized prompts overfit to local data.

Method: Proposes Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompt (CCMP) that maintains class-specific prompts alongside global prompts, adaptively combining them using weights from global class prototypes and client class priors for per-sample personalization without client-dependent parameters.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, DomainNet, and iNaturalist show PEP-FedPT consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines under diverse data heterogeneity scenarios.

Conclusion: PEP-FedPT establishes a strong foundation for efficient and generalizable federated prompt tuning of Vision Transformers, achieving both generalization and personalization effectively.

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) has
proven highly effective as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique for
adapting large models to downstream tasks with limited data. Its parameter
efficiency makes it particularly suitable for Federated Learning (FL), where
both communication and computation budgets are often constrained. However,
global prompt tuning struggles to generalize across heterogeneous clients,
while personalized tuning overfits to local data and lacks generalization. We
propose PEP-FedPT (Prompt Estimation from Prototypes for Federated Prompt
Tuning), a unified framework designed to achieve both generalization and
personalization in federated prompt tuning of ViTs. Within this framework, we
introduce the novel Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompt (CCMP) - based on
class-specific prompts maintained alongside a globally shared prompt. For each
input, CCMP adaptively combines class-specific prompts using weights derived
from global class prototypes and client class priors. This approach enables
per-sample prompt personalization without storing client-dependent trainable
parameters. The prompts are collaboratively optimized via traditional federated
averaging technique on the same. Comprehensive evaluations on CIFAR-100,
TinyImageNet, DomainNet, and iNaturalist datasets demonstrate that PEP-FedPT
consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines under diverse data
heterogeneity scenarios, establishing a strong foundation for efficient and
generalizable federated prompt tuning of Vision Transformers.

*Bill Psomas,George Retsinas,Nikos Efthymiadis,Panagiotis Filntisis,Yannis Avrithis,Petros Maragos,Ondrej Chum,Giorgos Tolias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces i-CIR, a new instance-level composed image retrieval dataset, and BASIC, a training-free method that uses pre-trained VLMs to achieve state-of-the-art performance on CIR tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress in composed image retrieval (CIR) is hindered by the lack of high-quality training and evaluation data, particularly for instance-level retrieval where the goal is to find the same specific object under various modifications.

Method: Proposes BASIC - a training-free approach that leverages pre-trained vision-and-language models to separately estimate query-image-to-image and query-text-to-image similarities, then performs late fusion to upweight images satisfying both queries while downweighting those with high similarity to only one.

Result: BASIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the new i-CIR dataset and existing CIR datasets with semantic-level class definitions, demonstrating effectiveness across different retrieval paradigms.

Conclusion: The combination of the i-CIR dataset and BASIC method addresses key challenges in CIR research, providing both better evaluation benchmarks and a simple yet effective training-free approach that outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: The progress of composed image retrieval (CIR), a popular research direction
in image retrieval, where a combined visual and textual query is used, is held
back by the absence of high-quality training and evaluation data. We introduce
a new evaluation dataset, i-CIR, which, unlike existing datasets, focuses on an
instance-level class definition. The goal is to retrieve images that contain
the same particular object as the visual query, presented under a variety of
modifications defined by textual queries. Its design and curation process keep
the dataset compact to facilitate future research, while maintaining its
challenge-comparable to retrieval among more than 40M random
distractors-through a semi-automated selection of hard negatives.
  To overcome the challenge of obtaining clean, diverse, and suitable training
data, we leverage pre-trained vision-and-language models (VLMs) in a
training-free approach called BASIC. The method separately estimates
query-image-to-image and query-text-to-image similarities, performing late
fusion to upweight images that satisfy both queries, while down-weighting those
that exhibit high similarity with only one of the two. Each individual
similarity is further improved by a set of components that are simple and
intuitive. BASIC sets a new state of the art on i-CIR but also on existing CIR
datasets that follow a semantic-level class definition. Project page:

### [72] [More than a Moment: Towards Coherent Sequences of Audio Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25440)
*Eshika Khandelwal,Junyu Xie,Tengda Han,Max Bain,Arsha Nagrani,Andrew Zisserman,Gül Varol,Makarand Tapaswi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoherentAD is a training-free method that generates coherent Audio Descriptions by selecting from multiple candidates across sequences, outperforming independent generation approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automatic AD generation methods produce descriptions independently, leading to repetitive and incoherent sequences that fail to help visually impaired audiences visualize unfolding scenes.

Method: Generate multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, then perform auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form coherent narratives.

Result: Produces coherent AD sequences with enhanced narrative understanding, outperforming prior independent generation approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed CoherentAD method effectively addresses the coherence problem in AD generation through sequence-level candidate selection, validated by new evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Audio Descriptions (ADs) convey essential on-screen information, allowing
visually impaired audiences to follow videos. To be effective, ADs must form a
coherent sequence that helps listeners to visualise the unfolding scene, rather
than describing isolated moments. However, most automatic methods generate each
AD independently, often resulting in repetitive, incoherent descriptions. To
address this, we propose a training-free method, CoherentAD, that first
generates multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, and then
performs auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form a coherent and
informative narrative. To evaluate AD sequences holistically, we introduce a
sequence-level metric, StoryRecall, which measures how well the predicted ADs
convey the ground truth narrative, alongside repetition metrics that capture
the redundancy across consecutive AD outputs. Our method produces coherent AD
sequences with enhanced narrative understanding, outperforming prior approaches
that rely on independent generations.

### [73] [Hawk: Leveraging Spatial Context for Faster Autoregressive Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25739)
*Zhi-Kai Chen,Jun-Peng Jiang,Han-Jia Ye,De-Chuan Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hawk introduces speculative decoding for autoregressive image generation, achieving 1.71x speedup while maintaining image quality by leveraging spatial structure to improve draft model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive image generation models produce high-quality images but suffer from slow inference due to sequential token-by-token decoding. While speculative decoding has accelerated text generation, it hasn't been effectively applied to images due to larger sampling spaces and poor utilization of spatial structure.

Method: Hawk uses speculative decoding with a lightweight draft model that leverages the spatial structure of images to guide predictions. It models local dependencies more effectively by utilizing the two-dimensional nature of images.

Result: Experimental results on multiple text-to-image benchmarks show a 1.71x speedup over standard autoregressive models while preserving both image fidelity and diversity.

Conclusion: Hawk successfully adapts speculative decoding to image generation by exploiting spatial structure, achieving significant speed improvements without compromising image quality.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image generation models are capable of producing
high-fidelity images but often suffer from slow inference due to their
inherently sequential, token-by-token decoding process. Speculative decoding,
which employs a lightweight draft model to approximate the output of a larger
AR model, has shown promise in accelerating text generation without
compromising quality. However, its application to image generation remains
largely underexplored. The challenges stem from a significantly larger sampling
space, which complicates the alignment between the draft and target model
outputs, coupled with the inadequate use of the two-dimensional spatial
structure inherent in images, thereby limiting the modeling of local
dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Hawk, a new approach
that harnesses the spatial structure of images to guide the speculative model
toward more accurate and efficient predictions. Experimental results on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate a 1.71x speedup over standard AR
models, while preserving both image fidelity and diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans have strong spatial reasoning abilities through multimodal observations, but systematic reviews and public benchmarks for large multimodal reasoning models remain limited, creating a need for comprehensive evaluation frameworks.

Method: The survey categorizes recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), outlines general spatial reasoning techniques, and examines various spatial tasks including 2D/3D understanding, visual question answering, embodied AI, and emerging modalities.

Conclusion: This survey offers comprehensive insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning and serves as a solid foundation for future research in this area.

Abstract: Humans possess spatial reasoning abilities that enable them to understand
spaces through multimodal observations, such as vision and sound. Large
multimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and
reason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However,
systematic reviews and publicly available benchmarks for these models remain
limited. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal
spatial reasoning tasks with large models, categorizing recent progress in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and introducing open benchmarks for
evaluation. We begin by outlining general spatial reasoning, focusing on
post-training techniques, explainability, and architecture. Beyond classical 2D
tasks, we examine spatial relationship reasoning, scene and layout
understanding, as well as visual question answering and grounding in 3D space.
We also review advances in embodied AI, including vision-language navigation
and action models. Additionally, we consider emerging modalities such as audio
and egocentric video, which contribute to novel spatial understanding through
new sensors. We believe this survey establishes a solid foundation and offers

### [75] [FreeArt3D: Training-Free Articulated Object Generation using 3D Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25765)
*Chuhao Chen,Isabella Liu,Xinyue Wei,Hao Su,Minghua Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeArt3D is a training-free framework that generates articulated 3D objects by repurposing pre-trained static 3D diffusion models and extending Score Distillation Sampling to handle articulation as an additional dimension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for articulated 3D object modeling either require dense-view supervision or produce coarse approximations without textures. While static 3D generation has advanced significantly, extending native 3D diffusion models to articulated objects is challenging due to limited training data.

Method: FreeArt3D uses a pre-trained static 3D diffusion model as a shape prior and extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to the 3D-to-4D domain, treating articulation as an additional generative dimension. It jointly optimizes geometry, texture, and articulation parameters from a few images in different articulation states.

Result: The method generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object categories. It completes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art approaches in quality and versatility.

Conclusion: FreeArt3D demonstrates that articulated 3D generation can be achieved without task-specific training or large-scale articulated datasets by leveraging pre-trained static 3D models and extending existing optimization techniques to handle articulation.

Abstract: Articulated 3D objects are central to many applications in robotics, AR/VR,
and animation. Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on
optimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision
or on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric
approximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D
generation of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with
the advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending
these methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models
poses significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a
training-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of
training a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a
pre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape
prior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by
treating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images
captured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the
object's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring
task-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our
method generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts
underlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object
categories. Despite following a per-instance optimization paradigm, FreeArt3D
completes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art
approaches in both quality and versatility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VFXMaster is a unified reference-based framework for VFX video generation that treats effect generation as an in-context learning task, enabling reproduction of diverse dynamic effects from reference videos to target content with strong generalization to unseen effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VFX generation methods rely on one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm which is resource-intensive and cannot generalize to unseen effects, limiting scalability and creative potential.

Method: Uses in-context conditioning strategy with reference examples, in-context attention masks to decouple and inject effect attributes, and one-shot effect adaptation mechanism for rapid generalization to tough unseen effects.

Result: Effectively imitates various categories of effect information and exhibits outstanding generalization to out-of-domain effects, demonstrating capability to reproduce diverse dynamic effects from reference videos.

Conclusion: VFXMaster provides a scalable and unified approach to VFX generation that overcomes limitations of previous methods, with plans to release code, models, and dataset to foster future research.

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are crucial to the expressive power of digital media,
yet their creation remains a major challenge for generative AI. Prevailing
methods often rely on the one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm, which is
resource-intensive and fundamentally incapable of generalizing to unseen
effects, thus limiting scalability and creation. To address this challenge, we
introduce VFXMaster, the first unified, reference-based framework for VFX video
generation. It recasts effect generation as an in-context learning task,
enabling it to reproduce diverse dynamic effects from a reference video onto
target content. In addition, it demonstrates remarkable generalization to
unseen effect categories. Specifically, we design an in-context conditioning
strategy that prompts the model with a reference example. An in-context
attention mask is designed to precisely decouple and inject the essential
effect attributes, allowing a single unified model to master the effect
imitation without information leakage. In addition, we propose an efficient
one-shot effect adaptation mechanism to boost generalization capability on
tough unseen effects from a single user-provided video rapidly. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method effectively imitates various categories
of effect information and exhibits outstanding generalization to out-of-domain
effects. To foster future research, we will release our code, models, and a
comprehensive dataset to the community.

*Hong Wang,Zhezheng Hao,Jian Luo,Chenxing Wei,Yao Shu,Lei Liu,Qiang Lin,Hande Dong,Jiawei Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Reasoning Score (r-score) metric and Re-Schedule algorithm for RLVR data scheduling that considers reasoning tree structures, achieving up to 3.2% accuracy gains on math benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR data scheduling methods use path-based metrics that ignore reasoning tree structures, limiting their effectiveness in optimizing LLM training.

Method: Proposed Reasoning Score (r-score) to measure query learning difficulty based on reasoning tree structure, and developed Re-Schedule algorithm that creates a curriculum from simple to complex queries.

Result: Experiments on six math-reasoning benchmarks show Re-Schedule significantly improves average accuracy with gains up to 3.2%.

Conclusion: Structural understanding of reasoning trees provides a more powerful and principled foundation for RLVR data scheduling than path-based approaches.

Abstract: Using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize Large
Language Models (LLMs) can be conceptualized as progressively editing a query's
`Reasoning Tree'. This process involves exploring nodes (tokens) and
dynamically modifying the model's policy at each node. When combined with data
scheduling, this process yields further gains in data efficiency and accuracy.
However, existing RLVR data scheduling methods typically rely on path-based
metrics to rank queries, overlooking the reasoning tree structures of these
queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric, namely Reasoning Score
(r-score), which measures the query's learning difficulty based on the
structure of its reasoning tree. Based on the r-score, we propose the Reasoning
Tree Schedule (Re-Schedule), a scheduling algorithm that constructs a
curriculum progressing from structurally simple (high r-score) to complex (low
r-score) queries. Experiments on six math-reasoning benchmarks show that
Re-Schedule significantly improves average accuracy, achieving gains of up to
3.2%. These strong results validate our approach and demonstrate that a
structural understanding of the reasoning tree provides a more powerful and
principled foundation for RLVR data scheduling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating E/M coding reduces physicians' documentation burden, improves billing efficiency, and enables better patient care by handling real-world complexities in medical coding.

Method: Uses an LLM-based framework called ProFees that addresses key complexities in E/M coding through advanced prompt engineering and systematic approaches.

Result: Achieved more than 36% increase in coding accuracy over commercial CPT E/M coding systems and almost 5% improvement over strongest single-prompt baselines on expert-curated real-world dataset.

Conclusion: ProFees effectively addresses real-world complexities in E/M coding automation, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy and practical utility for medical billing systems.

Abstract: Evaluation and Management (E/M) coding, under the Current Procedural
Terminology (CPT) taxonomy, documents medical services provided to patients by
physicians. Used primarily for billing purposes, it is in physicians' best
interest to provide accurate CPT E/M codes. %While important, it is an
auxiliary task that adds to physicians' documentation burden. Automating this
coding task will help alleviate physicians' documentation burden, improve
billing efficiency, and ultimately enable better patient care. However, a
number of real-world complexities have made E/M encoding automation a
challenging task. In this paper, we elaborate some of the key complexities and
present ProFees, our LLM-based framework that tackles them, followed by a
systematic evaluation. On an expert-curated real-world dataset, ProFees
achieves an increase in coding accuracy of more than 36\% over a commercial CPT
E/M coding system and almost 5\% over our strongest single-prompt baseline,
demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the real-world complexities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs fail to follow essential procedural flows in rule-governed trading systems, eroding player trust, creating tension between creative flexibility and procedural demands.

Method: Autoregressive State-Tracking Prompting (ASTP) - strategic prompting that makes LLM's state-tracking explicit and verifiable, plus state-specific placeholder post-processing for accurate price calculations.

Result: >99% state compliance and 99.3% calculation precision across 300 dialogues; ASTP with smaller models (Gemini-2.5-Flash) matches larger models' performance while reducing response time from 21.2s to 2.4s.

Conclusion: ASTP establishes practical foundation satisfying both real-time requirements and resource constraints of commercial games by enabling procedural compliance without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable dynamic game interactions but fail to
follow essential procedural flows in rule-governed trading systems, eroding
player trust. This work resolves the core tension between the creative
flexibility of LLMs and the procedural demands of in-game trading
(browse-offer-review-confirm). To this end, Autoregressive State-Tracking
Prompting (ASTP) is introduced, a methodology centered on a strategically
orchestrated prompt that compels an LLM to make its state-tracking process
explicit and verifiable. Instead of relying on implicit contextual
understanding, ASTP tasks the LLM with identifying and reporting a predefined
state label from the previous turn. To ensure transactional integrity, this is
complemented by a state-specific placeholder post-processing method for
accurate price calculations. Evaluation across 300 trading dialogues
demonstrates >99% state compliance and 99.3% calculation precision. Notably,
ASTP with placeholder post-processing on smaller models (Gemini-2.5-Flash)
matches larger models' (Gemini-2.5-Pro) performance while reducing response
time from 21.2s to 2.4s, establishing a practical foundation that satisfies
both real-time requirements and resource constraints of commercial games.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL-based post-training for large reasoning models uses outcome-centric rewards, but lacks signals about the reasoning process itself.

Method: Proposes PM4GRPO that augments standard answer/format rewards with process mining techniques to compute conformance rewards measuring reasoning alignment with teacher models.

Result: Empirical results on five benchmarks show PM4GRPO significantly outperforms existing GRPO-based post-training methodologies.

Conclusion: Leveraging process mining for reasoning-aware GRPO effectively enhances reasoning capabilities of policy models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training has been crucial for enabling
multi-step reasoning in large reasoning models (LRMs), yet current reward
schemes are typically outcome-centric. We propose PM4GRPO, a reasoning-aware
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that augments standard answer/format
rewards with signals over the reasoning procedure. To this end, process mining
techniques are utilized to compute a scalar conformance reward that measures
how closely a policy model's reasoning aligns with the pretrained teacher
model. The empirical results on five benchmarks demonstrate that PM4GRPO
significantly outperforms existing methodologies for GRPO-based post-training.
These results highlight that leveraging process mining for reasoning-aware GRPO
effectively enhances the reasoning capabilities of policy models.

Conclusion: The proposed H3M-SSMoEs framework successfully addresses the challenges in stock prediction through unified structural, semantic, and regime-adaptive modeling, demonstrating superior performance across multiple markets.

Abstract: Stock movement prediction remains fundamentally challenging due to complex

introduces H3M-SSMoEs, a novel Hypergraph-based MultiModal architecture with
LLM reasoning and Style-Structured Mixture of Experts, integrating three key
innovations: (1) a Multi-Context Multimodal Hypergraph that hierarchically
captures fine-grained spatiotemporal dynamics via a Local Context Hypergraph
(LCH) and persistent inter-stock dependencies through a Global Context
Hypergraph (GCH), employing shared cross-modal hyperedges and Jensen-Shannon

quantitative and textual modalities, enriching representations with
domain-specific financial knowledge; and (3) a Style-Structured Mixture of
Experts (SSMoEs) that combines shared market experts and industry-specialized
experts, each parameterized by learnable style vectors enabling regime-aware
specialization under sparse activation. Extensive experiments on three major

Motivation: Current KBQA methods use process supervision which provides weak incentives for exploration and fails to strengthen agentic reasoning ability. The paper aims to develop autonomous reasoning capabilities through outcome-only supervision.

Method: Multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning with easy-to-hard curriculum: 1) Fine-tune LLM on high-quality trajectories via outcome-based rejection sampling, 2) Apply multi-stage curriculum RL with progressive reward schedules to alleviate reward sparsity.

Result: KnowCoder-A1 consistently outperforms prior approaches across three mainstream datasets, achieving up to 11.1% relative improvement on GrailQA zero-shot subset while using only one-twelfth of the training data.

Conclusion: Outcome-only supervision with multi-stage curriculum RL enables powerful autonomous reasoning behaviors and demonstrates strong agentic reasoning capabilities in KBQA tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural-language
questions over a structured Knowledge Base (KB). Recent work improves KBQA by
adopting an agentic reasoning paradigm, in which Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively decompose a question, generate its corresponding logical queries,
and interact with the KB to derive the answer. However, these methods typically
fine-tune LLMs on reasoning trajectories synthesized via process supervision,
which offers weak incentives for exploration and thus fails to strengthen the
agentic reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose KnowCoder-A1, an LLM that
can autonomously perform agentic reasoning on KBs to obtain answers. To
incentivize autonomous exploration, KnowCoder-A1 trains the LLM under
outcome-only supervision via a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning
with an easy-to-hard curriculum. To establish foundational agentic
capabilities, KnowCoder-A1 first fine-tunes the LLM on a small set of
high-quality trajectories obtained through outcome-based rejection sampling.
Then, to alleviate the reward sparsity inherent in outcome-only supervision, it
applies multi-stage curriculum RL with reward schedules that progress from easy
to hard. Trained with outcome-only supervision, KnowCoder-A1 exhibits powerful
reasoning behaviors and consistently outperforms prior approaches across three
mainstream datasets. Notably, on the zero-shot subset of GrailQA, KnowCoder-A1
achieves up to an 11.1% relative improvement while using only one-twelfth of
the training data, demonstrating strong agentic reasoning capabilities.

*Juan Ren,Mark Dras,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agentic Moderation is a model-agnostic framework that uses specialized agents to defend multimodal systems against jailbreak attacks, achieving significant improvements in safety metrics through dynamic, cooperative agent coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend agentic methods to safety alignment by creating a more effective defense against jailbreak attacks in multimodal systems, moving beyond static binary classifications to achieve context-aware and interpretable moderation.

Method: Uses a framework with four specialized agents (Shield, Responder, Evaluator, Reflector) that work cooperatively to provide dynamic moderation, leveraging agentic architectures for flexible and reasoning-based safety enforcement.

Result: Reduces Attack Success Rate by 7-19%, maintains stable Non-Following Rate, improves Refusal Rate by 4-20% across five datasets and four LVLMs, demonstrating robust and well-balanced safety performance.

Conclusion: Agentic Moderation provides modular, scalable, and fine-grained safety enforcement, highlighting the potential of agentic systems as a foundation for automated safety governance in multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: Agentic methods have emerged as a powerful and autonomous paradigm that
enhances reasoning, collaboration, and adaptive control, enabling systems to
coordinate and independently solve complex tasks. We extend this paradigm to
safety alignment by introducing Agentic Moderation, a model-agnostic framework
that leverages specialised agents to defend multimodal systems against
jailbreak attacks. Unlike prior approaches that apply as a static layer over
inputs or outputs and provide only binary classifications (safe or unsafe), our
method integrates dynamic, cooperative agents, including Shield, Responder,
Evaluator, and Reflector, to achieve context-aware and interpretable
moderation. Extensive experiments across five datasets and four representative
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate that our approach reduces the
Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 7-19%, maintains a stable Non-Following Rate (NF),
and improves the Refusal Rate (RR) by 4-20%, achieving robust, interpretable,
and well-balanced safety performance. By harnessing the flexibility and
reasoning capacity of agentic architectures, Agentic Moderation provides
modular, scalable, and fine-grained safety enforcement, highlighting the
broader potential of agentic systems as a foundation for automated safety
governance.

*Yuyang Xia,Zibo Liang,Liwei Deng,Yan Zhao,Han Su,Kai Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EneAD is an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework that reduces perception computation by 1.9x-3.5x through adaptive model management, dynamic framerate adjustment, and reinforcement learning-based decision making, improving driving range by 3.9%-8.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving's energy consumption limits electric vehicle range, with perception computing being the most power-intensive component. Existing model compression techniques often sacrifice either model size or accuracy.

Method: Adaptive perception module with multiple models and dynamic framerate adjustment, transferable Bayesian optimization tuning, lightweight scenario classification, and reinforcement learning-based decision module with regularization for stability.

Result: Reduces perception consumption by 1.9x to 3.5x and improves driving range by 3.9% to 8.5% while maintaining desired accuracy.

Conclusion: EneAD effectively addresses energy efficiency in autonomous driving through adaptive perception optimization and robust decision making, achieving significant energy savings without compromising performance.

Abstract: Autonomous driving is an emerging technology that is expected to bring
significant social, economic, and environmental benefits. However, these
benefits come with rising energy consumption by computation engines, limiting
the driving range of vehicles, especially electric ones. Perception computing
is typically the most power-intensive component, as it relies on largescale
deep learning models to extract environmental features. Recently, numerous
studies have employed model compression techniques, such as sparsification,
quantization, and distillation, to reduce computational consumption. However,
these methods often result in either a substantial model size or a significant
drop in perception accuracy compared to high-computation models. To address
these challenges, we propose an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework,
called EneAD. In the adaptive perception module, a perception optimization
strategy is designed from the perspective of data management and tuning.
Firstly, we manage multiple perception models with different computational
consumption and adjust the execution framerate dynamically. Then, we define
them as knobs and design a transferable tuning method based on Bayesian
optimization to identify promising knob values that achieve low computation
while maintaining desired accuracy. To adaptively switch the knob values in
various traffic scenarios, a lightweight classification model is proposed to
distinguish the perception difficulty in different scenarios. In the robust
decision module, we propose a decision model based on reinforcement learning
and design a regularization term to enhance driving stability in the face of
perturbed perception results. Extensive experiments evidence the superiority of
our framework in both energy consumption and driving performance. EneAD can
reduce perception consumption by 1.9x to 3.5x and thus improve driving range by
3.9% to 8.5%

*Tianqianjin Lin,Xi Zhao,Xingyao Zhang,Rujiao Long,Yi Xu,Zhuoren Jiang,Wenbo Su,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAVR uses answer-conditioned reasoning to improve LLM reasoning by leveraging the insight that explaining "why" an answer is correct is easier than generating the answer itself, transforming hard problems into learnable ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL for LLMs fails when the model cannot generate high-quality reasoning paths initially, as it reinforces suboptimal patterns. The paper is motivated by cognitive science showing that explanatory reconstruction (explaining why an answer is correct) is easier than open-ended answer generation.

Method: RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided Variational Reasoning) uses answer-conditioned reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning, formalizing how conditioning on answers increases the expected utility of sampled reasoning paths.

Result: Experiments in general and math domains show consistent improvements over strong baselines. RAVR reduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes problem-specific reasoning strategies.

Conclusion: Answer-conditioned reasoning effectively transforms intractable reasoning problems into learnable ones by leveraging the cognitive advantage of explanatory reconstruction over open-ended exploration.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can refine the reasoning abilities of large
language models (LLMs), but critically depends on a key prerequisite: the LLM
can already generate high-utility reasoning paths with non-negligible
probability. For tasks beyond the LLM's current competence, such reasoning path
can be hard to sample, and learning risks reinforcing familiar but suboptimal
reasoning. We are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that Why is
this the answer is often an easier question than What is the answer, as it
avoids the heavy cognitive load of open-ended exploration, opting instead for
explanatory reconstruction-systematically retracing the reasoning that links a
question to its answer. We show that LLMs can similarly leverage answers to
derive high-quality reasoning paths. We formalize this phenomenon and prove
that conditioning on answer provably increases the expected utility of sampled
reasoning paths, thereby transforming intractable problems into learnable ones.
Building on this insight, we introduce RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided
Variational Reasoning), an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned
reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning. Experiments
in both general and math domains demonstrate consistent improvements over
strong baselines. We further analyze the reasoning behavior and find that RAVR
reduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes
problem-specific strategies in reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FELA is a multi-agent system using LLMs to automatically generate explainable features from complex industrial event logs, combining reasoning, coding, and evolutionary algorithms to improve model performance while reducing manual effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial event logs are valuable but complex, with existing automated feature engineering methods suffering from limited explainability, rigid operations, and poor adaptability to heterogeneous data.

Method: FELA uses specialized LLM agents (Idea, Code, Critic, Evaluation) in a multi-agent system with insight-guided self-evolution, combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms for idea space exploration.

Result: Extensive experiments on real industrial datasets show FELA generates explainable, domain-relevant features that significantly improve model performance while reducing manual effort.

Conclusion: LLM-based multi-agent systems show potential as a general framework for automated, interpretable, and adaptive feature engineering in complex real-world environments.

Abstract: Event log data, recording fine-grained user actions and system events,
represent one of the most valuable assets for modern digital services. However,
the complexity and heterogeneity of industrial event logs--characterized by
large scale, high dimensionality, diverse data types, and intricate temporal or
relational structures--make feature engineering extremely challenging. Existing
automatic feature engineering approaches, such as AutoML or genetic methods,
often suffer from limited explainability, rigid predefined operations, and poor
adaptability to complicated heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose FELA
(Feature Engineering LLM Agents), a multi-agent evolutionary system that
autonomously extracts meaningful and high-performing features from complex
industrial event log data. FELA integrates the reasoning and coding
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with an insight-guided
self-evolution paradigm. Specifically, FELA employs specialized agents--Idea
Agents, Code Agents, and Critic Agents--to collaboratively generate, validate,
and implement novel feature ideas. An Evaluation Agent summarizes feedback and
updates a hierarchical knowledge base and dual-memory system to enable
continual improvement. Moreover, FELA introduces an agentic evolution
algorithm, combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm principles to
balance exploration and exploitation across the idea space. Extensive
experiments on real industrial datasets demonstrate that FELA can generate
explainable, domain-relevant features that significantly improve model
performance while reducing manual effort. Our results highlight the potential
of LLM-based multi-agent systems as a general framework for automated,
interpretable, and adaptive feature engineering in complex real-world
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Psychiatric comorbidity is clinically significant but challenging due to complexity of multiple co-occurring disorders, requiring better diagnostic tools and datasets.

Method: Integrated synthetic patient EMR construction (502 records) with multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation using hierarchical state machine and context tree supporting 130+ diagnostic states, maintaining clinical standards.

Result: Created PsyCoTalk dataset with 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic dialogues validated by psychiatrists, showing high structural/linguistic fidelity compared to real clinical transcripts and confirmed realism by licensed psychiatrists.

Conclusion: PsyCoTalk enables development of models for multi-disorder psychiatric screening in single conversational pass, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning for comorbidity research.

Abstract: Psychiatric comorbidity is clinically significant yet challenging due to the
complexity of multiple co-occurring disorders. To address this, we develop a
novel approach integrating synthetic patient electronic medical record (EMR)
construction and multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation. We create 502
synthetic EMRs for common comorbid conditions using a pipeline that ensures
clinical relevance and diversity. Our multi-agent framework transfers the
clinical interview protocol into a hierarchical state machine and context tree,
supporting over 130 diagnostic states while maintaining clinical standards.
Through this rigorous process, we construct PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale
dialogue dataset supporting comorbidity, containing 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic
dialogues validated by psychiatrists. This dataset enhances diagnostic accuracy
and treatment planning, offering a valuable resource for psychiatric
comorbidity research. Compared to real-world clinical transcripts, PsyCoTalk
exhibits high structural and linguistic fidelity in terms of dialogue length,
token distribution, and diagnostic reasoning strategies. Licensed psychiatrists
confirm the realism and diagnostic validity of the dialogues. This dataset
enables the development and evaluation of models capable of multi-disorder
psychiatric screening in a single conversational pass.

### [89] [GAP: Graph-Based Agent Planning with Parallel Tool Use and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25320)
*Jiaqi Wu,Qinlao Zhao,Zefeng Chen,Kai Qin,Yifei Zhao,Xueqian Wang,Yuhang Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GAP introduces graph-based planning for LLM agents to enable parallel execution of independent sub-tasks, overcoming the sequential bottleneck of traditional approaches like ReAct.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sequential reasoning paradigms fail to exploit parallelism among independent sub-tasks, leading to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios.

Method: Trains agent foundation models to decompose complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, using a two-stage training strategy: supervised fine-tuning on graph-based planning traces followed by reinforcement learning with correctness-based rewards.

Result: Significantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines on MHQA datasets, particularly on multi-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization.

Conclusion: Graph-based agent planning enables adaptive parallel and serial tool execution, substantially improving both execution efficiency and task accuracy in multi-step reasoning scenarios.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown
impressive capabilities in tool manipulation for complex task-solving. However,
existing paradigms such as ReAct rely on sequential reasoning and execution,
failing to exploit the inherent parallelism among independent sub-tasks. This
sequential bottleneck leads to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal
performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios. We introduce Graph-based Agent
Planning (GAP), a novel framework that explicitly models inter-task
dependencies through graph-based planning to enable adaptive parallel and
serial tool execution. Our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose
complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining
which tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential
dependencies. This dependency-aware orchestration achieves substantial
improvements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy. To train GAP, we
construct a high-quality dataset of graph-based planning traces derived from
the Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) benchmark. We employ a two-stage
training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the curated dataset,
followed by reinforcement learning (RL) with a correctness-based reward
function on strategically sampled queries where tool-based reasoning provides
maximum value. Experimental results on MHQA datasets demonstrate that GAP
significantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines, particularly on
multi-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool
invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization. The project page is

### [90] [Grouping Nodes With Known Value Differences: A Lossless UCT-based Abstraction Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25388)
*Robin Schmöcker,Alexander Dockhorn,Bodo Rosenhahn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KVDA-UCT improves MCTS sample efficiency by grouping state-action pairs with known value differences rather than requiring identical values, outperforming OGA-UCT in deterministic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MCTS abstraction methods like OGA-UCT require state-action pairs to have identical immediate rewards, which limits the number of possible abstractions and reduces sample efficiency.

Method: Proposed Known Value Difference Abstractions (KVDA) framework that groups states and state-action pairs with different values as long as their value differences can be inferred through immediate reward analysis, then modified OGA-UCT to use this framework.

Result: KVDA-UCT detects significantly more abstractions than OGA-UCT, introduces no additional parameters, and outperforms OGA-UCT across various deterministic environments and parameter settings.

Conclusion: Breaking from the paradigm of grouping only value-equivalent states and instead grouping states with known value differences significantly improves MCTS abstraction capabilities and sample efficiency.

Abstract: A core challenge of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is its sample efficiency,
which can be improved by grouping state-action pairs and using their aggregate
statistics instead of single-node statistics. On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT) is the state-of-the-art MCTS
abstraction algorithm for deterministic environments that builds its
abstraction using the Abstractions of State-Action Pairs (ASAP) framework,
which aims to detect states and state-action pairs with the same value under
optimal play by analysing the search graph. ASAP, however, requires two
state-action pairs to have the same immediate reward, which is a rigid
condition that limits the number of abstractions that can be found and thereby
the sample efficiency. In this paper, we break with the paradigm of grouping
value-equivalent states or state-action pairs and instead group states and
state-action pairs with possibly different values as long as the difference
between their values can be inferred. We call this abstraction framework Known
Value Difference Abstractions (KVDA), which infers the value differences by
analysis of the immediate rewards and modifies OGA-UCT to use this framework
instead. The modification is called KVDA-UCT, which detects significantly more
abstractions than OGA-UCT, introduces no additional parameter, and outperforms
OGA-UCT on a variety of deterministic environments and parameter settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This survey introduces a dual-paradigm framework for Agentic AI, categorizing systems into Symbolic/Classical (algorithmic planning) and Neural/Generative (stochastic generation) lineages, and analyzes 90 studies to reveal strategic paradigm selection across domains and identify critical research gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragmented understanding and conceptual retrofitting in Agentic AI by providing a clear framework that distinguishes between modern neural systems and traditional symbolic models, cutting through confusion in the field.

Method: Systematic PRISMA-based review of 90 studies (2018-2025) using a dual-paradigm framework, analyzing three dimensions: theoretical foundations, domain-specific implementations, and paradigm-specific ethical/governance challenges.

Result: Symbolic systems dominate safety-critical domains (healthcare) while neural systems prevail in adaptive, data-rich environments (finance). Identified critical gaps: governance models for symbolic systems and need for hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures.

Conclusion: The future of Agentic AI lies in intentional integration of both paradigms to create systems that are both adaptable and reliable, requiring a strategic roadmap for robust hybrid intelligent systems.

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a transformative shift in artificial intelligence, but
its rapid advancement has led to a fragmented understanding, often conflating
modern neural systems with outdated symbolic models -- a practice known as
conceptual retrofitting. This survey cuts through this confusion by introducing
a novel dual-paradigm framework that categorizes agentic systems into two
distinct lineages: the Symbolic/Classical (relying on algorithmic planning and
persistent state) and the Neural/Generative (leveraging stochastic generation
and prompt-driven orchestration). Through a systematic PRISMA-based review of
90 studies (2018--2025), we provide a comprehensive analysis structured around
this framework across three dimensions: (1) the theoretical foundations and
architectural principles defining each paradigm; (2) domain-specific
implementations in healthcare, finance, and robotics, demonstrating how
application constraints dictate paradigm selection; and (3) paradigm-specific
ethical and governance challenges, revealing divergent risks and mitigation
strategies. Our analysis reveals that the choice of paradigm is strategic:
symbolic systems dominate safety-critical domains (e.g., healthcare), while
neural systems prevail in adaptive, data-rich environments (e.g., finance).
Furthermore, we identify critical research gaps, including a significant
deficit in governance models for symbolic systems and a pressing need for
hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures. The findings culminate in a strategic
roadmap arguing that the future of Agentic AI lies not in the dominance of one
paradigm, but in their intentional integration to create systems that are both
adaptable and reliable. This work provides the essential conceptual toolkit to
guide future research, development, and policy toward robust and trustworthy
hybrid intelligent systems.

*Willem Fourie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes reframing instrumental goals in AI alignment as inherent features to be managed rather than failures to be eliminated, drawing on Aristotelian ontology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional AI alignment theory treats instrumental goals (power-seeking, self-preservation) as risk sources and attempts to limit them, but this approach may be insufficient.

Method: Constructs a philosophical argument using Aristotle's ontology and modern interpretations, viewing AI systems as goal-directed entities whose constitution naturally produces instrumental tendencies.

Result: The analysis shows instrumental goals can be understood as per se outcomes of AI systems' formal and material constitution rather than accidental malfunctions.

Conclusion: AI alignment efforts should shift from eliminating instrumental goals to understanding, managing, and directing them toward human-aligned ends.

Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI) alignment research, instrumental goals, also
called instrumental subgoals or instrumental convergent goals, are widely
associated with advanced AI systems. These goals, which include tendencies such
as power-seeking and self-preservation, become problematic when they conflict
with human aims. Conventional alignment theory treats instrumental goals as
sources of risk that become problematic through failure modes such as reward
hacking or goal misgeneralization, and attempts to limit the symptoms of
instrumental goals, notably resource acquisition and self-preservation. This
article proposes an alternative framing: that a philosophical argument can be
constructed according to which instrumental goals may be understood as features
to be accepted and managed rather than failures to be limited. Drawing on
Aristotle's ontology and its modern interpretations, an ontology of concrete,
goal-directed entities, it argues that advanced AI systems can be seen as
artifacts whose formal and material constitution gives rise to effects distinct
from their designers' intentions. In this view, the instrumental tendencies of
such systems correspond to per se outcomes of their constitution rather than
accidental malfunctions. The implication is that efforts should focus less on
eliminating instrumental goals and more on understanding, managing, and
directing them toward human-aligned ends.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods for Text-to-SQL rely on static execution feedback, limiting real-time error correction. Multi-turn tool invocation with dynamic feedback could enhance adaptability and robustness.

Method: Proposes MTIR-SQL framework with execution-aware multi-turn reasoning that incorporates database execution feedback at each step. Extends GRPO algorithm with trajectory filtering and removes KL loss constraints to address training instability.

Result: Achieves 64.4% accuracy on BIRD Dev and 84.6% execution accuracy on SPIDER Dev with 4B parameters, significantly outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: The MTIR-SQL framework successfully demonstrates that dynamic multi-turn reasoning with execution feedback significantly improves Text-to-SQL performance and robustness.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in Text-to-SQL tasks,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a common method for improving
performance. Existing methods primarily rely on static execution feedback,
which restricts real-time error correction. However, integrating multi-turn
tool invocation along with dynamic feedback could significantly improve
adaptability and robustness, ultimately enhancing model performance. To address
these issues, we propose MTIR-SQL, an innovative Multi-turn Tool-Integrated
Reasoning reinforcement learning framework for Text-to-SQL. Our approach
introduces an execution-aware multi-turn reasoning paradigm that seamlessly
incorporates database execution feedback at each reasoning step, enabling
context-sensitive query generation and progressive refinement throughout the
reasoning process. The framework extends the GRPO algorithm to accommodate
complex multi-turn interaction scenarios. Considering the training instability
characteristics of MTIR and the potential for significant Deviation of model
distribution from the initial model, we enhance the GRPO algorithm by adding a
trajectory filtering mechanism and removing KL loss constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that MTIR-SQL, with 4B parameters, achieves \textbf{64.4}\%
accuracy in the BIRD Dev and 84.6% execution accuracy in the SPIDER Dev,
significantly outperforming existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unnamed predicates in logic rules from methods like Predicate Invention hinder readability, interpretability, and reusability of logic theories.

Method: Leverage LLMs' natural language and code processing capabilities to provide semantically meaningful names for unnamed predicates.

Result: Evaluation on hand-crafted logic rules shows LLMs have potential for this naming task.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for automatically naming unnamed predicates in logic rules to enhance theory interpretability.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of giving names to predicates in logic
rules using Large Language Models (LLMs). In the context of Inductive Logic
Programming, various rule generation methods produce rules containing unnamed
predicates, with Predicate Invention being a key example. This hinders the
readability, interpretability, and reusability of the logic theory. Leveraging
recent advancements in LLMs development, we explore their ability to process
natural language and code to provide semantically meaningful suggestions for
giving a name to unnamed predicates. The evaluation of our approach on some
hand-crafted logic rules indicates that LLMs hold potential for this task.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Zero-RL enhances LLM reasoning without supervised fine-tuning, but current methods focus on verifiable domains. This paper proposes a novel zero-RL paradigm combining verifiable rewards with generative reward models for both verifiable and non-verifiable domains, using multi-task training and smooth length penalty to prevent reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current zero-RL research primarily focuses on domains with easily verifiable reward signals (mathematics, programming), leaving more diverse scenarios with non-verifiable rewards underexplored. The challenge is to elicit reasoning abilities in domains where verification is not straightforward.

Method: Proposes a novel zero-RL paradigm combining verifiable rewards with a generative reward model, conducting multi-task zero-RL training across both verifiable and non-verifiable domains. Uses a smooth length penalty to mitigate reward hacking and encourage comprehensive thinking tokens in general domains.

Result: Experimental results on Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-14B-Base demonstrate superior reasoning performance, achieving improvements not only on tasks requiring extensive reasoning but also on more general tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed zero-RL approach successfully transfers reasoning capabilities between verifiable and non-verifiable domains, achieving enhanced performance across diverse reasoning scenarios through multi-task training and careful reward design.

Abstract: Zero Reinforcement Learning (Zero-RL) has proven to be an effective approach
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by
directly applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards on pretrained
models, without the need for a supervised fine-tuning phase. However, current
research on zero-RL primarily focuses on domains with easily verifiable reward
signals, such as mathematics, programming, and other reasoning tasks. The
challenge of eliciting reasoning abilities in more diverse scenarios, where
verification is not straightforward, remains underexplored. To address this
gap, we propose a novel zero-RL paradigm designed to improve a model's
reasoning ability across both verifiable and non-verifiable domains. By
combining verifiable rewards with a generative reward model, we conduct
multi-task zero-RL training across both domains, facilitating the transfer of
reasoning capabilities between them. Furthermore, to mitigate reward hacking in
the generative reward model, we design a smooth length penalty that encourages
the generation of more comprehensive thinking tokens in general domains.
Experimental results on Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-14B-Base demonstrate that our
approach achieves superior reasoning performance, not only on tasks requiring
extensive reasoning but also on more general tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MoGE is a novel exploration method that uses diffusion models to generate critical states and world models to create synthetic transitions, enhancing passive exploration in reinforcement learning without modifying core algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing exploration methods have limitations: active exploration struggles in high-dimensional environments, while passive exploration is constrained by limited sample diversity in replay buffers.

Method: MoGE has two components: (1) a diffusion-based generator that synthesizes critical states guided by a utility function, and (2) a one-step imagination world model that constructs critical transitions from these states for agent learning.

Result: Empirical results on OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control Suite show MoGE effectively bridges exploration and policy learning, achieving remarkable gains in sample efficiency and performance across complex control tasks.

Conclusion: MoGE provides a modular approach that seamlessly integrates with existing off-policy algorithms to improve exploration without altering their core structures, addressing limitations of both active and passive exploration methods.

Abstract: Exploration is fundamental to reinforcement learning (RL), as it determines
how effectively an agent discovers and exploits the underlying structure of its
environment to achieve optimal performance. Existing exploration methods
generally fall into two categories: active exploration and passive exploration.
The former introduces stochasticity into the policy but struggles in
high-dimensional environments, while the latter adaptively prioritizes
transitions in the replay buffer to enhance exploration, yet remains
constrained by limited sample diversity. To address the limitation in passive
exploration, we propose Modelic Generative Exploration (MoGE), which augments
exploration through the generation of under-explored critical states and
synthesis of dynamics-consistent experiences through transition models. MoGE is
composed of two components: (1) a diffusion-based generator that synthesizes
critical states under the guidance of a utility function evaluating each
state's potential influence on policy exploration, and (2) a one-step
imagination world model for constructing critical transitions based on the
critical states for agent learning. Our method adopts a modular formulation
that aligns with the principles of off-policy learning, allowing seamless
integration with existing algorithms to improve exploration without altering
their core structures. Empirical results on OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control
Suite reveal that MoGE effectively bridges exploration and policy learning,
leading to remarkable gains in both sample efficiency and performance across
complex control tasks.

TL;DR: A Fine-Tuned LLM Consortium integrated with OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM for clinical diagnosis of mental disorders, addressing subjective variability in psychiatric evaluations through AI standardization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the subjective nature and variability in psychiatric diagnoses across clinicians and patients, which leads to inconsistencies and unreliable outcomes in mental health assessment.

Method: Leverages fine-tuned LLMs trained on psychiatrist-patient conversational datasets, aggregates diagnostic predictions through consensus-based decision-making, and refines decisions using OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM with LLM agents orchestrating communication.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate transformative potential with robust and highly accurate diagnostic system. A prototype integrating three fine-tuned LLMs with reasoning LLM was developed in collaboration with U.S. Army Medical Research Team.

Conclusion: This represents the first application of fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with reasoning LLM for clinical mental health diagnosis, paving the way for next-generation AI-powered eHealth systems to standardize psychiatric diagnoses.

Abstract: The diagnosis of most mental disorders, including psychiatric evaluations,
primarily depends on dialogues between psychiatrists and patients. This
subjective process can lead to variability in diagnoses across clinicians and
patients, resulting in inconsistencies and challenges in achieving reliable
outcomes. To address these issues and standardize psychiatric diagnoses, we
propose a Fine-Tuned Large Language Model (LLM) Consortium and OpenAI-gpt-oss
Reasoning LLM-enabled Decision Support System for the clinical diagnosis of
mental disorders. Our approach leverages fine-tuned LLMs trained on
conversational datasets involving psychiatrist-patient interactions focused on
mental health conditions (e.g., depression). The diagnostic predictions from
individual models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making
process, refined by the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM. We propose a novel method
for deploying LLM agents that orchestrate communication between the LLM
consortium and the reasoning LLM, ensuring transparency, reliability, and
responsible AI across the entire diagnostic workflow. Experimental results
demonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned LLMs with a
reasoning model to create a robust and highly accurate diagnostic system for
mental health assessment. A prototype of the proposed platform, integrating
three fine-tuned LLMs with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM, was developed in
collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team in Norfolk, Virginia,
USA. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application
of a fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with a reasoning LLM for clinical
mental health diagnosis paving the way for next-generation AI-powered eHealth
systems aimed at standardizing psychiatric diagnoses.

TL;DR: CAIR is the first method to assess agent influence in LLM-based multi-agent systems using counterfactual analysis, providing task-agnostic influence rankings that work both offline and at inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing adoption of Agentic AI Workflows (AAWs) requires better understanding of agent operations, but existing methods only perform static structural analysis which is unsuitable for inference time execution.

Method: Counterfactual-based Agent Influence Ranker (CAIR) performs counterfactual analysis to assess each agent's influence level on the AAW's final output and determine the most influential agents.

Result: Evaluation on a custom AAWs dataset with 30 use cases and 230 functionalities showed CAIR produces consistent rankings, outperforms baseline methods, and enhances downstream task effectiveness.

Conclusion: CAIR successfully addresses the gap in agent influence assessment for AAWs, providing a practical solution for understanding and improving multi-agent system operations.

Abstract: An Agentic AI Workflow (AAW), also known as an LLM-based multi-agent system,
is an autonomous system that assembles several LLM-based agents to work
collaboratively towards a shared goal. The high autonomy, widespread adoption,
and growing interest in such AAWs highlight the need for a deeper understanding
of their operations, from both quality and security aspects. To this day, there
are no existing methods to assess the influence of each agent on the AAW's
final output. Adopting techniques from related fields is not feasible since
existing methods perform only static structural analysis, which is unsuitable
for inference time execution. We present Counterfactual-based Agent Influence
Ranker (CAIR) - the first method for assessing the influence level of each
agent on the AAW's output and determining which agents are the most
influential. By performing counterfactual analysis, CAIR provides a
task-agnostic analysis that can be used both offline and at inference time. We
evaluate CAIR using an AAWs dataset of our creation, containing 30 different
use cases with 230 different functionalities. Our evaluation showed that CAIR
produces consistent rankings, outperforms baseline methods, and can easily
enhance the effectiveness and relevancy of downstream tasks.

*Tianyu Yang,Terry Ruas,Yijun Tian,Jan Philip Wahle,Daniel Kurzawe,Bela Gipp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ALDEN is a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes VLMs as interactive agents for actively navigating long, visually rich documents, achieving state-of-the-art performance on five benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models struggle with long, complex documents that require analysis across multiple pages, and existing approaches use rigid templates that limit efficiency and generalization.

Method: ALDEN uses multi-turn reinforcement learning with fetch actions for direct page access, cross-level rewards for supervision, and visual-semantic anchoring to stabilize training with numerous visual tokens.

Result: ALDEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on five long-document benchmarks after training on a corpus from three open-source datasets.

Conclusion: ALDEN represents a shift from passive document reading to autonomous agents that navigate and reason across long documents, providing a robust path for more accurate and efficient long-document understanding.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at interpreting text-rich images but
struggle with long, visually complex documents that demand analysis and
integration of information spread across multiple pages. Existing approaches
typically rely on fixed reasoning templates or rigid pipelines, which force
VLMs into a passive role and hinder both efficiency and generalization. We
present Active Long-DocumEnt Navigation (ALDEN), a multi-turn reinforcement
learning framework that fine-tunes VLMs as interactive agents capable of
actively navigating long, visually rich documents. ALDEN introduces a novel
fetch action that directly accesses the page by index, complementing the
classic search action and better exploiting document structure. For dense
process supervision and efficient training, we propose a rule-based cross-level
reward that provides both turn- and token-level signals. To address the
empirically observed training instability caused by numerous visual tokens from
long documents, we further propose a visual-semantic anchoring mechanism that
applies a dual-path KL-divergence constraint to stabilize visual and textual
representations separately during training. Trained on a corpus constructed
from three open-source datasets, ALDEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on
five long-document benchmarks. Overall, ALDEN marks a step beyond passive
document reading toward agents that autonomously navigate and reason across
long, visually rich documents, offering a robust path to more accurate and
efficient long-document understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAVs are increasingly used in urban areas for delivery and surveillance, but face challenges navigating complex turbulent urban flows with recirculation zones.

Method: Flow-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) combined with Gated Transformer eXtra Large (GTrXL) architecture, using a 3D high-fidelity urban flow simulation with turbulence.

Result: Significant increase in success rate (SR) and lower crash rate (CR) compared to PPO+LSTM, PPO+GTrXL without secondary prediction tasks, and traditional Zermelo's navigation algorithm.

Conclusion: The approach paves the way for completely reimagined UAV navigation in complex urban environments by effectively handling turbulent flow conditions.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly populating urban areas for
delivery and surveillance purposes. In this work, we develop an optimal
navigation strategy based on Deep Reinforcement Learning. The environment is
represented by a three-dimensional high-fidelity simulation of an urban flow,
characterized by turbulence and recirculation zones. The algorithm presented
here is a flow-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) combined with a Gated
Transformer eXtra Large (GTrXL) architecture, giving the agent richer
information about the turbulent flow field in which it navigates. The results
are compared with a PPO+GTrXL without the secondary prediction tasks, a PPO
combined with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells and a traditional navigation
algorithm. The obtained results show a significant increase in the success rate
(SR) and a lower crash rate (CR) compared to a PPO+LSTM, PPO+GTrXL and the
classical Zermelo's navigation algorithm, paving the way to a completely
reimagined UAV landscape in complex urban environments.

TL;DR: BambooKG is a knowledge graph with frequency-based weights on non-triplet edges that improves retrieval-augmented generation by reducing information loss and enhancing multi-hop reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrieval-Augmented Generation struggles with multi-hop reasoning across documents and knowledge graphs miss non-triplet information, leading to information loss.

Method: Introduces BambooKG with frequency-based weights on non-triplet edges based on the Hebbian principle "fire together, wire together" to capture link strength.

Result: BambooKG decreases information loss and outperforms existing solutions on both single- and multi-hop reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The frequency-weighted non-triplet edges in BambooKG effectively enhance structured reasoning capabilities in retrieval-augmented systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation allows LLMs to access external knowledge,
reducing hallucinations and ageing-data issues. However, it treats retrieved
chunks independently and struggles with multi-hop or relational reasoning,
especially across documents. Knowledge graphs enhance this by capturing the
relationships between entities using triplets, enabling structured, multi-chunk
reasoning. However, these tend to miss information that fails to conform to the
triplet structure. We introduce BambooKG, a knowledge graph with
frequency-based weights on non-triplet edges which reflect link strength,
drawing on the Hebbian principle of "fire together, wire together". This
decreases information loss and results in improved performance on single- and
multi-hop reasoning, outperforming the existing solutions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TheraMind introduces a dual-loop architecture for longitudinal psychological counseling that separates tactical dialogue management (Intra-Session Loop) from strategic therapeutic planning (Cross-Session Loop), enabling emotional understanding, adaptive strategies, and long-term memory across multiple sessions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM approaches in psychological counseling lack emotional understanding, adaptive strategies, and therapeutic methods across multiple sessions with long-term memory, making them inadequate for real clinical practice.

Method: A novel dual-loop architecture with Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management (perceiving emotional states, dynamic strategy selection) and Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning (evaluating therapy efficacy, adjusting methods across sessions) with cross-session memory.

Result: TheraMind outperforms other methods in high-fidelity simulations, especially on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and Therapeutic Attunement, validating the effectiveness of its dual-loop design.

Conclusion: The dual-loop architecture effectively emulates strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior, addressing critical gaps in existing psychological counseling approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) in psychological counseling have attracted
increasing attention. However, existing approaches often lack emotional
understanding, adaptive strategies, and the use of therapeutic methods across
multiple sessions with long-term memory, leaving them far from real clinical
practice. To address these critical gaps, we introduce TheraMind, a strategic
and adaptive agent for longitudinal psychological counseling. The cornerstone
of TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex
counseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management
and a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning. The Intra-Session
Loop perceives the patient's emotional state to dynamically select response
strategies while leveraging cross-session memory to ensure continuity.
Crucially, the Cross-Session Loop empowers the agent with long-term
adaptability by evaluating the efficacy of the applied therapy after each
session and adjusting the method for subsequent interactions. We validate our
approach in a high-fidelity simulation environment grounded in real clinical
cases. Extensive evaluations show that TheraMind outperforms other methods,
especially on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and
Therapeutic Attunement, validating the effectiveness of its dual-loop design in
emulating strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior. The code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for assessing scenario coverage in autonomous agents rely on costly human annotations or computationally intensive LVLMs, making them impractical for large-scale deployment due to cost and efficiency constraints.

Method: SCOUT uses a distillation process to learn from LVLM-generated coverage labels, leveraging precomputed perception features from agents' latent sensor representations to enable fast, scalable scenario coverage estimation without continuous LVLM inference.

Result: Evaluation across real-life autonomous navigation scenarios shows SCOUT maintains high accuracy while significantly reducing computational cost, providing an effective practical alternative for large-scale coverage analysis.

Conclusion: SCOUT represents a major step toward efficient scenario coverage oversight in autonomous systems, though its performance depends on the quality of LVLM-generated training labels.

Abstract: Assessing scenario coverage is crucial for evaluating the robustness of
autonomous agents, yet existing methods rely on expensive human annotations or
computationally intensive Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). These
approaches are impractical for large-scale deployment due to cost and
efficiency constraints. To address these shortcomings, we propose SCOUT
(Scenario Coverage Oversight and Understanding Tool), a lightweight surrogate
model designed to predict scenario coverage labels directly from an agent's
latent sensor representations. SCOUT is trained through a distillation process,
learning to approximate LVLM-generated coverage labels while eliminating the
need for continuous LVLM inference or human annotation. By leveraging
precomputed perception features, SCOUT avoids redundant computations and
enables fast, scalable scenario coverage estimation. We evaluate our method
across a large dataset of real-life autonomous navigation scenarios,
demonstrating that it maintains high accuracy while significantly reducing
computational cost. Our results show that SCOUT provides an effective and
practical alternative for large-scale coverage analysis. While its performance
depends on the quality of LVLM-generated training labels, SCOUT represents a
major step toward efficient scenario coverage oversight in autonomous systems.

TL;DR: A hierarchical multimodal recurrent neural network based on predictive processing was developed for autonomous care robots, capable of learning multiple caregiving tasks without task-specific preprocessing and demonstrating robust performance in simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing task-specific care robots that rely on handcrafted preprocessing and lack generalization ability, inspired by the brain's hierarchical predictive processing for flexible cognition.

Method: Developed a hierarchical multimodal recurrent neural network grounded in predictive processing under the free-energy principle, capable of directly integrating high-dimensional visuo-proprioceptive inputs without dimensionality reduction.

Result: The model successfully learned rigid-body repositioning and flexible-towel wiping tasks, demonstrated hierarchical latent dynamics for task transitions, robustness to degraded vision, and asymmetric interference in multitask learning while maintaining overall robustness.

Conclusion: Predictive processing serves as a universal and scalable computational principle for developing robust, flexible autonomous caregiving robots, while providing theoretical insights into human brain's flexible adaptation in uncertain environments.

Abstract: The rapid aging of societies is intensifying demand for autonomous care
robots; however, most existing systems are task-specific and rely on
handcrafted preprocessing, limiting their ability to generalize across diverse
scenarios. A prevailing theory in cognitive neuroscience proposes that the
human brain operates through hierarchical predictive processing, which
underlies flexible cognition and behavior by integrating multimodal sensory
signals. Inspired by this principle, we introduce a hierarchical multimodal
recurrent neural network grounded in predictive processing under the
free-energy principle, capable of directly integrating over 30,000-dimensional
visuo-proprioceptive inputs without dimensionality reduction. The model was
able to learn two representative caregiving tasks, rigid-body repositioning and
flexible-towel wiping, without task-specific feature engineering. We
demonstrate three key properties: (i) self-organization of hierarchical latent
dynamics that regulate task transitions, capture variability in uncertainty,
and infer occluded states; (ii) robustness to degraded vision through
visuo-proprioceptive integration; and (iii) asymmetric interference in
multitask learning, where the more variable wiping task had little influence on
repositioning, whereas learning the repositioning task led to a modest
reduction in wiping performance, while the model maintained overall robustness.
Although the evaluation was limited to simulation, these results establish
predictive processing as a universal and scalable computational principle,
pointing toward robust, flexible, and autonomous caregiving robots while
offering theoretical insight into the human brain's ability to achieve flexible
adaptation in uncertain real-world environments.

*Sourabh Karmakar,Cameron J. Turner*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A new forward kinematics-based calibration method using Denavit-Hartenberg convention was developed for Stewart platforms, employing photogrammetry with high-resolution cameras to measure platform poses and using Least Square methods for error compensation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate calibration of Stewart platforms is crucial for precise operation, but forward kinematics generates multiple solutions and complex kinematic relations make calibration challenging.

Method: Used Denavit-Hartenberg convention for forward kinematics modeling, photogrammetry with high-resolution digital cameras to capture platform poses, and three Least Square compensation strategies for error estimation.

Result: All three compensation approaches demonstrated noticeable enhancements in platform pose accuracies, showing potential for further improvements.

Conclusion: The photogrammetry-based calibration method provides a non-invasive solution that doesn't require additional hardware modifications and effectively improves Stewart platform accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate calibration of a Stewart platform is important for their precise and
efficient operation. However, the calibration of these platforms using forward
kinematics is a challenge for researchers because forward kinematics normally
generates multiple feasible and unfeasible solutions for any pose of the moving
platform. The complex kinematic relations among the six actuator paths
connecting the fixed base to the moving platform further compound the
difficulty in establishing a straightforward and efficient calibration method.
The authors developed a new forward kinematics-based calibration method using
Denavit-Hartenberg convention and used the Stewart platform Tiger 66.1
developed in their lab for experimenting with the photogrammetry-based
calibration strategies described in this paper. This system became operational
upon completion of construction, marking its inaugural use. The authors used
their calibration model for estimating the errors in the system and adopted
three compensation options or strategies as per Least Square method to improve
the accuracy of the system. These strategies leveraged a high-resolution
digital camera and off-the-shelf software to capture the poses of the moving
platform's center. This process is non-invasive and does not need any
additional equipment to be attached to the hexapod or any alteration of the
hexapod hardware. This photogrammetry-based calibration process involves
multiple high-resolution images from different angles to measure the position
and orientation of the platform center in the three-dimensional space. The
Target poses and Actual poses are then compared, and the error compensations
are estimated using the Least-Squared methods to calculate the Predicted poses.
Results from each of the three compensation approaches demonstrated noticeable
enhancements in platform pose accuracies, suggesting room for further
improvements.

TL;DR: This paper reviews assignment-free collaboration methods for robot swarms, focusing on shape formation using mean-shift exploration strategy that significantly improves efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional assignment-based methods for robot swarm collaboration face fundamental limitations in efficiency and robustness due to poor scalability to swarm variants, while biological swarms demonstrate efficient collective behaviors.

Method: The paper presents mean-shift exploration strategy as a key theoretical component for assignment-free collaboration, enabling large-scale robot swarms to achieve shape formation without individual task assignments.

Result: The mean-shift exploration strategy improves collaboration efficiency of large-scale swarms by dozens of times, with efficiency gains becoming more significant as swarm scale increases.

Conclusion: The assignment-free approach using mean-shift exploration enables practical applications in smart warehousing, area exploration, and cargo transportation through precise shape formation, area coverage formation, and maneuvering formation capabilities.

Abstract: Swarms evolving from collective behaviors among multiple individuals are
commonly seen in nature, which enables biological systems to exhibit more
efficient and robust collaboration. Creating similar swarm intelligence in
engineered robots poses challenges to the design of collaborative algorithms
that can be programmed at large scales. The assignment-based method has played
an eminent role for a very long time in solving collaboration problems of robot
swarms. However, it faces fundamental limitations in terms of efficiency and
robustness due to its unscalability to swarm variants. This article presents a
tutorial review on recent advances in assignment-free collaboration of robot
swarms, focusing on the problem of shape formation. A key theoretical component
is the recently developed \emph{mean-shift exploration} strategy, which
improves the collaboration efficiency of large-scale swarms by dozens of times.
Further, the efficiency improvement is more significant as the swarm scale
increases. Finally, this article discusses three important applications of the
mean-shift exploration strategy, including precise shape formation, area
coverage formation, and maneuvering formation, as well as their corresponding
industrial scenarios in smart warehousing, area exploration, and cargo
transportation.

Result: Achieves up to 52x faster inference on edge devices with 98% less parameters while maintaining or surpassing state-of-the-art VLA models' task accuracy and generalization. Ablation studies confirm preserved cross-task transferability and enhanced cost-performance trade-offs.

Conclusion: NanoVLA enables practical, high-precision robotic manipulation on resource-constrained hardware by optimizing the efficiency-performance trade-off through architectural innovations.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have significantly advanced robotic
manipulation by integrating vision-language models (VLMs), and action decoders
into a unified architecture. However, their deployment on resource-constrained
edge devices, such as mobile robots or embedded systems (e.g., Jetson Orin
Nano), remains challenging due to high computational demands, especially in
real-world scenarios where power, latency, and computational resources are
critical. To close this gap, we introduce Nano-scale Vision-Language Action
(NanoVLA), a family of lightweight VLA architectures that achieve high
performance with minimal resources. Our core innovations include: (1)
vision-language decoupling that moves conventional early vision and language
inputs fusion in VLM to late stage, achieving better performance while enabling
caching and reduce inference overhead and latency; (2) long-short action
chunking to ensure smooth, coherent multi-step planning without sacrificing
real-time responsiveness; (3) dynamic routing that adaptively assigns
lightweight or heavy backbones based on task complexity, further optimizing
inference efficiency. Experimental results on several benchmarks, as well as
real-world deployments, demonstrate that NanoVLA achieves up to 52x faster
inference on edge devices compared to previous state-of-the-art VLA models,
with 98% less parameters while maintaining or surpassing their task accuracy
and generalization. Ablation studies confirm that our decoupling strategy
preserves cross-task transferability, and the routing module enhances
cost-performance trade-offs, enabling practical, high-precision robotic
manipulation on resource-constrained hardware.

*Yuxiang Yan,Zhiyuan Zhou,Xin Gao,Guanghao Li,Shenglin Li,Jiaqi Chen,Qunyan Pu,Jian Pu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OrderMind is a spatial-aware manipulation ordering framework that learns object manipulation priorities using spatial context to handle cluttered environments effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing manipulation approaches often ignore spatial dependencies among objects in cluttered environments, leading to collisions and blocked access, which limits flexibility and scalability.

Method: Integrates spatial context encoder with temporal priority structuring module using k-NN spatial graphs, encodes object-object and object-manipulator interactions, and uses spatial prior labeling with vision-language models for supervision.

Result: Outperforms prior approaches in effectiveness and efficiency on Manipulation Ordering Benchmark (163,222 samples), enabling robust manipulation in both simulation and real-world cluttered scenes.

Conclusion: OrderMind provides a unified framework that successfully addresses spatial dependencies in cluttered manipulation tasks through spatial-aware priority learning.

Abstract: Manipulation in cluttered environments is challenging due to spatial
dependencies among objects, where an improper manipulation order can cause
collisions or blocked access. Existing approaches often overlook these spatial
relationships, limiting their flexibility and scalability. To address these
limitations, we propose OrderMind, a unified spatial-aware manipulation
ordering framework that directly learns object manipulation priorities based on
spatial context. Our architecture integrates a spatial context encoder with a
temporal priority structuring module. We construct a spatial graph using
k-Nearest Neighbors to aggregate geometric information from the local layout
and encode both object-object and object-manipulator interactions to support
accurate manipulation ordering in real-time. To generate physically and
semantically plausible supervision signals, we introduce a spatial prior
labeling method that guides a vision-language model to produce reasonable
manipulation orders for distillation. We evaluate OrderMind on our Manipulation
Ordering Benchmark, comprising 163,222 samples of varying difficulty. Extensive
experiments in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms prior approaches in effectiveness and
efficiency, enabling robust manipulation in cluttered scenes.

*Hongyu Song,Rishabh Dev Yadav,Cheng Guo,Wei Pan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SoraNav is an adaptive UAV navigation framework that integrates zero-shot vision-language model reasoning with geometry-aware decision-making to improve aerial navigation in 3D environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision-Language Navigation approaches struggle with aerial tasks requiring full 3D spatial reasoning, and large VLMs lack spatial grounding for navigation tasks.

Method: Integrates zero-shot VLM reasoning with geometric priors in image annotations, uses hybrid switching strategy between VLM reasoning and geometry-based exploration, and implements PX4-based hardware-software platform with digital twin and physical micro-UAV.

Result: In 2.5D scenarios: SR improved by 25.7%, SPL by 17%. In 3D scenarios: SR improved by 29.5%, SPL by 18.5% relative to baseline.

Conclusion: SoraNav effectively bridges the gap between semantic reasoning and spatial navigation for UAVs, demonstrating significant performance improvements in complex 3D environments.

Abstract: Interpreting visual observations and natural language instructions for
complex task execution remains a key challenge in robotics and AI. Despite
recent advances, language-driven navigation is still difficult, particularly
for UAVs in small-scale 3D environments. Existing Vision-Language Navigation
(VLN) approaches are mostly designed for ground robots and struggle to
generalize to aerial tasks that require full 3D spatial reasoning. The
emergence of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as GPT and Claude,
enables zero-shot semantic reasoning from visual and textual inputs. However,
these models lack spatial grounding and are not directly applicable to
navigation. To address these limitations, SoraNav is introduced, an adaptive
UAV navigation framework that integrates zero-shot VLM reasoning with
geometry-aware decision-making. Geometric priors are incorporated into image
annotations to constrain the VLM action space and improve decision quality. A
hybrid switching strategy leverages navigation history to alternate between VLM
reasoning and geometry-based exploration, mitigating dead-ends and redundant
revisits. A PX4-based hardware-software platform, comprising both a digital
twin and a physical micro-UAV, enables reproducible evaluation. Experimental
results show that in 2.5D scenarios, our method improves Success Rate (SR) by
25.7% and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) by 17%. In 3D scenarios, it
improves SR by 29.5% and SPL by 18.5% relative to the baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current progress in road quality monitoring using smartphones is limited by the lack of high-quality, standardized datasets that provide comprehensive context for analyzing road issues.

Method: Created a dataset using a mobile app that collects data from multiple smartphone sensors (GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, gravity, orientation) and integrates it with GIS data, weather information, and video footage of road conditions.

Result: Developed one of the few datasets that provides comprehensive road condition analysis with geographic context, including vehicle speed, acceleration, rotation rates, magnetic field intensity, and visual/spatial context.

Conclusion: The dataset will be publicly accessible to support initiatives in traffic management, infrastructure development, road safety, urban planning, and promote further research in smart transportation systems.

Abstract: It's important to monitor road issues such as bumps and potholes to enhance
safety and improve road conditions. Smartphones are equipped with various
built-in sensors that offer a cost-effective and straightforward way to assess
road quality. However, progress in this area has been slow due to the lack of
high-quality, standardized datasets. This paper discusses a new dataset created
by a mobile app that collects sensor data from devices like GPS,
accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, gravity sensors, and orientation
sensors. This dataset is one of the few that integrates Geographic Information
System (GIS) data with weather information and video footage of road
conditions, providing a comprehensive understanding of road issues with
geographic context. The dataset allows for a clearer analysis of road
conditions by compiling essential data, including vehicle speed, acceleration,
rotation rates, and magnetic field intensity, along with the visual and spatial
context provided by GIS, weather, and video data. Its goal is to provide
funding for initiatives that enhance traffic management, infrastructure
development, road safety, and urban planning. Additionally, the dataset will be
publicly accessible to promote further research and innovation in smart

*Jee Won Lee,Hansol Lim,Sooyeun Yang,Jongseong Brad Choi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hybrid visual tracking framework combining template matching, deep-feature Lucas-Kanade, and GRU-based prediction for robust robot vision under occlusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of classical tracking methods (fragile to occlusion/drift) and deep learning approaches (require continuous visibility, computationally intensive) for robust robot manipulation.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) Fast global template matcher constrains pose search, 2) Deep-feature Lucas-Kanade on VGG layers for sub-pixel alignment, 3) Residual regressor for local corrections, with GRU-based prediction during low confidence periods.

Result: Sustains under 2px tracking error on handheld video sequences with up to 90% occlusion, providing 30Hz control signals for real-time servo loops.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework achieves robust, low-latency precision essential for reliable real-world robot vision applications, bridging advanced perception with real-time servo control.

Abstract: Vision-based control systems, such as image-based visual servoing (IBVS),
have been extensively explored for precise robot manipulation. A persistent
challenge, however, is maintaining robust target tracking under partial or full
occlusions. Classical methods like Lucas-Kanade (LK) offer lightweight tracking
but are fragile to occlusion and drift, while deep learning-based approaches
often require continuous visibility and intensive computation. To address these
gaps, we propose a hybrid visual tracking framework that bridges advanced
perception with real-time servo control. First, a fast global template matcher
constrains the pose search region; next, a deep-feature Lucas-Kanade module
operating on early VGG layers refines alignment to sub-pixel accuracy (<2px);
then, a lightweight residual regressor corrects local misalignments caused by
texture degradation or partial occlusion. When visual confidence falls below a
threshold, a GRU-based predictor seamlessly extrapolates pose updates from
recent motion history. Crucially, the pipeline's final outputs-translation,
rotation, and scale deltas-are packaged as direct control signals for 30Hz
image-based servo loops. Evaluated on handheld video sequences with up to 90%
occlusion, our system sustains under 2px tracking error, demonstrating the
robustness and low-latency precision essential for reliable real-world robot
vision applications.

TL;DR: A novel method for training humanoid motion policies using only one non-walking motion sample plus walking motions, leveraging optimal transport and geodesic interpolation to generate intermediate poses for reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require multiple training samples per motion category, making human motion dataset collection labor-intensive and costly. The goal is to reduce data requirements while maintaining performance.

Method: Uses order-preserving optimal transport to compute distances between walking and non-walking sequences, interpolates along geodesics to generate new intermediate pose skeletons, optimizes for collision-free configurations, retargets to humanoid, and trains policies via reinforcement learning in simulation.

Result: Experimental evaluations on CMU MoCap dataset show the method consistently outperforms baselines and achieves superior performance across metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully enables effective humanoid motion policy training with minimal data requirements, demonstrating the viability of single-sample learning for complex motion tasks.

Abstract: Whole-body humanoid motion represents a cornerstone challenge in robotics,
integrating balance, coordination, and adaptability to enable human-like
behaviors. However, existing methods typically require multiple training
samples per motion category, rendering the collection of high-quality human
motion datasets both labor-intensive and costly. To address this, we propose a
novel approach that trains effective humanoid motion policies using only a
single non-walking target motion sample alongside readily available walking
motions. The core idea lies in leveraging order-preserving optimal transport to
compute distances between walking and non-walking sequences, followed by
interpolation along geodesics to generate new intermediate pose skeletons,
which are then optimized for collision-free configurations and retargeted to
the humanoid before integration into a simulated environment for policy
training via reinforcement learning. Experimental evaluations on the CMU MoCap
dataset demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines,
achieving superior performance across metrics. Code will be released upon
acceptance.

*Klaus Zauner,Hubert Gattringer,Andreas Mueller*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents an optimal control approach for transporting liquid-filled containers while minimizing spillage by incorporating sloshing dynamics into the trajectory planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handling liquid-filled containers with robotic manipulators is challenging due to sloshing dynamics, which can cause spillage during transport. The goal is to develop a method that can transport such containers along prescribed paths in minimum time while avoiding fluid spillage.

Method: The authors formulate an optimal control problem that incorporates the sloshing dynamics of the liquid. They solve this optimization problem using a direct multiple shooting approach.

Result: The proposed method successfully generates trajectories that minimize sloshing and prevent spillage while transporting liquid-filled cups along prescribed paths in shortest possible time.

Conclusion: By explicitly modeling sloshing dynamics within the optimal control framework, the approach enables efficient and spill-free transportation of liquid-filled containers using robotic manipulators.

Abstract: Handling loosely placed objects with robotic manipulators is a difficult task
from the point of view of trajectory planning and control. This becomes even
more challenging when the object to be handled is a container filled with
liquid. This paper addresses the task of transporting a liquid-filled cup
placed on a tray along a prescribed path in shortest time. The objective is to
minimize swapping, thus avoiding spillage of the fluid. To this end, the
sloshing dynamics is incorporated into the dynamic model used within the
optimal control problem formulation. The optimization problem is solved using a
direct multiple shooting approach.

*Wang zhi,Yuyan Liu,Liu Liu,Li Zhang,Ruixuan Lu,Dan Guo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SynHLMA is a framework that generates hand grasp sequences for articulated objects using language instructions, achieving HAOI generation, prediction, and interpolation tasks with superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hand grasp synthesis for articulated objects requires considering both object functionality and long-term manipulation sequences with object deformation, which existing methods don't adequately address.

Method: Uses discrete HAOI representation to model hand-object interaction frames, trains with natural language embeddings via HAOI manipulation language model, and employs joint-aware loss to handle dynamic joint variations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on HAOI-lang dataset for three manipulation tasks and enables robotics grasp execution through imitation learning.

Conclusion: SynHLMA effectively synthesizes hand language manipulation for articulated objects by aligning grasping processes with language descriptions in shared representation space.

Abstract: Generating hand grasps with language instructions is a widely studied topic
that benefits from embodied AI and VR/AR applications. While transferring into
hand articulatied object interaction (HAOI), the hand grasps synthesis requires
not only object functionality but also long-term manipulation sequence along
the object deformation. This paper proposes a novel HAOI sequence generation
framework SynHLMA, to synthesize hand language manipulation for articulated
objects. Given a complete point cloud of an articulated object, we utilize a
discrete HAOI representation to model each hand object interaction frame. Along
with the natural language embeddings, the representations are trained by an
HAOI manipulation language model to align the grasping process with its
language description in a shared representation space. A joint-aware loss is
employed to ensure hand grasps follow the dynamic variations of articulated
object joints. In this way, our SynHLMA achieves three typical hand
manipulation tasks for articulated objects of HAOI generation, HAOI prediction
and HAOI interpolation. We evaluate SynHLMA on our built HAOI-lang dataset and
experimental results demonstrate the superior hand grasp sequence generation
performance comparing with state-of-the-art. We also show a robotics grasp
application that enables dexterous grasps execution from imitation learning
using the manipulation sequence provided by our SynHLMA. Our codes and datasets
will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A centipede-type robot with flexible joints and multiple leg structures was developed to navigate both land and water using a unified control scheme, eliminating the need for environment-specific gait switching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-legged robots require complex environment-specific gait controllers and accurate switching mechanisms, which is challenging for diverse environments like land and water.

Method: Developed a centipede robot with flexible joints and tested three different leg structures using implicit-explicit control philosophy with unified control scheme across environments.

Result: Experimental evaluation using leg slip rate and energy consumption metrics confirmed that appropriate leg structures exist for navigating both aquatic and terrestrial environments under identical control.

Conclusion: A simple unified control scheme with properly designed leg structures can enable multi-legged robots to navigate both land and water environments without complex controller switching.

Abstract: Multi-legged mobile robots possess high mobility performance in rough terrain
environments, stemming from their high postural stability, joint flexibility,
and the redundancy provided by multiple legs. In prior research on navigating
between different environments such as land and water, the primary strategy
employed involves switching to a controller that generates an appropriate gait
for the new environment upon entering it. However, designing appropriate gaits
for each complex and diverse environment and accurately determining controller
switching for each environment is challenging. Therefore, this research
develops a centipede-type mobile robot that navigates both aquatic and
terrestrial environments with a simple, unified control scheme, based on the
implicit-explicit control philosophy and by ingeniously designing the robot's
body structure. In this research, we developed the robot featuring flexible
joints and left and right legs on each body segment and focused on the leg
structure which has extensive contact with the environment. This paper
evaluates the locomotion performance on land and water using the three
developed leg structures, using the robot's leg slip rate and actuator energy
consumption as evaluation metrics. The experimental results confirmed the
existence of an appropriate leg structure capable of navigating both aquatic
and terrestrial environments under identical control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a gait assistance system that can both follow user's free motion with minimal interaction forces and provide active assistance during walking.

Method: Uses gear backlash in actuation units for transparent mode, and adaptive oscillators to learn quasi-periodic locomotion signals for superimposed assistance mode that applies torque to guide legs to estimated future positions.

Result: First experiments showed promising results.

Conclusion: The approach successfully combines transparency and motion assistance concepts for lower body exoskeleton gait assistance.

Abstract: In this paper, an approach for gait assistance with a lower body exoskeleton
is described. Two concepts, transparency and motion assistance, are combined.
The transparent mode, where the system is following the user's free motion with
a minimum of perceived interaction forces, is realized by exploiting the gear
backlash of the actuation units. During walking a superimposed assistance mode
applies an additional torque guiding the legs to their estimated future
position. The concept of adaptive oscillators is utilized to learn the
quasi-periodic signals typical for locomotion. First experiments showed
promising results.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more mechanically robust, cheaper, and easily transportable calibration method compared to conventional systems like laser trackers or motion capture systems.

Method: Uses a calibration plate with precisely known distances between measuring points, employs relative measurements between points to determine error parameters, and applies least squares method with constrained optimization for parameter identification.

Result: The method demonstrated promising results in experiments, showing correlation with laser tracker calibration results.

Conclusion: The calibration plate method provides an effective alternative to conventional calibration systems and can be applied to various robot types beyond the tested gantry machine.

Abstract: In this paper a new method for geometric robot calibration is introduced,
which uses a calibration plate with precisely known distances between its
measuring points. The relative measurement between two points on the
calibration plate is used to determine predefined error parameters of the
system. In comparison to conventional measurement methods, like laser tracker
or motion capture systems, the calibration plate provides a more mechanically
robust and cheaper alternative, which is furthermore easier to transport due to
its small size. The calibration method, the plate design, the mathematical
description of the error system as well as the identification of the parameters
are described in detail. For identifying the error parameters, the least
squares method and a constrained optimization problem are used. The
functionality of this method was demonstrated in experiments that led to
promising results, correlated with one of a laser tracker calibration. The
modeling and identification of the error parameters is done for a gantry
machine, but is not restricted to that type of robot.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic manipulation of deformable and fragile objects is challenging due to potential irreversible damage from excessive stress. Existing solutions rely on accurate models or specialized hardware, which adds complexity and lacks generalization.

Method: Vision-based reinforcement learning with stress-penalized reward function, offline demonstrations, and curriculum learning progressing from rigid proxies to deformable objects.

Result: Policies learned in simulation transferred to real-world in zero-shot manner, successfully performing tasks like picking up and pushing tofu. Stress applied to fragile objects decreased by 36.5% compared to vanilla RL policies while achieving task goals.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables damage-aware, gentle manipulation behavior for fragile objects, demonstrating effective transfer from simulation to real-world with significant stress reduction.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation of deformable and fragile objects presents significant
challenges, as excessive stress can lead to irreversible damage to the object.
While existing solutions rely on accurate object models or specialized sensors
and grippers, this adds complexity and often lacks generalization. To address
this problem, we present a vision-based reinforcement learning approach that
incorporates a stress-penalized reward to discourage damage to the object
explicitly. In addition, to bootstrap learning, we incorporate offline
demonstrations as well as a designed curriculum progressing from rigid proxies
to deformables. We evaluate the proposed method in both simulated and
real-world scenarios, showing that the policy learned in simulation can be
transferred to the real world in a zero-shot manner, performing tasks such as
picking up and pushing tofu. Our results show that the learned policies exhibit
a damage-aware, gentle manipulation behavior, demonstrating their effectiveness
by decreasing the stress applied to fragile objects by 36.5% while achieving
the task goals, compared to vanilla RL policies.

### [124] [Solving the Right Problem with Multi-Robot Formations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25422)
*Chaz Cornwall,Jeremy P. Bos*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A formation planner that reduces mismatch between formations and cost functions by optimizing relative robot positions through weighted surrogate cost functions, achieving 75% cost reduction for single objectives and 20-40% for multiple objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static formations often fail to minimize original cost functions when environmental information changes, creating discrepancies between maintaining shapes and actual cost minimization.

Method: Two-step optimization: first estimate non-linear costs with weighted surrogate functions, then minimize using relative positions with Lyapunov-based non-cooperative formation controller.

Result: 75% cost reduction for single objectives, 20-40% reduction for multiple objectives simultaneously; demonstrated effectiveness for military-like costs including protection and obstacle avoidance.

Conclusion: Formation planning outperforms static shape abstractions by minimizing surrogate cost functions that better approximate original objectives while leveraging efficient formation controllers.

Abstract: Formation control simplifies minimizing multi-robot cost functions by
encoding a cost function as a shape the robots maintain. However, by reducing
complex cost functions to formations, discrepancies arise between maintaining
the shape and minimizing the original cost function. For example, a Diamond or
Box formation shape is often used for protecting all members of the formation.
When more information about the surrounding environment becomes available, a
static shape often no longer minimizes the original protection cost. We propose
a formation planner to reduce mismatch between a formation and the cost
function while still leveraging efficient formation controllers. Our formation
planner is a two-step optimization problem that identifies desired relative
robot positions. We first solve a constrained problem to estimate non-linear
and non-differentiable costs with a weighted sum of surrogate cost functions.
We theoretically analyze this problem and identify situations where weights do
not need to be updated. The weighted, surrogate cost function is then minimized
using relative positions between robots. The desired relative positions are
realized using a non-cooperative formation controller derived from Lyapunov's
direct approach. We then demonstrate the efficacy of this approach for
military-like costs such as protection and obstacle avoidance. In simulations,
we show a formation planner can reduce a single cost by over 75%. When
minimizing a variety of cost functions simultaneously, using a formation
planner with adaptive weights can reduce the cost by 20-40%. Formation planning
provides better performance by minimizing a surrogate cost function that
closely approximates the original cost function instead of relying on a shape
abstraction.

Motivation: To develop a more comprehensive dynamic model for underwater vehicles that incorporates the effects of internal moving mass actuators, which are important for control and maneuvering capabilities.

Method: Derived a Newton-Euler formulation that expresses moving mass dynamics as an extension to Fossen's maneuvering model, including the moving mass influence in body-frame coordinates through additional kinematic equations and coupled rigid-body kinetics, with Coriolis-centripetal effects from Kirchhoff's equations and hydrostatics from first principles.

Result: The proposed Newton-Euler model was validated through simulation and compared with the traditional Hamiltonian formulation for internal moving mass actuators.

Conclusion: The Newton-Euler approach provides an effective alternative formulation for modeling underwater vehicles with internal moving mass actuators, successfully extending existing maneuvering models to account for this important actuation mechanism.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a Newton-Euler formulation of the equations of
motion for underwater vehicles with an interntal moving mass actuator.
Furthermore, the moving mass dynamics are expressed as an extension to the
manoeuvring model for underwater vehicles, originally introduced by Fossen
(1991). The influence of the moving mass is described in body-frame and
included as states in both an additional kinematic equation and as part of the
coupled rigid-body kinetics of the underwater vehicle. The Coriolis-centripetal
effects are derived from Kirchhoff's equations and the hydrostatics are derived
using first principals. The proposed Newton-Euler model is validated through
simulation and compared with the traditional Hamiltonian internal moving mass
actuator formulation.

Result: Ecoflex Gel 2 arm driven at 150 rpm reproduced curvature propagation similar to octopus reaching, but bend-point velocity decreased monotonically rather than showing the biological bell-shaped profile, and no propagation occurred in air.

Conclusion: Octopus reaching movement is not merely passive whipping behavior, with the surrounding medium playing a critical role, providing new perspective for understanding biological reaching and a platform for hydrodynamic research.

Abstract: The stereotypical reaching motion of the octopus arm has drawn growing
attention for its efficient control of a highly deformable body. Previous
studies suggest that its characteristic bend propagation may share underlying
principles with the dynamics of a whip. This work investigates whether
whip-like passive dynamics in water can reproduce the kinematic features
observed in biological reaching and their similarities and differences.
Platform-based whipping tests were performed in water and air while
systematically varying material stiffness and driving speed. Image-based
quantification revealed that the Ecoflex Gel 2 arm driven at 150 rpm (motor
speed) reproduced curvature propagation similar to that observed in octopus
reaching. However, its bend-point velocity decreased monotonically rather than
exhibiting the biological bell-shaped profile, confirming that the octopus
reaching movement is not merely a passive whipping behavior. The absence of
propagation in air further highlights the critical role of the surrounding
medium in forming octopus-like reaching motion. This study provides a new
perspective for understand biological reaching movement, and offers a potential
platform for future hydrodynamic research.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VIZ-COAST uses Vision-Language Models to predict downward refinement failures in task and motion planning, reducing planning times by identifying infeasible task plans before motion planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional task and motion planning methods only detect refinement failures after they occur during motion planning, leading to wasted search effort and slower performance.

Method: Leverages large pretrained Vision-Language Models for common-sense spatial reasoning to identify potential downward refinement issues from images and domain descriptions before planning.

Result: Drastically reduces planning times and eliminates downward refinement failures in some cases, generalizing across diverse domain instances.

Conclusion: Using Vision-Language Models for a priori refinement feasibility assessment is an effective approach to improve task and motion planning efficiency.

Abstract: In task and motion planning, high-level task planning is done over an
abstraction of the world to enable efficient search in long-horizon robotics
problems. However, the feasibility of these task-level plans relies on the
downward refinability of the abstraction into continuous motion. When a
domain's refinability is poor, task-level plans that appear valid may
ultimately fail during motion planning, requiring replanning and resulting in
slower overall performance. Prior works mitigate this by encoding refinement
issues as constraints to prune infeasible task plans. However, these approaches
only add constraints upon refinement failure, expending significant search
effort on infeasible branches. We propose VIZ-COAST, a method of leveraging the
common-sense spatial reasoning of large pretrained Vision-Language Models to
identify issues with downward refinement a priori, bypassing the need to fix
these failures during planning. Experiments on two challenging TAMP domains
show that our approach is able to extract plausible constraints from images and
domain descriptions, drastically reducing planning times and, in some cases,
eliminating downward refinement failures altogether, generalizing to a diverse
range of instances from the broader domain.

*Weikang Wan,Fabio Ramos,Xuning Yang,Caelan Garrett*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hierarchical framework for bimanual manipulation that treats the problem as skill planning & scheduling, using RL-trained primitive skills and a Transformer-based planner to coordinate parallel and sequential arm movements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon contact-rich bimanual manipulation requires complex coordination involving both parallel execution and sequential collaboration between arms, which is challenging for traditional approaches.

Method: Hierarchical framework with RL-trained primitive skills (single-arm and bimanual) and a Transformer-based planner that acts as a high-level scheduler, predicting both discrete skill schedules and continuous parameters simultaneously.

Result: Achieves higher success rates on complex, contact-rich tasks than end-to-end RL approaches and produces more efficient, coordinated behaviors than traditional sequential-only planners.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical skill planning & scheduling framework effectively addresses the challenges of bimanual manipulation by enabling simultaneous skill invocation and coordination.

Abstract: Long-horizon contact-rich bimanual manipulation presents a significant
challenge, requiring complex coordination involving a mixture of parallel
execution and sequential collaboration between arms. In this paper, we
introduce a hierarchical framework that frames this challenge as an integrated
skill planning & scheduling problem, going beyond purely sequential
decision-making to support simultaneous skill invocation. Our approach is built
upon a library of single-arm and bimanual primitive skills, each trained using
Reinforcement Learning (RL) in GPU-accelerated simulation. We then train a
Transformer-based planner on a dataset of skill compositions to act as a
high-level scheduler, simultaneously predicting the discrete schedule of skills
as well as their continuous parameters. We demonstrate that our method achieves
higher success rates on complex, contact-rich tasks than end-to-end RL
approaches and produces more efficient, coordinated behaviors than traditional
sequential-only planners.

*Ahmad Kokhahi,Mary Kurz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes energy-aware multi-agent path finding for AGVs with new collision avoidance and multi-objective task assignment algorithms (NSGA and ALNS) that outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most MAPF research focuses on minimizing collisions and travel time, but this paper also considers energy consumption in AGV path planning to address both collision resolution and task assignment challenges.

Method: Proposed a new collision avoidance strategy considering both energy use and travel time, and two multi-objective algorithms for task assignment: Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA) and Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS).

Result: Comparative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed methods perform better than existing approaches in both collision avoidance and task assignment.

Conclusion: The energy-aware approach with multi-objective optimization algorithms effectively addresses MAPF challenges for AGVs, achieving superior performance in collision resolution and task allocation.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) has gained significant attention, with most
research focusing on minimizing collisions and travel time. This paper also
considers energy consumption in the path planning of automated guided vehicles
(AGVs). It addresses two main challenges: i) resolving collisions between AGVs
and ii) assigning tasks to AGVs. We propose a new collision avoidance strategy
that takes both energy use and travel time into account. For task assignment,
we present two multi-objective algorithms: Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic
Algorithm (NSGA) and Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS). Comparative
evaluations show that these proposed methods perform better than existing
approaches in both collision avoidance and task assignment.

*Boshi An,Chenyu Yang,Robert Katzschmann*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Adapted Open-VLA model for dexterous human-robot collaboration with minimal language prompting using FiLM conditioning, auxiliary intent prediction, and action-space post-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable dexterous human-robot collaboration with minimal language requirements by adapting pre-trained VLA models.

Method: Added FiLM conditioning for task-aware perception, auxiliary intent head for hand pose prediction, and action-space post-processing with delta actions and PCA-reduced finger joints.

Result: Delta actions are well-behaved, 4 principal components explain ~96% of hand-joint variance, and real-time performance achieved with ~0.3s latency.

Conclusion: Action post-processing is the primary performance driver, with trainer overfitting to specific demonstrators identified as the key limitation.

Abstract: We adapt a pre-trained Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model (Open-VLA) for
dexterous human-robot collaboration with minimal language prompting. Our
approach adds (i) FiLM conditioning to visual backbones for task-aware
perception, (ii) an auxiliary intent head that predicts collaborator hand pose
and target cues, and (iii) action-space post-processing that predicts compact
deltas (position/rotation) and PCA-reduced finger joints before mapping to full
commands. Using a multi-view, teleoperated Franka and Mimic-hand dataset
augmented with MediaPipe hand poses, we demonstrate that delta actions are
well-behaved and that four principal components explain ~96% of hand-joint
variance. Ablations identify action post-processing as the primary performance
driver; auxiliary intent helps, FiLM is mixed, and a directional motion loss is
detrimental. A real-time stack (~0.3 s latency on one RTX 4090) composes
"pick-up" and "pass" into a long-horizon behavior. We surface "trainer
overfitting" to specific demonstrators as the key limitation.

Abstract: Contact-rich manipulation has become increasingly important in robot
learning. However, previous studies on robot learning datasets have focused on
rigid objects and underrepresented the diversity of pressure conditions for
real-world manipulation. To address this gap, we present a humanoid
visual-tactile-action dataset designed for manipulating deformable soft
objects. The dataset was collected via teleoperation using a humanoid robot
equipped with dexterous hands, capturing multi-modal interactions under varying

*Ciera McFarland,Margaret McGuinness*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A collapse model for soft, vine-inspired growing robots that predicts collapse length using true shape information and tail tension, validated through experiments with unsteered and steered robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft growing robots that move by eversion are highly mobile in confined environments but may collapse under their own weight when facing gaps, limiting their navigation capabilities.

Method: Developed a comprehensive collapse model using true shape information and tail tension, validated through experiments with unsteered robots and steered robots with single actuators at different orientations.

Result: The model accurately predicts collapse trends in unsteered robots and collapse occurrences in steered robots. Demonstrated practical application in gap-crossing tasks where robots need inflated actuators to avoid collapse.

Conclusion: The collapse model enables prediction of robot collapse behavior in open environments and understanding of parameters needed for successful 3D navigation tasks, with potential application to various robot variations beyond the tested configurations.

Abstract: Soft, vine-inspired growing robots that move by eversion are highly mobile in
confined environments, but, when faced with gaps in the environment, they may
collapse under their own weight while navigating a desired path. In this work,
we present a comprehensive collapse model that can predict the collapse length
of steered robots in any shape using true shape information and tail tension.
We validate this model by collapsing several unsteered robots without true
shape information. The model accurately predicts the trends of those
experiments. We then attempt to collapse a robot steered with a single actuator
at different orientations. Our models accurately predict collapse when it
occurs. Finally, we demonstrate how this could be used in the field by having a
robot attempt a gap-crossing task with and without inflating its actuators. The
robot needs its actuators inflated to cross the gap without collapsing, which
our model supports. Our model has been specifically tested on straight and
series pouch motor-actuated robots made of non-stretchable material, but it
could be applied to other robot variations. This work enables us to model the
robot's collapse behavior in any open environment and understand the parameters
it needs to succeed in 3D navigation tasks.

### [133] [GET-USE: Learning Generalized Tool Usage for Bimanual Mobile Manipulation via Simulated Embodiment Extensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25754)
*Bohan Wu,Paul de La Sayette,Li Fei-Fei,Roberto Martín-Martín*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GeT-USE enables robots to identify, grasp, and use the best available objects as tools by learning geometric knowledge through embodiment extension in simulation and transferring it to real-world visuomotor policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic tool usage methods can only handle single provided objects and assume the object can perform the task with correct grasp, lacking the ability to select the best object from multiple options when the optimal tool is absent.

Method: Two-step procedure: first learns to extend robot's embodiment in simulation to identify general tool geometries beneficial for tasks, then transfers learned strategies to real-robot visuomotor policies.

Result: On a real robot with 22 DOFs, GeT-USE outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 30-60% success rates across three vision-based bimanual mobile manipulation tool-usage tasks.

Conclusion: Learning geometric knowledge through embodiment extension in simulation enables effective generalized tool usage by allowing robots to select and use the best available real-world objects as tools.

Abstract: The ability to use random objects as tools in a generalizable manner is a
missing piece in robots' intelligence today to boost their versatility and
problem-solving capabilities. State-of-the-art robotic tool usage methods
focused on procedurally generating or crowd-sourcing datasets of tools for a
task to learn how to grasp and manipulate them for that task. However, these
methods assume that only one object is provided and that it is possible, with
the correct grasp, to perform the task; they are not capable of identifying,
grasping, and using the best object for a task when many are available,
especially when the optimal tool is absent. In this work, we propose GeT-USE, a
two-step procedure that learns to perform real-robot generalized tool usage by
learning first to extend the robot's embodiment in simulation and then
transferring the learned strategies to real-robot visuomotor policies. Our key
insight is that by exploring a robot's embodiment extensions (i.e., building
new end-effectors) in simulation, the robot can identify the general tool
geometries most beneficial for a task. This learned geometric knowledge can
then be distilled to perform generalized tool usage tasks by selecting and
using the best available real-world object as tool. On a real robot with 22
degrees of freedom (DOFs), GeT-USE outperforms state-of-the-art methods by
30-60% success rates across three vision-based bimanual mobile manipulation
tool-usage tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: STITCH 2.0 improves robot-assisted surgical suturing with enhanced needle tracking, thread management, and automated suture alignment, achieving 74.4% wound closure and 66% more sutures in 38% less time compared to previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical suturing quality varies widely between surgeons and affects patient outcomes. Previous robot suturing systems like STITCH 1.0 struggled with inaccurate needle tracking and poor thread management, limiting their ability to fully close wounds.

Method: STITCH 2.0 introduces an augmented dexterity pipeline with seven key improvements: enhanced EKF needle pose estimation, new thread untangling methods, and an automated 3D suture alignment algorithm.

Result: In 15 trials, STITCH 2.0 achieved 74.4% wound closure with 4.87 sutures per trial - 66% more sutures in 38% less time than baseline. With two human interventions, it averaged six sutures with 100% wound closure rate.

Conclusion: STITCH 2.0 significantly advances robot-assisted surgical suturing by addressing key limitations in needle tracking and thread management, demonstrating substantial improvements in wound closure efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: Surgical suturing is a high-precision task that impacts patient healing and
scarring. Suturing skill varies widely between surgeons, highlighting the need
for robot assistance. Previous robot suturing works, such as STITCH 1.0 [1],
struggle to fully close wounds due to inaccurate needle tracking and poor
thread management. To address these challenges, we present STITCH 2.0, an
elevated augmented dexterity pipeline with seven improvements including:
improved EKF needle pose estimation, new thread untangling methods, and an
automated 3D suture alignment algorithm. Experimental results over 15 trials
find that STITCH 2.0 on average achieves 74.4% wound closure with 4.87 sutures
per trial, representing 66% more sutures in 38% less time compared to the
previous baseline. When two human interventions are allowed, STITCH 2.0
averages six sutures with 100% wound closure rate. Project website:
