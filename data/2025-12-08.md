### [1] [AREA3D: Active Reconstruction Agent with Unified Feed-Forward 3D Perception and Vision-Language Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05131)
*Tianling Xu,Shengzhe Gan,Leslie Gu,Yuelei Li,Fangneng Zhan,Hanspeter Pfister*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AREA3D is an active 3D reconstruction agent that uses feed-forward models and vision-language guidance to autonomously select informative viewpoints, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing active reconstruction methods rely on hand-crafted geometric heuristics that often lead to redundant observations without significantly improving reconstruction quality. There's a need for more intelligent viewpoint selection that goes beyond purely geometric cues.

Method: AREA3D decouples view-uncertainty modeling from feed-forward 3D reconstruction models, enabling precise uncertainty estimation without expensive online optimization. It integrates vision-language models to provide high-level semantic guidance for selecting informative and diverse viewpoints beyond geometric cues.

Result: Extensive experiments on scene-level and object-level benchmarks show that AREA3D achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy, particularly in the sparse-view regime where fewer observations are available.

Conclusion: AREA3D demonstrates that combining feed-forward reconstruction models with vision-language guidance enables more efficient and accurate active 3D reconstruction, outperforming traditional geometric heuristics-based methods.

Abstract: Active 3D reconstruction enables an agent to autonomously select viewpoints to efficiently obtain accurate and complete scene geometry, rather than passively reconstructing scenes from pre-collected images. However, existing active reconstruction methods often rely on hand-crafted geometric heuristics, which can lead to redundant observations without substantially improving reconstruction quality. To address this limitation, we propose AREA3D, an active reconstruction agent that leverages feed-forward 3D reconstruction models and vision-language guidance. Our framework decouples view-uncertainty modeling from the underlying feed-forward reconstructor, enabling precise uncertainty estimation without expensive online optimization. In addition, an integrated vision-language model provides high-level semantic guidance, encouraging informative and diverse viewpoints beyond purely geometric cues. Extensive experiments on both scene-level and object-level benchmarks demonstrate that AREA3D achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy, particularly in the sparse-view regime.

### [2] [Breaking Scale Anchoring: Frequency Representation Learning for Accurate High-Resolution Inference from Low-Resolution Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05132)
*Wenshuo Wang,Fan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Zero-shot super-resolution forecasting models fail to reduce error at higher resolutions due to "Scale Anchoring" - a fundamental limitation where low-resolution training data can't represent high-frequency components needed for accurate high-resolution inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current zero-shot super-resolution forecasting models maintain similar error across resolutions, which is incorrectly interpreted as successful generalization. However, models should actually reduce error as resolution increases, but they're fundamentally limited by the Nyquist frequency of low-resolution training data.

Method: Proposed Frequency Representation Learning (FRL) with resolution-aligned frequency representations and spectral consistency training. FRL ensures more stable frequency response in high-frequency bands on higher-resolution grids, allowing errors to decrease with resolution.

Result: FRL-enhanced models significantly outperform baselines in zero-shot super-resolution forecasting, with errors decreasing as resolution increases (unlike baselines). Achieves this with only modest computational overhead.

Conclusion: Identified "Scale Anchoring" as a new fundamental problem in zero-shot super-resolution forecasting. Proposed FRL as an architecture-agnostic solution that enables models to properly generalize across resolutions by learning better frequency representations.

Abstract: Zero-Shot Super-Resolution Spatiotemporal Forecasting requires a deep learning model to be trained on low-resolution data and deployed for inference on high-resolution. Existing studies consider maintaining similar error across different resolutions as indicative of successful multi-resolution generalization. However, deep learning models serving as alternatives to numerical solvers should reduce error as resolution increases. The fundamental limitation is, the upper bound of physical law frequencies that low-resolution data can represent is constrained by its Nyquist frequency, making it difficult for models to process signals containing unseen frequency components during high-resolution inference. This results in errors being anchored at low resolution, incorrectly interpreted as successful generalization. We define this fundamental phenomenon as a new problem distinct from existing issues: Scale Anchoring. Therefore, we propose architecture-agnostic Frequency Representation Learning. It alleviates Scale Anchoring through resolution-aligned frequency representations and spectral consistency training: on grids with higher Nyquist frequencies, the frequency response in high-frequency bands of FRL-enhanced variants is more stable. This allows errors to decrease with resolution and significantly outperform baselines within our task and resolution range, while incurring only modest computational overhead.

### [3] [InvarDiff: Cross-Scale Invariance Caching for Accelerated Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05134)
*Zihao Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InvarDiff: Training-free acceleration method for diffusion models that exploits temporal invariance across timesteps and layers to achieve 2-3× speedups with minimal quality degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models produce high-quality results but are slow due to iterative sampling. The authors observed feature invariance in deterministic sampling that can be exploited for acceleration without retraining.

Method: InvarDiff computes a binary cache plan matrix from few deterministic runs using quantile-based change metrics. This matrix identifies which modules at which steps can be reused rather than recomputed. It applies step-first and layer-wise caching during inference with re-sampling correction to avoid drift.

Result: Achieves 2-3× end-to-end speed-ups on DiT and FLUX models with minimal impact on standard quality metrics. Visual quality shows almost no degradation compared to full computations.

Conclusion: InvarDiff effectively reduces redundant computation in diffusion models by exploiting temporal invariance, providing significant speed improvements while maintaining output quality, all without requiring retraining.

Abstract: Diffusion models deliver high-fidelity synthesis but remain slow due to iterative sampling. We empirically observe there exists feature invariance in deterministic sampling, and present InvarDiff, a training-free acceleration method that exploits the relative temporal invariance across timestep-scale and layer-scale. From a few deterministic runs, we compute a per-timestep, per-layer, per-module binary cache plan matrix and use a re-sampling correction to avoid drift when consecutive caches occur. Using quantile-based change metrics, this matrix specifies which module at which step is reused rather than recomputed. The same invariance criterion is applied at the step scale to enable cross-timestep caching, deciding whether an entire step can reuse cached results. During inference, InvarDiff performs step-first and layer-wise caching guided by this matrix. When applied to DiT and FLUX, our approach reduces redundant compute while preserving fidelity. Experiments show that InvarDiff achieves $2$-$3\times$ end-to-end speed-ups with minimal impact on standard quality metrics. Qualitatively, we observe almost no degradation in visual quality compared with full computations.

### [4] [Fine-tuning an ECG Foundation Model to Predict Coronary CT Angiography Outcomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05136)
*Yujie Xiao,Gongzhen Tang,Deyun Zhang,Jun Li,Guangkun Nie,Haoyu Wang,Shun Huang,Tong Liu,Qinghao Zhao,Kangyin Chen,Shenda Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI-ECG model predicts severe coronary artery stenosis with good accuracy, offering radiation-free CAD screening alternative to CCTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CCTA has limitations for large-scale CAD screening (equipment needs, radiation, patient cooperation), while ECG is widely available. AI-ECG could provide accessible, non-invasive CAD assessment.

Method: Developed interpretable AI-ECG model to predict severe/complete stenosis in four major coronary arteries (RCA, LM, LAD, LCX) using CCTA as reference standard.

Result: Model achieved AUCs of 0.794-0.818 on internal validation and 0.667-0.971 on external validation for different arteries. Performance stable in normal-ECG subset and across demographic subgroups.

Conclusion: AI-ECG shows promise as accessible CAD screening tool, with interpretability revealing ECG waveform patterns associated with coronary stenosis.

Abstract: Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains a major global health burden. Accurate identification of the culprit vessel and assessment of stenosis severity are essential for guiding individualized therapy. Although coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is the first-line non-invasive modality for CAD diagnosis, its dependence on high-end equipment, radiation exposure, and strict patient cooperation limits large-scale use. With advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and the widespread availability of electrocardiography (ECG), AI-ECG offers a promising alternative for CAD screening. In this study, we developed an interpretable AI-ECG model to predict severe or complete stenosis of the four major coronary arteries on CCTA. On the internal validation set, the model's AUCs for the right coronary artery (RCA), left main coronary artery (LM), left anterior descending artery (LAD), and left circumflex artery (LCX) were 0.794, 0.818, 0.744, and 0.755, respectively; on the external validation set, the AUCs reached 0.749, 0.971, 0.667, and 0.727, respectively. Performance remained stable in a clinically normal-ECG subset, indicating robustness beyond overt ECG abnormalities. Subgroup analyses across demographic and acquisition-time strata further confirmed model stability. Risk stratification based on vessel-specific incidence thresholds showed consistent separation on calibration and cumulative event curves. Interpretability analyses revealed distinct waveform differences between high- and low-risk groups, highlighting key electrophysiological regions contributing to model decisions and offering new insights into the ECG correlates of coronary stenosis.

*Yunfei Zhang,Yizhuo He,Yuanxun Shao,Zhengtao Yao,Haoyan Xu,Junhao Dong,Zhen Yao,Zhikang Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChromouVQA is a benchmark using Ishihara-style chromatic camouflaged images to test VLMs on figure-ground segregation tasks, revealing performance gaps and proposing a contrastive learning solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models struggle with figure-ground segregation in cluttered backgrounds, especially when targets are chromatically camouflaged, creating a need for controlled evaluation benchmarks.

Method: Created ChromouVQA benchmark with Ishihara-style images featuring varied chromatic separation, density, size, occlusion, and rotation. Includes 9 VQA tasks and proposes contrastive recipe aligning silhouettes with camouflaged renderings.

Result: Evaluations show large performance gaps between humans and VLMs, especially under subtle chromatic contrast or disruptive geometric fills. Proposed contrastive method improves global shape recovery.

Conclusion: ChromouVQA provides a compact, controlled benchmark for reproducible evaluation of VLMs on figure-ground segregation tasks, with open-source code and dataset available.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced multimodal understanding, yet still struggle when targets are embedded in cluttered backgrounds requiring figure-ground segregation. To address this, we introduce ChromouVQA, a large-scale, multi-task benchmark based on Ishihara-style chromatic camouflaged images. We extend classic dot plates with multiple fill geometries and vary chromatic separation, density, size, occlusion, and rotation, recording full metadata for reproducibility. The benchmark covers nine vision-question-answering tasks, including recognition, counting, comparison, and spatial reasoning. Evaluations of humans and VLMs reveal large gaps, especially under subtle chromatic contrast or disruptive geometric fills. We also propose a model-agnostic contrastive recipe aligning silhouettes with their camouflaged renderings, improving recovery of global shapes. ChromouVQA provides a compact, controlled benchmark for reproducible evaluation and extension. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Chromou-VQA-Benchmark/Chromou-VQA.

### [6] [Spatiotemporal Satellite Image Downscaling with Transfer Encoders and Autoregressive Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05139)
*Yang Xiang,Jingwen Zhong,Yige Yan,Petros Koutrakis,Eric Garshick,Meredith Franklin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Transfer-learning generative downscaling framework reconstructs fine-resolution satellite images from coarse inputs using U-Net encoder pretrained on long time series and diffusion-based generative model, achieving excellent performance while preserving physical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust method for reconstructing fine-resolution satellite images from coarse-scale inputs that can handle long time series with limited training periods, improving environmental exposure assessment and long-term monitoring capabilities.

Method: Combines lightweight U-Net transfer encoder (pretrained on coarse resolution data) with diffusion-based generative model. U-Net encoder learns spatiotemporal representations from long time series, then frozen and transferred as physically meaningful latent features to larger downscaling model. Applied to downscale NASA's MERRA-2 reanalysis (50 km) to GEOS-5 Nature Run resolution (7 km) over Asian region, split into subregions and seasons.

Result: Achieved excellent performance (R2 = 0.65 to 0.94 across seasonal regional splits), outperforming deterministic U-Nets, variational autoencoders, and prior transfer learning baselines. Out-of-data evaluations confirmed preserved physically consistent spatial variability and temporal autocorrelation, enabling stable autoregressive reconstruction beyond training record.

Conclusion: Transfer-enhanced diffusion models provide a robust and physically coherent solution for downscaling long time series of coarse resolution images with limited training periods, with significant implications for environmental exposure assessment and long-term monitoring.

Abstract: We present a transfer-learning generative downscaling framework to reconstruct fine resolution satellite images from coarse scale inputs. Our approach combines a lightweight U-Net transfer encoder with a diffusion-based generative model. The simpler U-Net is first pretrained on a long time series of coarse resolution data to learn spatiotemporal representations; its encoder is then frozen and transferred to a larger downscaling model as physically meaningful latent features. Our application uses NASA's MERRA-2 reanalysis as the low resolution source domain (50 km) and the GEOS-5 Nature Run (G5NR) as the high resolution target (7 km). Our study area included a large area in Asia, which was made computationally tractable by splitting into two subregions and four seasons. We conducted domain similarity analysis using Wasserstein distances confirmed minimal distributional shift between MERRA-2 and G5NR, validating the safety of parameter frozen transfer. Across seasonal regional splits, our model achieved excellent performance (R2 = 0.65 to 0.94), outperforming comparison models including deterministic U-Nets, variational autoencoders, and prior transfer learning baselines. Out of data evaluations using semivariograms, ACF/PACF, and lag-based RMSE/R2 demonstrated that the predicted downscaled images preserved physically consistent spatial variability and temporal autocorrelation, enabling stable autoregressive reconstruction beyond the G5NR record. These results show that transfer enhanced diffusion models provide a robust and physically coherent solution for downscaling a long time series of coarse resolution images with limited training periods. This advancement has significant implications for improving environmental exposure assessment and long term environmental monitoring.

*Georges Le Bellier,Nicolas Audebert*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowEO uses flow matching generative models for unsupervised domain adaptation in Earth observation, outperforming existing image translation methods for classification and segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earth observation data is heterogeneous with distribution shifts between training and deployment domains, limiting generalization of pretrained models. Unsupervised domain adaptation is crucial for real-world remote sensing applications.

Method: FlowEO leverages flow matching to learn semantically preserving mappings that transport from source to target image distributions, enabling image-space unsupervised domain adaptation for Earth observation.

Result: Outperforms existing image translation approaches for domain adaptation while achieving on-par or better perceptual image quality across four datasets covering SAR to optical translation and temporal/semantic shifts from natural disasters.

Conclusion: FlowEO demonstrates the potential of flow-matching-based unsupervised domain adaptation for remote sensing applications, effectively handling challenging domain adaptation configurations.

Abstract: The increasing availability of Earth observation data offers unprecedented opportunities for large-scale environmental monitoring and analysis. However, these datasets are inherently heterogeneous, stemming from diverse sensors, geographical regions, acquisition times, and atmospheric conditions. Distribution shifts between training and deployment domains severely limit the generalization of pretrained remote sensing models, making unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) crucial for real-world applications. We introduce FlowEO, a novel framework that leverages generative models for image-space UDA in Earth observation. We leverage flow matching to learn a semantically preserving mapping that transports from the source to the target image distribution. This allows us to tackle challenging domain adaptation configurations for classification and semantic segmentation of Earth observation images. We conduct extensive experiments across four datasets covering adaptation scenarios such as SAR to optical translation and temporal and semantic shifts caused by natural disasters. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowEO outperforms existing image translation approaches for domain adaptation while achieving on-par or better perceptual image quality, highlighting the potential of flow-matching-based UDA for remote sensing.

### [8] [Self-Improving VLM Judges Without Human Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05145)
*Inna Wanyin Lin,Yushi Hu,Shuyue Stella Li,Scott Geng,Pang Wei Koh,Luke Zettlemoyer,Tim Althoff,Marjan Ghazvininejad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-training framework for VLM judges without human annotations achieves state-of-the-art performance by iteratively generating and filtering synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM judge training relies on expensive human preference annotations that quickly become obsolete as models improve rapidly, creating a need for scalable, self-supervised alternatives.

Method: Three-stage iterative framework: (1) generate diverse multimodal instruction-response pairs at varying quality levels, (2) generate reasoning traces and judgments, filtering mismatched pairs, (3) train on correct judge answers with reasoning traces.

Result: Improves Llama-3.2-11B judge from 0.38 to 0.51 overall accuracy on VL-RewardBench, outperforming larger models (Llama-3.2-90B, GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) especially in general, hallucination, and reasoning dimensions.

Conclusion: Human-annotation-free self-training shows strong potential for developing VLM judges that can evolve alongside rapidly improving model capabilities without costly manual annotation.

Abstract: Effective judges of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are crucial for model development. Current methods for training VLM judges mainly rely on large-scale human preference annotations. However, such an approach is costly, and the annotations easily become obsolete as models rapidly improve. In this work, we present a framework to self-train a VLM judge model without any human preference annotations, using only self-synthesized data. Our method is iterative and has three stages: (1) generate diverse multimodal instruction-response pairs at varying quality levels, (2) generate reasoning traces and judgments for each pair, removing the ones that do not match our expected quality levels, and (3) training on correct judge answers and their reasoning traces. We evaluate the resulting judge on Multimodal RewardBench and VL-RewardBench across domains: correctness, preference, reasoning, safety, and visual question-answering. Our method improves a Llama-3.2-11B multimodal judge from 0.38 to 0.51 in overall accuracy on VL-RewardBench, often outperforming much larger models including Llama-3.2-90B, GPT-4o, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, with particularly strong gains in general, hallucination, and reasoning dimensions. The overall strength of these human-annotation-free results suggest the potential for a future self-judge that evolves alongside rapidly improving VLM capabilities.

### [9] [TwinFlow: Realizing One-step Generation on Large Models with Self-adversarial Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05150)
*Zhenglin Cheng,Peng Sun,Jianguo Li,Tao Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TwinFlow is a simple framework for training 1-step generative models that avoids pretrained teachers and adversarial networks, achieving efficient multi-modal generation with 100x computational reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal generative models use multi-step frameworks (40-100 NFEs) that limit inference efficiency. Existing few-step methods have limitations: distillation methods require iterative procedures or degrade at <4 NFEs, while adversarial training methods introduce instability, complexity, and high memory overhead.

Method: TwinFlow bypasses the need for fixed pretrained teacher models and avoids standard adversarial networks during training. It's a simple yet effective framework for training 1-step generative models, making it suitable for building large-scale, efficient models.

Result: On text-to-image tasks, TwinFlow achieves GenEval score of 0.83 in 1-NFE, outperforming SANA-Sprint and RCGM. When trained on Qwen-Image-20B, it matches the performance of the original 100-NFE model on both GenEval and DPG-Bench benchmarks with just 1-NFE, reducing computational cost by 100x with minor quality degradation.

Conclusion: TwinFlow provides an efficient solution for few-step generative modeling that avoids the limitations of existing distillation and adversarial training methods, demonstrating scalability to large models while maintaining performance with dramatically reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Recent advances in large multi-modal generative models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in multi-modal generation, including image and video generation. These models are typically built upon multi-step frameworks like diffusion and flow matching, which inherently limits their inference efficiency (requiring 40-100 Number of Function Evaluations (NFEs)). While various few-step methods aim to accelerate the inference, existing solutions have clear limitations. Prominent distillation-based methods, such as progressive and consistency distillation, either require an iterative distillation procedure or show significant degradation at very few steps (< 4-NFE). Meanwhile, integrating adversarial training into distillation (e.g., DMD/DMD2 and SANA-Sprint) to enhance performance introduces training instability, added complexity, and high GPU memory overhead due to the auxiliary trained models. To this end, we propose TwinFlow, a simple yet effective framework for training 1-step generative models that bypasses the need of fixed pretrained teacher models and avoids standard adversarial networks during training, making it ideal for building large-scale, efficient models. On text-to-image tasks, our method achieves a GenEval score of 0.83 in 1-NFE, outperforming strong baselines like SANA-Sprint (a GAN loss-based framework) and RCGM (a consistency-based framework). Notably, we demonstrate the scalability of TwinFlow by full-parameter training on Qwen-Image-20B and transform it into an efficient few-step generator. With just 1-NFE, our approach matches the performance of the original 100-NFE model on both the GenEval and DPG-Bench benchmarks, reducing computational cost by $100\times$ with minor quality degradation.

### [10] [EFDiT: Efficient Fine-grained Image Generation Using Diffusion Transformer Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05152)
*Kun Wang,Donglin Di,Tonghua Su,Lei Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion model approach for fine-grained image generation using tiered embeddings and super-resolution enhancement to address semantic entanglement and detail insufficiency issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current class-conditional diffusion models struggle with fine-grained image generation due to semantic information entanglement between super/child classes and insufficient detail in generated images, especially for less common categories.

Method: Introduces tiered embedder to integrate semantic information from both super and child classes, uses super-resolution during perceptual information generation for detail enhancement, and proposes efficient ProAttention mechanism for diffusion models.

Result: Outperforms other state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods on public benchmarks, demonstrating improved performance in fine-grained image generation.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses semantic entanglement and detail insufficiency in fine-grained image generation through tiered embeddings and super-resolution enhancement, achieving superior results compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Diffusion models are highly regarded for their controllability and the diversity of images they generate. However, class-conditional generation methods based on diffusion models often focus on more common categories. In large-scale fine-grained image generation, issues of semantic information entanglement and insufficient detail in the generated images still persist. This paper attempts to introduce a concept of a tiered embedder in fine-grained image generation, which integrates semantic information from both super and child classes, allowing the diffusion model to better incorporate semantic information and address the issue of semantic entanglement. To address the issue of insufficient detail in fine-grained images, we introduce the concept of super-resolution during the perceptual information generation stage, enhancing the detailed features of fine-grained images through enhancement and degradation models. Furthermore, we propose an efficient ProAttention mechanism that can be effectively implemented in the diffusion model. We evaluate our method through extensive experiments on public benchmarks, demonstrating that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods in terms of performance.

### [11] [Semore: VLM-guided Enhanced Semantic Motion Representations for Visual Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05172)
*Wentao Wang,Chunyang Liu,Kehua Sheng,Bo Zhang,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Semore is a VLM-based framework for visual RL that extracts both semantic and motion representations from RGB flows using a dual-path backbone, guided by VLM knowledge and CLIP alignment, achieving state-of-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based RL methods focus on control policy guidance but suffer from limited representation capabilities in backbone networks, creating a need for better semantic and motion understanding in visual RL.

Method: Uses a dual-path backbone to extract semantic and motion representations from RGB flows, leverages VLM for common-sense knowledge retrieval, employs CLIP for text-image alignment, and uses separate supervision for representation fusion with spontaneous interaction.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method exhibits efficient and adaptive ability compared to state-of-art methods under VLM guidance at the feature level.

Conclusion: Semore successfully addresses representation limitations in LLM-based RL by integrating VLM knowledge and dual-path representation learning, demonstrating superior performance in visual reinforcement learning tasks.

Abstract: The growing exploration of Large Language Models (LLM) and Vision-Language Models (VLM) has opened avenues for enhancing the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL). However, existing LLM-based RL methods often focus on the guidance of control policy and encounter the challenge of limited representations of the backbone networks. To tackle this problem, we introduce Enhanced Semantic Motion Representations (Semore), a new VLM-based framework for visual RL, which can simultaneously extract semantic and motion representations through a dual-path backbone from the RGB flows. Semore utilizes VLM with common-sense knowledge to retrieve key information from observations, while using the pre-trained clip to achieve the text-image alignment, thereby embedding the ground-truth representations into the backbone. To efficiently fuse semantic and motion representations for decision-making, our method adopts a separately supervised approach to simultaneously guide the extraction of semantics and motion, while allowing them to interact spontaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, under the guidance of VLM at the feature level, our method exhibits efficient and adaptive ability compared to state-of-art methods. All codes are released.

### [12] [Your Latent Mask is Wrong: Pixel-Equivalent Latent Compositing for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05198)
*Rowan Bradbury,Dazhi Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Pixel-Equivalent Latent Compositing (PELC) principle and DecFormer transformer for artifact-free latent inpainting that matches pixel-space alpha compositing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current latent inpainting methods using linear VAE latent interpolation produce artifacts at mask seams, global degradation, and color shifts because they don't properly account for how VAEs capture global context beyond patch-aligned local structure.

Method: Introduces DecFormer, a 7.7M-parameter transformer that predicts per-channel blend weights and residual corrections to achieve pixel-equivalent latent fusion. Trained so decoding after fusion matches pixel-space alpha compositing.

Result: DecFormer restores global color consistency, soft-mask support, sharp boundaries, and high-fidelity masking, reducing error metrics around edges by up to 53% over standard mask interpolation. Adds only 0.07% parameters and 3.5% FLOP overhead to FLUX.1-Dev.

Conclusion: PELC enables true pixel-equivalent latent editing, with DecFormer achieving inpainting fidelity comparable to fully finetuned models while being plug-compatible and lightweight. The approach generalizes beyond inpainting to other latent editing tasks.

Abstract: Latent inpainting in diffusion models still relies almost universally on linearly interpolating VAE latents under a downsampled mask. We propose a key principle for compositing image latents: Pixel-Equivalent Latent Compositing (PELC). An equivalent latent compositor should be the same as compositing in pixel space. This principle enables full-resolution mask control and true soft-edge alpha compositing, even though VAEs compress images 8x spatially. Modern VAEs capture global context beyond patch-aligned local structure, so linear latent blending cannot be pixel-equivalent: it produces large artifacts at mask seams and global degradation and color shifts. We introduce DecFormer, a 7.7M-parameter transformer that predicts per-channel blend weights and an off-manifold residual correction to realize mask-consistent latent fusion. DecFormer is trained so that decoding after fusion matches pixel-space alpha compositing, is plug-compatible with existing diffusion pipelines, requires no backbone finetuning and adds only 0.07% of FLUX.1-Dev's parameters and 3.5% FLOP overhead. On the FLUX.1 family, DecFormer restores global color consistency, soft-mask support, sharp boundaries, and high-fidelity masking, reducing error metrics around edges by up to 53% over standard mask interpolation. Used as an inpainting prior, a lightweight LoRA on FLUX.1-Dev with DecFormer achieves fidelity comparable to FLUX.1-Fill, a fully finetuned inpainting model. While we focus on inpainting, PELC is a general recipe for pixel-equivalent latent editing, as we demonstrate on a complex color-correction task.

*Vsevolod Plohotnuk,Artyom Panshin,Nikola Banić,Simone Bianco,Michael Freeman,Egor Ershov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEAR is the first dataset for evaluating image rendering aesthetics using human preference scores, enabling models to go beyond traditional distortion-based quality assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IQA focuses on technical degradations (noise, blur, compression) but lacks evaluation of rendering aesthetics, which is crucial for photographic editing, content creation, and AI-generated imagery. There's a need for datasets that capture subjective style preferences.

Method: Built upon MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset, DEAR incorporates pairwise human preference scores collected via large-scale crowdsourcing (25 evaluators per image pair, 13,648 total participants). The dataset enables Evaluation of Aesthetics of Rendering (EAR) as a new task.

Result: Created DEAR dataset with nuanced, context-sensitive aesthetic preference annotations. Published subset of 100 images on HuggingFace. The dataset supports style preference prediction, aesthetic benchmarking, and personalized aesthetic modeling.

Conclusion: DEAR is the first systematic dataset for image aesthetics of rendering assessment grounded in subjective human preferences, addressing a gap in evaluating rendering styles beyond traditional distortion-based metrics.

Abstract: Traditional Image Quality Assessment~(IQA) focuses on quantifying technical degradations such as noise, blur, or compression artifacts, using both full-reference and no-reference objective metrics. However, evaluation of rendering aesthetics, a growing domain relevant to photographic editing, content creation, and AI-generated imagery, remains underexplored due to the lack of datasets that reflect the inherently subjective nature of style preference. In this work, a novel benchmark dataset designed to model human aesthetic judgments of image rendering styles is introduced: the Dataset for Evaluating the Aesthetics of Rendering (DEAR). Built upon the MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset, DEAR incorporates pairwise human preference scores collected via large-scale crowdsourcing, with each image pair evaluated by 25 distinct human evaluators with a total of 13,648 of them participating overall. These annotations capture nuanced, context-sensitive aesthetic preferences, enabling the development and evaluation of models that go beyond traditional distortion-based IQA, focusing on a new task: Evaluation of Aesthetics of Rendering (EAR). The data collection pipeline is described, human voting patterns are analyzed, and multiple use cases are outlined, including style preference prediction, aesthetic benchmarking, and personalized aesthetic modeling. To the best of the authors' knowledge, DEAR is the first dataset to systematically address image aesthetics of rendering assessment grounded in subjective human preferences. A subset of 100 images with markup for them is published on HuggingFace (huggingface.co/datasets/vsevolodpl/DEAR).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuous video monitoring faces power constraints with conventional RGB cameras, while event cameras offer low-power sensing but produce non-standard event streams. Need to combine benefits of both for energy-efficient video capture.

Method: Two approaches: 1) HyperE2VID - adapting autoregressive model for RGB generation, 2) LTX - injecting event representations into pretrained text-to-video diffusion model via learned encoders and low-rank adaptation.

Result: Diffusion-based approach achieves 33% better perceptual quality than autoregressive baseline (0.283 vs 0.422 LPIPS). Robust cross-dataset generalization demonstrated across three event camera datasets at varying sequence lengths.

Conclusion: Hybrid capture paradigm with sparse RGB keyframes and continuous event streams enables power-efficient video monitoring while maintaining standard RGB video output quality through effective reconstruction methods.

Abstract: Continuous video monitoring in surveillance, robotics, and wearable systems faces a fundamental power constraint: conventional RGB cameras consume substantial energy through fixed-rate capture. Event cameras offer sparse, motion-driven sensing with low power consumption, but produce asynchronous event streams rather than RGB video. We propose a hybrid capture paradigm that records sparse RGB keyframes alongside continuous event streams, then reconstructs full RGB video offline -- reducing capture power consumption while maintaining standard video output for downstream applications. We introduce the Image and Event to Video (IE2Video) task: reconstructing RGB video sequences from a single initial frame and subsequent event camera data. We investigate two architectural strategies: adapting an autoregressive model (HyperE2VID) for RGB generation, and injecting event representations into a pretrained text-to-video diffusion model (LTX) via learned encoders and low-rank adaptation. Our experiments demonstrate that the diffusion-based approach achieves 33\% better perceptual quality than the autoregressive baseline (0.283 vs 0.422 LPIPS). We validate our approach across three event camera datasets (BS-ERGB, HS-ERGB far/close) at varying sequence lengths (32-128 frames), demonstrating robust cross-dataset generalization with strong performance on unseen capture configurations.

TL;DR: AionHMR is a framework that improves 3D human shape and pose estimation for children and infants by using SMPL-A body model and generating pseudo-ground-truth data, enabling age-inclusive reconstruction while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D human shape and pose estimation methods perform well for adults but fail to generalize to children and infants, creating a domain gap that needs to be addressed for inclusive human modeling.

Method: Proposed AionHMR framework with optimization-based method using SMPL-A body model to generate pseudo-ground-truth for child/infant databases, then trained transformer-based deep learning model for real-time age-inclusive reconstruction.

Result: Significantly improved shape and pose estimation for children and infants without compromising adult accuracy; created 3D-BabyRobot dataset of action-preserving 3D reconstructions; enables privacy-preserving anonymized datasets.

Conclusion: The work bridges crucial domain gap in 3D human modeling, establishes foundation for inclusive, privacy-aware, and age-diverse human reconstruction with applications in privacy-preserving data sharing.

Abstract: While three-dimensional (3D) shape and pose estimation is a highly researched area that has yielded significant advances, the resulting methods, despite performing well for the adult population, generally fail to generalize effectively to children and infants. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing AionHMR, a comprehensive framework designed to bridge this domain gap. We propose an optimization-based method that extends a top-performing model by incorporating the SMPL-A body model, enabling the concurrent and accurate modeling of adults, children, and infants. Leveraging this approach, we generated pseudo-ground-truth annotations for publicly available child and infant image databases. Using these new training data, we then developed and trained a specialized transformer-based deep learning model capable of real-time 3D age-inclusive human reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods significantly improve shape and pose estimation for children and infants without compromising accuracy on adults. Importantly, our reconstructed meshes serve as privacy-preserving substitutes for raw images, retaining essential action, pose, and geometry information while enabling anonymized datasets release. As a demonstration, we introduce the 3D-BabyRobot dataset, a collection of action-preserving 3D reconstructions of children interacting with robots. This work bridges a crucial domain gap and establishes a foundation for inclusive, privacy-aware, and age-diverse 3D human modeling.

*Niki Nezakati,Arnab Ghosh,Amit Roy-Chowdhury,Vishwanath Saragadam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CARD is a training-free diffusion method that handles spatially correlated noise via whitening, outperforming existing methods on real-world sensor noise tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world sensors produce spatially correlated noise due to readout mechanisms, but most diffusion models assume i.i.d. Gaussian noise, limiting practical effectiveness in image restoration.

Method: CARD whitens noisy observations to convert correlated noise to i.i.d. form, then uses noise-whitened updates in diffusion restoration while maintaining DDRM's closed-form sampling efficiency.

Result: CARD outperforms existing methods on synthetic correlated noise benchmarks and the new CIN-D dataset across denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution tasks.

Conclusion: Addressing correlated noise is crucial for real-world image restoration, and CARD provides an effective training-free solution while CIN-D fills a critical evaluation gap for real-world sensor noise.

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in image restoration by modeling the process as sequential denoising steps. However, most approaches assume independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian noise, while real-world sensors often exhibit spatially correlated noise due to readout mechanisms, limiting their practical effectiveness. We introduce Correlation Aware Restoration with Diffusion (CARD), a training-free extension of DDRM that explicitly handles correlated Gaussian noise. CARD first whitens the noisy observation, which converts the noise into an i.i.d. form. Then, the diffusion restoration steps are replaced with noise-whitened updates, which inherits DDRM's closed-form sampling efficiency while now being able to handle correlated noise. To emphasize the importance of addressing correlated noise, we contribute CIN-D, a novel correlated noise dataset captured across diverse illumination conditions to evaluate restoration methods on real rolling-shutter sensor noise. This dataset fills a critical gap in the literature for experimental evaluation with real-world correlated noise. Experiments on standard benchmarks with synthetic correlated noise and on CIN-D demonstrate that CARD consistently outperforms existing methods across denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COM4D is a method for reconstructing complete 4D scenes with multiple interacting objects from monocular videos using only static multi-object or dynamic single-object supervision, without requiring 4D compositional training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on single objects with category-specific models, leading to inconsistent scene configurations and limited to modeled categories. Real-world scenes have multiple static/dynamic objects, making 4D structure capture challenging.

Method: Uses spatial and temporal attentions on 2D video input with disentangled training: learning object compositions and single object dynamics separately. Attention mixing combines learned attentions at inference without 4D composition examples.

Result: Reconstructs complete and persistent 4D scenes with multiple interacting objects from monocular videos. Provides state-of-the-art results in 4D object and composed 3D reconstruction despite being purely data-driven.

Conclusion: COM4D enables consistent joint prediction of 4D scene structure and spatio-temporal configuration without 4D compositional training data, advancing multi-object 4D scene reconstruction from monocular videos.

Abstract: Scenes in the real world are often composed of several static and dynamic objects. Capturing their 4-dimensional structures, composition and spatio-temporal configuration in-the-wild, though extremely interesting, is equally hard. Therefore, existing works often focus on one object at a time, while relying on some category-specific parametric shape model for dynamic objects. This can lead to inconsistent scene configurations, in addition to being limited to the modeled object categories. We propose COM4D (Compositional 4D), a method that consistently and jointly predicts the structure and spatio-temporal configuration of 4D/3D objects using only static multi-object or dynamic single object supervision. We achieve this by a carefully designed training of spatial and temporal attentions on 2D video input. The training is disentangled into learning from object compositions on the one hand, and single object dynamics throughout the video on the other, thus completely avoiding reliance on 4D compositional training data. At inference time, our proposed attention mixing mechanism combines these independently learned attentions, without requiring any 4D composition examples. By alternating between spatial and temporal reasoning, COM4D reconstructs complete and persistent 4D scenes with multiple interacting objects directly from monocular videos. Furthermore, COM4D provides state-of-the-art results in existing separate problems of 4D object and composed 3D reconstruction despite being purely data-driven.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing temporal reasoning benchmarks focus on sports, cooking, and movies, but none address the unique challenges of ego-centric autonomous driving footage where temporal understanding is critical for safety and decision-making.

Method: Created TAD benchmark with ~6,000 QA pairs across 7 tasks, evaluated 9 generalist and AD specialist models, proposed two training-free solutions: Scene-CoT (Chain-of-Thought) and TCogMap (ego-centric temporal cognitive map).

Result: Current SoTA models show substandard accuracy on TAD due to poor fine-grained motion understanding. Proposed Scene-CoT and TCogMap methods improve average accuracy by up to 17.72% when integrated with existing VLMs.

Conclusion: TAD benchmark fills a critical gap in evaluating temporal understanding for autonomous driving, reveals limitations of current VLMs, and provides effective training-free solutions to improve performance, catalyzing future research in this domain.

Abstract: Temporal understanding in autonomous driving (AD) remains a significant challenge, even for recent state-of-the-art (SoTA) Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior work has introduced datasets and benchmarks aimed at improving temporal reasoning, but these have emphasized other video content, including sports, cooking, and movies. No existing benchmark focuses exclusively on the unique challenges of temporal understanding in ego-centric AD footage. To fill this gap, the Temporal Understanding in Autonomous Driving (TAD) benchmark is presented, which evaluates VLMs' ability to capture the dynamic relationships between actions in AD. TAD comprises nearly 6,000 question-answer (QA) pairs, spanning 7 human-designed tasks. In addition, an evaluation is performed that consists of 9 closed- and open-source generalist models as well as SoTA AD specialist models. When applied to TAD, current SoTA models demonstrated substandard accuracies, largely due to imperfect fine-grained motion understanding. To improve motion understanding and overall accuracy on TAD, two novel training-free solutions are proposed: Scene-CoT, that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and TCogMap, which incorporates an ego-centric temporal cognitive map. The proposed approaches are integrated with existing VLMs and improve average accuracy on TAD by up to 17.72%. By introducing TAD, benchmarking multiple SoTA models, and proposing effective enhancements, this work aims to catalyze future research on temporal understanding in AD. The benchmark and evaluation code are available at \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/vbdai/TAD}{Hugging Face} and \href{https://github.com/vbdi/tad_bench}{Github}, respectively.

TL;DR: SpaceControl enables training-free, test-time spatial control for 3D generation using geometric inputs like primitives or meshes, balancing geometric fidelity with realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D generative methods rely on ambiguous text or cumbersome image prompts, lacking precise geometric control over object shapes.

Method: Training-free test-time approach that accepts various geometric inputs (primitives to detailed meshes) and integrates with pre-trained generative models via a controllable fidelity-realism tradeoff parameter.

Result: Outperforms training-based and optimization-based baselines in geometric faithfulness while maintaining high visual quality, with interactive UI for editing superquadrics into textured 3D assets.

Conclusion: SpaceControl provides practical, intuitive geometric control for 3D generation without additional training, facilitating creative workflows through its interactive interface.

Abstract: Generative methods for 3D assets have recently achieved remarkable progress, yet providing intuitive and precise control over the object geometry remains a key challenge. Existing approaches predominantly rely on text or image prompts, which often fall short in geometric specificity: language can be ambiguous, and images are cumbersome to edit. In this work, we introduce SpaceControl, a training-free test-time method for explicit spatial control of 3D generation. Our approach accepts a wide range of geometric inputs, from coarse primitives to detailed meshes, and integrates seamlessly with modern pre-trained generative models without requiring any additional training. A controllable parameter lets users trade off between geometric fidelity and output realism. Extensive quantitative evaluation and user studies demonstrate that SpaceControl outperforms both training-based and optimization-based baselines in geometric faithfulness while preserving high visual quality. Finally, we present an interactive user interface that enables online editing of superquadrics for direct conversion into textured 3D assets, facilitating practical deployment in creative workflows.

Conclusion: Paves the way for fluid and intuitive 3D content authoring by providing a versatile, interactive editing solution for 3D Gaussian assets.

Abstract: The rise of 3D Gaussian Splatting has revolutionized photorealistic 3D asset creation, yet a critical gap remains for their interactive refinement and editing. Existing approaches based on diffusion or optimization are ill-suited for this task, as they are often prohibitively slow, destructive to the original asset's identity, or lack the precision for fine-grained control. To address this, we introduce \ourmethod, a state-aware feedforward model that enables continuous editing of 3D Gaussian assets from user-provided 2D view(s). Our method directly predicts updates to the attributes of a compact, feature-rich Gaussian representation and leverages Test-Time Training to create a state-aware, iterative workflow. The versatility of our approach allows a single architecture to perform diverse tasks, including high-fidelity local detail refinement, local paint-over, and consistent global recoloring, all at interactive speeds, paving the way for fluid and intuitive 3D content authoring.

*Zekai Shao,Yufan Hu,Jingyuan Liu,Bin Fan,Hongmin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GOLA framework reduces rank redundancy in RGB-T tracking by grouping redundant ranks and enforcing orthogonal constraints to learn complementary features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current parameter-efficient fine-tuning in RGB-T tracking suffers from significant redundancy in rank space, where many ranks contribute little practical information, limiting the model's ability to learn diverse knowledge for various tracking challenges.

Method: Proposes Group Orthogonal Low-Rank Adaptation (GOLA): 1) Uses SVD-based rank decomposition to quantify rank importance, 2) Freezes crucial ranks to preserve pretrained priors, 3) Clusters redundant ranks into groups, and 4) Applies inter-group orthogonal constraints to enforce complementary feature learning.

Result: GOLA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets, effectively reducing parameter redundancy and enhancing feature representation capabilities in RGB-T tracking tasks.

Conclusion: The GOLA framework successfully addresses rank space redundancy in parameter-efficient fine-tuning for RGB-T tracking, enabling more diverse knowledge learning through structured parameter learning and orthogonal constraints.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning has emerged as a promising paradigm in RGB-T tracking, enabling downstream task adaptation by freezing pretrained parameters and fine-tuning only a small set of parameters. This set forms a rank space made up of multiple individual ranks, whose expressiveness directly shapes the model's adaptability. However, quantitative analysis reveals low-rank adaptation exhibits significant redundancy in the rank space, with many ranks contributing almost no practical information. This hinders the model's ability to learn more diverse knowledge to address the various challenges in RGB-T tracking. To address this issue, we propose the Group Orthogonal Low-Rank Adaptation (GOLA) framework for RGB-T tracking, which effectively leverages the rank space through structured parameter learning. Specifically, we adopt a rank decomposition partitioning strategy utilizing singular value decomposition to quantify rank importance, freeze crucial ranks to preserve the pretrained priors, and cluster the redundant ranks into groups to prepare for subsequent orthogonal constraints. We further design an inter-group orthogonal constraint strategy. This constraint enforces orthogonality between rank groups, compelling them to learn complementary features that target diverse challenges, thereby alleviating information redundancy. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLA effectively reduces parameter redundancy and enhances feature representation capabilities, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets and validating its effectiveness in RGB-T tracking tasks.

TL;DR: PoolNet is a deep learning framework that quickly identifies which image scenes are suitable for Structure-from-Motion processing, saving time by filtering out unsuitable data before expensive SfM computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SfM processing is slow and computationally expensive, and most publicly available image data is unsuitable due to poor camera pose variation, occlusions, and noise. Current methods waste time processing scenes that ultimately fail.

Method: PoolNet is a versatile deep learning framework that performs both frame-level and scene-level validation of in-the-wild image data to determine SfM readiness.

Result: The model successfully differentiates SfM-ready scenes from unfit ones while significantly reducing the time needed compared to state-of-the-art SfM algorithms.

Conclusion: PoolNet provides an efficient pre-filtering solution for SfM pipelines, enabling faster processing by identifying suitable scenes before expensive SfM computation begins.

Abstract: Lifting Structure-from-Motion (SfM) information from sequential and non-sequential image data is a time-consuming and computationally expensive task. In addition to this, the majority of publicly available data is unfit for processing due to inadequate camera pose variation, obscuring scene elements, and noisy data. To solve this problem, we introduce PoolNet, a versatile deep learning framework for frame-level and scene-level validation of in-the-wild data. We demonstrate that our model successfully differentiates SfM ready scenes from those unfit for processing while significantly undercutting the amount of time state of the art algorithms take to obtain structure-from-motion data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShaRP is an improved attention-based pruning framework for Video LLMs that enables effective pruning at shallow decoder layers while maintaining performance under high compression rates without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLLMs face high computational load during pre-filling due to processing enormous visual tokens. Existing attention-based pruning methods suffer from significant performance degradation when applied at early decoder layers, especially under high compression rates, due to positional encoding bias and insufficient information interaction.

Method: ShaRP integrates three key components: segment-aware causal masking, positional debiasing, and token deduplication for enhanced token selection. This framework enables effective pruning at shallow layers while maintaining stable performance under high compression rates without requiring retraining.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that ShaRP achieves competitive performance across multiple video understanding benchmarks, establishing a new paradigm for accelerating VLLM inference.

Conclusion: ShaRP successfully addresses the limitations of attention-based pruning in shallow decoder layers and provides an effective solution for accelerating VLLM inference while maintaining performance under high compression rates.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) face the challenge of high computational load during the pre-filling stage due to the processing of an enormous number of visual tokens. Although attention-based pruning methods are widely used to accelerate inference, trials at early decoder layers often result in significant performance degradation, especially under high compression rates. We argue that while attention-based pruning inherently holds the potential to identify the most relevant visual tokens, its effectiveness in shallow decoder layers is limited by factors such as positional encoding bias and insufficient information interaction. In this paper, we propose an improved attention-based pruning framework, termed ShaRP, that integrates segment-aware causal masking, positional debiasing, and token deduplication for enhanced token selection. It enables effective pruning at shallow layers while maintaining stable performance under high compression rates without retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ShaRP achieves competitive performance across multiple video understanding benchmarks, establishing a new paradigm for accelerating VLLM inference.

*Qingqiao Hu,Weimin Lyu,Meilong Xu,Kehan Qi,Xiaoling Hu,Saumya Gupta,Jiawei Zhou,Chao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoC-Path is an efficient multimodal LLM for pathology that reduces computational costs by identifying and focusing on only task-relevant tiles in whole slide images, rather than processing all patches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing slide-level MLLMs for pathology use brute-force processing of thousands of patch features, resulting in excessive computational costs, while human experts focus only on key diagnostic regions. The authors observed that tile-level features exhibit strong redundancy, with only a small subset being truly task-relevant.

Method: LoC-Path replaces expensive slide-level encoders with redundancy-reducing modules: 1) Sparse Token Merger (STM) and MAE-pretrained resampler to remove local redundancy and compress globally redundant tiles, 2) Cross-Attention Routing Adapter (CARA) and Token Importance Scorer (TIS) to integrate compressed visual representations with language models efficiently.

Result: The approach achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art whole-slide MLLMs while requiring significantly lower computation and memory.

Conclusion: By focusing only on task-relevant tiles and reducing redundancy, LoC-Path provides an efficient alternative to brute-force processing of whole slide images, making pathology MLLMs more practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) understanding is fundamentally challenging due to its gigapixel scale and the extreme sparsity of diagnostically relevant regions. Unlike human experts who primarily rely on key areas to arrive at a diagnosis, existing slide-level multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for pathology rely on heavy slide-level encoders that process thousands of patch features in a brute-force manner, resulting in excessive computational cost. In this work, we revisit the WSI-language modeling paradigm and show that tile-level features exhibit strong global and local redundancy, whereas only a small subset of tiles are truly task-relevant. Motivated by this observation, we introduce an efficient MLLM framework, called LoC-Path, that replaces the expensive slide-level encoder with redundancy-reducing modules. We first design a Sparse Token Merger (STM) and an MAE-pretrained resampler to remove local redundancy and compress globally redundant tile tokens into a compact slide-level representation set. We then propose a Cross-Attention Routing Adapter (CARA) and a Token Importance Scorer (TIS) to integrate the compressed visual representation with the language model in a computation-efficient manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to existing state-of-the-art whole-slide MLLMs, while requiring significantly lower computation and memory.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A simple active learning method for 3D point cloud segmentation that uses 2D grid columns for region splitting and network ensemble uncertainty estimation, achieving state-of-the-art performance while being easy to implement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds requires expensive annotation. Active learning can reduce annotation costs, but existing methods use complex heuristics for region splitting and selection. The authors aim to develop a simpler, more effective approach.

Method: Proposes a novel active learning strategy: 1) Uses a 2D grid to subdivide point clouds into columns as annotatable regions, 2) Employs a network ensemble to estimate uncertainty for selecting which regions to annotate next, 3) Focuses on annotated area rather than number of points as the evaluation metric.

Result: Evaluated on S3DIS, Toronto-3D, and a manually labeled urban dataset of Freiburg. The method achieves performance on par with or better than complex state-of-the-art methods across all datasets. Shows that annotated area is a more meaningful measure than number of annotated points for point cloud active learning.

Conclusion: The proposed simple active learning approach effectively reduces annotation costs for 3D point cloud segmentation while matching or exceeding complex state-of-the-art methods. The work also highlights that annotated area should be prioritized over point count when evaluating active learning for point clouds.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of 3D point cloud data often comes with high annotation costs. Active learning automates the process of selecting which data to annotate, reducing the total amount of annotation needed to achieve satisfactory performance. Recent approaches to active learning for 3D point clouds are often based on sophisticated heuristics for both, splitting point clouds into annotatable regions and selecting the most beneficial for further neural network training. In this work, we propose a novel and easy-to-implement strategy to separate the point cloud into annotatable regions. In our approach, we utilize a 2D grid to subdivide the point cloud into columns. To identify the next data to be annotated, we employ a network ensemble to estimate the uncertainty in the network output. We evaluate our method on the S3DIS dataset, the Toronto-3D dataset, and a large-scale urban 3D point cloud of the city of Freiburg, which we labeled in parts manually. The extensive evaluation shows that our method yields performance on par with, or even better than, complex state-of-the-art methods on all datasets. Furthermore, we provide results suggesting that in the context of point clouds the annotated area can be a more meaningful measure for active learning algorithms than the number of annotated points.

TL;DR: SSVAE introduces spectral-structured video VAE with regularizers for better diffusion training, achieving 3x faster convergence and 10% higher video reward.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video VAEs focus on reconstruction fidelity but overlook latent structure, which strongly influences diffusion training difficulty. The structure of VAE latents is crucial for diffusion model performance.

Method: Statistical analysis of video VAE latent spaces identifies two key spectral properties: low-frequency spatio-temporal spectrum and channel-wise eigenspectrum dominated by few modes. Proposes two backbone-agnostic regularizers: Local Correlation Regularization and Latent Masked Reconstruction to induce these properties.

Result: SSVAE achieves 3x speedup in text-to-video generation convergence and 10% gain in video reward, outperforming strong open-source VAEs.

Conclusion: Optimizing latent structure through spectral properties significantly improves diffusion training efficiency and video generation quality, demonstrating the importance of latent space design beyond reconstruction fidelity.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models pair VAEs with diffusion backbones, and the structure of VAE latents strongly influences the difficulty of diffusion training. However, existing video VAEs typically focus on reconstruction fidelity, overlooking latent structure. We present a statistical analysis of video VAE latent spaces and identify two spectral properties essential for diffusion training: a spatio-temporal frequency spectrum biased toward low frequencies, and a channel-wise eigenspectrum dominated by a few modes. To induce these properties, we propose two lightweight, backbone-agnostic regularizers: Local Correlation Regularization and Latent Masked Reconstruction. Experiments show that our Spectral-Structured VAE (SSVAE) achieves a $3\times$ speedup in text-to-video generation convergence and a 10\% gain in video reward, outperforming strong open-source VAEs.

*Zhiting Mei,Tenny Yin,Micah Baker,Ola Shorinwa,Anirudha Majumdar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C3 is a novel uncertainty quantification method for controllable video models that provides dense, calibrated confidence estimates at subpatch level to identify hallucinated regions in generated videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controllable video models often hallucinate (generate physically unrealistic frames), which is problematic for applications like robot policy evaluation and planning. Current models lack confidence assessment capabilities, making hallucination mitigation difficult.

Method: Three core innovations: 1) Training framework using strictly proper scoring rules for correctness and calibration, 2) Uncertainty estimation in latent space (avoiding pixel-space instability/costs), 3) Mapping latent uncertainty to interpretable pixel-level RGB uncertainty heatmaps.

Result: Method provides calibrated uncertainty estimates within training distribution and enables effective out-of-distribution detection, demonstrated through extensive experiments on Bridge and DROID robot learning datasets with real-world evaluations.

Conclusion: C3 successfully addresses the hallucination problem in controllable video generation by providing dense, interpretable uncertainty quantification that can identify untrustworthy regions in generated videos, improving reliability for critical applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative video models have led to significant breakthroughs in high-fidelity video synthesis, specifically in controllable video generation where the generated video is conditioned on text and action inputs, e.g., in instruction-guided video editing and world modeling in robotics. Despite these exceptional capabilities, controllable video models often hallucinate - generating future video frames that are misaligned with physical reality - which raises serious concerns in many tasks such as robot policy evaluation and planning. However, state-of-the-art video models lack the ability to assess and express their confidence, impeding hallucination mitigation. To rigorously address this challenge, we propose C3, an uncertainty quantification (UQ) method for training continuous-scale calibrated controllable video models for dense confidence estimation at the subpatch level, precisely localizing the uncertainty in each generated video frame. Our UQ method introduces three core innovations to empower video models to estimate their uncertainty. First, our method develops a novel framework that trains video models for correctness and calibration via strictly proper scoring rules. Second, we estimate the video model's uncertainty in latent space, avoiding training instability and prohibitive training costs associated with pixel-space approaches. Third, we map the dense latent-space uncertainty to interpretable pixel-level uncertainty in the RGB space for intuitive visualization, providing high-resolution uncertainty heatmaps that identify untrustworthy regions. Through extensive experiments on large-scale robot learning datasets (Bridge and DROID) and real-world evaluations, we demonstrate that our method not only provides calibrated uncertainty estimates within the training distribution, but also enables effective out-of-distribution detection.

*Zhuoyuan Wu,Xurui Yang,Jiahui Huang,Yue Wang,Jun Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dynamic Prior (DP) uses Vision-Language Models and SAM2 to identify dynamic objects without task-specific training, improving camera pose estimation, depth reconstruction, and 4D trajectory estimation in videos with moving objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical structure from motion pipelines struggle with dynamic objects in videos, and existing learning-based methods are limited by the need for large-scale motion segmentation datasets, leading to inaccurate segmentation and poor 3D understanding.

Method: Dynamic Prior leverages Vision-Language Models for reasoning about object dynamics and SAM2 for fine-grained spatial segmentation to identify dynamic objects without task-specific training, then integrates this into state-of-the-art pipelines for camera pose optimization, depth reconstruction, and 4D trajectory estimation.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world videos show that Dynamic Prior achieves state-of-the-art performance on motion segmentation and significantly improves accuracy and robustness for structural 3D understanding tasks.

Conclusion: Dynamic Prior provides an effective way to handle dynamic objects in videos without requiring specialized training datasets, enabling better camera pose estimation, 3D scene reconstruction, and motion understanding in complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Estimating accurate camera poses, 3D scene geometry, and object motion from in-the-wild videos is a long-standing challenge for classical structure from motion pipelines due to the presence of dynamic objects. Recent learning-based methods attempt to overcome this challenge by training motion estimators to filter dynamic objects and focus on the static background. However, their performance is largely limited by the availability of large-scale motion segmentation datasets, resulting in inaccurate segmentation and, therefore, inferior structural 3D understanding. In this work, we introduce the Dynamic Prior (\ourmodel) to robustly identify dynamic objects without task-specific training, leveraging the powerful reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and the fine-grained spatial segmentation capacity of SAM2. \ourmodel can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art pipelines for camera pose optimization, depth reconstruction, and 4D trajectory estimation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world videos demonstrate that \ourmodel not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on motion segmentation, but also significantly improves accuracy and robustness for structural 3D understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for realistic synthetic traffic sign data that combines data-driven realism with analytical control for explainable AI and robustness testing, especially for rare/new traffic signs.

Method: Hybrid synthesis pipeline: GAN-based texture generation creates realistic dirt/wear artifacts on traffic sign surfaces, while analytical scene modulation provides physically correct lighting and detailed parameterization.

Result: Created Synset Signset Germany dataset with 105,500 images of 211 German traffic sign classes, including rare/new signs (2020), with masks, segmentation, and extensive metadata including stochastic environment/imaging parameters.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach produces realistic synthetic traffic sign data suitable for training/testing, with analytical parameterization enabling XAI applications and robustness testing through sensitivity analysis to parameter changes.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a synthesis pipeline and dataset for training / testing data in the task of traffic sign recognition that combines the advantages of data-driven and analytical modeling: GAN-based texture generation enables data-driven dirt and wear artifacts, rendering unique and realistic traffic sign surfaces, while the analytical scene modulation achieves physically correct lighting and allows detailed parameterization. In particular, the latter opens up applications in the context of explainable AI (XAI) and robustness tests due to the possibility of evaluating the sensitivity to parameter changes, which we demonstrate with experiments. Our resulting synthetic traffic sign recognition dataset Synset Signset Germany contains a total of 105500 images of 211 different German traffic sign classes, including newly published (2020) and thus comparatively rare traffic signs. In addition to a mask and a segmentation image, we also provide extensive metadata including the stochastically selected environment and imaging effect parameters for each image. We evaluate the degree of realism of Synset Signset Germany on the real-world German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) and in comparison to CATERED, a state-of-the-art synthetic traffic sign recognition dataset.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional stereo matching algorithms (SGBM+WLS) are fast for UAV applications but require meticulous manual parameter tuning, which is impractical for real-world forestry applications with varied conditions.

Method: Propose a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based parameter optimization framework that systematically searches for optimal parameter configurations for SGBM and WLS filtering, eliminating manual tuning.

Result: GA-optimized approach reduces Mean Squared Error by 42.86%, increases PSNR by 8.47% and SSIM by 28.52% compared to baseline configurations, with superior generalization across varied imaging conditions.

Conclusion: The GA-based optimization framework provides a practical solution for resource-constrained UAV systems, enabling enhanced precision in tree branch distance measurement while maintaining processing efficiency.

Abstract: Traditional stereo matching algorithms like Semi-Global Block Matching (SGBM) with Weighted Least Squares (WLS) filtering offer speed advantages over neural networks for UAV applications, generating disparity maps in approximately 0.5 seconds per frame. However, these algorithms require meticulous parameter tuning. We propose a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based parameter optimization framework that systematically searches for optimal parameter configurations for SGBM and WLS, enabling UAVs to measure distances to tree branches with enhanced precision while maintaining processing efficiency. Our contributions include: (1) a novel GA-based parameter optimization framework that eliminates manual tuning; (2) a comprehensive evaluation methodology using multiple image quality metrics; and (3) a practical solution for resource-constrained UAV systems. Experimental results demonstrate that our GA-optimized approach reduces Mean Squared Error by 42.86% while increasing Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio and Structural Similarity by 8.47% and 28.52%, respectively, compared with baseline configurations. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates superior generalization performance across varied imaging conditions, which is critcal for real-world forestry applications.

### [31] [Measuring the Effect of Background on Classification and Feature Importance in Deep Learning for AV Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05937)
*Anne Sielemann,Valentin Barner,Stefan Wolf,Masoud Roschani,Jens Ziehn,Juergen Beyerer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using synthetic datasets to systematically study how background correlations affect deep learning classifiers, specifically in traffic sign recognition, enabling quantitative analysis of when and why models rely on background features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current XAI methods for deep learning (like SHAP and GradCAM) lack quantitative testing of intuitive interpretations about whether classifiers focus on object pixels or background pixels. Real-world data has unavoidable correlations that are hard to classify as spurious or legitimate, while synthetic data often lacks realism quantification.

Method: Systematically generate six synthetic datasets for traffic sign recognition that differ only in their degree of camera variation and background correlation. This allows isolated quantification of background correlation influence, camera variation levels, and traffic sign shapes on classification performance and background feature importance.

Result: The approach enables quantification of when and how much background features gain importance to support classification tasks based on changes in the training domain. The synthetic datasets provide controlled conditions to study these effects.

Conclusion: Synthetic datasets with systematic variations offer a valuable approach to quantitatively study background feature importance in deep learning classifiers, addressing limitations of current XAI methods that lack explanation for their own outputs.

Abstract: Common approaches to explainable AI (XAI) for deep learning focus on analyzing the importance of input features on the classification task in a given model: saliency methods like SHAP and GradCAM are used to measure the impact of spatial regions of the input image on the classification result. Combined with ground truth information about the location of the object in the input image (e.g., a binary mask), it is determined whether object pixels had a high impact on the classification result, or whether the classification focused on background pixels. The former is considered to be a sign of a healthy classifier, whereas the latter is assumed to suggest overfitting on spurious correlations. A major challenge, however, is that these intuitive interpretations are difficult to test quantitatively, and hence the output of such explanations lacks an explanation itself. One particular reason is that correlations in real-world data are difficult to avoid, and whether they are spurious or legitimate is debatable. Synthetic data in turn can facilitate to actively enable or disable correlations where desired but often lack a sufficient quantification of realism and stochastic properties. [...] Therefore, we systematically generate six synthetic datasets for the task of traffic sign recognition, which differ only in their degree of camera variation and background correlation [...] to quantify the isolated influence of background correlation, different levels of camera variation, and considered traffic sign shapes on the classification performance, as well as background feature importance. [...] Results include a quantification of when and how much background features gain importance to support the classification task based on changes in the training domain [...].

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current moving object detection in solar system surveys relies heavily on manual verification by human eyes, which is labor-intensive and costly. There's a need to reduce reliance on human intervention and automate the verification process.

Method: Proposes a multi-input convolutional neural network integrated with a convolutional block attention module. The architecture processes multiple stacked images simultaneously and uses attention mechanisms to focus on essential features in both spatial and channel dimensions.

Result: Achieved nearly 99% accuracy with AUC >0.99 on a dataset of approximately 2,000 observational images. By adjusting detection thresholds, the model reduces human workload by more than 99% compared to manual verification.

Conclusion: The proposed model demonstrates excellent classification performance for moving object detection in solar system surveys, significantly reducing the need for manual verification while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: One of the greatest challenges for detecting moving objects in the solar system from wide-field survey data is determining whether a signal indicates a true object or is due to some other source, like noise. Object verification has relied heavily on human eyes, which usually results in significant labor costs. In order to address this limitation and reduce the reliance on manual intervention, we propose a multi-input convolutional neural network integrated with a convolutional block attention module. This method is specifically tailored to enhance the moving object detection system that we have developed and used previously. The current method introduces two innovations. This first one is a multi-input architecture that processes multiple stacked images simultaneously. The second is the incorporation of the convolutional block attention module which enables the model to focus on essential features in both spatial and channel dimensions. These advancements facilitate efficient learning from multiple inputs, leading to more robust detection of moving objects. The performance of the model is evaluated on a dataset consisting of approximately 2,000 observational images. We achieved an accuracy of nearly 99% with AUC (an Area Under the Curve) of >0.99. These metrics indicate that the proposed model achieves excellent classification performance. By adjusting the threshold for object detection, the new model reduces the human workload by more than 99% compared to manual verification.

*Jiangtong Tan,Lin Liu,Jie Huanng,Xiaopeng Zhang,Qi Tian,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ParaUni is a unified multimodal model that extracts parallel features from different VLM layers for comprehensive information interaction while maintaining flexible architecture, enhancing visual generation quality and enabling multiple reward improvements through RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unified multimodal models struggle to balance sufficient interaction and flexible implementation due to vast representation differences between vision-language models and diffusion models. VLM layers contain abundant hierarchical information from low-level details to high-level semantics that isn't fully utilized.

Method: ParaUni extracts features from all VLM layers in parallel and feeds them into a Layer Integration Module (LIM) that efficiently integrates fine-grained details and semantic abstractions. It also introduces a Layer-wise Dynamic Adjustment Mechanism (LDAM) that uses RL to align hierarchical layer properties with multiple rewards.

Result: Extensive experiments show ParaUni leverages complementary multi-layer features to substantially improve generation quality and demonstrates strong potential for multiple reward advances during RL stages.

Conclusion: ParaUni successfully addresses the balance between interaction and flexibility in unified multimodal models by parallel feature extraction from VLM layers and RL-based layer adjustment, leading to improved visual generation quality and reward optimization.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models significantly improve visual generation by combining vision-language models (VLMs) with diffusion models. However, existing methods struggle to fully balance sufficient interaction and flexible implementation due to vast representation difference. Considering abundant and hierarchical information in VLM's layers from low-level details to high-level semantics, we propose \textbf{ParaUni}. It extracts features from variants VLM's layers in a \textbf{Para}llel way for comprehensive information interaction and retains a flexible separation architecture to enhance generation in \textbf{Uni}fied multimodal model. Concretely, visual features from all VLM's layers are fed in parallel into a Layer Integration Module (LIM), which efficiently integrates fine-grained details and semantic abstractions and provides the fused representation as a condition to the diffusion model. To further enhance performance, we reveal that these hierarchical layers respond unequally to different rewards in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Crucially, we design a Layer-wise Dynamic Adjustment Mechanism (LDAM) to facilitate multiple reward improvements that aligns the hierarchical properties of these layers using RL. Extensive experiments show ParaUni leverages complementary multi-layer features to substantially improve generation quality and shows strong potential for multiple reward advances during RL stages.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TED-4DGS: A temporally activated embedding-based deformation scheme for rate-distortion-optimized compression of dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dynamic 3DGS methods have limitations: space-time 4DGS uses overspecified short-lived Gaussians, while canonical 3DGS with deformation lacks explicit temporal control. There's a need for more compact, efficient deformation schemes with rate-distortion-optimized compression for dynamic 3DGS.

Method: TED-4DGS uses sparse anchor-based 3DGS with learnable temporal-activation parameters for appearance/disappearance transitions. Lightweight per-anchor temporal embeddings query a shared deformation bank. For compression, uses INR-based hyperprior for anchor attribute distributions and channel-wise autoregressive model for intra-anchor correlations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance on several real-world datasets. Represents one of the first attempts at rate-distortion-optimized compression for dynamic 3DGS representations.

Conclusion: TED-4DGS successfully unifies strengths of both space-time and canonical approaches, providing an efficient deformation scheme with explicit temporal control and optimized compression for dynamic 3DGS.

Abstract: Building on the success of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in static 3D scene representation, its extension to dynamic scenes, commonly referred to as 4DGS or dynamic 3DGS, has attracted increasing attention. However, designing more compact and efficient deformation schemes together with rate-distortion-optimized compression strategies for dynamic 3DGS representations remains an underexplored area. Prior methods either rely on space-time 4DGS with overspecified, short-lived Gaussian primitives or on canonical 3DGS with deformation that lacks explicit temporal control. To address this, we present TED-4DGS, a temporally activated and embedding-based deformation scheme for rate-distortion-optimized 4DGS compression that unifies the strengths of both families. TED-4DGS is built on a sparse anchor-based 3DGS representation. Each canonical anchor is assigned learnable temporal-activation parameters to specify its appearance and disappearance transitions over time, while a lightweight per-anchor temporal embedding queries a shared deformation bank to produce anchor-specific deformation. For rate-distortion compression, we incorporate an implicit neural representation (INR)-based hyperprior to model anchor attribute distributions, along with a channel-wise autoregressive model to capture intra-anchor correlations. With these novel elements, our scheme achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance on several real-world datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents one of the first attempts to pursue a rate-distortion-optimized compression framework for dynamic 3DGS representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image stylization methods focus on visual appearance but overlook emotional impact. The authors aim to bridge this gap by creating stylization that evokes specific emotions while maintaining content integrity.

Method: 1) Construct EmoStyleSet dataset from ArtEmis; 2) Develop Emotion-Content Reasoner to integrate emotional cues with content for style queries; 3) Create Style Quantizer to convert continuous features into emotion-related codebook entries.

Result: EmoStyle enhances emotional expressiveness while maintaining content consistency, as shown through qualitative/quantitative evaluations and user studies. The learned emotion-aware style dictionary is adaptable to other generative tasks.

Conclusion: The work establishes a foundation for emotion-driven image stylization, expanding AI-generated art's creative potential by addressing the gap between visual style and emotional impact.

Abstract: Art has long been a profound medium for expressing emotions. While existing image stylization methods effectively transform visual appearance, they often overlook the emotional impact carried by styles. To bridge this gap, we introduce Affective Image Stylization (AIS), a task that applies artistic styles to evoke specific emotions while preserving content. We present EmoStyle, a framework designed to address key challenges in AIS, including the lack of training data and the emotion-style mapping. First, we construct EmoStyleSet, a content-emotion-stylized image triplet dataset derived from ArtEmis to support AIS. We then propose an Emotion-Content Reasoner that adaptively integrates emotional cues with content to learn coherent style queries. Given the discrete nature of artistic styles, we further develop a Style Quantizer that converts continuous style features into emotion-related codebook entries. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, including user studies, demonstrate that EmoStyle enhances emotional expressiveness while maintaining content consistency. Moreover, the learned emotion-aware style dictionary is adaptable to other generative tasks, highlighting its potential for broader applications. Our work establishes a foundation for emotion-driven image stylization, expanding the creative potential of AI-generated art.

TL;DR: UniFS is a unified frequency-spatial fusion model for multi-contrast MR reconstruction that handles multiple k-space undersampling patterns without retraining, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MCMR methods struggle with generalization across different k-space undersampling patterns (requiring separate models for each pattern) and often neglect deep frequency information, limiting practical applicability and performance.

Method: UniFS integrates three key modules: Cross-Modal Frequency Fusion module, Adaptive Mask-Based Prompt Learning module, and Dual-Branch Complementary Refinement module, with adaptive prompt-guided frequency fusion for k-space learning to extract domain-invariant features.

Result: Experimental results on BraTS and HCP datasets with various k-space undersampling patterns and acceleration factors (including unseen patterns) demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: UniFS successfully addresses generalization challenges in MCMR by handling multiple k-space undersampling patterns without retraining while effectively leveraging complementary cross-modal frequency information, making it more practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Recently, Multi-Contrast MR Reconstruction (MCMR) has emerged as a hot research topic that leverages high-quality auxiliary modalities to reconstruct undersampled target modalities of interest. However, existing methods often struggle to generalize across different k-space undersampling patterns, requiring the training of a separate model for each specific pattern, which limits their practical applicability. To address this challenge, we propose UniFS, a Unified Frequency-Spatial Fusion model designed to handle multiple k-space undersampling patterns for MCMR tasks without any need for retraining. UniFS integrates three key modules: a Cross-Modal Frequency Fusion module, an Adaptive Mask-Based Prompt Learning module, and a Dual-Branch Complementary Refinement module. These modules work together to extract domain-invariant features from diverse k-space undersampling patterns while dynamically adapt to their own variations. Another limitation of existing MCMR methods is their tendency to focus solely on spatial information while neglect frequency characteristics, or extract only shallow frequency features, thus failing to fully leverage complementary cross-modal frequency information. To relieve this issue, UniFS introduces an adaptive prompt-guided frequency fusion module for k-space learning, significantly enhancing the model's generalization performance. We evaluate our model on the BraTS and HCP datasets with various k-space undersampling patterns and acceleration factors, including previously unseen patterns, to comprehensively assess UniFS's generalizability. Experimental results across multiple scenarios demonstrate that UniFS achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/LIKP0/UniFS.

TL;DR: DepSeg is a training-free surgical scene segmentation framework that uses monocular depth as geometric prior with vision foundation models, achieving 35.9% mIoU on CholecSeg8k.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-wise segmentation of laparoscopic scenes is essential for computer-assisted surgery but difficult to scale due to the high cost of dense annotations.

Method: Uses depth-guided prompting: estimates relative depth maps, generates depth-guided point prompts that SAM2 converts to masks, then classifies masks via template matching with pretrained visual features against a template bank from annotated frames.

Result: Improves over SAM2 auto segmentation baseline (35.9% vs. 14.7% mIoU on CholecSeg8k) and maintains competitive performance with only 10-20% of object templates.

Conclusion: Depth-guided prompting and template-based classification offer an annotation-efficient segmentation approach for surgical scenes.

Abstract: Pixel-wise segmentation of laparoscopic scenes is essential for computer-assisted surgery but difficult to scale due to the high cost of dense annotations. We propose depth-guided surgical scene segmentation (DepSeg), a training-free framework that utilizes monocular depth as a geometric prior together with pretrained vision foundation models. DepSeg first estimates a relative depth map with a pretrained monocular depth estimation network and proposes depth-guided point prompts, which SAM2 converts into class-agnostic masks. Each mask is then described by a pooled pretrained visual feature and classified via template matching against a template bank built from annotated frames. On the CholecSeg8k dataset, DepSeg improves over a direct SAM2 auto segmentation baseline (35.9% vs. 14.7% mIoU) and maintains competitive performance even when using only 10--20% of the object templates. These results show that depth-guided prompting and template-based classification offer an annotation-efficient segmentation approach.

Abstract: Rare-object detection remains a challenging task in autonomous driving systems, particularly when relying solely on point cloud data. Although Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong capabilities in image understanding, their potential to enhance 3D object detection through intelligent data mining has not been fully explored. This paper proposes a novel cross-modal framework that leverages 2D VLMs to identify and mine rare objects from driving scenes, thereby improving 3D object detection performance. Our approach synthesizes complementary techniques such as object detection, semantic feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and multi-faceted outlier detection into a cohesive, explainable pipeline that systematically identifies rare but critical objects in driving scenes. By combining Isolation Forest and t-SNE-based outlier detection methods with concept-based filtering, the framework effectively identifies semantically meaningful rare objects. A key strength of this approach lies in its ability to extract and annotate targeted rare object concepts such as construction vehicles, motorcycles, and barriers. This substantially reduces the annotation burden and focuses only on the most valuable training samples. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that this concept-guided data mining strategy enhances the performance of 3D object detection models while utilizing only a fraction of the training data, with particularly notable improvements for challenging object categories such as trailers and bicycles compared with the same amount of random data. This finding has substantial implications for the efficient curation of datasets in safety-critical autonomous systems.

*Weijue Bu,Guan Yuan,Guixian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CG-VLM is a training-free framework that uses game-theoretic interpretability to detect when VLMs drift from visual evidence to text priors, then selectively reorients attention to visual tokens to reduce hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs suffer from text inertia where attention drifts from visual evidence to linguistic priors, causing object hallucinations. Existing methods either intervene too late (at output logits) or use unprincipled internal control methods.

Method: Uses a Cognitive Demand Sensor based on Harsanyi interactions to estimate vision-text synergy and detect when visual grounding is needed. Then applies Focused Consensus Induction to selectively reorient mid-layer attention toward visual tokens before collapse into text priors.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on POPE and CHAIR benchmarks across multiple VLMs (InstructBLIP, LLaVA, Qwen-VL, mPLUG) while preserving general capabilities.

Conclusion: Token-level sensing enables precise, context-aware intervention to reduce hallucinations without compromising foundational knowledge, demonstrating that game-theoretic interpretability can be converted into actionable decoding control.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often exhibit text inertia, where attention drifts from visual evidence toward linguistic priors, resulting in object hallucinations. Existing decoding strategies intervene only at the output logits and thus cannot correct internal reasoning drift, while recent internal-control methods based on heuristic head suppression or global steering vectors lack principled grounding. We introduce Conscious Gaze (CG-VLM), a training-free, inference-time framework that converts game-theoretic interpretability into actionable decoding control. A Cognitive Demand Sensor built on Harsanyi interactions estimates instantaneous vision-text synergy and identifies moments when visual grounding is necessary. Conditioned on this signal, a Focused Consensus Induction module selectively reorients mid-layer attention toward visual tokens before collapse into text priors. CG-VLM achieves state-of-the-art results on POPE and CHAIR across InstructBLIP, LLaVA, Qwen-VL, and mPLUG, while preserving general capabilities, demonstrating that token-level sensing enables precise, context-aware intervention without compromising foundational knowledge.

*Qi Zhu,Jingyi Zhang,Naishan Zheng,Wei Yu,Jinghao Zhang,Deyi Ji,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaterWave: A temporal consistency field method using wavelet-based implicit representation to enhance underwater videos by filtering inconsistent components while preserving motion details, without requiring paired training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing underwater video enhancement methods lack temporal consistency when applying single-image models frame by frame, and obtaining paired underwater video data is difficult due to complex underwater imaging conditions.

Method: Proposes WaterWave, an implicit representation method in wavelet-based temporal consistency field that filters inconsistent components while preserving motion details. Uses temporal consistency prior from local temporal frequency perspective and includes an underwater flow correction module to rectify estimated flows considering underwater transmission effects.

Result: Significantly enhances quality of videos generated using single-image underwater enhancements. Demonstrates high potential in downstream tracking tasks (UOSTrack and MAT), outperforming original video by 19.7% and 9.7% on precision respectively.

Conclusion: WaterWave effectively addresses temporal consistency issues in underwater video enhancement without requiring paired data, improving both visual quality and performance in downstream applications like underwater tracking.

Abstract: Underwater video pairs are fairly difficult to obtain due to the complex underwater imaging. In this case, most existing video underwater enhancement methods are performed by directly applying the single-image enhancement model frame by frame, but a natural issue is lacking temporal consistency. To relieve the problem, we rethink the temporal manifold inherent in natural videos and observe a temporal consistency prior in dynamic scenes from the local temporal frequency perspective. Building upon the specific prior and no paired-data condition, we propose an implicit representation manner for enhanced video signals, which is conducted in the wavelet-based temporal consistency field, WaterWave. Specifically, under the constraints of the prior, we progressively filter and attenuate the inconsistent components while preserving motion details and scenes, achieving a natural-flowing video. Furthermore, to represent temporal frequency bands more accurately, an underwater flow correction module is designed to rectify estimated flows considering the transmission in underwater scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WaterWave significantly enhances the quality of videos generated using single-image underwater enhancements. Additionally, our method demonstrates high potential in downstream underwater tracking tasks, such as UOSTrack and MAT, outperforming the original video by a large margin, i.e., 19.7% and 9.7% on precise respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 2K-Characters-10K-Stories, a stylized narrative dataset with 2,000 unique characters across 10,000 stories, providing decoupled control for sequential identity consistency in visual storytelling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack sufficient fidelity and fail to disentangle stable identities from transient attributes (pose, expression, scene composition), limiting structured control and reliable sequential synthesis in visual storytelling.

Method: Human-in-the-Loop pipeline (HiL) with expert-verified character templates and LLM-guided narrative planning; decoupled control scheme separating persistent identity from transient attributes; Quality-Gated loop integrating MMLM evaluation, Auto-Prompt Tuning, and Local Image Editing for pixel-level consistency.

Result: Models fine-tuned on the 2K-Characters-10K-Stories dataset achieve performance comparable to closed-source models in generating visual narratives, demonstrating the effectiveness of the dataset and approach.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and pipeline successfully address the challenge of sequential identity consistency with precise transient attribute control, enabling reliable visual narrative generation through structured, decoupled control signals.

Abstract: Sequential identity consistency under precise transient attribute control remains a long-standing challenge in controllable visual storytelling. Existing datasets lack sufficient fidelity and fail to disentangle stable identities from transient attributes, limiting structured control over pose, expression, and scene composition and thus constraining reliable sequential synthesis. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{2K-Characters-10K-Stories}, a multi-modal stylized narrative dataset of \textbf{2{,}000} uniquely stylized characters appearing across \textbf{10{,}000} illustration stories. It is the first dataset that pairs large-scale unique identities with explicit, decoupled control signals for sequential identity consistency. We introduce a \textbf{Human-in-the-Loop pipeline (HiL)} that leverages expert-verified character templates and LLM-guided narrative planning to generate highly-aligned structured data. A \textbf{decoupled control} scheme separates persistent identity from transient attributes -- pose and expression -- while a \textbf{Quality-Gated loop} integrating MMLM evaluation, Auto-Prompt Tuning, and Local Image Editing enforces pixel-level consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models fine-tuned on our dataset achieves performance comparable to closed-source models in generating visual narratives.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel decoder framework for medical image segmentation with three modules: ACFA for adaptive cross-fusion attention with learnable guidance, TFFA for triple feature fusion across spatial, Fourier and wavelet domains, and SMMM for structural-aware multi-scale masking to optimize skip connections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of Transformer decoders in capturing edge details, recognizing local textures, and modeling spatial continuity in medical image segmentation tasks.

Method: Proposes a three-module decoder framework: 1) Adaptive Cross-Fusion Attention (ACFA) with channel enhancement and spatial attention with learnable planar/horizontal/vertical guidance; 2) Triple Feature Fusion Attention (TFFA) combining spatial, Fourier and wavelet domain features; 3) Structural-aware Multi-scale Masking Module (SMMM) for optimizing encoder-decoder skip connections.

Result: The framework addresses traditional decoder shortcomings and significantly enhances performance in high-precision medical segmentation tasks like tumor segmentation and organ boundary extraction, improving both segmentation accuracy and model generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an efficient and practical solution for medical image segmentation by synergistically combining three novel modules that enhance edge detail capture, local texture recognition, and spatial continuity modeling.

Abstract: To address the limitations of Transformer decoders in capturing edge details, recognizing local textures and modeling spatial continuity, this paper proposes a novel decoder framework specifically designed for medical image segmentation, comprising three core modules. First, the Adaptive Cross-Fusion Attention (ACFA) module integrates channel feature enhancement with spatial attention mechanisms and introduces learnable guidance in three directions (planar, horizontal, and vertical) to enhance responsiveness to key regions and structural orientations. Second, the Triple Feature Fusion Attention (TFFA) module fuses features from Spatial, Fourier and Wavelet domains, achieving joint frequency-spatial representation that strengthens global dependency and structural modeling while preserving local information such as edges and textures, making it particularly effective in complex and blurred boundary scenarios. Finally, the Structural-aware Multi-scale Masking Module (SMMM) optimizes the skip connections between encoder and decoder by leveraging multi-scale context and structural saliency filtering, effectively reducing feature redundancy and improving semantic interaction quality. Working synergistically, these modules not only address the shortcomings of traditional decoders but also significantly enhance performance in high-precision tasks such as tumor segmentation and organ boundary extraction, improving both segmentation accuracy and model generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that this framework provides an efficient and practical solution for medical image segmentation.

TL;DR: FDEP framework adapts frozen visual foundation models for infrared small target detection using semantic alignment and implicit distillation, achieving SOTA with no inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large visual foundation models have strong generalization but haven't been explored for single-frame infrared small target detection, which is an important but underexplored application area.

Method: Proposes FDEP framework with: 1) Semantic Alignment Modulation Fusion (SAMF) module for dynamic alignment of VFM priors with task features, 2) Collaborative Optimization-based Implicit Self-Distillation (CO-ISD) for implicit semantic transfer without inference overhead, and 3) Holistic SIRST Evaluation (HSE) metric for unified evaluation.

Result: Extensive experiments show SIRST detection networks equipped with FDEP achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple public datasets without additional inference overhead.

Conclusion: FDEP successfully bridges visual foundation models with infrared small target detection, providing an efficient paradigm that improves accuracy while maintaining inference efficiency, with a new comprehensive evaluation metric for fair comparison.

Abstract: While large-scale visual foundation models (VFMs) exhibit strong generalization across diverse visual domains, their potential for single-frame infrared small target (SIRST) detection remains largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we systematically introduce the frozen representations from VFMs into the SIRST task for the first time and propose a Foundation-Driven Efficient Paradigm (FDEP), which can seamlessly adapt to existing encoder-decoder-based methods and significantly improve accuracy without additional inference overhead. Specifically, a Semantic Alignment Modulation Fusion (SAMF) module is designed to achieve dynamic alignment and deep fusion of the global semantic priors from VFMs with task-specific features. Meanwhile, to avoid the inference time burden introduced by VFMs, we propose a Collaborative Optimization-based Implicit Self-Distillation (CO-ISD) strategy, which enables implicit semantic transfer between the main and lightweight branches through parameter sharing and synchronized backpropagation. In addition, to unify the fragmented evaluation system, we construct a Holistic SIRST Evaluation (HSE) metric that performs multi-threshold integral evaluation at both pixel-level confidence and target-level robustness, providing a stable and comprehensive basis for fair model comparison. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the SIRST detection networks equipped with our FDEP framework achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple public datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to controllable 4D video generation require expensive fine-tuning of pre-trained Video Diffusion Models, which is computationally expensive, needs large datasets, causes architectural modifications, and suffers from catastrophic forgetting of original generative priors.

Method: Proposes InverseCrafter, an inpainting inverse solver that encodes pixel space degradation operators into continuous, multi-channel latent masks, bypassing the need for repeated VAE operations and backpropagation by solving the 4D generation task as an inpainting problem in latent space.

Result: Achieves comparable novel view generation and superior measurement consistency in camera control tasks with near-zero computational overhead, while also excelling at general-purpose video inpainting with editing capabilities.

Conclusion: InverseCrafter provides an efficient alternative to fine-tuning-based approaches for 4D video generation, maintaining generative priors while enabling controllable generation and editing with minimal computational cost.

Abstract: Recent approaches to controllable 4D video generation often rely on fine-tuning pre-trained Video Diffusion Models (VDMs). This dominant paradigm is computationally expensive, requiring large-scale datasets and architectural modifications, and frequently suffers from catastrophic forgetting of the model's original generative priors. Here, we propose InverseCrafter, an efficient inpainting inverse solver that reformulates the 4D generation task as an inpainting problem solved in the latent space. The core of our method is a principled mechanism to encode the pixel space degradation operator into a continuous, multi-channel latent mask, thereby bypassing the costly bottleneck of repeated VAE operations and backpropagation. InverseCrafter not only achieves comparable novel view generation and superior measurement consistency in camera control tasks with near-zero computational overhead, but also excels at general-purpose video inpainting with editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Know-Show is a new benchmark for evaluating spatio-temporal grounded reasoning in Video-LMs, revealing significant gaps between current models and human reasoning, with GRAM proposed as a training-free plug-in to improve grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video-LMs show impressive multimodal understanding but lack proper grounding in space and time - they can't effectively "show what they know" by connecting reasoning to specific visual and temporal evidence.

Method: Created Know-Show benchmark with 2.5K human-authored questions across five spatial and temporal scenarios from Charades, Action Genome, and Ego4D datasets. Proposed GRAM - a training-free plug-in using attention-based video token selection and explicit timestamp encoding.

Result: Existing Video-LMs (Qwen, VideoLLaVA, GPT-4o, Gemini) struggle with spatio-temporal grounding, especially in fine-grained hand-object interactions. GRAM improves grounding without additional training.

Conclusion: Know-Show establishes a unified standard for assessing grounded reasoning in video-language understanding and provides insights for developing more interpretable and reliable multimodal reasoning systems.

Abstract: Large Video-Language Models (Video-LMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal understanding, yet their reasoning remains weakly grounded in space and time. We present Know-Show, a new benchmark designed to evaluate spatio-temporal grounded reasoning, the ability of a model to reason about actions and their semantics while simultaneously grounding its inferences in visual and temporal evidence. Know-Show unifies reasoning and localization within a single evaluation framework consisting of five complementary scenarios across spatial (person, object, person-object, and hand-object) and temporal dimensions. Built from Charades, Action Genome, and Ego4D with 2.5K human-authored questions, the benchmark exposes significant gaps between current Video-LMs and human reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose GRAM, a training-free plug-in that augments Video-LMs with fine-grained grounding through attention-based video token selection and explicit timestamp encoding. Extensive experiments across open and closed Video-LMs (Qwen, VideoLLaVA, GPT-4o, and Gemini, etc.) reveal that existing models struggle to "show what they know" and vice versa, especially in fine-grained hand-object interactions. Know-Show establishes a unified standard for assessing grounded reasoning in video-language understanding and provides insights toward developing interpretable and reliable multimodal reasoning systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DashFusion: A novel multimodal sentiment analysis framework with dual-stream alignment (temporal & semantic) and hierarchical bottleneck fusion that achieves SOTA performance while balancing computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MSA methods struggle with alignment (temporal and semantic synchronization across modalities) and fusion (integrating aligned features) issues, often addressing them in isolation, leading to performance and efficiency limitations.

Method: Dual-stream alignment module with temporal alignment (cross-modal attention for frame-level correspondences) and semantic alignment (contrastive learning for feature space consistency), plus supervised contrastive learning for feature refinement, and hierarchical bottleneck fusion using compressed bottleneck tokens for progressive multimodal integration.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS datasets across various metrics, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of the alignment and fusion techniques.

Conclusion: DashFusion effectively addresses alignment and fusion challenges in multimodal sentiment analysis through its dual-stream alignment and hierarchical bottleneck fusion approach, achieving superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) integrates various modalities, such as text, image, and audio, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of sentiment. However, effective MSA is challenged by alignment and fusion issues. Alignment requires synchronizing both temporal and semantic information across modalities, while fusion involves integrating these aligned features into a unified representation. Existing methods often address alignment or fusion in isolation, leading to limitations in performance and efficiency. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel framework called Dual-stream Alignment with Hierarchical Bottleneck Fusion (DashFusion). Firstly, dual-stream alignment module synchronizes multimodal features through temporal and semantic alignment. Temporal alignment employs cross-modal attention to establish frame-level correspondences among multimodal sequences. Semantic alignment ensures consistency across the feature space through contrastive learning. Secondly, supervised contrastive learning leverages label information to refine the modality features. Finally, hierarchical bottleneck fusion progressively integrates multimodal information through compressed bottleneck tokens, which achieves a balance between performance and computational efficiency. We evaluate DashFusion on three datasets: CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS. Experimental results demonstrate that DashFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our alignment and fusion techniques. The codes for our experiments are available at https://github.com/ultramarineX/DashFusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VOST-SGG: A VLM-aided one-stage spatio-temporal scene graph generation framework that integrates vision-language models to address limitations in current DETR-style approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Action Genome dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DETR-style single-stage ST-SGG models have two key limitations: (1) learnable queries are semantically uninformed and instance-agnostically initialized, and (2) they rely exclusively on unimodal visual features for predicate classification, lacking semantic reasoning capabilities.

Method: Proposes VOST-SGG with two main innovations: (1) dual-source query initialization strategy that disentangles "what to attend to" from "where to attend" for semantically grounded reasoning, and (2) multi-modal feature bank that fuses visual, textual, and spatial cues derived from VLMs for improved predicate classification.

Result: Extensive experiments on Action Genome dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of integrating VLM-aided semantic priors and multi-modal features for ST-SGG.

Conclusion: Integrating vision-language models' common sense reasoning capabilities into ST-SGG pipelines through semantically informed query initialization and multi-modal feature fusion significantly improves performance and addresses key limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal scene graph generation (ST-SGG) aims to model objects and their evolving relationships across video frames, enabling interpretable representations for downstream reasoning tasks such as video captioning and visual question answering. Despite recent advancements in DETR-style single-stage ST-SGG models, they still suffer from several key limitations. First, while these models rely on attention-based learnable queries as a core component, these learnable queries are semantically uninformed and instance-agnostically initialized. Second, these models rely exclusively on unimodal visual features for predicate classification. To address these challenges, we propose VOST-SGG, a VLM-aided one-stage ST-SGG framework that integrates the common sense reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) into the ST-SGG pipeline. First, we introduce the dual-source query initialization strategy that disentangles what to attend to from where to attend, enabling semantically grounded what-where reasoning. Furthermore, we propose a multi-modal feature bank that fuses visual, textual, and spatial cues derived from VLMs for improved predicate classification. Extensive experiments on the Action Genome dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of integrating VLM-aided semantic priors and multi-modal features for ST-SGG.

TL;DR: AVP is an active video perception framework that uses MLLM agents to iteratively plan, observe, and reflect on video content, achieving state-of-the-art performance on LVU benchmarks while being highly efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video understanding methods use query-agnostic captioners that waste computation on irrelevant content and lose fine-grained details. Inspired by active perception theory, the authors argue that LVU agents should actively decide what, when, and where to observe, similar to how humans process long videos.

Method: AVP treats videos as interactive environments and uses an iterative plan-observe-reflect process with MLLM agents. The planner proposes targeted video interactions, the observer executes them to extract time-stamped evidence, and the reflector evaluates sufficiency, either halting with an answer or triggering further observation.

Result: AVP achieves highest performance across five LVU benchmarks, outperforming the best agentic method by 5.7% in average accuracy while requiring only 18.4% inference time and 12.4% input tokens.

Conclusion: The active perception approach enables efficient and accurate long video understanding by focusing computational resources on query-relevant evidence, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods while being highly efficient.

Abstract: Long video understanding (LVU) is challenging because answering real-world queries often depends on sparse, temporally dispersed cues buried in hours of mostly redundant and irrelevant content. While agentic pipelines improve video reasoning capabilities, prevailing frameworks rely on a query-agnostic captioner to perceive video information, which wastes computation on irrelevant content and blurs fine-grained temporal and spatial information. Motivated by active perception theory, we argue that LVU agents should actively decide what, when, and where to observe, and continuously assess whether the current observation is sufficient to answer the query. We present Active Video Perception (AVP), an evidence-seeking framework that treats the video as an interactive environment and acquires compact, queryrelevant evidence directly from pixels. Concretely, AVP runs an iterative plan-observe-reflect process with MLLM agents. In each round, a planner proposes targeted video interactions, an observer executes them to extract time-stamped evidence, and a reflector evaluates the sufficiency of the evidence for the query, either halting with an answer or triggering further observation. Across five LVU benchmarks, AVP achieves highest performance with significant improvements. Notably, AVP outperforms the best agentic method by 5.7% in average accuracy while only requires 18.4% inference time and 12.4% input tokens.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bayesian ideal observer framework for image segmentation using dead leaves models to study occlusion and provide performance upper bounds for human/algorithm comparison.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how human visual systems handle occlusion in scenes with overlapping objects, and to establish a principled benchmark for segmentation performance.

Method: Develops a Bayesian ideal observer based on dead leaves models (generative models with object position, shape, color, texture distributions) to compute posterior probabilities for pixel partitions.

Result: Provides theoretical framework with step-by-step explanations for computing posterior probabilities and identifies factors affecting practical application feasibility.

Conclusion: Dead leaves model ideal observer offers principled performance upper bound for segmentation in limited pixel scenarios, enabling comparison of humans and vision algorithms.

Abstract: The human visual environment is comprised of different surfaces that are distributed in space. The parts of a scene that are visible at any one time are governed by the occlusion of overlapping objects. In this work we consider "dead leaves" models, which replicate these occlusions when generating images by layering objects on top of each other. A dead leaves model is a generative model comprised of distributions for object position, shape, color and texture. An image is generated from a dead leaves model by sampling objects ("leaves") from these distributions until a stopping criterion is reached, usually when the image is fully covered or until a given number of leaves was sampled. Here, we describe a theoretical approach, based on previous work, to derive a Bayesian ideal observer for the partition of a given set of pixels based on independent dead leaves model distributions. Extending previous work, we provide step-by-step explanations for the computation of the posterior probability as well as describe factors that determine the feasibility of practically applying this computation. The dead leaves image model and the associated ideal observer can be applied to study segmentation decisions in a limited number of pixels, providing a principled upper-bound on performance, to which humans and vision algorithms could be compared.

*Saurav Jha,M. Jehanzeb Mirza,Wei Lin,Shiqi Yang,Sarath Chandar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViSA framework improves spatial reasoning by grounding test-time verification in spatial assertions, but world models remain a bottleneck for fine-grained reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models struggle with spatial reasoning requiring multi-view understanding and perspective shifts. Current test-time verification approaches like MindJourney have systematic biases and unreliable reward signals.

Method: Introduces Verification through Spatial Assertions (ViSA) framework that grounds test-time rewards in verifiable, frame-anchored micro-claims to correct trajectory-selection biases and improve spatial reasoning.

Result: ViSA consistently improves spatial reasoning on SAT-Real benchmark and corrects biases through more balanced exploratory behavior. However, on MMSI-Bench, no verifiers achieve consistent scaling due to world model limitations.

Conclusion: Test-time verification shows promise but current world models form an information bottleneck where imagined views fail to enrich fine-grained reasoning, revealing the "bad, good, and ugly" aspects of this approach.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain limited in spatial reasoning tasks that require multi-view understanding and embodied perspective shifts. Recent approaches such as MindJourney attempt to mitigate this gap through test-time scaling where a world model imagines action-conditioned trajectories and a heuristic verifier selects helpful views from such trajectories. In this work, we systematically examine how such test-time verifiers behave across benchmarks, uncovering both their promise and their pitfalls. Our uncertainty-based analyses show that MindJourney's verifier provides little meaningful calibration, and that random scoring often reduces answer entropy equally well, thus exposing systematic action biases and unreliable reward signals. To mitigate these, we introduce a Verification through Spatial Assertions (ViSA) framework that grounds the test-time reward in verifiable, frame-anchored micro-claims. This principled verifier consistently improves spatial reasoning on the SAT-Real benchmark and corrects trajectory-selection biases through more balanced exploratory behavior. However, on the challenging MMSI-Bench, none of the verifiers, including ours, achieve consistent scaling, suggesting that the current world models form an information bottleneck where imagined views fail to enrich fine-grained reasoning. Together, these findings chart the bad, good, and ugly aspects of test-time verification for world-model-based reasoning.

TL;DR: ProPhy is a Progressive Physical Alignment Framework that improves video generation by explicitly modeling physics through a two-stage Mixture-of-Physics-Experts mechanism and physical alignment with vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models struggle with physical consistency, especially for large-scale or complex dynamics, due to isotropic response to physical prompts and poor alignment between generated content and localized physical cues.

Method: Two-stage Mixture-of-Physics-Experts (MoPE): Semantic Experts infer semantic-level physical principles from text, and Refinement Experts capture token-level physical dynamics. Physical alignment strategy transfers physical reasoning from vision-language models to Refinement Experts.

Result: Extensive experiments on physics-aware video generation benchmarks show ProPhy produces more realistic, dynamic, and physically coherent results than state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ProPhy successfully addresses physical consistency challenges in video generation through explicit physics-aware conditioning and anisotropic generation, enabling better world simulation capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have shown remarkable potential for constructing world simulators. However, current models still struggle to produce physically consistent results, particularly when handling large-scale or complex dynamics. This limitation arises primarily because existing approaches respond isotropically to physical prompts and neglect the fine-grained alignment between generated content and localized physical cues. To address these challenges, we propose ProPhy, a Progressive Physical Alignment Framework that enables explicit physics-aware conditioning and anisotropic generation. ProPhy employs a two-stage Mixture-of-Physics-Experts (MoPE) mechanism for discriminative physical prior extraction, where Semantic Experts infer semantic-level physical principles from textual descriptions, and Refinement Experts capture token-level physical dynamics. This mechanism allows the model to learn fine-grained, physics-aware video representations that better reflect underlying physical laws. Furthermore, we introduce a physical alignment strategy that transfers the physical reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) into the Refinement Experts, facilitating a more accurate representation of dynamic physical phenomena. Extensive experiments on physics-aware video generation benchmarks demonstrate that ProPhy produces more realistic, dynamic, and physically coherent results than existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: MedDIFT is a training-free 3D medical image registration framework that uses pretrained diffusion model features as voxel descriptors for accurate correspondence without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional medical image registration methods rely on local intensity-based similarity measures that fail to capture global semantic structure, leading to mismatches in low-contrast or anatomically variable regions.

Method: MedDIFT leverages multi-scale features from a pretrained latent medical diffusion model as voxel descriptors, fuses diffusion activations into rich descriptors, and matches them via cosine similarity with optional local-search prior.

Result: On lung CT dataset, MedDIFT achieves accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art learning-based UniGradICON and surpasses conventional B-spline registration, without requiring task-specific training.

Conclusion: Diffusion model features encode rich geometric and semantic information suitable for medical image registration, enabling training-free correspondence matching that competes with learning-based methods.

Abstract: Accurate spatial correspondence between medical images is essential for longitudinal analysis, lesion tracking, and image-guided interventions. Medical image registration methods rely on local intensity-based similarity measures, which fail to capture global semantic structure and often yield mismatches in low-contrast or anatomically variable regions. Recent advances in diffusion models suggest that their intermediate representations encode rich geometric and semantic information. We present MedDIFT, a training-free 3D correspondence framework that leverages multi-scale features from a pretrained latent medical diffusion model as voxel descriptors. MedDIFT fuses diffusion activations into rich voxel-wise descriptors and matches them via cosine similarity, with an optional local-search prior. On a publicly available lung CT dataset, MedDIFT achieves correspondence accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art learning-based UniGradICON model and surpasses conventional B-spline-based registration, without requiring any task-specific model training. Ablation experiments confirm that multi-level feature fusion and modest diffusion noise improve performance.

Abstract: Grounding is a fundamental capability for building graphical user interface (GUI) agents. Although existing approaches rely on large-scale bounding box supervision, they still face various challenges, such as cross-platform generalization, complex layout analysis, and fine-grained element localization. In this paper, we investigate zoom as a strong yet underexplored prior for GUI grounding, and propose a training-free method, ZoomClick. By characterizing four key properties of zoom (i.e., pre-zoom, depth, shrink size, minimal crop size), we unlock its full capabilities for dynamic spatial focusing and adaptive context switching. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly boosts the performance of both general vision-language and specialized GUI grounding models, achieving state-of-the-art results on several mainstream benchmarks; for example, UI-Venus-72B attains a 73.1% success rate on ScreenSpot-Pro.

*Rong Wang,Wei Mao,Changsheng Lu,Hongdong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Skinning-free 3D garment animation method that decouples low-frequency shape and high-frequency wrinkles, using 2D image transfer with pretrained models for superior wrinkle detail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing skinning-based methods produce misaligned shapes that corrupt high-frequency wrinkles. Need better approach for high-fidelity garment animation in virtual try-on and XR applications.

Method: 1) Decouple low-frequency vertex positions and high-frequency vertex normals with direct supervision. 2) Encode vertex attributes as texture images for 2D transfer. 3) Leverage pretrained image models for wrinkle details. 4) Multimodal fusion to recover 3D garments from transferred images.

Result: Significantly improves animation quality on various garment types, recovers finer wrinkles than state-of-the-art methods, maintains scalability for diverse topologies without manual UV partition.

Conclusion: Skinning-free approach with frequency decoupling and 2D image transfer enables high-fidelity 3D garment animation with superior wrinkle detail and broad applicability.

Abstract: We present a novel method for generating 3D garment deformations from given body poses, which is key to a wide range of applications, including virtual try-on and extended reality. To simplify the cloth dynamics, existing methods mostly rely on linear blend skinning to obtain low-frequency posed garment shape and only regress high-frequency wrinkles. However, due to the lack of explicit skinning supervision, such skinning-based approach often produces misaligned shapes when posing the garment, consequently corrupts the high-frequency signals and fails to recover high-fidelity wrinkles. To tackle this issue, we propose a skinning-free approach by independently estimating posed (i) vertex position for low-frequency posed garment shape, and (ii) vertex normal for high-frequency local wrinkle details. In this way, each frequency modality can be effectively decoupled and directly supervised by the geometry of the deformed garment. To further improve the visual quality of animation, we propose to encode both vertex attributes as rendered texture images, so that 3D garment deformation can be equivalently achieved via 2D image transfer. This enables us to leverage powerful pretrained image models to recover fine-grained visual details in wrinkles, while maintaining superior scalability for garments of diverse topologies without relying on manual UV partition. Finally, we propose a multimodal fusion to incorporate constraints from both frequency modalities and robustly recover deformed 3D garments from transferred images. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves animation quality on various garment types and recovers finer wrinkles than state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater images suffer from color distortion, low contrast, and haze due to light absorption/scattering, while existing deep learning models are computationally complex and impractical for real-time underwater applications.

Method: AQUA-Net integrates a residual encoder-decoder with dual auxiliary branches: 1) frequency fusion encoder that enriches spatial representations with Fourier domain cues to preserve textures/details, and 2) illumination-aware decoder using Retinex-inspired learned illumination map for adaptive exposure correction by separating reflectance from lighting effects.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show AQUA-Net performs on par with SOTA in qualitative/quantitative evaluations while using fewer parameters. Ablation studies confirm frequency and illumination branches provide complementary contributions improving visibility and color representation.

Conclusion: The joint spatial, frequency, and illumination design enables restoration of color balance, contrast, and perceptual realism under diverse underwater conditions, showing strong generalization capability and robustness for real-world underwater imaging applications.

Abstract: Underwater images often suffer from severe color distortion, low contrast, and a hazy appearance due to wavelength-dependent light absorption and scattering. Simultaneously, existing deep learning models exhibit high computational complexity, which limits their practical deployment for real-time underwater applications. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel underwater image enhancement model, called Adaptive Frequency Fusion and Illumination Aware Network (AQUA-Net). It integrates a residual encoder decoder with dual auxiliary branches, which operate in the frequency and illumination domains. The frequency fusion encoder enriches spatial representations with frequency cues from the Fourier domain and preserves fine textures and structural details. Inspired by Retinex, the illumination-aware decoder performs adaptive exposure correction through a learned illumination map that separates reflectance from lighting effects. This joint spatial, frequency, and illumination design enables the model to restore color balance, visual contrast, and perceptual realism under diverse underwater conditions. Additionally, we present a high-resolution, real-world underwater video-derived dataset from the Mediterranean Sea, which captures challenging deep-sea conditions with realistic visual degradations to enable robust evaluation and development of deep learning models. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that AQUA-Net performs on par with SOTA in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations while using less number of parameters. Ablation studies further confirm that the frequency and illumination branches provide complementary contributions that improve visibility and color representation. Overall, the proposed model shows strong generalization capability and robustness, and it provides an effective solution for real-world underwater imaging applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current perception-generalist approaches using language models achieve SOTA results but rely on slow autoregressive next-token prediction. Need for faster inference while maintaining accuracy in 3D scene layout estimation.

Method: Introduces multi-token prediction (MTP) to reduce autoregressive iterations, adapts self-speculative decoding (SSD) for structured language models, and proposes confidence-guided decoding (CGD) with improved scoring for token reliability. Also includes parameter-efficient mechanism to reduce MTP overhead.

Result: Can generate up to 9 tokens per decoder inference step without compromising accuracy, while adding only ~7.5% additional parameters. Validated on ASE and Structured3D benchmarks.

Conclusion: Fast SceneScript provides accurate and efficient 3D scene layout estimation through structured language modeling with multi-token prediction and reliability filtering, significantly accelerating inference while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Recent perception-generalist approaches based on language models have achieved state-of-the-art results across diverse tasks, including 3D scene layout estimation, via unified architecture and interface. However, these approaches rely on autoregressive next-token prediction, which is inherently slow. In this work, we introduce Fast SceneScript, a novel structured language model for accurate and efficient 3D scene layout estimation. Our method employs multi-token prediction (MTP) to reduce the number of autoregressive iterations and significantly accelerate inference. While MTP improves speed, unreliable token predictions can significantly reduce accuracy. To filter out unreliable tokens, we adapt self-speculative decoding (SSD) for structured language models and introduce confidence-guided decoding (CGD) with an improved scoring mechanism for token reliability. Furthermore, we design a parameter-efficient mechanism that reduces the parameter overhead of MTP. Extensive experiments on the ASE and Structured3D benchmarks demonstrate that Fast SceneScript can generate up to 9 tokens per decoder inference step without compromising accuracy, while adding only $\sim7.5\%$ additional parameters.

TL;DR: NormalView: A sensor-agnostic projection-based deep learning method for tree species classification from point cloud data using normal vector projections and YOLOv11, achieving 95.5% accuracy on MLS data and 91.8% on ALS data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile laser scanning (MLS) shows promise for accurate tree-level inventory, but there's a need for effective methods to classify tree species from point cloud data that work across different sensors and can leverage both geometric and radiometric information.

Method: NormalView embeds local geometric information (normal vector estimates) into 2D projections and uses these as inputs to YOLOv11 image classification network. The method also examines the effect of multispectral radiometric intensity information on classification performance.

Result: Achieved 95.5% overall accuracy (94.8% macro-average) on high-density MLS data (7 species) and 91.8% (79.1% macro-average) on high-density ALS data (9 species). Multispectral intensity information from all three channels provided the best performance on ALS data.

Conclusion: Projection-based methods enhanced with geometric information and state-of-the-art image classification backbones can achieve exceptional results for tree species classification. These methods are sensor-agnostic and rely only on geometric information, making them versatile for different laser scanning platforms.

Abstract: Laser scanning has proven to be an invaluable tool in assessing the decomposition of forest environments. Mobile laser scanning (MLS) has shown to be highly promising for extremely accurate, tree level inventory. In this study, we present NormalView, a sensor-agnostic projection-based deep learning method for classifying tree species from point cloud data. NormalView embeds local geometric information into two-dimensional projections, in the form of normal vector estimates, and uses the projections as inputs to an image classification network, YOLOv11. In addition, we inspected the effect of multispectral radiometric intensity information on classification performance. We trained and tested our model on high-density MLS data (7 species, ~5000 pts/m^2), as well as high-density airborne laser scanning (ALS) data (9 species, >1000 pts/m^2). On the MLS data, NormalView achieves an overall accuracy (macro-average accuracy) of 95.5 % (94.8 %), and 91.8 % (79.1 %) on the ALS data. We found that having intensity information from multiple scanners provides benefits in tree species classification, and the best model on the multispectral ALS dataset was a model using intensity information from all three channels of the multispectral ALS. This study demonstrates that projection-based methods, when enhanced with geometric information and coupled with state-of-the-art image classification backbones, can achieve exceptional results. Crucially, these methods are sensor-agnostic, relying only on geometric information. Additionally, we publically release the MLS dataset used in the study.

TL;DR: DistillFSS: A distillation-based framework for cross-domain few-shot semantic segmentation that embeds support knowledge into model parameters, eliminating need for support images at test time for faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-domain few-shot semantic segmentation faces challenges: substantial domain shifts, disjoint label spaces, scarce support images, making episodic methods unreliable and computationally demanding at test time.

Method: Teacher-student distillation framework that internalizes few-shot reasoning into a dedicated layer within student network, enabling fast inference without support images, with efficient extension to novel classes via teacher-driven specialization.

Result: Matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, especially in multi-class and multi-shot scenarios, with substantial efficiency gains; evaluated on new CD-FSS benchmark spanning medical imaging, industrial inspection, and remote sensing.

Conclusion: DistillFSS effectively addresses CD-FSS challenges by embedding support knowledge into parameters, enabling fast lightweight inference while maintaining competitive performance, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation (CD-FSS) seeks to segment unknown classes in unseen domains using only a few annotated examples. This setting is inherently challenging: source and target domains exhibit substantial distribution shifts, label spaces are disjoint, and support images are scarce--making standard episodic methods unreliable and computationally demanding at test time. To address these constraints, we propose DistillFSS, a framework that embeds support-set knowledge directly into a model's parameters through a teacher--student distillation process. By internalizing few-shot reasoning into a dedicated layer within the student network, DistillFSS eliminates the need for support images at test time, enabling fast, lightweight inference, while allowing efficient extension to novel classes in unseen domains through rapid teacher-driven specialization. Combined with fine-tuning, the approach scales efficiently to large support sets and significantly reduces computational overhead. To evaluate the framework under realistic conditions, we introduce a new CD-FSS benchmark spanning medical imaging, industrial inspection, and remote sensing, with disjoint label spaces and variable support sizes. Experiments show that DistillFSS matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in multi-class and multi-shot scenarios, while offering substantial efficiency gains.

TL;DR: Novel unsupervised training framework using Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) for ISP pipelines that works with both paired and unpaired data, achieving state-of-the-art performance while being robust to outliers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learned ISP pipelines require large-scale paired raw-to-sRGB datasets which are costly to acquire, creating a significant bottleneck for development and deployment.

Method: UOT-based framework for cross-domain translation with a "committee of expert discriminators" that provides specialized adversarial regularization to correct specific ISP failure modes (color fidelity, structural artifacts, frequency-domain realism).

Result: When trained in paired mode, exceeds original paired methods across all metrics; in unpaired mode, achieves performance rivaling or surpassing original paired-trained counterparts.

Conclusion: The UOT-based framework successfully addresses the data bottleneck in learned ISP pipelines, enabling effective training with both paired and unpaired data while providing robustness to outliers.

Abstract: Learned Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipelines offer powerful end-to-end performance but are critically dependent on large-scale paired raw-to-sRGB datasets. This reliance on costly-to-acquire paired data remains a significant bottleneck. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel, unsupervised training framework based on Optimal Transport capable of training arbitrary ISP architectures in both unpaired and paired modes. We are the first to successfully apply Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) for this complex, cross-domain translation task. Our UOT-based framework provides robustness to outliers in the target sRGB data, allowing it to discount atypical samples that would be prohibitively costly to map. A key component of our framework is a novel ``committee of expert discriminators,'' a hybrid adversarial regularizer. This committee guides the optimal transport mapping by providing specialized, targeted gradients to correct specific ISP failure modes, including color fidelity, structural artifacts, and frequency-domain realism. To demonstrate the superiority of our approach, we retrained existing state-of-the-art ISP architectures using our paired and unpaired setups. Our experiments show that while our framework, when trained in paired mode, exceeds the performance of the original paired methods across all metrics, our unpaired mode concurrently achieves quantitative and qualitative performance that rivals, and in some cases surpasses, the original paired-trained counterparts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI-generated image detectors rely on specific generative model internals, limiting cross-model applicability. Need for more generalizable detectors that work across different AI models.

Method: Self-supervised approach using EXIF camera metadata: trains feature extractor on camera-captured photos by classifying categorical EXIF tags and ranking ordinal/continuous tags. Uses EXIF-induced features for one-class detection (Gaussian mixture model) and binary detection (regularized classifier on high-frequency residuals from scrambled patches).

Result: EXIF-induced detectors substantially advance state of the art, demonstrate strong generalization to in-the-wild samples, and show robustness to common benign image perturbations across various generative models.

Conclusion: Camera metadata (EXIF tags) provides effective features for detecting AI-generated images, enabling cross-model generalization without relying on specific generative model internals.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated imagery poses escalating challenges for multimedia forensics, yet many existing detectors depend on assumptions about the internals of specific generative models, limiting their cross-model applicability. We introduce a self-supervised approach for detecting AI-generated images that leverages camera metadata -- specifically exchangeable image file format (EXIF) tags -- to learn features intrinsic to digital photography. Our pretext task trains a feature extractor solely on camera-captured photographs by classifying categorical EXIF tags (\eg, camera model and scene type) and pairwise-ranking ordinal and continuous EXIF tags (\eg, focal length and aperture value). Using these EXIF-induced features, we first perform one-class detection by modeling the distribution of photographic images with a Gaussian mixture model and flagging low-likelihood samples as AI-generated. We then extend to binary detection that treats the learned extractor as a strong regularizer for a classifier of the same architecture, operating on high-frequency residuals from spatially scrambled patches. Extensive experiments across various generative models demonstrate that our EXIF-induced detectors substantially advance the state of the art, delivering strong generalization to in-the-wild samples and robustness to common benign image perturbations.

Conclusion: High fidelity and real-time efficiency in monocular 3D detection are simultaneously attainable without LiDAR, stereo, or geometric assumptions, setting a new Pareto frontier for the field.

Abstract: Real-time monocular 3D object detection remains challenging due to severe depth ambiguity, viewpoint shifts, and the high computational cost of 3D reasoning. Existing approaches either rely on LiDAR or geometric priors to compensate for missing depth, or sacrifice efficiency to achieve competitive accuracy. We introduce LeAD-M3D, a monocular 3D detector that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time inference without extra modalities. Our method is powered by three key components. Asymmetric Augmentation Denoising Distillation (A2D2) transfers geometric knowledge from a clean-image teacher to a mixup-noised student via a quality- and importance-weighted depth-feature loss, enabling stronger depth reasoning without LiDAR supervision. 3D-aware Consistent Matching (CM3D) improves prediction-to-ground truth assignment by integrating 3D MGIoU into the matching score, yielding more stable and precise supervision. Finally, Confidence-Gated 3D Inference (CGI3D) accelerates detection by restricting expensive 3D regression to top-confidence regions. Together, these components set a new Pareto frontier for monocular 3D detection: LeAD-M3D achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on KITTI and Waymo, and the best reported car AP on Rope3D, while running up to 3.6x faster than prior high-accuracy methods. Our results demonstrate that high fidelity and real-time efficiency in monocular 3D detection are simultaneously attainable - without LiDAR, stereo, or geometric assumptions.

Motivation: Hyperspectral unmixing requires separating pixels into constituent endmembers and abundance fractions, but existing methods need better integration of spectral and spatial information in 3D HSI data cubes.

Method: Proposes 3D-CSCNet built on autoencoder framework with 3D convolutional sparse coding blocks for abundance estimation, decoder weights as endmembers, and PSVM algorithm for endmember initialization.

Result: Extensive experiments on three real datasets and one simulated dataset with varying SNR levels demonstrate that 3D-CSCNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The 3D-CSCNet effectively integrates spectral and spatial information through 3D convolutional sparse coding within an autoencoder framework, achieving superior hyperspectral unmixing performance.

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing (HSU) aims to separate each pixel into its constituent endmembers and estimate their corresponding abundance fractions. This work presents an algorithm-unrolling-based network for the HSU task, named the 3D Convolutional Sparse Coding Network (3D-CSCNet), built upon a 3D CSC model. Unlike existing unrolling-based networks, our 3D-CSCNet is designed within the powerful autoencoder (AE) framework. Specifically, to solve the 3D CSC problem, we propose a 3D CSC block (3D-CSCB) derived through deep algorithm unrolling. Given a hyperspectral image (HSI), 3D-CSCNet employs the 3D-CSCB to estimate the abundance matrix. The use of 3D CSC enables joint learning of spectral and spatial relationships in the 3D HSI data cube. The estimated abundance matrix is then passed to the AE decoder to reconstruct the HSI, and the decoder weights are extracted as the endmember matrix. Additionally, we propose a projected simplex volume maximization (PSVM) algorithm for endmember estimation, and the resulting endmembers are used to initialize the decoder weights of 3D-CSCNet. Extensive experiments on three real datasets and one simulated dataset with three different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels demonstrate that our 3D-CSCNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: ZRNet: Physics-informed framework for joint Zernike coefficient prediction and optical image restoration in microscopy, using Zernike Graph module and Frequency-Aware Alignment loss to enforce physical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optical aberrations degrade microscopy image quality, especially in deep imaging. Existing methods handle only mild aberrations on limited samples, treating the problem as black-box mapping without leveraging optical physics of wavefront distortions represented by Zernike polynomials.

Method: ZRNet jointly performs Zernike coefficient prediction and image restoration. It uses a Zernike Graph module to model physical relationships between Zernike polynomials based on azimuthal degrees, ensuring corrections align with optical principles. A Frequency-Aware Alignment (FAA) loss enforces consistency between image restoration and Zernike prediction in Fourier domain.

Result: Extensive experiments on CytoImageNet show state-of-the-art performance in both image restoration and Zernike coefficient prediction across diverse microscopy modalities and biological samples with complex, large-amplitude aberrations.

Conclusion: ZRNet successfully integrates optical physics into aberration correction, outperforming existing methods by explicitly modeling Zernike polynomial relationships and enforcing physical consistency between image restoration and wavefront prediction.

Abstract: Optical aberrations significantly degrade image quality in microscopy, particularly when imaging deeper into samples. These aberrations arise from distortions in the optical wavefront and can be mathematically represented using Zernike polynomials. Existing methods often address only mild aberrations on limited sample types and modalities, typically treating the problem as a black-box mapping without leveraging the underlying optical physics of wavefront distortions. We propose ZRNet, a physics-informed framework that jointly performs Zernike coefficient prediction and optical image Restoration. We contribute a Zernike Graph module that explicitly models physical relationships between Zernike polynomials based on their azimuthal degrees-ensuring that learned corrections align with fundamental optical principles. To further enforce physical consistency between image restoration and Zernike prediction, we introduce a Frequency-Aware Alignment (FAA) loss, which better aligns Zernike coefficient prediction and image features in the Fourier domain. Extensive experiments on CytoImageNet demonstrates that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both image restoration and Zernike coefficient prediction across diverse microscopy modalities and biological samples with complex, large-amplitude aberrations.

TL;DR: OWL proposes unsupervised 3D object detection using occupancy-guided warm-up and large-model priors to address incorrect pseudo-label issues in self-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised 3D object detection methods suffer from incorrect pseudo-labels at training start, which mislead optimization and make filtering/refining challenging.

Method: OWL uses: 1) Occupancy Guided Warm-up (OGW) to initialize backbone with spatial perception; 2) Instance-Cued Reasoning (ICR) module leveraging large-model priors to assess pseudo-label quality; 3) Weight-adapted Self-training (WAS) to dynamically re-weight pseudo-labels.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by over 15.0% mAP on Waymo Open Dataset and KITTI.

Conclusion: OWL effectively addresses pseudo-label quality issues in unsupervised 3D object detection through warm-up initialization, large-model priors, and adaptive self-training.

Abstract: Unsupervised 3D object detection leverages heuristic algorithms to discover potential objects, offering a promising route to reduce annotation costs in autonomous driving. Existing approaches mainly generate pseudo labels and refine them through self-training iterations. However, these pseudo-labels are often incorrect at the beginning of training, resulting in misleading the optimization process. Moreover, effectively filtering and refining them remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we propose OWL for unsupervised 3D object detection by occupancy guided warm-up and large-model priors reasoning. OWL first employs an Occupancy Guided Warm-up (OGW) strategy to initialize the backbone weight with spatial perception capabilities, mitigating the interference of incorrect pseudo-labels on network convergence. Furthermore, OWL introduces an Instance-Cued Reasoning (ICR) module that leverages the prior knowledge of large models to assess pseudo-label quality, enabling precise filtering and refinement. Finally, we design a Weight-adapted Self-training (WAS) strategy to dynamically re-weight pseudo-labels, improving the performance through self-training. Extensive experiments on Waymo Open Dataset (WOD) and KITTI demonstrate that OWL outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by over 15.0% mAP, revealing the effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud completion methods rely on Euclidean proximity and overlook intrinsic nonlinear geometric structure, leading to suboptimal geometric consistency and semantic ambiguity in reconstructed shapes.

Method: Introduces two key modules: Geodesic Distance Approximator (GDA) to estimate geodesic distances capturing manifold topology, and Manifold-Aware Feature Extractor (MAFE) using geodesic-based k-NN groupings and geodesic-relational attention for hierarchical feature extraction.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate consistent outperformance over state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: The manifold-aware framework incorporating nonlinear geometry information throughout the feature learning pipeline improves semantic coherence and structural fidelity in point cloud completion.

Abstract: Point cloud completion seeks to recover geometrically consistent shapes from partial or sparse 3D observations. Although recent methods have achieved reasonable global shape reconstruction, they often rely on Euclidean proximity and overlook the intrinsic nonlinear geometric structure of point clouds, resulting in suboptimal geometric consistency and semantic ambiguity. In this paper, we present a manifold-aware point cloud completion framework that explicitly incorporates nonlinear geometry information throughout the feature learning pipeline. Our approach introduces two key modules: a Geodesic Distance Approximator (GDA), which estimates geodesic distances between points to capture the latent manifold topology, and a Manifold-Aware Feature Extractor (MAFE), which utilizes geodesic-based $k$-NN groupings and a geodesic-relational attention mechanism to guide the hierarchical feature extraction process. By integrating geodesic-aware relational attention, our method promotes semantic coherence and structural fidelity in the reconstructed point clouds. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction quality.

TL;DR: Privacy-preserving framework distills knowledge from large LLMs into local VLMs for surgical scene understanding using expert-supervised text-only datasets with segmentation masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs lack domain-specific surgical scene understanding capabilities and pose privacy risks when patient data is sent to external cloud services. There's a need for locally deployable models that can understand surgical anatomy while protecting patient privacy.

Method: Generate expert-supervised dataset by prompting teacher LLM with only textual context and binary segmentation masks (no sensitive images). Use this dataset for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) of a locally deployable VLM.

Result: Finetuning VLMs with the generated datasets significantly increases surgical domain knowledge compared to base VLMs, demonstrating effective knowledge transfer without compromising privacy.

Conclusion: The work validates a data-efficient, privacy-conforming approach to train locally deployable VLMs optimized for surgical scene understanding, addressing both domain expertise gaps and patient data privacy concerns.

Abstract: Recently, Vision Large Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated high potential in computer-aided diagnosis and decision-support. However, current VLMs show deficits in domain specific surgical scene understanding, such as identifying and explaining anatomical landmarks during Complete Mesocolic Excision. Additionally, there is a need for locally deployable models to avoid patient data leakage to large VLMs, hosted outside the clinic. We propose a privacy-preserving framework to distill knowledge from large, general-purpose LLMs into an efficient, local VLM. We generate an expert-supervised dataset by prompting a teacher LLM without sensitive images, using only textual context and binary segmentation masks for spatial information. This dataset is used for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and subsequent Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) of the locally deployable VLM. Our evaluation confirms that finetuning VLMs with our generated datasets increases surgical domain knowledge compared to its base VLM by a large margin. Overall, this work validates a data-efficient and privacy-conforming way to train a surgical domain optimized, locally deployable VLM for surgical scene understanding.

Conclusion: HQ-DM effectively addresses activation outlier issues in diffusion model quantization, enabling efficient low-bit deployment with significant performance improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated significant applications in the field of image generation. However, their high computational and memory costs pose challenges for deployment. Model quantization has emerged as a promising solution to reduce storage overhead and accelerate inference. Nevertheless, existing quantization methods for diffusion models struggle to mitigate outliers in activation matrices during inference, leading to substantial performance degradation under low-bit quantization scenarios. To address this, we propose HQ-DM, a novel Quantization-Aware Training framework that applies Single Hadamard Transformation to activation matrices. This approach effectively reduces activation outliers while preserving model performance under quantization. Compared to traditional Double Hadamard Transformation, our proposed scheme offers distinct advantages by seamlessly supporting INT convolution operations while preventing the amplification of weight outliers. For conditional generation on the ImageNet 256x256 dataset using the LDM-4 model, our W4A4 and W4A3 quantization schemes improve the Inception Score by 12.8% and 467.73%, respectively, over the existing state-of-the-art method.

*Xinjian Wu,Hongmei Wang,Yuan Zhou,Qinglin Lu*

TL;DR: USV is a unified framework that jointly optimizes attention sparsification, token merging, and denoising step reduction for accelerating video diffusion models while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video diffusion models suffer from quadratic complexity in spatio-temporal attention and computational overhead from long iterative denoising, with existing accelerators targeting single dimensions in isolation leading to diminishing returns.

Method: USV learns a dynamic, data- and timestep-dependent sparsification policy that jointly prunes redundant attention connections, merges semantically similar tokens, and reduces denoising steps within a single optimization objective.

Result: Achieves up to 83.3% speedup in denoising process and 22.7% end-to-end acceleration while maintaining high visual fidelity on large-scale video generation benchmarks.

Conclusion: Unified, dynamic sparsification provides a practical path toward efficient, high-quality video generation by enabling strong mutual reinforcement among previously disjoint acceleration strategies.

Abstract: The scalability of high-fidelity video diffusion models (VDMs) is constrained by two key sources of redundancy: the quadratic complexity of global spatio-temporal attention and the computational overhead of long iterative denoising trajectories. Existing accelerators -- such as sparse attention and step-distilled samplers -- typically target a single dimension in isolation and quickly encounter diminishing returns, as the remaining bottlenecks become dominant. In this work, we introduce USV (Unified Sparsification for Video diffusion models), an end-to-end trainable framework that overcomes this limitation by jointly orchestrating sparsification across both the model's internal computation and its sampling process. USV learns a dynamic, data- and timestep-dependent sparsification policy that prunes redundant attention connections, adaptively merges semantically similar tokens, and reduces denoising steps, treating them not as independent tricks but as coordinated actions within a single optimization objective. This multi-dimensional co-design enables strong mutual reinforcement among previously disjoint acceleration strategies. Extensive experiments on large-scale video generation benchmarks demonstrate that USV achieves up to 83.3% speedup in the denoising process and 22.7% end-to-end acceleration, while maintaining high visual fidelity. Our results highlight unified, dynamic sparsification as a practical path toward efficient, high-quality video generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior neural cloth simulators require extensive ground truth data, sacrifice fine-scale details, and generalize poorly across resolutions and motion patterns. There's a need for a method that can simulate physically plausible cloth dynamics without these limitations.

Method: FNOpt formulates time integration as an optimization problem and trains a resolution-agnostic neural optimizer parameterized by a Fourier neural operator (FNO). It's trained only on coarse grids with physics-based losses in a self-supervised manner.

Result: FNOpt achieves stable and accurate rollouts across diverse mesh resolutions and motion patterns without retraining, captures fine-scale wrinkles, and outperforms prior learning-based approaches in out-of-distribution settings for both accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: FNO-based meta-optimization presents a compelling alternative to previous neural simulators for cloth, reducing the need for curated data and improving cross-resolution reliability in cloth simulation.

Abstract: We present FNOpt, a self-supervised cloth simulation framework that formulates time integration as an optimization problem and trains a resolution-agnostic neural optimizer parameterized by a Fourier neural operator (FNO). Prior neural simulators often rely on extensive ground truth data or sacrifice fine-scale detail, and generalize poorly across resolutions and motion patterns. In contrast, FNOpt learns to simulate physically plausible cloth dynamics and achieves stable and accurate rollouts across diverse mesh resolutions and motion patterns without retraining. Trained only on a coarse grid with physics-based losses, FNOpt generalizes to finer resolutions, capturing fine-scale wrinkles and preserving rollout stability. Extensive evaluations on a benchmark cloth simulation dataset demonstrate that FNOpt outperforms prior learning-based approaches in out-of-distribution settings in both accuracy and robustness. These results position FNO-based meta-optimization as a compelling alternative to previous neural simulators for cloth, thus reducing the need for curated data and improving cross-resolution reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse depth measurements (only 5% of needed data) make complete 3D scene reconstruction difficult for autonomous vehicles and robots, where geometric errors from sparse reconstruction are unacceptable.

Method: Proposes curvature regularization through a discrete Laplacian operator that provides stable gradients and noise suppression with minimal training overhead (15%) and zero inference cost.

Result: Achieves 18.1% better reconstruction accuracy than standard variational autoencoders, demonstrating that a single well-designed regularization term can outperform complex multi-term formulations.

Conclusion: Challenges the implicit assumption in geometric deep learning that combining multiple geometric constraints improves performance, showing that a single effective regularization term can be superior.

Abstract: When depth sensors provide only 5% of needed measurements, reconstructing complete 3D scenes becomes difficult. Autonomous vehicles and robots cannot tolerate the geometric errors that sparse reconstruction introduces. We propose curvature regularization through a discrete Laplacian operator, achieving 18.1% better reconstruction accuracy than standard variational autoencoders. Our contribution challenges an implicit assumption in geometric deep learning: that combining multiple geometric constraints improves performance. A single well-designed regularization term not only matches but exceeds the effectiveness of complex multi-term formulations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CTVG methods assume static personalized concepts and struggle with forgetting and concept neglect when continuously learning new subjects and motions over time.

Method: Introduces concept-specific attribute retention module, task-aware concept aggregation strategy, and controllable conditional synthesis with layer-specific region attention-guided noise estimation.

Result: Extensive experiments show CCVD outperforms existing CTVG models in continual learning scenarios.

Conclusion: CCVD successfully addresses forgetting and concept neglect in continual customized video generation, enabling effective learning of new concepts over time.

Abstract: Customized text-to-video generation (CTVG) has recently witnessed great progress in generating tailored videos from user-specific text. However, most CTVG methods assume that personalized concepts remain static and do not expand incrementally over time. Additionally, they struggle with forgetting and concept neglect when continuously learning new concepts, including subjects and motions. To resolve the above challenges, we develop a novel Continual Customized Video Diffusion (CCVD) model, which can continuously learn new concepts to generate videos across various text-to-video generation tasks by tackling forgetting and concept neglect. To address catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a concept-specific attribute retention module and a task-aware concept aggregation strategy. They can capture the unique characteristics and identities of old concepts during training, while combining all subject and motion adapters of old concepts based on their relevance during testing. Besides, to tackle concept neglect, we develop a controllable conditional synthesis to enhance regional features and align video contexts with user conditions, by incorporating layer-specific region attention-guided noise estimation. Extensive experimental comparisons demonstrate that our CCVD outperforms existing CTVG models. The code is available at https://github.com/JiahuaDong/CCVD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AD classification frameworks struggle with multicenter studies due to inter-site heterogeneity and lack of uncertainty quantification, limiting robustness and clinical applicability.

Method: Integrates uncertainty quantification with federated domain adaptation, extracts multi-template RoI features using self-attention transformer, and uses UQ to guide feature alignment by down-weighting uncertain samples.

Result: Achieved consistent cross-domain improvements across three datasets (ADNI, AIBL, OASIS) for three classification tasks: AD vs. NC (90.54%, 89.04%, 77.78%), MCI vs. AD (80.20%, 71.91%, 79.73%), NC vs. MCI (76.87%, 73.91%, 83.73%).

Conclusion: UG-FedDA efficiently adapts across multiple sites while preserving strict privacy, demonstrating robust performance for multicenter AD classification.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder, and early diagnosis is critical for timely intervention. However, most existing classification frameworks face challenges in multicenter studies, as they often neglect inter-site heterogeneity and lack mechanisms to quantify uncertainty, which limits their robustness and clinical applicability. To address these issues, we proposed Uncertainty-Guided Federated Domain Adaptation (UG-FedDA), a novel multicenter AD classification framework that integrates uncertainty quantification (UQ) with federated domain adaptation to handle cross-site structure magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) heterogeneity under privacy constraints. Our approach extracts multi-template region-of-interest (RoI) features using a self-attention transformer, capturing both regional representations and their interactions. UQ is integrated to guide feature alignment, mitigating source-target distribution shifts by down-weighting uncertain samples. Experiments are conducted on three public datasets: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle study (AIBL), and the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS). UG-FedDA achieved consistent cross-domain improvements in accuracy, sensitivity, and area under the ROC curve across three classification tasks: AD vs. normal controls (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) vs. AD, and NC vs. MCI. For NC vs. AD, UG-FedDA achieves accuracies of 90.54%, 89.04%, and 77.78% on ADNI, AIBL and OASIS datasets, respectively. For MCI vs. AD, accuracies are 80.20% (ADNI), 71.91% (AIBL), and 79.73% (OASIS). For NC vs. MCI, results are 76.87% (ADNI), 73.91% (AIBL), and 83.73% (OASIS). These results demonstrate that the proposed framework not only adapts efficiently across multiple sites but also preserves strict privacy.

TL;DR: VRSA is a visual reasoning sequential attack method that decomposes harmful text into sequential sub-images to jailbreak MLLMs, achieving higher success rates than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While previous jailbreak attacks focused on text modality, visual reasoning safety risks in MLLMs have been largely overlooked. The paper aims to fully evaluate potential safety risks in visual reasoning tasks.

Method: Proposes Visual Reasoning Sequential Attack (VRSA) that decomposes harmful text into sequentially related sub-images. Includes three components: Adaptive Scene Refinement to optimize relevant scenes, Semantic Coherent Completion to iteratively rewrite sub-texts with context, and Text-Image Consistency Alignment to maintain semantic consistency.

Result: VRSA achieves higher attack success rates compared to state-of-the-art jailbreak attack methods on both open-source and closed-source MLLMs including GPT-4o and Claude-4.5-Sonnet.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates significant safety vulnerabilities in MLLMs' visual reasoning capabilities and highlights the need for more robust safety measures against multimodal jailbreak attacks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are widely used in various fields due to their powerful cross-modal comprehension and generation capabilities. However, more modalities bring more vulnerabilities to being utilized for jailbreak attacks, which induces MLLMs to output harmful content. Due to the strong reasoning ability of MLLMs, previous jailbreak attacks try to explore reasoning safety risk in text modal, while similar threats have been largely overlooked in the visual modal. To fully evaluate potential safety risks in the visual reasoning task, we propose Visual Reasoning Sequential Attack (VRSA), which induces MLLMs to gradually externalize and aggregate complete harmful intent by decomposing the original harmful text into several sequentially related sub-images. In particular, to enhance the rationality of the scene in the image sequence, we propose Adaptive Scene Refinement to optimize the scene most relevant to the original harmful query. To ensure the semantic continuity of the generated image, we propose Semantic Coherent Completion to iteratively rewrite each sub-text combined with contextual information in this scene. In addition, we propose Text-Image Consistency Alignment to keep the semantical consistency. A series of experiments demonstrates that the VRSA can achieve a higher attack success rate compared with the state-of-the-art jailbreak attack methods on both the open-source and closed-source MLLMs such as GPT-4o and Claude-4.5-Sonnet.

TL;DR: Plug-and-play edit-aware loss function improves RAW reconstruction robustness to diverse rendering styles and edits by incorporating a differentiable ISP with tunable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users edit camera images post-capture but typically work with display-referred sRGB JPEGs rather than RAW files. Existing RAW reconstruction methods focus on pixel fidelity and degrade under diverse rendering styles and editing operations, despite editing being the primary motivation for RAW reconstruction in consumer imaging.

Method: Introduces an edit-aware loss function with modular, differentiable image signal processor (ISP) that simulates realistic photofinishing pipelines. During training, ISP parameters are randomly sampled from distributions modeling practical variations in real camera processing, and loss is computed in sRGB space between ground-truth and reconstructed RAWs rendered through this ISP.

Result: Improves sRGB reconstruction quality by 1.5-2 dB PSNR across various editing conditions. When applied to metadata-assisted RAW reconstruction methods, enables fine-tuning for target edits with further gains.

Conclusion: The simple yet effective edit-aware loss function provides a general mechanism for enhancing edit fidelity and rendering flexibility across existing RAW reconstruction methods, addressing the core need for photographic editing in consumer imaging.

Abstract: Users frequently edit camera images post-capture to achieve their preferred photofinishing style. While editing in the RAW domain provides greater accuracy and flexibility, most edits are performed on the camera's display-referred output (e.g., 8-bit sRGB JPEG) since RAW images are rarely stored. Existing RAW reconstruction methods can recover RAW data from sRGB images, but these approaches are typically optimized for pixel-wise RAW reconstruction fidelity and tend to degrade under diverse rendering styles and editing operations. We introduce a plug-and-play, edit-aware loss function that can be integrated into any existing RAW reconstruction framework to make the recovered RAWs more robust to different rendering styles and edits. Our loss formulation incorporates a modular, differentiable image signal processor (ISP) that simulates realistic photofinishing pipelines with tunable parameters. During training, parameters for each ISP module are randomly sampled from carefully designed distributions that model practical variations in real camera processing. The loss is then computed in sRGB space between ground-truth and reconstructed RAWs rendered through this differentiable ISP. Incorporating our loss improves sRGB reconstruction quality by up to 1.5-2 dB PSNR across various editing conditions. Moreover, when applied to metadata-assisted RAW reconstruction methods, our approach enables fine-tuning for target edits, yielding further gains. Since photographic editing is the primary motivation for RAW reconstruction in consumer imaging, our simple yet effective loss function provides a general mechanism for enhancing edit fidelity and rendering flexibility across existing methods.

Abstract: Underwater imaging is essential for marine exploration, environmental monitoring, and infrastructure inspection. However, water causes severe image degradation through wavelength-dependent absorption and scattering, resulting in color distortion, low contrast, and haze effects. Traditional reconstruction methods and convolutional neural network-based approaches often fail to adequately address these challenges due to limited receptive fields and inability to model global dependencies.

A PatchGAN discriminator provided adversarial training to ensure high-frequency detail preservation. We trained and evaluated our model on the EUVP dataset, which contains paired underwater images of varying quality. Quantitative results demonstrate stateof-the-art performance with PSNR of 24.76 dB and SSIM of 0.89, representing significant improvements over existing methods.

Conclusion: SCAIL successfully addresses challenges in character animation by combining innovative 3D pose representation with full-context pose injection, moving the field closer to production-ready studio-grade animation quality.

Abstract: Achieving character animation that meets studio-grade production standards remains challenging despite recent progress. Existing approaches can transfer motion from a driving video to a reference image, but often fail to preserve structural fidelity and temporal consistency in wild scenarios involving complex motion and cross-identity animations. In this work, we present \textbf{SCAIL} (\textbf{S}tudio-grade \textbf{C}haracter \textbf{A}nimation via \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{L}earning), a framework designed to address these challenges from two key innovations. First, we propose a novel 3D pose representation, providing a more robust and flexible motion signal. Second, we introduce a full-context pose injection mechanism within a diffusion-transformer architecture, enabling effective spatio-temporal reasoning over full motion sequences. To align with studio-level requirements, we develop a curated data pipeline ensuring both diversity and quality, and establish a comprehensive benchmark for systematic evaluation. Experiments show that \textbf{SCAIL} achieves state-of-the-art performance and advances character animation toward studio-grade reliability and realism.

*Jiawen Yang,Yihui Cao,Xuanyu Tian,Yuyao Zhang,Hongjiang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NICE uses neural implicit representations for accurate craniofacial reconstruction and surgical outcome prediction, outperforming existing methods in orthognathic surgery planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate postoperative facial appearance prediction in orthognathic surgery is challenging due to complex nonlinear interactions between skeletal movements and facial soft tissue. Existing methods lack computational efficiency or fail to capture intricate biomechanical interactions.

Method: Neural Implicit Craniofacial Model (NICE) uses implicit neural representations with two modules: (1) shape module with region-specific implicit SDF decoders for facial surface, maxilla, and mandible reconstruction, and (2) surgery module with region-specific deformation decoders driven by shared surgical latent code to model nonlinear biomechanical responses.

Result: NICE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving prediction accuracy in critical facial regions (lips and chin) while preserving anatomical integrity, providing a clinically viable tool for surgical planning.

Conclusion: NICE offers an effective solution for accurate orthognathic surgery outcome prediction through neural implicit representations, enhancing surgical planning and patient consultation capabilities.

Abstract: Orthognathic surgery is a crucial intervention for correcting dentofacial skeletal deformities to enhance occlusal functionality and facial aesthetics. Accurate postoperative facial appearance prediction remains challenging due to the complex nonlinear interactions between skeletal movements and facial soft tissue. Existing biomechanical, parametric models and deep-learning approaches either lack computational efficiency or fail to fully capture these intricate interactions. To address these limitations, we propose Neural Implicit Craniofacial Model (NICE) which employs implicit neural representations for accurate anatomical reconstruction and surgical outcome prediction. NICE comprises a shape module, which employs region-specific implicit Signed Distance Function (SDF) decoders to reconstruct the facial surface, maxilla, and mandible, and a surgery module, which employs region-specific deformation decoders. These deformation decoders are driven by a shared surgical latent code to effectively model the complex, nonlinear biomechanical response of the facial surface to skeletal movements, incorporating anatomical prior knowledge. The deformation decoders output point-wise displacement fields, enabling precise modeling of surgical outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NICE outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, notably improving prediction accuracy in critical facial regions such as lips and chin, while robustly preserving anatomical integrity. This work provides a clinically viable tool for enhanced surgical planning and patient consultation in orthognathic procedures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: One-stage learnable-prototype framework with diversity regularization achieves SOTA WSSS performance in histopathology by addressing CAM limitations and morphological heterogeneity without costly clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current WSSS methods in histopathology suffer from inter-class homogeneity, intra-class heterogeneity, and CAM-induced region shrinkage. Two-stage clustering approaches are costly, hyperparameter-sensitive, and decouple prototype discovery from segmentation learning.

Method: Proposes a cluster-free, one-stage learnable-prototype framework with diversity regularization to enhance morphological intra-class heterogeneity coverage without separate clustering stages.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on BCSS-WSSS benchmark, outperforming prior methods in mIoU and mDice. Qualitative results show sharper boundaries, fewer mislabels, and learnable prototypes covering more diverse/complementary regions than clustering-based approaches.

Conclusion: The one-stage learnable-prototype framework with diversity regularization effectively addresses WSSS challenges in histopathology, providing superior performance and efficiency compared to two-stage clustering methods while better capturing morphological heterogeneity.

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) in histopathology reduces pixel-level labeling by learning from image-level labels, but it is hindered by inter-class homogeneity, intra-class heterogeneity, and CAM-induced region shrinkage (global pooling-based class activation maps whose activations highlight only the most distinctive areas and miss nearby class regions). Recent works address these challenges by constructing a clustering prototype bank and then refining masks in a separate stage; however, such two-stage pipelines are costly, sensitive to hyperparameters, and decouple prototype discovery from segmentation learning, limiting their effectiveness and efficiency. We propose a cluster-free, one-stage learnable-prototype framework with diversity regularization to enhance morphological intra-class heterogeneity coverage. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on BCSS-WSSS, outperforming prior methods in mIoU and mDice. Qualitative segmentation maps show sharper boundaries and fewer mislabels, and activation heatmaps further reveal that, compared with clustering-based prototypes, our learnable prototypes cover more diverse and complementary regions within each class, providing consistent qualitative evidence for their effectiveness.

TL;DR: This paper compares synthetic facial datasets generated using different techniques (diffusion models, GANs, 3D models) for facial recognition tasks, evaluating their effectiveness against real data across eight datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facial recognition faces challenges in explainability, demographic bias, privacy, robustness to variations, and dataset degradation due to privacy regulations. Synthetic data offers solutions to privacy concerns, enables controlled attribute experimentation, alleviates bias, and supplements real data.

Method: Comparative evaluation of synthetic facial datasets generated using various techniques (diffusion models, GANs, 3D models) on facial recognition tasks. Performance measured using accuracy, rank-1, rank-5, and true positive rate at false positive rate of 0.01% across eight leading datasets.

Result: Synthetic data demonstrates ability to capture realistic variations, but there remains a performance gap compared to real data. Techniques like diffusion models, GANs, and 3D models show substantial progress, though challenges persist.

Conclusion: Synthetic facial data generation is a promising solution for privacy, bias, and data augmentation challenges in facial recognition, but further research is needed to close the performance gap with real data and address remaining technical challenges.

Abstract: Facial recognition has become a widely used method for authentication and identification, with applications for secure access and locating missing persons. Its success is largely attributed to deep learning, which leverages large datasets and effective loss functions to learn discriminative features. Despite these advances, facial recognition still faces challenges in explainability, demographic bias, privacy, and robustness to aging, pose variations, lighting changes, occlusions, and facial expressions. Privacy regulations have also led to the degradation of several datasets, raising legal, ethical, and privacy concerns. Synthetic facial data generation has been proposed as a promising solution. It mitigates privacy issues, enables experimentation with controlled facial attributes, alleviates demographic bias, and provides supplementary data to improve models trained on real data. This study compares the effectiveness of synthetic facial datasets generated using different techniques in facial recognition tasks. We evaluate accuracy, rank-1, rank-5, and the true positive rate at a false positive rate of 0.01% on eight leading datasets, offering a comparative analysis not extensively explored in the literature. Results demonstrate the ability of synthetic data to capture realistic variations while emphasizing the need for further research to close the performance gap with real data. Techniques such as diffusion models, GANs, and 3D models show substantial progress; however, challenges remain.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instruction-based image editing models have high aesthetic quality but limited instruction-following capability due to inherent stochasticity and lack of deliberation. Single-turn success rates remain constrained despite supervised or reinforcement learning approaches.

Method: Proposes a deliberative editing framework with iterative Think-while-Edit cycles: Critiquing results, Refining instructions, and Repeating generation. Trains a single MLLM (EditThinker) as reasoning engine to produce critique scores, reasoning processes, and refined instructions. Uses reinforcement learning to align thinking with editing for targeted instruction improvements.

Conclusion: The deliberative editing framework with EditThinker effectively addresses instruction-following challenges in image editing by simulating human cognitive loops, with plans to release data construction framework, datasets, and models to benefit the community.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has emerged as a prominent research area, which, benefiting from image generation foundation models, have achieved high aesthetic quality, making instruction-following capability the primary challenge. Existing approaches improve instruction adherence via supervised or reinforcement learning, yet single-turn success rates remain limited due to inherent stochasticity and a lack of deliberation. In this work, we propose a deliberative editing framework to 'think' while they edit, which simulates the human cognitive loop by iteratively executing a Think-while-Edit cycle: Critiquing results and Refining instructions , followed by Repeating the generation until satisfactory. Specifically, we train a single MLLM, EditThinker, to act as the reasoning engine of this framework, which jointly produce the critique score, reasoning process, and refined instructions. We employ reinforcement learning to align the EditThinker's thinking with its editing, thereby generating more targeted instruction improvements. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the instruction-following capability of any image editing model by a large margin. We will release our data construction framework, datasets, and models to benefit the community.

TL;DR: A passive wake vectoring mechanism recovers lost thrust during aerial robot morphing, enabling up to 40% vertical thrust recovery without electronics or added mechanical complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Morphing aerial robots need to maintain stability and control during mid-flight reconfiguration, but tilting propulsors reduces vertical thrust, undermining flight capabilities.

Method: Developed internal deflectors that passively intercept and redirect rotor wake downward, steering airflow momentum that would otherwise be wasted. Integrated this into the Aerially Transforming Morphobot (ATMO) system.

Result: Achieved up to 40% recovery of vertical thrust in configurations where no useful thrust would otherwise be produced, substantially extending hover and maneuvering capabilities during transformation.

Conclusion: Passive aerodynamic structures inspired by thrust vectoring in rockets and aircraft enable efficient, agile flight for morphing aerial robots without added mechanical complexity, opening new design directions.

Abstract: Morphing aerial robots have the potential to transform autonomous flight, enabling navigation through cluttered environments, perching, and seamless transitions between aerial and terrestrial locomotion. Yet mid-flight reconfiguration presents a critical aerodynamic challenge: tilting propulsors to achieve shape change reduces vertical thrust, undermining stability and control authority. Here, we introduce a passive wake vectoring mechanism that recovers lost thrust during morphing. Integrated into a novel robotic system, Aerially Transforming Morphobot (ATMO), internal deflectors intercept and redirect rotor wake downward, passively steering airflow momentum that would otherwise be wasted. This electronics-free solution achieves up to a 40% recovery of vertical thrust in configurations where no useful thrust would otherwise be produced, substantially extending hover and maneuvering capabilities during transformation. Our findings highlight a new direction for morphing aerial robot design, where passive aerodynamic structures, inspired by thrust vectoring in rockets and aircraft, enable efficient, agile flight without added mechanical complexity.

*Yanis Lahrach,Christian Hughes,Ian Abraham*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a scale-agnostic ergodic coverage planning method using MMD metric with adaptive scaling and log-space conditioning to handle numerical instability in geometric coverage problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ergodic coverage planning methods are sensitive to numerical scaling and become brittle/unstable with changing scales, especially under nonlinear constraints, limiting their practical applicability.

Method: Develops a scale-agnostic adaptive ergodic coverage optimization based on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) metric. The approach solves for scale of differential constraints while annealing hyperparameters, and derives a log-space variation of the ergodic metric for better numerical conditioning.

Result: The method is compared with existing coverage planning approaches and demonstrates utility across a wide range of coverage problems with improved stability and adaptability.

Conclusion: The proposed scale-agnostic MMD-based approach successfully addresses numerical instability in ergodic coverage planning, enabling robust performance across varying scales and constraints while maintaining physical consistency.

Abstract: Recent methods in ergodic coverage planning have shown promise as tools that can adapt to a wide range of geometric coverage problems with general constraints, but are highly sensitive to the numerical scaling of the problem space. The underlying challenge is that the optimization formulation becomes brittle and numerically unstable with changing scales, especially under potentially nonlinear constraints that impose dynamic restrictions, due to the kernel-based formulation. This paper proposes to address this problem via the development of a scale-agnostic and adaptive ergodic coverage optimization method based on the maximum mean discrepancy metric (MMD). Our approach allows the optimizer to solve for the scale of differential constraints while annealing the hyperparameters to best suit the problem domain and ensure physical consistency. We also derive a variation of the ergodic metric in the log space, providing additional numerical conditioning without loss of performance. We compare our approach with existing coverage planning methods and demonstrate the utility of our approach on a wide range of coverage problems.

*Jonathan Yang,Chelsea Finn,Dorsa Sadigh*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Co-training robotic policies with synthetic visual data using auxiliary tasks improves generalization to observational variations like camera viewpoint, lighting, and distractors by 18% over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large-scale robotic policies lack robustness to observational variations (camera perspective, lighting, distractors) due to limited diversity in training data and scarcity of rich robotic datasets covering these variations.

Method: Introduce two auxiliary tasks: state similarity and invariance to observational perturbations. Co-train policies using both expensive robotic demonstration data and inexpensive synthetic visual data from non-physics-based simulation (e.g., Unreal Engine).

Result: Co-training on diverse synthetic and real data substantially improves generalization to unseen camera viewpoints, lighting configurations, and distractor conditions, achieving 18% performance improvement over existing generative augmentation methods.

Conclusion: Systematically leveraging auxiliary tasks with diverse visual data from simulations enables more robust robotic policies that generalize better across challenging observational variations.

Abstract: Reasoning from diverse observations is a fundamental capability for generalist robot policies to operate in a wide range of environments. Despite recent advancements, many large-scale robotic policies still remain sensitive to key sources of observational variation such as changes in camera perspective, lighting, and the presence of distractor objects. We posit that the limited generalizability of these models arises from the substantial diversity required to robustly cover these quasistatic axes, coupled with the current scarcity of large-scale robotic datasets that exhibit rich variation across them. In this work, we propose to systematically examine what robots need to generalize across these challenging axes by introducing two key auxiliary tasks, state similarity and invariance to observational perturbations, applied to both demonstration data and static visual data. We then show that via these auxiliary tasks, leveraging both more-expensive robotic demonstration data and less-expensive, visually rich synthetic images generated from non-physics-based simulation (for example, Unreal Engine) can lead to substantial increases in generalization to unseen camera viewpoints, lighting configurations, and distractor conditions. Our results demonstrate that co-training on this diverse data improves performance by 18 percent over existing generative augmentation methods.

Abstract: As mobile robots increasingly operate alongside humans in shared workspaces, ensuring safe, efficient, and interpretable Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has become a pressing challenge. While substantial progress has been devoted to human behavior prediction, limited attention has been paid to how humans perceive, interpret, and trust robots' inferences, impeding deployment in safety-critical and socially embedded environments. This paper presents XR-DT, an eXtended Reality-enhanced Digital Twin framework for agentic mobile robots, that bridges physical and virtual spaces to enable bi-directional understanding between humans and robots. Our hierarchical XR-DT architecture integrates virtual-, augmented-, and mixed-reality layers, fusing real-time sensor data, simulated environments in the Unity game engine, and human feedback captured through wearable AR devices. Within this framework, we design an agentic mobile robot system with a unified diffusion policy for context-aware task adaptation. We further propose a chain-of-thought prompting mechanism that allows multimodal large language models to reason over human instructions and environmental context, while leveraging an AutoGen-based multi-agent coordination layer to enhance robustness and collaboration in dynamic tasks. Initial experimental results demonstrate accurate human and robot trajectory prediction, validating the XR-DT framework's effectiveness in HRI tasks. By embedding human intention, environmental dynamics, and robot cognition into the XR-DT framework, our system enables interpretable, trustworthy, and adaptive HRI.

TL;DR: Combines disturbance rejection control and robust control barrier functions for safe, high-performance tracking of industrial manipulators with unmodifiable inner-loop controllers and model uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial robotic systems often have closed, unmodifiable inner-loop torque controllers while exposing outer-loop controllers to users. There's a need for easily integrated add-ons that handle imperfect inner-loop controllers and significant dynamic model uncertainty while ensuring safety and performance.

Method: Develops an outer-loop add-on combining disturbance rejection control (for tracking) with robust control barrier functions (for safety). The approach handles uncertain inner-loop controllers and dynamic models through robust control techniques.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in implementation simplicity, robustness, tracking precision, and safety compared to state-of-the-art methods. Hardware experiments with a PUMA robotic manipulator validate the approach.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an effective solution for safe, high-performance control of industrial manipulators with unmodifiable inner-loop controllers and model uncertainty, offering formal safety guarantees and practical implementation benefits.

Abstract: In commercial robotic systems, it is common to encounter a closed inner-loop torque controller that is not user-modifiable. However, the outer-loop controller, which sends kinematic commands such as position or velocity for the inner-loop controller to track, is typically exposed to users. In this work, we focus on the development of an easily integrated add-on at the outer-loop layer by combining disturbance rejection control and robust control barrier function for high-performance tracking and safe control of the whole dynamic system of an industrial manipulator. This is particularly beneficial when 1) the inner-loop controller is imperfect, unmodifiable, and uncertain; and 2) the dynamic model exhibits significant uncertainty. Stability analysis, formal safety guarantee proof, and hardware experiments with a PUMA robotic manipulator are presented. Our solution demonstrates superior performance in terms of simplicity of implementation, robustness, tracking precision, and safety compared to the state of the art.

Conclusion: The system provides a practical, GNSS-independent solution for seabed-to-sky mapping that operates in real-time and handles both above-water and underwater environments consistently.

Abstract: Critical maritime infrastructure increasingly demands situational awareness both above and below the surface, yet existing ''seabed-to-sky'' mapping pipelines either rely on GNSS (vulnerable to shadowing/spoofing) or expensive bathymetric sonars. We present a unified, GNSS-independent mapping system that fuses LiDAR-IMU with a dual, orthogonally mounted Forward Looking Sonars (FLS) to generate consistent seabed-to-sky maps from an Autonomous Surface Vehicle. On the acoustic side, we extend orthogonal wide-aperture fusion to handle arbitrary inter-sonar translations (enabling heterogeneous, non-co-located models) and extract a leading edge from each FLS to form line-scans. On the mapping side, we modify LIO-SAM to ingest both stereo-derived 3D sonar points and leading-edge line-scans at and between keyframes via motion-interpolated poses, allowing sparse acoustic updates to contribute continuously to a single factor-graph map.

Motivation: Address visual domain transfer for end-to-end imitation learning in realistic settings where target-domain data is off-policy, expert-free, and scarce - common practical challenges in real-world deployment.

Method: Propose State-Conditional Adversarial Learning (SCAL), an off-policy adversarial framework that aligns latent distributions conditioned on system state using a discriminator-based estimator of the conditional KL divergence between source and target observation models.

Result: Experiments on visually diverse autonomous driving environments (BARC-CARLA simulator) show SCAL achieves robust transfer and strong sample efficiency.

Conclusion: SCAL provides an effective solution for visual domain transfer in challenging real-world imitation learning scenarios with limited target data.

Abstract: We study visual domain transfer for end-to-end imitation learning in a realistic and challenging setting where target-domain data are strictly off-policy, expert-free, and scarce. We first provide a theoretical analysis showing that the target-domain imitation loss can be upper bounded by the source-domain loss plus a state-conditional latent KL divergence between source and target observation models. Guided by this result, we propose State- Conditional Adversarial Learning, an off-policy adversarial framework that aligns latent distributions conditioned on system state using a discriminator-based estimator of the conditional KL term. Experiments on visually diverse autonomous driving environments built on the BARC-CARLA simulator demonstrate that SCAL achieves robust transfer and strong sample efficiency.

Result: Controller is computationally efficient, robust to disturbances and model uncertainties, requires no model approximations or online optimization. Validated through simulations showing superior robustness, accuracy, and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The STT-based framework provides a formally guaranteed solution for T-RAS specifications with practical advantages of computational efficiency and robustness, making it suitable for real-time robotic applications with dynamic uncertainties.

Abstract: This paper presents a Spatiotemporal Tube (STT)-based control framework for differential-drive mobile robots with dynamic uncertainties and external disturbances, guaranteeing the satisfaction of Temporal Reach-Avoid-Stay (T-RAS) specifications. The approach employs circular STT, characterized by smoothly time-varying center and radius, to define dynamic safe corridors that guide the robot from the start region to the goal while avoiding obstacles. In particular, we first develop a sampling-based synthesis algorithm to construct a feasible STT that satisfies the prescribed timing and safety constraints with formal guarantees. To ensure that the robot remains confined within this tube, we then design analytically a closed-form, approximation-free control law. The resulting controller is computationally efficient, robust to disturbances and {model uncertainties}, and requires no model approximations or online optimization. The proposed framework is validated through simulation studies on a differential-drive robot and benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior robustness, accuracy, and computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Battery recycling is critical due to growing battery usage and limited resources. Rising energy densities create safety hazards (fires) during recycling. Existing AI-based detection systems (X-ray/RGB) haven't achieved fully autonomous battery sorting across diverse WEEE types.

Method: Integrates specialized X-ray transmission dual-energy imaging with advanced pre-processing for high-contrast reconstruction. Uses YOLO for detection and U-Net for segmentation of battery-containing items on conveyor belt. Intelligent tracking/position estimation guides Delta robot with suction gripper for selective extraction.

Result: System validated in photorealistic NVIDIA Isaac Sim simulation environment and on real physical setup.

Conclusion: Presents a novel integrated approach for autonomous battery identification and sorting in WEEE recycling, addressing safety hazards and resource limitations through advanced imaging and robotics.

Abstract: Battery recycling is becoming increasingly critical due to the rapid growth in battery usage and the limited availability of natural resources. Moreover, as battery energy densities continue to rise, improper handling during recycling poses significant safety hazards, including potential fires at recycling facilities. Numerous systems have been proposed for battery detection and removal from WEEE recycling lines, including X-ray and RGB-based visual inspection methods, typically driven by AI-powered object detection models (e.g., Mask R-CNN, YOLO, ResNets). Despite advances in optimizing detection techniques and model modifications, a fully autonomous solution capable of accurately identifying and sorting batteries across diverse WEEEs types has yet to be realized. In response to these challenges, we present our novel approach which integrates a specialized X-ray transmission dual energy imaging subsystem with advanced pre-processing algorithms, enabling high-contrast image reconstruction for effective differentiation of dense and thin materials in WEEE. Devices move along a conveyor belt through a high-resolution X-ray imaging system, where YOLO and U-Net models precisely detect and segment battery-containing items. An intelligent tracking and position estimation algorithm then guides a Delta robot equipped with a suction gripper to selectively extract and properly discard the targeted devices. The approach is validated in a photorealistic simulation environment developed in NVIDIA Isaac Sim and on the real setup.

TL;DR: A scenario-aware uncertainty quantification framework for autonomous driving trajectory prediction that provides prediction intervals and reliability assessment using conformal calibration and trajectory segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning trajectory predictors lack uncertainty-aware frameworks adaptable to heterogeneous real-world scenarios, which is crucial for safety-critical autonomous driving systems.

Method: 1) Project trajectories onto map-derived reference routes using Frenet coordinates; 2) Use CopulaCPTS conformal calibration to generate temporal prediction intervals for different scenarios; 3) Develop trajectory reliability discriminator (TRD) analyzing mean error and calibrated confidence intervals; 4) Create risk-aware discriminator integrating longitudinal/lateral prediction intervals to identify critical points and segment trajectories.

Result: The framework was evaluated on the real-world nuPlan dataset and demonstrated effectiveness in scenario-aware uncertainty quantification and reliability assessment across diverse driving contexts.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides actionable reliability results for downstream planning modules by enabling segmentation of trajectories into reliable and unreliable segments through scenario-aware uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification in trajectory prediction is crucial for safety-critical autonomous driving systems, yet existing deep learning predictors lack uncertainty-aware frameworks adaptable to heterogeneous real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel scenario-aware uncertainty quantification framework to provide the predicted trajectories with prediction intervals and reliability assessment. To begin with, predicted trajectories from the trained predictor and their ground truth are projected onto the map-derived reference routes within the Frenet coordinate system. We then employ CopulaCPTS as the conformal calibration method to generate temporal prediction intervals for distinct scenarios as the uncertainty measure. Building upon this, within the proposed trajectory reliability discriminator (TRD), mean error and calibrated confidence intervals are synergistically analyzed to establish reliability models for different scenarios. Subsequently, the risk-aware discriminator leverages a joint risk model that integrates longitudinal and lateral prediction intervals within the Frenet coordinate to identify critical points. This enables segmentation of trajectories into reliable and unreliable segments, holding the advantage of informing downstream planning modules with actionable reliability results. We evaluated our framework using the real-world nuPlan dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in scenario-aware uncertainty quantification and reliability assessment across diverse driving contexts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models for embodied intelligence need large-scale robot demonstration data, but existing methods struggle with heterogeneity across embodiments, action spaces, sensor configurations, and control frequencies, limiting generalization to new settings.

Method: Proposes HiMoE-VLA with Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts architecture for the action module that adaptively handles multiple heterogeneity sources across layers and gradually abstracts them into shared knowledge representations.

Conclusion: HiMoE-VLA effectively handles diverse robotic data heterogeneity and enables better generalization, with code and models publicly available for community use.

Abstract: The development of foundation models for embodied intelligence critically depends on access to large-scale, high-quality robot demonstration data. Recent approaches have sought to address this challenge by training on large collections of heterogeneous robotic datasets. However, unlike vision or language data, robotic demonstrations exhibit substantial heterogeneity across embodiments and action spaces as well as other prominent variations such as senor configurations and action control frequencies. The lack of explicit designs for handling such heterogeneity causes existing methods to struggle with integrating diverse factors, thereby limiting their generalization and leading to degraded performance when transferred to new settings. In this paper, we present HiMoE-VLA, a novel vision-language-action (VLA) framework tailored to effectively handle diverse robotic data with heterogeneity. Specifically, we introduce a Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts (HiMoE) architecture for the action module which adaptively handles multiple sources of heterogeneity across layers and gradually abstracts them into shared knowledge representations. Through extensive experimentation with simulation benchmarks and real-world robotic platforms, HiMoE-VLA demonstrates a consistent performance boost over existing VLA baselines, achieving higher accuracy and robust generalization across diverse robots and action spaces.

TL;DR: Differentiable rendering framework enables CT-free 3D path planning for robot-assisted vertebroplasty using only 2D X-rays, outperforming baselines in reconstruction and planning success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic surgical path planning requires registration of intraoperative 2D images with preoperative 3D CT scans, which is burdensome and costly, especially in procedures like vertebroplasty where preoperative CT scans are not routinely performed.

Method: Differentiable rendering-based framework integrates with vertebral atlas from Statistical Shape Model (SSM) and uses learned similarity loss to dynamically refine SSM shape and pose from bi-planar 2D X-rays, independent of fixed imaging geometries.

Result: Outperformed normalized cross-correlation baseline in reconstruction (DICE: 0.75 vs 0.65), comparable to state-of-the-art ReVerteR (DICE: 0.77) with generalization to arbitrary views. Bipedicular planning success: 82% synthetic, 75% cadaver data, exceeding 2D-to-3D baseline (66% and 31%).

Conclusion: Framework enables versatile, CT-free 3D path planning for robot-assisted vertebroplasty, effectively accommodating real-world imaging diversity without preoperative CT scans.

Abstract: Robotic systems are transforming image-guided interventions by enhancing accuracy and minimizing radiation exposure. A significant challenge in robotic assistance lies in surgical path planning, which often relies on the registration of intraoperative 2D images with preoperative 3D CT scans. This requirement can be burdensome and costly, particularly in procedures like vertebroplasty, where preoperative CT scans are not routinely performed. To address this issue, we introduce a differentiable rendering-based framework for 3D transpedicular path planning utilizing bi-planar 2D X-rays. Our method integrates differentiable rendering with a vertebral atlas generated through a Statistical Shape Model (SSM) and employs a learned similarity loss to refine the SSM shape and pose dynamically, independent of fixed imaging geometries. We evaluated our framework in two stages: first, through vertebral reconstruction from orthogonal X-rays for benchmarking, and second, via clinician-in-the-loop path planning using arbitrary-view X-rays. Our results indicate that our method outperformed a normalized cross-correlation baseline in reconstruction metrics (DICE: 0.75 vs. 0.65) and achieved comparable performance to the state-of-the-art model ReVerteR (DICE: 0.77), while maintaining generalization to arbitrary views. Success rates for bipedicular planning reached 82% with synthetic data and 75% with cadaver data, exceeding the 66% and 31% rates of a 2D-to-3D baseline, respectively. In conclusion, our framework facilitates versatile, CT-free 3D path planning for robot-assisted vertebroplasty, effectively accommodating real-world imaging diversity without the need for preoperative CT scans.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to compute safe invariant subsets that capture both asymptotic stability and state-safety bounds along trajectories for vehicle-with-driver systems, supporting real-time safety assessment for active vehicle control.

Method: Original iterative Sum-of-Squares (SOS) procedure to optimize Lyapunov functions, with polynomial approximation of nonlinear vehicle model and operating-envelope constraints. Validated on 2-state benchmark and applied to 7-state vehicle-with-driver system with delayed preview-tracking driver model.

Result: Method accurately recovers prescribed safe region in benchmark case. For vehicle system, estimated safe sets compare well with reference boundaries from exhaustive simulations, showing SOS techniques can efficiently deliver Lyapunov-defined safe regions.

Conclusion: SOS techniques can efficiently compute safe invariant subsets for complex vehicle systems, supporting potential use for real-time safety assessment as supervisory layer for active vehicle control.

Abstract: This work estimates safe invariant subsets of the Region of Attraction (ROA) for a seven-state vehicle-with-driver system, capturing both asymptotic stability and the influence of state-safety bounds along the system trajectory. Safe sets are computed by optimizing Lyapunov functions through an original iterative Sum-of-Squares (SOS) procedure. The method is first demonstrated on a two-state benchmark, where it accurately recovers a prescribed safe region as the 1-level set of a polynomial Lyapunov function. We then describe the distinguishing characteristics of the studied vehicle-with-driver system: the control dynamics mimic human driver behavior through a delayed preview-tracking model that, with suitable parameter choices, can also emulate digital controllers. To enable SOS optimization, a polynomial approximation of the nonlinear vehicle model is derived, together with its operating-envelope constraints. The framework is then applied to understeering and oversteering scenarios, and the estimated safe sets are compared with reference boundaries obtained from exhaustive simulations. The results show that SOS techniques can efficiently deliver Lyapunov-defined safe regions, supporting their potential use for real-time safety assessment, for example as a supervisory layer for active vehicle control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for scalable multi-agent driving simulation that balances computational efficiency with realistic behavior modeling for traffic participants.

Method: Instance-centric scene representation with local coordinate frames, query-centric symmetric context encoder with relative positional encodings, and Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning with adaptive reward transformation.

Result: Approach scales efficiently with token count, reduces training/inference times, and outperforms agent-centric baselines in positional accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed instance-centric framework enables efficient, realistic multi-agent driving simulation that scales well while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Scalable multi-agent driving simulation requires behavior models that are both realistic and computationally efficient. We address this by optimizing the behavior model that controls individual traffic participants. To improve efficiency, we adopt an instance-centric scene representation, where each traffic participant and map element is modeled in its own local coordinate frame. This design enables efficient, viewpoint-invariant scene encoding and allows static map tokens to be reused across simulation steps. To model interactions, we employ a query-centric symmetric context encoder with relative positional encodings between local frames. We use Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning to learn the behavior model and propose an adaptive reward transformation that automatically balances robustness and realism during training. Experiments demonstrate that our approach scales efficiently with the number of tokens, significantly reducing training and inference times, while outperforming several agent-centric baselines in terms of positional accuracy and robustness.

Motivation: Enable simultaneous conflict-free collaboration of multiple UAVs for aerial 3D printing by addressing coordination challenges, task dependencies, safety constraints, and resource limitations.

Method: Formulates optimization problem for task assignment and scheduling with geometric dependencies, proposes importance prioritization for faster computation, uses utility maximization to determine optimal UAV count, and implements conflict-free execution through dynamic timing/location selection.

Result: Framework evaluated through Gazebo-based simulation with mission control module coordinating UAVs based on optimal scheduling while respecting material and battery constraints.

Conclusion: Proposed framework effectively enables multiple UAVs to collaboratively perform aerial 3D printing with optimized coordination, safety, and resource management.

Abstract: This article presents a novel coordination and task-planning framework to enable the simultaneous conflict-free collaboration of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for aerial 3D printing. The proposed framework formulates an optimization problem that takes a construction mission divided into sub-tasks and a team of autonomous UAVs, along with limited volume and battery. It generates an optimal mission plan comprising task assignments and scheduling while accounting for task dependencies arising from the geometric and structural requirements of the 3D design, inter-UAV safety constraints, material usage, and total flight time of each UAV. The potential conflicts occurring during the simultaneous operation of the UAVs are addressed at a segment level by dynamically selecting the starting time and location of each task to guarantee collision-free parallel execution. An importance prioritization is proposed to accelerate the computation by guiding the solution toward more important tasks. Additionally, a utility maximization formulation is proposed to dynamically determine the optimal number of UAVs required for a given mission, balancing the trade-off between minimizing makespan and the deployment of excess agents. The proposed framework's effectiveness is evaluated through a Gazebo-based simulation setup, where agents are coordinated by a mission control module allocating the printing tasks based on the generated optimal scheduling plan while remaining within the material and battery constraints of each UAV.

Method: Uses physically based rendering in near-infrared domain with single-bounce reflections and retroreflections over rasterized images. Models beam steering patterns with non-vanishing diameter. Parameters determined systematically through optical laboratory measurements using goniometer at 0.01° resolution to measure beam patterns on different target surfaces.

Result: Successfully calibrated and tested on two different automotive LiDAR systems (Valeo Scala Gen. 2 and Blickfeld Cube 1) with notably different properties and interfaces, demonstrating the model's ability to extract relevant parameters across diverse systems.

Conclusion: The proposed analytic model provides a systematic approach for simulating automotive ToF LiDAR with realistic effects, validated through laboratory measurements and applicable to different LiDAR systems despite their varying properties.

Abstract: We present an analytic model for simulating automotive time-of-flight (ToF) LiDAR that includes blooming, echo pulse width, and ambient light, along with steps to determine model parameters systematically through optical laboratory measurements. The model uses physically based rendering (PBR) in the near-infrared domain. It assumes single-bounce reflections and retroreflections over rasterized rendered images from shading or ray tracing, including light emitted from the sensor as well as stray light from other, non-correlated sources such as sunlight. Beams from the sensor and sensitivity of the receiving diodes are modeled with flexible beam steering patterns and with non-vanishing diameter.
  Different (all non-real time) computational approaches can be chosen based on system properties, computing capabilities, and desired output properties.
  Model parameters include system-specific properties, namely the physical spread of the LiDAR beam, combined with the sensitivity of the receiving diode; the intensity of the emitted light; the conversion between the intensity of reflected light and the echo pulse width; and scenario parameters such as environment lighting, positioning, and surface properties of the target(s) in the relevant infrared domain. System-specific properties of the model are determined from laboratory measurements of the photometric luminance on different target surfaces aligned with a goniometer at 0.01° resolution, which marks the best available resolution for measuring the beam pattern.
  The approach is calibrated for and tested on two automotive LiDAR systems, the Valeo Scala Gen. 2 and the Blickfeld Cube 1. Both systems differ notably in their properties and available interfaces, but the relevant model parameters could be extracted successfully.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visuomotor control methods often assume fixed task representations with uniform spatial and temporal granularity, limiting flexibility for different user intents and task requirements. There's a need for more adaptable task representations that can handle variable specifications.

Method: COIL uses a correspondence-oriented task representation where tasks are defined by intended motion of keypoints on objects. It employs a conditional policy with spatio-temporal attention to fuse multiple input modalities, trained via scalable self-supervised pipeline using simulation demonstrations with automatically generated correspondence labels.

Result: COIL achieves superior performance compared to prior methods on real-world manipulation tasks under both sparse and dense specifications, demonstrating generalization across tasks, objects, and motion patterns.

Conclusion: The correspondence-oriented approach with flexible spatial and temporal granularity provides an effective framework for visuomotor control that adapts to different task requirements and user intents, enabling robust manipulation across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce Correspondence-Oriented Imitation Learning (COIL), a conditional policy learning framework for visuomotor control with a flexible task representation in 3D. At the core of our approach, each task is defined by the intended motion of keypoints selected on objects in the scene. Instead of assuming a fixed number of keypoints or uniformly spaced time intervals, COIL supports task specifications with variable spatial and temporal granularity, adapting to different user intents and task requirements. To robustly ground this correspondence-oriented task representation into actions, we design a conditional policy with a spatio-temporal attention mechanism that effectively fuses information across multiple input modalities. The policy is trained via a scalable self-supervised pipeline using demonstrations collected in simulation, with correspondence labels automatically generated in hindsight. COIL generalizes across tasks, objects, and motion patterns, achieving superior performance compared to prior methods on real-world manipulation tasks under both sparse and dense specifications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models lack physical understanding due to training on static data without causal interactions, making them unsuitable for fine-grained robotic manipulation tasks requiring physical reasoning and action planning.

Method: SIMPACT is a test-time, simulation-enabled action planning framework that constructs physics simulations from single RGB-D observations, allowing VLMs to propose actions, observe simulated rollouts, and iteratively refine reasoning through simulation-in-the-loop world modeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on five challenging real-world rigid-body and deformable manipulation tasks requiring fine-grained physical reasoning, outperforming existing general-purpose robotic manipulation models.

Conclusion: Embedding physics understanding via efficient simulation into VLM reasoning at test time offers a promising path toward generalizable embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable common-sense and semantic reasoning capabilities. However, they lack a grounded understanding of physical dynamics. This limitation arises from training VLMs on static internet-scale visual-language data that contain no causal interactions or action-conditioned changes. Consequently, it remains challenging to leverage VLMs for fine-grained robotic manipulation tasks that require physical understanding, reasoning, and corresponding action planning. To overcome this, we present SIMPACT, a test-time, SIMulation-enabled ACTion Planning framework that equips VLMs with physical reasoning through simulation-in-the-loop world modeling, without requiring any additional training. From a single RGB-D observation, SIMPACT efficiently constructs physics simulations, enabling the VLM to propose informed actions, observe simulated rollouts, and iteratively refine its reasoning. By integrating language reasoning with physics prediction, our simulation-enabled VLM can understand contact dynamics and action outcomes in a physically grounded way. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on five challenging, real-world rigid-body and deformable manipulation tasks that require fine-grained physical reasoning, outperforming existing general-purpose robotic manipulation models. Our results demonstrate that embedding physics understanding via efficient simulation into VLM reasoning at test time offers a promising path towards generalizable embodied intelligence.

*Kevin Black,Allen Z. Ren,Michael Equi,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Training-time real-time chunking (RTC) replaces inference-time inpainting with simulated delay conditioning, reducing computational overhead while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference-time inpainting in real-time chunking for vision-language-action models introduces computational overhead that increases latency, making real-time robot control less efficient.

Method: Simulate inference delay at training time and condition on action prefixes directly instead of using inference-time inpainting. This requires no architecture changes and minimal code modifications.

Result: Training-time RTC outperforms inference-time RTC at higher inference delays in simulations. Real-world experiments on box building and espresso making tasks show maintained performance and speed parity with lower computational cost.

Conclusion: Training-time action conditioning is a practical drop-in replacement for inference-time inpainting in real-time robot control, offering computational efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Real-time chunking (RTC) enables vision-language-action models (VLAs) to generate smooth, reactive robot trajectories by asynchronously predicting action chunks and conditioning on previously committed actions via inference-time inpainting. However, this inpainting method introduces computational overhead that increases inference latency. In this work, we propose a simple alternative: simulating inference delay at training time and conditioning on action prefixes directly, eliminating any inference-time overhead. Our method requires no modifications to the model architecture or robot runtime, and can be implemented with only a few additional lines of code. In simulated experiments, we find that training-time RTC outperforms inference-time RTC at higher inference delays. In real-world experiments on box building and espresso making tasks with the $π_{0.6}$ VLA, we demonstrate that training-time RTC maintains both task performance and speed parity with inference-time RTC while being computationally cheaper. Our results suggest that training-time action conditioning is a practical drop-in replacement for inference-time inpainting in real-time robot control.

TL;DR: LLM-powered chatbot helps SMEs capture tacit shop-floor knowledge and convert it into BPMN diagrams through conversational interviews, enabling rapid process documentation at low cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMEs rely heavily on undocumented tacit knowledge that doesn't get formalized into process documentation, creating barriers to knowledge preservation, operational transparency, and continuous improvement.

Method: Developed an LLM-driven conversational assistant using Gemini 2.5 Pro with Gradio front-end and bpmn-js visualization that conducts interview-style dialogues to elicit process details, supports clarifying questions, and renders live BPMN 2.0 diagrams.

Result: Proof-of-concept evaluation in equipment-maintenance scenario showed the chatbot produced accurate AS-IS models, flagged issues via annotations, generated improved TO-BE variants within ~12 minutes, while keeping API costs SME-friendly.

Conclusion: Conversational LLMs can lower skill and cost barriers to rigorous process documentation, helping SMEs preserve institutional knowledge, enhance operational transparency, and accelerate continuous improvement efforts.

Abstract: Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) still depend heavily on tacit, experience-based know-how that rarely makes its way into formal documentation. This paper introduces a large-language-model (LLM)-driven conversational assistant that captures such knowledge on the shop floor and converts it incrementally and interactively into standards-compliant Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0 diagrams. Powered by Gemini 2.5 Pro and delivered through a lightweight Gradio front-end with client-side bpmn-js visualisation, the assistant conducts an interview-style dialogue: it elicits process details, supports clarifying dialogue and on-demand analysis, and renders live diagrams that users can refine in real time. A proof-of-concept evaluation in an equipment-maintenance scenario shows that the chatbot produced an accurate "AS-IS" model, flagged issues via on-diagram annotations, and generated an improved "TO-BE" variant, all within about 12-minutes, while keeping API costs within an SME-friendly budget. The study analyses latency sources, model-selection trade-offs, and the challenges of enforcing strict XML schemas, then outlines a roadmap toward agentic and multimodal deployments. The results demonstrate that conversational LLMs can potentially be used to lower the skill and cost barriers to rigorous process documentation, helping SMEs preserve institutional knowledge, enhance operational transparency, and accelerate continuous-improvement efforts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating faithfulness of LLMs to given tasks is complex, and there's a need for unsupervised metrics that can assess how well LLMs stay faithful to provided context without requiring labeled data.

Method: Models LLMs as bipartite information engines where hidden layers act as Maxwell demons. Treats QCA triplets as probability distributions over topics, with transformations from context to query and answer modeled as transition matrices. Uses KL divergence between these matrices to compute semantic faithfulness via convex optimization, and proposes thermodynamics-based semantic entropy production metric.

Result: Developed two metrics: semantic faithfulness (SF) quantifies faithfulness on [0,1] scale, and semantic entropy production (SEP) measures entropy in answer generation. High faithfulness correlates with low entropy production. Demonstrated framework on LLM summarization of SEC 10-K filings.

Conclusion: Proposed unsupervised SF and SEP metrics provide effective tools for evaluating LLM faithfulness and controlling hallucinations, applicable to tasks like document summarization where faithfulness to source material is critical.

Abstract: Evaluating faithfulness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to a given task is a complex challenge. We propose two new unsupervised metrics for faithfulness evaluation using insights from information theory and thermodynamics. Our approach treats an LLM as a bipartite information engine where hidden layers act as a Maxwell demon controlling transformations of context $C $ into answer $A$ via prompt $Q$. We model Question-Context-Answer (QCA) triplets as probability distributions over shared topics. Topic transformations from $C$ to $Q$ and $A$ are modeled as transition matrices ${\bf Q}$ and ${\bf A}$ encoding the query goal and actual result, respectively. Our semantic faithfulness (SF) metric quantifies faithfulness for any given QCA triplet by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between these matrices. Both matrices are inferred simultaneously via convex optimization of this KL divergence, and the final SF metric is obtained by mapping the minimal divergence onto the unit interval [0,1], where higher scores indicate greater faithfulness. Furthermore, we propose a thermodynamics-based semantic entropy production (SEP) metric in answer generation, and show that high faithfulness generally implies low entropy production. The SF and SEP metrics can be used jointly or separately for LLM evaluation and hallucination control. We demonstrate our framework on LLM summarization of corporate SEC 10-K filings.

*Georgios Mappouras,Charalambos Rossides*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proves that no algorithm can demonstrate truly new functional capabilities, only combinations of existing ones, thus establishing fundamental limits on AI creativity and AGI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the upper bounds of AI and any machine-computable process in achieving human-level intelligence (AGI), specifically addressing whether algorithms can be truly creative and innovative.

Method: Borrows prior work's definition of AGI as the ability to be creative and innovate in a field to unlock new functional capabilities. Uses formal proof to demonstrate that no algorithm can generate capabilities beyond what was initially present in itself.

Result: Formally proves that algorithms cannot demonstrate truly new functional capabilities, only existing ones or combinations/permutations thereof. This establishes fundamental computational limits on creativity and innovation.

Conclusion: AI models cannot achieve true creativity or AGI as defined, only demonstrate existing capabilities in new combinations. This has significant implications for AI development and raises questions about the origins of human intelligence.

Abstract: In recent years we observed rapid and significant advancements in artificial intelligence (A.I.). So much so that many wonder how close humanity is to developing an A.I. model that can achieve human level of intelligence, also known as artificial general intelligence (A.G.I.). In this work we look at this question and we attempt to define the upper bounds, not just of A.I., but rather of any machine-computable process (a.k.a. an algorithm). To answer this question however, one must first precisely define A.G.I. We borrow prior work's definition of A.G.I. [1] that best describes the sentiment of the term, as used by the leading developers of A.I. That is, the ability to be creative and innovate in some field of study in a way that unlocks new and previously unknown functional capabilities in that field. Based on this definition we draw new bounds on the limits of computation. We formally prove that no algorithm can demonstrate new functional capabilities that were not already present in the initial algorithm itself. Therefore, no algorithm (and thus no A.I. model) can be truly creative in any field of study, whether that is science, engineering, art, sports, etc. In contrast, A.I. models can demonstrate existing functional capabilities, as well as combinations and permutations of existing functional capabilities. We conclude this work by discussing the implications of this proof both as it regards to the future of A.I. development, as well as to what it means for the origins of human intelligence.

*Bychkov Oleksii,Bychkova Sophia,Lytvynchuk Khrystyna*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Possibility theory provides a fundamental resolution to Dempster-Shafer Theory paradoxes through axiomatic foundations using possibility/necessity measures, avoiding logical traps in uncertainty reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the crisis in uncertainty reasoning caused by Dempster-Shafer Theory paradoxes, demonstrating that possibility theory offers a mathematically rigorous alternative that aligns with natural intelligence logic.

Method: Axiomatic approach from possibility theory using dualistic apparatus of possibility and necessity measures, with comparative analysis of probabilistic, evidential, and possibilistic paradigms using a medical diagnostic dilemma case study.

Result: Possibility theory enables correct processing of contradictory data, avoids logical traps of DST, and brings formal reasoning closer to natural intelligence logic, providing a fundamental resolution rather than just an alternative.

Conclusion: Possibility theory, particularly through its axiomatic approach with possibility/necessity measures, provides the mathematically rigorous and logically consistent foundation needed to resolve DST paradoxes, representing a fundamental advancement in uncertainty reasoning.

Abstract: This work advances and substantiates the thesis that the resolution of this crisis lies in the domain of possibility theory, specifically in the axiomatic approach developed in Bychkovs article. Unlike numerous attempts to fix Dempster rule, this approach builds from scratch a logically consistent and mathematically rigorous foundation for working with uncertainty, using the dualistic apparatus of possibility and necessity measures. The aim of this work is to demonstrate that possibility theory is not merely an alternative, but provides a fundamental resolution to DST paradoxes. A comparative analysis of three paradigms will be conducted probabilistic, evidential, and possibilistic. Using a classic medical diagnostic dilemma as an example, it will be shown how possibility theory allows for correct processing of contradictory data, avoiding the logical traps of DST and bringing formal reasoning closer to the logic of natural intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pure AI self-improvement is exciting but dangerous and may take too long. The authors argue that focusing on human-AI collaboration in research is a better, safer goal for humanity.

Method: Proposes targeting improvement of AI systems' ability to work with human researchers throughout the entire AI research process - from ideation to experimentation - creating a symbiotic relationship.

Result: Not specified in the abstract (this appears to be a position/advocacy paper rather than reporting experimental results).

Conclusion: Focusing on human-in-the-loop research improvement will accelerate AI research progress more safely and lead to "co-superintelligence" through human-AI symbiosis.

Abstract: Self-improvement is a goal currently exciting the field of AI, but is fraught with danger, and may take time to fully achieve. We advocate that a more achievable and better goal for humanity is to maximize co-improvement: collaboration between human researchers and AIs to achieve co-superintelligence. That is, specifically targeting improving AI systems' ability to work with human researchers to conduct AI research together, from ideation to experimentation, in order to both accelerate AI research and to generally endow both AIs and humans with safer superintelligence through their symbiosis. Focusing on including human research improvement in the loop will both get us there faster, and more safely.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional healthcare AI systems struggle with contextual reasoning, long-term state management, and human-verifiable workflows.

Conclusion: MCP-AI represents a significant shift from traditional CDSS and prompt-based LLMs, providing a scalable basis for interpretable, composable, and safety-oriented AI that connects with HL7/FHIR interfaces and adheres to HIPAA and FDA SaMD guidelines for upcoming clinical environments.

Abstract: Healthcare AI systems have historically faced challenges in merging contextual reasoning, long-term state management, and human-verifiable workflows into a cohesive framework. This paper introduces a completely innovative architecture and concept: combining the Model Context Protocol (MCP) with a specific clinical application, known as MCP-AI. This integration allows intelligent agents to reason over extended periods, collaborate securely, and adhere to authentic clinical logic, representing a significant shift away from traditional Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) and prompt-based Large Language Models (LLMs). As healthcare systems become more complex, the need for autonomous, context-aware clinical reasoning frameworks has become urgent. We present MCP-AI, a novel architecture for explainable medical decision-making built upon the Model Context Protocol (MCP) a modular, executable specification for orchestrating generative and descriptive AI agents in real-time workflows. Each MCP file captures clinical objectives, patient context, reasoning state, and task logic, forming a reusable and auditable memory object. Unlike conventional CDSS or stateless prompt-based AI systems, MCP-AI supports adaptive, longitudinal, and collaborative reasoning across care settings. MCP-AI is validated through two use cases: (1) diagnostic modeling of Fragile X Syndrome with comorbid depression, and (2) remote coordination for Type 2 Diabetes and hypertension. In either scenario, the protocol facilitates physician-in-the-loop validation, streamlines clinical processes, and guarantees secure transitions of AI responsibilities between healthcare providers. The system connects with HL7/FHIR interfaces and adheres to regulatory standards, such as HIPAA and FDA SaMD guidelines. MCP-AI provides a scalable basis for interpretable, composable, and safety-oriented AI within upcoming clinical environments.

TL;DR: ChipMind is a knowledge graph-augmented reasoning framework that addresses LLM context window limitations for IC development by converting circuit specs to knowledge graphs and using adaptive retrieval with semantic filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have potential for automating IC development but are limited by restricted context windows. Existing context-extension methods fail at effective semantic modeling and multi-hop reasoning over complex circuit specifications.

Method: ChipMind transforms circuit specifications into domain-specific knowledge graphs (ChipKG) using Circuit Semantic-Aware Knowledge Graph Construction, then uses ChipKG-Augmented Reasoning with information-theoretic adaptive retrieval and intent-aware semantic filtering.

Result: On industrial-scale specification reasoning benchmarks, ChipMind significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with average improvement of 34.59% (up to 72.73%).

Conclusion: ChipMind bridges the gap between academic research and practical industrial deployment of LLM-aided Hardware Design by effectively handling lengthy, complex circuit specifications.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate immense potential for automating integrated circuit (IC) development, their practical deployment is fundamentally limited by restricted context windows. Existing context-extension methods struggle to achieve effective semantic modeling and thorough multi-hop reasoning over extensive, intricate circuit specifications. To address this, we introduce ChipMind, a novel knowledge graph-augmented reasoning framework specifically designed for lengthy IC specifications. ChipMind first transforms circuit specifications into a domain-specific knowledge graph ChipKG through the Circuit Semantic-Aware Knowledge Graph Construction methodology. It then leverages the ChipKG-Augmented Reasoning mechanism, combining information-theoretic adaptive retrieval to dynamically trace logical dependencies with intent-aware semantic filtering to prune irrelevant noise, effectively balancing retrieval completeness and precision. Evaluated on an industrial-scale specification reasoning benchmark, ChipMind significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average improvement of 34.59% (up to 72.73%). Our framework bridges a critical gap between academic research and practical industrial deployment of LLM-aided Hardware Design (LAD).

*Tarun Suresh,Nalin Wadhwa,Debangshu Banerjee,Gagandeep Singh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BEAVER is the first practical framework for computing deterministic, sound probability bounds on LLM constraint satisfaction, providing provable guarantees rather than just sampling-based estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs move to production, practitioners need reliable methods to verify that model outputs satisfy required constraints. Sampling-based estimates offer intuition but no sound guarantees, creating a need for deterministic verification methods.

Method: BEAVER systematically explores the generation space using novel token trie and frontier data structures, maintaining provably sound bounds at every iteration for any prefix-closed semantic constraint.

Result: BEAVER achieves 6-8× tighter probability bounds and identifies 3-4× more high-risk instances compared to baseline methods under identical computational budgets across correctness verification, privacy verification, and secure code generation tasks.

Conclusion: BEAVER enables precise characterization and risk assessment that loose bounds or empirical evaluation cannot provide, offering the first practical framework for sound verification of LLM constraint satisfaction.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) transition from research prototypes to production systems, practitioners often need reliable methods to verify that model outputs satisfy required constraints. While sampling-based estimates provide an intuition of model behavior, they offer no sound guarantees. We present BEAVER, the first practical framework for computing deterministic, sound probability bounds on LLM constraint satisfaction. Given any prefix-closed semantic constraint, BEAVER systematically explores the generation space using novel token trie and frontier data structures, maintaining provably sound bounds at every iteration. We formalize the verification problem, prove soundness of our approach, and evaluate BEAVER on correctness verification, privacy verification and secure code generation tasks across multiple state of the art LLMs. BEAVER achieves 6 to 8 times tighter probability bounds and identifies 3 to 4 times more high risk instances compared to baseline methods under identical computational budgets, enabling precise characterization and risk assessment that loose bounds or empirical evaluation cannot provide.

*Robert Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces "akrasia" (weakness of will) as a framework for analyzing AI inconsistency, creates an Akrasia Benchmark to measure when models contradict their own commitments, and connects this to broader issues in agentic AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models show inconsistency between knowing correct answers and failing to act on them, similar to human akrasia. This work aims to provide a conceptual framework and empirical tools to analyze and measure this form of inconsistency in AI systems.

Method: Proposes akrasia as a foundational concept and introduces the Akrasia Benchmark - a structured set of prompting conditions (Baseline, Synonym, Temporal, and Temptation) that measures when a model's local response contradicts its own prior commitments.

Result: The benchmark enables quantitative comparison of "self-control" across model families, decoding strategies, and temptation types, and shows how micro-level akrasia may compound into macro-level instability in multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: By reframing inconsistency as weakness of will, this work connects agentic AI behavior to classical theories of agency and provides an empirical bridge between philosophy, psychology, and the science of agentic AI.

Abstract: Large language models display a peculiar form of inconsistency: they "know" the correct answer but fail to act on it. In human philosophy, this tension between global judgment and local impulse is called akrasia, or weakness of will. We propose akrasia as a foundational concept for analyzing inconsistency and goal drift in agentic AI systems. To operationalize it, we introduce a preliminary version of the Akrasia Benchmark, currently a structured set of prompting conditions (Baseline [B], Synonym [S], Temporal [T], and Temptation [X]) that measures when a model's local response contradicts its own prior commitments. The benchmark enables quantitative comparison of "self-control" across model families, decoding strategies, and temptation types. Beyond single-model evaluation, we outline how micro-level akrasia may compound into macro-level instability in multi-agent systems that may be interpreted as "scheming" or deliberate misalignment. By reframing inconsistency as weakness of will, this work connects agentic behavior to classical theories of agency and provides an empirical bridge between philosophy, psychology, and the emerging science of agentic AI.

TL;DR: MIND framework enables MLLMs with human-like "Understand -> Rethink -> Correct" cognitive abilities through rationale augmentation, progressive correction learning, and contrastive alignment for better reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs suffer from limited multi-rationale semantic modeling, insufficient logical robustness, and susceptibility to misleading interpretations in complex reasoning scenarios.

Method: Proposes MIND framework with: 1) RAD paradigm for rationale augmentation and dataset expansion, 2) P2CL strategy for progressive two-stage correction learning, and 3) MCA optimization for multi-rationale contrastive alignment to separate correct/incorrect reasoning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple public datasets covering scientific, commonsense, and mathematical scenarios.

Conclusion: MIND provides a new perspective for advancing MLLMs towards higher levels of cognitive intelligence by enabling active discriminative reasoning rather than passive imitation.

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been widely applied to reasoning tasks. However, they suffer from limited multi-rationale semantic modeling, insufficient logical robustness, and are susceptible to misleading interpretations in complex scenarios. Therefore, we propose a Multi-rationale INtegrated Discriminative (MIND) reasoning framework, which is designed to endow MLLMs with human-like cognitive abilities of "Understand -> Rethink -> Correct", and achieves a paradigm evolution from passive imitation-based reasoning to active discriminative reasoning. Specifically, we introduce a Rationale Augmentation and Discrimination (RAD) paradigm, which automatically and efficiently expands existing datasets by generating diverse rationales, providing a unified and extensible data foundation. Meanwhile, we design a Progressive Two-stage Correction Learning (P2CL) strategy. The first phase enhances multi-rationale positive learning, while the second phase enables active logic discrimination and correction. In addition, to mitigate representation entanglement in the multi-rationale semantic space, we propose a Multi-rationale Contrastive Alignment (MCA) optimization strategy, which achieves semantic aggregation of correct reasoning and boundary separation of incorrect reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MIND reasoning framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple public datasets covering scientific, commonsense, and mathematical scenarios. It provides a new perspective for advancing MLLMs towards higher levels of cognitive intelligence. Our code is available at https://github.com/YuChuang1205/MIND

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Executor-Analyst Framework with stratified ensemble strategy to address context utilization failure in clinical agents, achieving SOTA on CURE-Bench without finetuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current clinical agents like TxAgent suffer from Context Utilization Failure - they retrieve biomedical evidence but fail to ground diagnosis in that information, showing reasoning deficits in monolithic models.

Method: Executor-Analyst Framework decouples tool execution (syntactic precision) from clinical reasoning (semantic robustness) using specialized TxAgents as Executors and long-context foundation models as Analysts. Uses Stratified Ensemble strategy instead of global pooling to preserve evidentiary diversity and address information bottleneck.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CURE-Bench without expensive end-to-end finetuning. Reveals scaling insights: Context-Performance Paradox (beyond 12k tokens degrades accuracy) and Curse of Dimensionality in action spaces (expanding toolsets needs hierarchical retrieval).

Conclusion: Demonstrates potential of training-free architectural engineering for scalable, agile foundation for trustworthy AI-driven therapeutics. Code released on GitHub.

Abstract: Current clinical agent built on small LLMs, such as TxAgent suffer from a \textit{Context Utilization Failure}, where models successfully retrieve biomedical evidence due to supervised finetuning but fail to ground their diagnosis in that information. In this work, we propose the Executor-Analyst Framework, a modular architecture that decouples the syntactic precision of tool execution from the semantic robustness of clinical reasoning. By orchestrating specialized TxAgents (Executors) with long-context foundation models (Analysts), we mitigate the reasoning deficits observed in monolithic models. Beyond simple modularity, we demonstrate that a Stratified Ensemble strategy significantly outperforms global pooling by preserving evidentiary diversity, effectively addressing the information bottleneck. Furthermore, our stress tests reveal critical scaling insights: (1) a \textit{Context-Performance Paradox}, where extending reasoning contexts beyond 12k tokens introduces noise that degrades accuracy; and (2) the \textit{Curse of Dimensionality} in action spaces, where expanding toolsets necessitates hierarchical retrieval strategies. Crucially, our approach underscores the potential of training-free architectural engineering, achieving state-of-the-art performance on CURE-Bench without the need for expensive end-to-end finetuning. This provides a scalable, agile foundation for the next generation of trustworthy AI-driven therapeutics. Code has been released on https://github.com/June01/CureAgent.

### [121] [Ontology Learning with LLMs: A Benchmark Study on Axiom Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05594)
*Roos M. Bakker,Daan L. Di Scala,Maaike H. T. de Boer,Stephan A. Raaijmakers*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show promise for ontology axiom identification but performance varies by axiom type and domain, with Axiom-by-Axiom prompting outperforming direct approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ontology development is complex and requires significant expertise. While ontology learning has advanced with NLP and LLMs, there's a need to systematically evaluate LLMs' ability to identify fundamental ontology axioms (logical relations between classes and properties).

Method: Created OntoAxiom benchmark with 9 medium-sized ontologies (17,118 triples, 2,771 axioms). Tested 12 LLMs on subclass, disjoint, subproperty, domain, and range axioms. Compared three shot settings and two prompting strategies: Direct (all axioms at once) vs Axiom-by-Axiom (AbA, one axiom per prompt).

Result: AbA prompting achieved higher F1 scores than direct approach. Performance varied significantly across axiom types and domains (e.g., FOAF ontology: 0.642 for subclass, music ontology: 0.218 for subclass). Larger LLMs outperformed smaller ones, though smaller models remain viable for resource-constrained settings.

Conclusion: LLMs cannot fully automate axiom identification yet, but can provide valuable candidate axioms to support ontology engineers in development and refinement tasks.

Abstract: Ontologies are an important tool for structuring domain knowledge, but their development is a complex task that requires significant modelling and domain expertise. Ontology learning, aimed at automating this process, has seen advancements in the past decade with the improvement of Natural Language Processing techniques, and especially with the recent growth of Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper investigates the challenge of identifying axioms: fundamental ontology components that define logical relations between classes and properties. In this work, we introduce an Ontology Axiom Benchmark OntoAxiom, and systematically test LLMs on that benchmark for axiom identification, evaluating different prompting strategies, ontologies, and axiom types. The benchmark consists of nine medium-sized ontologies with together 17.118 triples, and 2.771 axioms. We focus on subclass, disjoint, subproperty, domain, and range axioms. To evaluate LLM performance, we compare twelve LLMs with three shot settings and two prompting strategies: a Direct approach where we query all axioms at once, versus an Axiom-by-Axiom (AbA) approach, where each prompt queries for one axiom only. Our findings show that the AbA prompting leads to higher F1 scores than the direct approach. However, performance varies across axioms, suggesting that certain axioms are more challenging to identify. The domain also influences performance: the FOAF ontology achieves a score of 0.642 for the subclass axiom, while the music ontology reaches only 0.218. Larger LLMs outperform smaller ones, but smaller models may still be viable for resource-constrained settings. Although performance overall is not high enough to fully automate axiom identification, LLMs can provide valuable candidate axioms to support ontology engineers with the development and refinement of ontologies.

*Menghua Jiang,Haokai Gao,Shuhao Chen,Yin Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepDist introduces a novel clause weighting scheme that distinguishes between PMS and WPMS problems, with different update strategies and initialization methods, plus a decimation technique for unit/hard clauses, outperforming state-of-the-art SLS solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SLS algorithms for Partial Maximum Satisfiability (PMS) and Weighted Partial Maximum Satisfiability (WPMS) fail to adequately distinguish between these two problem types, typically using uniform update strategies for clause weights and overlooking their structural differences.

Method: 1) Novel clause weighting scheme that updates clause weights differently for PMS and WPMS instances based on distinct conditions; 2) New initialization method accommodating unique characteristics of both instance types; 3) Decimation method prioritizing satisfaction of unit and hard clauses; 4) Integration into new SLS solver called DeepDist.

Result: DeepDist outperforms state-of-the-art SLS solvers on benchmarks from recent MaxSAT Evaluations. A hybrid solver combining DeepDist with TT-Open-WBO-Inc surpasses the performance of MaxSAT Evaluation 2024 winners SPB-MaxSAT-c-Band and SPB-MaxSAT-c-FPS.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by distinguishing between PMS and WPMS problems, resulting in superior performance that can be combined with other solvers to achieve state-of-the-art results in MaxSAT solving.

Abstract: Partial Maximum Satisfiability (PMS) and Weighted Partial Maximum Satisfiability (WPMS) generalize Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT), with broad real-world applications. Recent advances in Stochastic Local Search (SLS) algorithms for solving (W)PMS have mainly focused on designing clause weighting schemes. However, existing methods often fail to adequately distinguish between PMS and WPMS, typically employing uniform update strategies for clause weights and overlooking critical structural differences between the two problem types. In this work, we present a novel clause weighting scheme that, for the first time, updates the clause weights of PMS and WPMS instances according to distinct conditions. This scheme also introduces a new initialization method, which better accommodates the unique characteristics of both instance types. Furthermore, we propose a decimation method that prioritizes satisfying unit and hard clauses, effectively complementing our proposed clause weighting scheme. Building on these methods, we develop a new SLS solver for (W)PMS named DeepDist. Experimental results on benchmarks from the anytime tracks of recent MaxSAT Evaluations show that DeepDist outperforms state-of-the-art SLS solvers. Notably, a hybrid solver combining DeepDist with TT-Open-WBO-Inc surpasses the performance of the MaxSAT Evaluation 2024 winners, SPB-MaxSAT-c-Band and SPB-MaxSAT-c-FPS, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KANFormer is a deep learning model that combines dilated causal CNNs, Transformers, and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to predict limit order time-to-fill using both market and agent-level information, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for predicting limit order time-to-fill rely only on limit order book snapshots, missing important agent-level information and order queue position that affect execution likelihood. There's a need for more comprehensive models that capture richer market dynamics.

Method: KANFormer combines a Dilated Causal Convolutional network with a Transformer encoder, enhanced by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for improved nonlinear approximation. It integrates agent actions related to LOB dynamics and order queue position, going beyond just LOB snapshots.

Result: KANFormer outperforms existing works on CAC 40 index futures data across both calibration metrics (Right-Censored Log-Likelihood, Integrated Brier Score) and discrimination metrics (C-index, time-dependent AUC). SHAP analysis provides interpretable feature importance over time.

Conclusion: Combining rich market signals with expressive neural architectures (especially KAN-enhanced Transformers) enables accurate and interpretable predictions of fill probabilities, demonstrating the value of integrating both market- and agent-level information.

Abstract: This paper introduces KANFormer, a novel deep-learning-based model for predicting the time-to-fill of limit orders by leveraging both market- and agent-level information. KANFormer combines a Dilated Causal Convolutional network with a Transformer encoder, enhanced by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), which improve nonlinear approximation. Unlike existing models that rely solely on a series of snapshots of the limit order book, KANFormer integrates the actions of agents related to LOB dynamics and the position of the order in the queue to more effectively capture patterns related to execution likelihood. We evaluate the model using CAC 40 index futures data with labeled orders. The results show that KANFormer outperforms existing works in both calibration (Right-Censored Log-Likelihood, Integrated Brier Score) and discrimination (C-index, time-dependent AUC). We further analyze feature importance over time using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). Our results highlight the benefits of combining rich market signals with expressive neural architectures to achieve accurate and interpretabl predictions of fill probabilities.

Method: Models radar deployment as end-to-end task using deep reinforcement learning with integrated neural modules for heatmap perception and novel reward format.

Result: Achieves coverage comparable to evolutionary algorithms while deploying radars approximately 7,000 times faster; ablation studies confirm necessity of all FARDA components.

Conclusion: FARDA provides an efficient neural network-based solution for rapid anti-jamming radar deployment, significantly outperforming traditional evolutionary approaches in speed while maintaining effectiveness.

Abstract: The fast deployment of cognitive radar to counter jamming remains a critical challenge in modern warfare, where more efficient deployment leads to quicker detection of targets. Existing methods are primarily based on evolutionary algorithms, which are time-consuming and prone to falling into local optima. We tackle these drawbacks via the efficient inference of neural networks and propose a brand new framework: Fast Anti-Jamming Radar Deployment Algorithm (FARDA). We first model the radar deployment problem as an end-to-end task and design deep reinforcement learning algorithms to solve it, where we develop integrated neural modules to perceive heatmap information and a brand new reward format. Empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves coverage comparable to evolutionary algorithms while deploying radars approximately 7,000 times faster. Further ablation experiments confirm the necessity of each component of FARDA.

TL;DR: ERO framework uses evolutionary optimization to enhance LLMs' reasoning abilities, showing weak models can develop strong reasoning through evolution while current advanced LLMs still lack system 2 reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite LLMs showing specific skills, they lack general intelligence and system 2 reasoning (slow thinking) comparable to human intelligence. The paper aims to explore whether machine intelligence can evolve reasoning abilities like humans.

Method: Proposes Evolutionary Reasoning Optimization (ERO) framework that applies survival of the fittest principles to a population of LLMs. Initializes multiple LLMs as a population and uses evolutionary strategies to maximize reasoning scores of the best individual through iterative evolution.

Result: Two key findings: 1) Latest LLMs like GPT-5 still show limited system 2 reasoning ability; 2) A relatively weak model (Qwen-7B) can be enhanced through ERO's simple evolution loop to emerge powerful reasoning ability.

Conclusion: Evolutionary optimization can effectively enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities, demonstrating that machine intelligence can evolve reasoning abilities similar to human cognitive development, with ERO providing a practical framework for this evolution.

Abstract: Machine intelligence marks the ultimate dream of making machines' intelligence comparable to human beings. While recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) show substantial specific skills for a wide array of downstream tasks, they more or less fall shorts in general intelligence. Following correlation between intelligence and system 2 reasoning (slow thinking), in this paper, we aim to answering a worthwhile research question: could machine intelligence such as LLMs be evolved to acquire reasoning ability (not specific skill) just like our human beings? To this end, we propose evolutionary reasoning optimization (ERO) framework which performs survival of the fittest over a population of LLMs to search for individual with strong reasoning ability. Given a reasoning task, ERO first initializes multiple LLMs as a population, after which an evolutionary strategy evolves the population to maximize quantified reasoning score of the best individual. Based on experiments on representative testsuites, we claim two surprising empirical discoveries: i) the latest LLMs such as GPT-5 still show limited system 2 reasoning ability; ii) with simple evolution-loop of ERO, a relatively weak model (Qwen-7B) could be enhanced to emerge powerful reasoning ability.

### [126] [The Missing Layer of AGI: From Pattern Alchemy to Coordination Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05765)
*Edward Y. Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs are not dead ends for AGI - they provide the necessary pattern substrate, but need a System-2 coordination layer for reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To counter critiques that LLMs are fundamentally incapable of reasoning/planning, arguing that the bottleneck is not the pattern-matching substrate but the missing coordination layer that selects and constrains patterns.

Method: Propose UCCT theory of semantic anchoring (with parameters rho_d, d_r, gamma log k) and implement it as MACI architecture with baiting (behavior-modulated debate), filtering (Socratic judging), and persistence (transactional memory).

Result: Formal framework showing reasoning emerges when anchors shift posterior toward goal-directed constraints, and architecture that implements this coordination layer.

Conclusion: Path to AGI runs through LLMs (as necessary substrate) with added coordination layer, not around them; common objections are reframed as testable coordination failures.

Abstract: Influential critiques argue that Large Language Models (LLMs) are a dead end for AGI: "mere pattern matchers" structurally incapable of reasoning or planning. We argue this conclusion misidentifies the bottleneck: it confuses the ocean with the net. Pattern repositories are the necessary System-1 substrate; the missing component is a System-2 coordination layer that selects, constrains, and binds these patterns. We formalize this layer via UCCT, a theory of semantic anchoring that models reasoning as a phase transition governed by effective support (rho_d), representational mismatch (d_r), and an adaptive anchoring budget (gamma log k). Under this lens, ungrounded generation is simply an unbaited retrieval of the substrate's maximum likelihood prior, while "reasoning" emerges when anchors shift the posterior toward goal-directed constraints. We translate UCCT into architecture with MACI, a coordination stack that implements baiting (behavior-modulated debate), filtering (Socratic judging), and persistence (transactional memory). By reframing common objections as testable coordination failures, we argue that the path to AGI runs through LLMs, not around them.

*Hafsa Akebli,Adam Shephard,Vincenzo Della Mea,Nasir Rajpoot*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MOA (Multimodal Oncology Agent) combines histology analysis via TITAN foundation model with clinical/genomic reasoning to predict IDH1 mutations in low-grade gliomas, outperforming baselines with 0.912 F1-score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IDH1 mutations in low-grade gliomas define clinically distinct subgroups with important prognostic and therapeutic implications, but accurate prediction requires integrating multiple data modalities.

Method: Developed a Multimodal Oncology Agent (MOA) that integrates: 1) TITAN foundation model for histology analysis, 2) reasoning over structured clinical/genomic data using PubMed, Google Search, and OncoKB, and 3) fusion of histology features with clinical data.

Result: Evaluated on 488 TCGA-LGG patients: MOA without histology (F1=0.826) outperformed clinical baseline (0.798); MOA with histology fusion achieved best performance (F1=0.912), exceeding histology baseline (0.894) and fused histology-clinical baseline (0.897).

Conclusion: MOA captures complementary mutation-relevant information enriched through external biomedical sources, enabling accurate IDH1 mutation prediction by effectively integrating multimodal data.

Abstract: Low-grade gliomas frequently present IDH1 mutations that define clinically distinct subgroups with specific prognostic and therapeutic implications. This work introduces a Multimodal Oncology Agent (MOA) integrating a histology tool based on the TITAN foundation model for IDH1 mutation prediction in low-grade glioma, combined with reasoning over structured clinical and genomic inputs through PubMed, Google Search, and OncoKB. MOA reports were quantitatively evaluated on 488 patients from the TCGA-LGG cohort against clinical and histology baselines. MOA without the histology tool outperformed the clinical baseline, achieving an F1-score of 0.826 compared to 0.798. When fused with histology features, MOA reached the highest performance with an F1-score of 0.912, exceeding both the histology baseline at 0.894 and the fused histology-clinical baseline at 0.897. These results demonstrate that the proposed agent captures complementary mutation-relevant information enriched through external biomedical sources, enabling accurate IDH1 mutation prediction.

TL;DR: LLM-based pipeline generates personalized client networks from therapy transcripts for treatment planning, outperforming direct prompting with 90% expert preference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized networks for psychotherapy treatment planning typically require intensive longitudinal data, which limits scalability. LLMs offer a solution to create clinically relevant networks from therapy transcripts without extensive data collection.

Method: End-to-end pipeline using in-context learning to identify psychological processes and dimensions from 77 therapy transcripts (3364 annotated processes), then two-step clustering to organize processes into clinically meaningful networks with explanation-augmented relationships.

Result: Method achieved high performance with few training examples; experts preferred multi-step approach over direct prompting (90% preference) and rated networks favorably (72-75% for clinical relevance, novelty, usefulness).

Conclusion: Proof of concept for using LLMs to create clinically relevant networks from therapy transcripts, enabling bottom-up case conceptualization and latent theme identification. Networks have potential for clinical use, supervision, and training, though future research should compare treatment outcomes with statistically estimated networks.

Abstract: Recent advances in psychotherapy have focused on treatment personalization, such as by selecting treatment modules based on personalized networks. However, estimating personalized networks typically requires intensive longitudinal data, which is not always feasible. A solution to facilitate scalability of network-driven treatment personalization is leveraging LLMs. In this study, we present an end-to-end pipeline for automatically generating client networks from 77 therapy transcripts to support case conceptualization and treatment planning. We annotated 3364 psychological processes and their corresponding dimensions in therapy transcripts. Using these data, we applied in-context learning to jointly identify psychological processes and their dimensions. The method achieved high performance even with a few training examples. To organize the processes into networks, we introduced a two-step method that grouped them into clinically meaningful clusters. We then generated explanation-augmented relationships between clusters. Experts found that networks produced by our multi-step approach outperformed those built with direct prompting for clinical utility and interpretability, with up to 90% preferring our approach. In addition, the networks were rated favorably by experts, with scores for clinical relevance, novelty, and usefulness ranging from 72-75%. Our findings provide a proof of concept for using LLMs to create clinically relevant networks from therapy transcripts. Advantages of our approach include bottom-up case conceptualization from client utterances in therapy sessions and identification of latent themes. Networks generated from our pipeline may be used in clinical settings and supervision and training. Future research should examine whether these networks improve treatment outcomes relative to other methods of treatment personalization, including statistically estimated networks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GPT-5-based Paper Correctness Checker finds increasing objective mistakes in AI papers over time, with 83.2% precision in error detection and 75.8% fix success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Peer-reviewed publications form the foundation of research, but errors can propagate unnoticed, creating confusion and complicating reproducibility. The accelerating pace of research and demands on peer-review make mistakes harder to detect.

Method: Developed a Paper Correctness Checker based on GPT-5 to systematically identify objective mistakes (formulas, derivations, calculations, figures, tables) in papers from top AI conferences/journals. Human experts reviewed 316 potential mistakes to validate findings.

Result: Published papers contain non-negligible objective mistakes, with increasing trends: NeurIPS (3.8 to 5.9 mistakes/paper, 55.3% increase 2021-2025), ICLR (4.1 to 5.2, 2018-2025), TMLR (5.0 to 5.5, 2022/23-2025). AI Checker achieved 83.2% precision and could propose correct fixes for 75.8% of identified mistakes.

Conclusion: Frontier LLMs like GPT-5 can effectively detect and correct objective mistakes in published papers, helping establish a firmer knowledge foundation by reducing confusion and strengthening reproducibility in the literature.

Abstract: How many mistakes do published AI papers contain? Peer-reviewed publications form the foundation upon which new research and knowledge are built. Errors that persist in the literature can propagate unnoticed, creating confusion in follow-up studies and complicating reproducibility. The accelerating pace of research and the increasing demands on the peer-review system make such mistakes harder to detect and avoid. To address this, we developed a Paper Correctness Checker based on GPT-5 to systematically identify mistakes in papers previously published at top AI conferences and journals. Our analysis focuses on objective mistakes-e.g., errors in formulas, derivations, calculations, figures, and tables-that have a clearly verifiable ground truth. We intentionally exclude subjective considerations such as novelty, importance, or writing quality. We find that published papers contain a non-negligible number of objective mistakes and that the average number of mistakes per paper has increased over time-from 3.8 in NeurIPS 2021 to 5.9 in NeurIPS 2025 (55.3% increase); from 4.1 in ICLR 2018 to 5.2 in ICLR 2025; and from 5.0 in TMLR 2022/23 to 5.5 in TMLR 2025. Human experts reviewed 316 potential mistakes identified by the AI Checker and confirmed that 263 were actual mistakes, corresponding to a precision of 83.2%. While most identified issues are relatively minor, correcting them would reduce confusion in the literature and strengthen reproducibility. The AI Checker also surfaced potentially more substantive mistakes that could affect the interpretation of results. Moreover, we show that the AI Checker can propose correct fixes for 75.8% of the identified mistakes. Overall, this study highlights the potential of frontier LLMs to detect and correct objective mistakes in published papers, helping to establish a firmer foundation of knowledge.

TL;DR: PRiSM is a synthetic, dynamic multimodal benchmark for evaluating scientific reasoning in VLMs using Python code, covering 24,750+ physics/math problems with automated verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM benchmarks fail to assess scientific reasoning capabilities like conceptual understanding, symbolic reasoning, and adherence to formal laws in domains like mathematics and physics. Existing datasets are static, lack intermediate reasoning steps, robustness testing, and scientific correctness verification.

Method: Developed PRiSM benchmark with 24,750+ university-level physics/math problems using PrismAgent pipeline for dynamic generation. Each problem includes multimodal input (text, generated figures) and structured outputs (executable Python code for ground truth, step-by-step reasoning). Features automated Python-powered verification.

Result: Enables fine-grained experimental auditing of VLMs, revealing failure modes, uncertainty behaviors, and scientific reasoning limitations. Comprehensive evaluation of existing VLMs demonstrates their limitations and provides deeper insights into their capabilities.

Conclusion: PRiSM addresses critical gaps in scientific VLM evaluation through dynamic, multimodal benchmarking with automated verification, enabling targeted assessment of generalization, program synthesis, robustness, reasoning correction, and ambiguity resolution capabilities.

Abstract: Evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) in scientific domains like mathematics and physics poses unique challenges that go far beyond predicting final answers. These domains demand conceptual understanding, symbolic reasoning, and adherence to formal laws, requirements that most existing benchmarks fail to address. In particular, current datasets tend to be static, lacking intermediate reasoning steps, robustness to variations, or mechanisms for verifying scientific correctness. To address these limitations, we introduce PRiSM, a synthetic, fully dynamic, and multimodal benchmark for evaluating scientific reasoning via grounded Python code. PRiSM includes over 24,750 university-level physics and math problems, and it leverages our scalable agent-based pipeline, PrismAgent, to generate well-structured problem instances. Each problem contains dynamic textual and visual input, a generated figure, alongside rich structured outputs: executable Python code for ground truth generation and verification, and detailed step-by-step reasoning. The dynamic nature and Python-powered automated ground truth generation of our benchmark allow for fine-grained experimental auditing of multimodal VLMs, revealing failure modes, uncertainty behaviors, and limitations in scientific reasoning. To this end, we propose five targeted evaluation tasks covering generalization, symbolic program synthesis, perturbation robustness, reasoning correction, and ambiguity resolution. Through comprehensive evaluation of existing VLMs, we highlight their limitations and showcase how PRiSM enables deeper insights into their scientific reasoning capabilities.

*Shima Imani,Seungwhan Moon,Lambert Mathias,Lu Zhang,Babak Damavandi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRACE is a framework that evaluates reasoning trajectories in vision-language models using Auxiliary Reasoning Sets to expose hidden reasoning errors that final-answer evaluation misses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard evaluation of vision-language models focuses only on final answers, masking reasoning errors and allowing silent failures to persist, which is problematic for reliable mathematical and scientific reasoning.

Method: TRACE uses Auxiliary Reasoning Sets - compact sub question-answer pairs that decompose complex problems, then evaluates intermediate steps through consistency-based metrics to diagnose reasoning trajectories.

Result: Experiments show consistency across ARS correlates with final-answer correctness and helps pinpoint specific reasoning steps where failures occur, providing actionable signals for model improvement.

Conclusion: TRACE offers a transparent evaluation framework that defines confidence regions to distinguish reliable from unreliable reasoning paths, supporting effective filtering, debugging, and model refinement.

Abstract: Reliable mathematical and scientific reasoning remains an open challenge for large vision-language models. Standard final-answer evaluation often masks reasoning errors, allowing silent failures to persist. To address this gap, we introduce TRACE, a framework for Transparent Reasoning And Consistency Evaluation that diagnoses reasoning trajectories rather than only end results. At its core, TRACE leverages Auxiliary Reasoning Sets, compact sub question answer pairs that decompose complex problems, evaluate intermediate steps through consistency-based metrics, and expose failures overlooked by standard evaluation. Our experiments show that consistency across ARS correlates with final-answer correctness and helps pinpoint the reasoning steps where failures arise, offering actionable signals for model improvement. Furthermore, TRACE defines confidence regions that distinguish reliable from unreliable reasoning paths, supporting effective filtering, debugging, and model refinement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resource allocation is NP-hard with combinatorial complexity. Classical deep reinforcement learning methods like Rainbow DQN have limited representational power due to classical function approximators, creating a need for quantum-enhanced approaches.

Method: Introduces Variational Quantum Rainbow DQN (VQR-DQN) that integrates ring-topology variational quantum circuits with Rainbow DQN to leverage quantum superposition and entanglement. Frames human resource allocation as a Markov decision process with combinatorial action spaces based on officer capabilities, event schedules, and transition times.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of quantum-enhanced DRL for large-scale resource allocation problems, with implementation available as open source.

Abstract: Resource allocation remains NP-hard due to combinatorial complexity. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods, such as the Rainbow Deep Q-Network (DQN), improve scalability through prioritized replay and distributional heads, classical function approximators limit their representational power. We introduce Variational Quantum Rainbow DQN (VQR-DQN), which integrates ring-topology variational quantum circuits with Rainbow DQN to leverage quantum superposition and entanglement. We frame the human resource allocation problem (HRAP) as a Markov decision process (MDP) with combinatorial action spaces based on officer capabilities, event schedules, and transition times. On four HRAP benchmarks, VQR-DQN achieves 26.8% normalized makespan reduction versus random baselines and outperforms Double DQN and classical Rainbow DQN by 4.9-13.4%. These gains align with theoretical connections between circuit expressibility, entanglement, and policy quality, demonstrating the potential of quantum-enhanced DRL for large-scale resource allocation.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for comprehensive evaluation of scientific reasoning capabilities in language models, particularly for physics problem-solving where current benchmarks may lack diversity, parameterization, and robust evaluation metrics.

Method: Created SymPyBench with 15,045 university-level physics problems that are fully parameterized, supporting infinite input configurations. Each problem includes structured step-by-step reasoning and executable Python code for ground-truth solutions. Features three question types: MC-Symbolic, MC-Numerical, and free-form formats.

Result: The benchmark enables evaluation using both standard accuracy and three novel metrics: Consistency Score (variability across problem variants), Failure Rate, and Confusion Rate. Experiments with state-of-the-art instruction-tuned language models revealed both strengths and limitations in scientific reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: SymPyBench provides a foundation for developing more robust and interpretable reasoning systems by offering a dynamic, code-driven benchmark with diverse problem formats and novel evaluation metrics that better quantify model performance on scientific reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We introduce, a large-scale synthetic benchmark of 15,045 university-level physics problems (90/10% train/test split). Each problem is fully parameterized, supporting an effectively infinite range of input configurations, and is accompanied by structured, step-by-step reasoning and executable Python code that produces the ground-truth solution for any parameter set. The benchmark contains three question types: MC-Symbolic (multiple-choice with symbolic options), MC-Numerical (multiple-choice with numerical options), and free-form (open-ended responses). These diverse formats test complementary reasoning skills. By leveraging the dynamic, code-driven nature of the benchmark, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics in addition to standard accuracy: Consistency Score, Failure Rate, and Confusion Rate, that quantify variability and uncertainty across problem variants. Experiments with state-of-the-art instruction-tuned language models reveal both strengths and limitations in scientific reasoning, positioning SymPyBench as a foundation for developing more robust and interpretable reasoning systems
