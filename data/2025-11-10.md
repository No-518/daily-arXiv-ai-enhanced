*Ali Faraz,Akash,Shaharukh Khan,Raja Kolla,Akshat Patidar,Suranjan Goswami,Abhinav Ravi,Chandra Khatri,Shubham Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IndicVisionBench is the first large-scale multimodal benchmark focused on the Indian subcontinent, evaluating vision-language models across 10 Indian languages and 13 culturally grounded topics through 3 tasks (OCR, MMT, VQA) with ~5K images and 37K+ QA pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM evaluation benchmarks are predominantly Western-centric, leaving gaps in understanding model performance in culturally diverse and multilingual settings, particularly for regions like the Indian subcontinent with rich linguistic diversity.

Method: Created a comprehensive benchmark covering English and 10 Indian languages across 3 multimodal tasks (OCR, MMT, VQA) with 6 question types, organized around 13 culturally relevant topics. Evaluated 8 diverse models including proprietary and open-weights systems.

Result: Substantial performance gaps were revealed, highlighting limitations of current VLMs in culturally diverse contexts. The benchmark provides a unique paired parallel corpus for analyzing cultural and linguistic biases.

Conclusion: IndicVisionBench establishes a reproducible evaluation framework that enables more inclusive multimodal research by centering cultural diversity and multilinguality, addressing critical gaps in current VLM evaluation practices.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization
across multimodal tasks, yet most evaluation benchmarks remain Western-centric,
leaving open questions about their performance in culturally diverse and
multilingual settings. To address this gap, we introduce IndicVisionBench, the
first large-scale benchmark centered on the Indian subcontinent. Covering
English and 10 Indian languages, our benchmark spans 3 multimodal tasks,
including Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Multimodal Machine Translation
(MMT), and Visual Question Answering (VQA), covering 6 kinds of question types.
Our final benchmark consists of a total of ~5K images and 37K+ QA pairs across
13 culturally grounded topics. In addition, we release a paired parallel corpus
of annotations across 10 Indic languages, creating a unique resource for
analyzing cultural and linguistic biases in VLMs. We evaluate a broad spectrum
of 8 models, from proprietary closed-source systems to open-weights medium and
large-scale models. Our experiments reveal substantial performance gaps,
underscoring the limitations of current VLMs in culturally diverse contexts. By
centering cultural diversity and multilinguality, IndicVisionBench establishes
a reproducible evaluation framework that paves the way for more inclusive
multimodal research.

### [2] [Knowledge-based anomaly detection for identifying network-induced shape artifacts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04729)
*Rucha Deshpande,Tahsin Rahman,Miguel Lago,Adarsh Subbaswamy,Jana G. Delfino,Ghada Zamzmi,Elim Thompson,Aldo Badano,Seyed Kahaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel knowledge-based anomaly detection method for identifying network-induced shape artifacts in synthetic medical images, using angle gradient analysis and isolation forests to ensure synthetic data quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic data helps address data scarcity but can introduce artifacts that compromise model performance and clinical utility, requiring quality assessment methods.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) feature extractor analyzing per-image distribution of angle gradients along anatomical boundaries, (2) isolation forest-based anomaly detector.

Result: Achieved AUC values of 0.97 and 0.91 on two mammography datasets, with human reader agreement rates of 66% and 68% for most anomalous images, and Kendall-Tau correlations of 0.45 and 0.43.

Conclusion: The method enables responsible use of synthetic data by allowing developers to evaluate synthetic images against anatomic constraints and improve dataset quality.

Abstract: Synthetic data provides a promising approach to address data scarcity for
training machine learning models; however, adoption without proper quality
assessments may introduce artifacts, distortions, and unrealistic features that
compromise model performance and clinical utility. This work introduces a novel
knowledge-based anomaly detection method for detecting network-induced shape
artifacts in synthetic images. The introduced method utilizes a two-stage
framework comprising (i) a novel feature extractor that constructs a
specialized feature space by analyzing the per-image distribution of angle
gradients along anatomical boundaries, and (ii) an isolation forest-based
anomaly detector. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for
identifying network-induced shape artifacts in two synthetic mammography
datasets from models trained on CSAW-M and VinDr-Mammo patient datasets
respectively. Quantitative evaluation shows that the method successfully
concentrates artifacts in the most anomalous partition (1st percentile), with
AUC values of 0.97 (CSAW-syn) and 0.91 (VMLO-syn). In addition, a reader study
involving three imaging scientists confirmed that images identified by the
method as containing network-induced shape artifacts were also flagged by human
readers with mean agreement rates of 66% (CSAW-syn) and 68% (VMLO-syn) for the
most anomalous partition, approximately 1.5-2 times higher than the least
anomalous partition. Kendall-Tau correlations between algorithmic and human
rankings were 0.45 and 0.43 for the two datasets, indicating reasonable
agreement despite the challenging nature of subtle artifact detection. This
method is a step forward in the responsible use of synthetic data, as it allows
developers to evaluate synthetic images for known anatomic constraints and
pinpoint and address specific issues to improve the overall quality of a
synthetic dataset.

### [3] [CPO: Condition Preference Optimization for Controllable Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04753)
*Zonglin Lyu,Ming Li,Xinxin Liu,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Condition Preference Optimization (CPO) to improve controllability in text-to-image generation by performing preference learning over control conditions rather than generated images, achieving better results than ControlNet++ with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like ControlNet++ optimize only low-noise timesteps and introduce approximation errors, while Direct Preference Optimization faces challenges in isolating controllability from other image quality factors due to generative model uncertainty.

Method: Construct winning and losing control signals (c^w and c^l) and train the model to prefer c^w, eliminating confounding factors and providing a low-variance training objective. This avoids the need to back-propagate through sampling process.

Result: Significantly improves controllability over ControlNet++: over 10% error rate reduction in segmentation, 70-80% in human pose, and consistent 2-5% reductions in edge and depth maps. Theoretically shows lower contrastive loss variance than DPO.

Conclusion: CPO provides an effective and efficient approach for improving controllability in text-to-image generation by focusing on control condition preferences, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple control types with reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: To enhance controllability in text-to-image generation, ControlNet introduces
image-based control signals, while ControlNet++ improves pixel-level cycle
consistency between generated images and the input control signal. To avoid the
prohibitive cost of back-propagating through the sampling process, ControlNet++
optimizes only low-noise timesteps (e.g., $t < 200$) using a single-step
approximation, which not only ignores the contribution of high-noise timesteps
but also introduces additional approximation errors. A straightforward
alternative for optimizing controllability across all timesteps is Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), a fine-tuning method that increases model
preference for more controllable images ($I^{w}$) over less controllable ones
($I^{l}$). However, due to uncertainty in generative models, it is difficult to
ensure that win--lose image pairs differ only in controllability while keeping
other factors, such as image quality, fixed. To address this, we propose
performing preference learning over control conditions rather than generated
images. Specifically, we construct winning and losing control signals,
$\mathbf{c}^{w}$ and $\mathbf{c}^{l}$, and train the model to prefer
$\mathbf{c}^{w}$. This method, which we term \textit{Condition Preference
Optimization} (CPO), eliminates confounding factors and yields a low-variance
training objective. Our approach theoretically exhibits lower contrastive loss
variance than DPO and empirically achieves superior results. Moreover, CPO
requires less computation and storage for dataset curation. Extensive
experiments show that CPO significantly improves controllability over the
state-of-the-art ControlNet++ across multiple control types: over $10\%$ error
rate reduction in segmentation, $70$--$80\%$ in human pose, and consistent
$2$--$5\%$ reductions in edge and depth maps.

### [4] [DARN: Dynamic Adaptive Regularization Networks for Efficient and Robust Foundation Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04766)
*Dhenenjay Yadav,Rohan Sawai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DARN is a novel decoder architecture that dynamically adapts regularization for geospatial foundation models, addressing heterogeneity in satellite imagery through task complexity prediction and adaptive dropout modulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard adaptation methods for foundation models in geospatial analysis use fixed regularization strategies that fail to account for the significant heterogeneity in satellite imagery, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: DARN integrates three innovations: (1) Task Complexity Predictor (TCP) for per-sample difficulty estimation, (2) Adaptive Dropout Modulation (ADM) that dynamically adjusts dropout rates (0.1-0.5), and (3) Dynamic Capacity Gating (DCG) for channel activation modulation.

Result: DARN achieves state-of-the-art performance: 86.66% mIoU on GeoBench (+5.56 pp over prior SOTA) in full fine-tuning, and 90.5% mIoU on Sen1Floods11 in efficient adaptation. It also shows superior OOD generalization (+9.5 pp mIoU), enhanced robustness (17% corruption error reduction), and improved minority class performance.

Conclusion: DARN provides a more intelligent, robust, and efficient approach to leveraging foundation models in critical geospatial applications by dynamically adapting regularization based on task complexity.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) offer powerful representations for geospatial
analysis, but adapting them effectively remains challenging. Standard
adaptation methods, whether full fine-tuning or efficient frozen-backbone
approaches, typically employ decoders with fixed regularization strategies,
failing to account for the significant heterogeneity in satellite imagery. We
introduce Dynamic Adaptive Regularization Networks (DARN), a novel decoder
architecture designed to address this limitation. DARN integrates three key
innovations: (1) a lightweight Task Complexity Predictor (TCP) that estimates
per-sample difficulty, (2) Adaptive Dropout Modulation (ADM), dynamically
adjusting dropout rates (from 0.1 to 0.5) based on predicted complexity, and
(3) Dynamic Capacity Gating (DCG) that modulates channel activation. We provide
theoretical justifications linking DARN's optimization to stationary point
convergence and its mechanism to adaptive information bottlenecks. Empirically,
DARN demonstrates exceptional performance across both major adaptation
paradigms. In full fine-tuning (unfrozen backbone), DARN achieves a new
state-of-the-art on the multi-task GeoBench benchmark (86.66% mIoU, +5.56 pp
over prior SOTA). In efficient adaptation (frozen backbone), DARN achieves
SOTA-competitive accuracy (90.5% mIoU on Sen1Floods11) while delivering
substantial advantages crucial for real-world deployment: superior
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization (+9.5 pp mIoU on AI4SmallFarms),
enhanced robustness (17% relative reduction in corruption error), and improved
performance on minority classes. DARN offers a more intelligent, robust, and
efficient approach to leveraging FMs in critical geospatial applications.

### [5] [Global 3D Reconstruction of Clouds & Tropical Cyclones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04773)
*Shirin Ermis,Cesar Aybar,Lilli Freischem,Stella Girtsou,Kyriaki-Margarita Bintsi,Emiliano Diaz Salas-Porras,Michael Eisinger,William Jones,Anna Jungbluth,Benoit Tremblay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new framework using pre-training and fine-tuning translates 2D satellite imagery into 3D cloud maps for tropical cyclones, enabling global 3D cloud reconstruction even for intense storms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tropical cyclone forecasting is challenging due to limited satellite observations of TC structure and difficulties resolving cloud properties involved in intensification.

Method: Pre-training--fine-tuning pipeline that learns from multiple satellites with global coverage to translate 2D satellite imagery into 3D cloud maps of relevant cloud properties.

Result: First global instantaneous 3D cloud maps that accurately reconstruct 3D structure of intense storms, extending available satellite observations and providing estimates when observations are missing.

Conclusion: This approach is crucial for advancing understanding of TC intensification and improving forecasts by providing comprehensive 3D cloud structure data.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of tropical cyclones (TCs) remains challenging due to
limited satellite observations probing TC structure and difficulties in
resolving cloud properties involved in TC intensification. Recent research has
demonstrated the capabilities of machine learning methods for 3D cloud
reconstruction from satellite observations. However, existing approaches have
been restricted to regions where TCs are uncommon, and are poorly validated for
intense storms. We introduce a new framework, based on a
pre-training--fine-tuning pipeline, that learns from multiple satellites with
global coverage to translate 2D satellite imagery into 3D cloud maps of
relevant cloud properties. We apply our model to a custom-built TC dataset to
evaluate performance in the most challenging and relevant conditions. We show
that we can - for the first time - create global instantaneous 3D cloud maps
and accurately reconstruct the 3D structure of intense storms. Our model not
only extends available satellite observations but also provides estimates when
observations are missing entirely. This is crucial for advancing our
understanding of TC intensification and improving forecasts.

### [6] [EETnet: a CNN for Gaze Detection and Tracking for Smart-Eyewear](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04779)
*Andrea Aspesi,Andrea Simpsi,Aaron Tognoli,Simone Mentasti,Luca Merigo,Matteo Matteucci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EETnet is a CNN for eye tracking using event-based cameras, designed to run on resource-constrained microcontrollers, with both classification and regression versions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing event-based eye tracking solutions often require powerful GPUs and lack deployment on embedded devices, despite event cameras' efficiency advantages.

Method: Developed EETnet CNN for event-based eye tracking, with methodology for training, evaluation, and quantization using public dataset. Created two architectures: classification model for grid-based pupil detection and regression model for pixel-level operation.

Result: Successfully designed a network capable of running on microcontrollers with limited resources while maintaining eye tracking functionality.

Conclusion: EETnet enables efficient event-based eye tracking on embedded devices, bridging the gap between event camera advantages and practical deployment on resource-constrained hardware.

Abstract: Event-based cameras are becoming a popular solution for efficient, low-power
eye tracking. Due to the sparse and asynchronous nature of event data, they
require less processing power and offer latencies in the microsecond range.
However, many existing solutions are limited to validation on powerful GPUs,
with no deployment on real embedded devices. In this paper, we present EETnet,
a convolutional neural network designed for eye tracking using purely
event-based data, capable of running on microcontrollers with limited
resources. Additionally, we outline a methodology to train, evaluate, and
quantize the network using a public dataset. Finally, we propose two versions
of the architecture: a classification model that detects the pupil on a grid
superimposed on the original image, and a regression model that operates at the
pixel level.

### [7] [3D Gaussian Point Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04797)
*Jim James,Ben Wilson,Simon Lucey,James Hays*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D Gaussian Point Encoder is an explicit per-point embedding using learned 3D Gaussians, offering faster and more efficient 3D recognition compared to implicit representations like PointNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move from implicit representations (like PointNet) to explicit geometric representations for 3D recognition tasks, similar to the shift from NeRF to Gaussian Splatting in 3D reconstruction.

Method: Developed optimization techniques using natural gradients and distillation from PointNets to learn Gaussian Basis that reconstructs PointNet activations. Extended filtering techniques from 3D Gaussian Splatting to accelerate performance.

Result: Achieved 2.7x faster speed than comparable PointNet with 46% less memory, 88% fewer FLOPs. In Mamba3D, achieved 1.27x faster speed with 42% memory reduction and 54% FLOPs reduction. Lightweight enough for high framerates on CPU-only devices.

Conclusion: 3D Gaussian Point Encoders provide a more efficient and faster alternative to traditional PointNets for 3D recognition tasks, enabling high performance even on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the 3D Gaussian Point Encoder, an explicit
per-point embedding built on mixtures of learned 3D Gaussians. This explicit
geometric representation for 3D recognition tasks is a departure from widely
used implicit representations such as PointNet. However, it is difficult to
learn 3D Gaussian encoders in end-to-end fashion with standard optimizers. We
develop optimization techniques based on natural gradients and distillation
from PointNets to find a Gaussian Basis that can reconstruct PointNet
activations. The resulting 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are faster and more
parameter efficient than traditional PointNets. As in the 3D reconstruction
literature where there has been considerable interest in the move from implicit
(e.g., NeRF) to explicit (e.g., Gaussian Splatting) representations, we can
take advantage of computational geometry heuristics to accelerate 3D Gaussian
Point Encoders further. We extend filtering techniques from 3D Gaussian
Splatting to construct encoders that run 2.7 times faster as a comparable
accuracy PointNet while using 46% less memory and 88% fewer FLOPs. Furthermore,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian Point Encoders as a component
in Mamba3D, running 1.27 times faster and achieving a reduction in memory and
FLOPs by 42% and 54% respectively. 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are lightweight
enough to achieve high framerates on CPU-only devices.

### [8] [Data Efficiency and Transfer Robustness in Biomedical Image Segmentation: A Study of Redundancy and Forgetting with Cellpose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04803)
*Shuo Zhao,Jianxu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes data redundancy and catastrophic forgetting in biomedical image segmentation using Cellpose. It shows that only 10% of training data is needed for performance saturation, and proposes dataset quantization and selective replay strategies to address cross-domain forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address two underexplored challenges in generalist biomedical image segmentation: (1) training data redundancy and (2) the impact of cross-domain transfer on model retention (catastrophic forgetting).

Method: Proposed dataset quantization (DQ) strategy to construct compact training subsets, conducted cross-domain finetuning experiments, used selective DQ-based replay with 5-10% source data, and explored training domain sequencing.

Result: Image segmentation performance saturates with only 10% of data, revealing substantial redundancy. Cross-domain finetuning causes significant source domain degradation, but selective replay effectively restores source performance while full replay hinders target adaptation. Domain sequencing improves generalization and reduces forgetting.

Conclusion: Efficient biomedical image segmentation requires compact data subsets, retention-aware learning strategies, and informed domain ordering. Data-centric design is crucial for addressing redundancy and catastrophic forgetting in cross-domain applications.

Abstract: Generalist biomedical image segmentation models such as Cellpose are
increasingly applied across diverse imaging modalities and cell types. However,
two critical challenges remain underexplored: (1) the extent of training data
redundancy and (2) the impact of cross domain transfer on model retention. In
this study, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of these challenges
using Cellpose as a case study. First, to assess data redundancy, we propose a
simple dataset quantization (DQ) strategy for constructing compact yet diverse
training subsets. Experiments on the Cyto dataset show that image segmentation
performance saturates with only 10% of the data, revealing substantial
redundancy and potential for training with minimal annotations. Latent space
analysis using MAE embeddings and t-SNE confirms that DQ selected patches
capture greater feature diversity than random sampling. Second, to examine
catastrophic forgetting, we perform cross domain finetuning experiments and
observe significant degradation in source domain performance, particularly when
adapting from generalist to specialist domains. We demonstrate that selective
DQ based replay reintroducing just 5-10% of the source data effectively
restores source performance, while full replay can hinder target adaptation.
Additionally, we find that training domain sequencing improves generalization
and reduces forgetting in multi stage transfer. Our findings highlight the
importance of data centric design in biomedical image segmentation and suggest
that efficient training requires not only compact subsets but also retention
aware learning strategies and informed domain ordering. The code is available
at https://github.com/MMV-Lab/biomedseg-efficiency.

### [9] [An Active Learning Pipeline for Biomedical Image Instance Segmentation with Minimal Human Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04811)
*Shuo Zhao,Yu Zhou,Jianxu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a data-centric AI workflow combining active learning and pseudo-labeling to reduce manual annotation needs in biomedical image segmentation while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations of traditional methods (noisy data handling), nnU-Net (requires substantial annotated data), and foundation models (underperform on specific datasets), aiming to minimize human intervention.

Method: Uses foundation model to generate pseudo-labels for nnU-Net self-configuration, then selects representative core-set for minimal manual annotation to fine-tune nnU-Net.

Result: Significantly reduces need for manual annotations while maintaining competitive segmentation performance.

Conclusion: Provides accessible solution for biomedical researchers to apply state-of-the-art AI techniques in segmentation tasks with minimal annotation requirements.

Abstract: Biomedical image segmentation is critical for precise structure delineation
and downstream analysis. Traditional methods often struggle with noisy data,
while deep learning models such as U-Net have set new benchmarks in
segmentation performance. nnU-Net further automates model configuration, making
it adaptable across datasets without extensive tuning. However, it requires a
substantial amount of annotated data for cross-validation, posing a challenge
when only raw images but no labels are available. Large foundation models offer
zero-shot generalizability, but may underperform on specific datasets with
unique characteristics, limiting their direct use for analysis. This work
addresses these bottlenecks by proposing a data-centric AI workflow that
leverages active learning and pseudo-labeling to combine the strengths of
traditional neural networks and large foundation models while minimizing human
intervention. The pipeline starts by generating pseudo-labels from a foundation
model, which are then used for nnU-Net's self-configuration. Subsequently, a
representative core-set is selected for minimal manual annotation, enabling
effective fine-tuning of the nnU-Net model. This approach significantly reduces
the need for manual annotations while maintaining competitive performance,
providing an accessible solution for biomedical researchers to apply
state-of-the-art AI techniques in their segmentation tasks. The code is

### [10] [Geometry Denoising with Preferred Normal Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04848)
*Manuel Weiß,Lukas Baumgärtner,Roland Herzog,Stephan Schmidt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new geometry denoising method using surface normal priors (label vectors) with embedded segmentation and total variation regularization, solved via split Bregman/ADMM approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a geometry denoising approach that incorporates prior knowledge about preferred surface normal vectors and naturally embeds segmentation during the denoising process.

Method: Formulate denoising as optimization problem using label vectors as normal priors, with total variation regularization. Solve using split Bregman (ADMM) approach where vertex update is based on second-order shape calculus.

Result: The method enables simultaneous geometry denoising and segmentation based on normal vector similarity to predefined label vectors.

Conclusion: The proposed paradigm effectively integrates prior normal knowledge into geometry denoising while naturally performing segmentation, with efficient optimization via split Bregman method.

Abstract: We introduce a new paradigm for geometry denoising using prior knowledge
about the surface normal vector. This prior knowledge comes in the form of a
set of preferred normal vectors, which we refer to as label vectors. A
segmentation problem is naturally embedded in the denoising process. The
segmentation is based on the similarity of the normal vector to the elements of
the set of label vectors. Regularization is achieved by a total variation term.
We formulate a split Bregman (ADMM) approach to solve the resulting
optimization problem. The vertex update step is based on second-order shape
calculus.

### [11] [Self-Supervised Implicit Attention Priors for Point Cloud Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04864)
*Kyle Fogarty,Chenyue Cai,Jing Yang,Zhilin Guo,Cengiz Öztireli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An implicit self-prior approach that learns shape-specific priors directly from input point clouds using cross-attention with learnable embeddings, enabling high-quality surface reconstruction without external training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recovering high-quality surfaces from irregular point clouds is ill-posed without strong geometric priors, and existing methods often require external training data or fail to preserve fine details.

Method: Jointly trains a dictionary of learnable embeddings with an implicit distance field using cross-attention, followed by sampling to extract dense points and normals, then integrates them into robust implicit moving least squares (RIMLS).

Result: Outperforms both classical and learning-based approaches in generating high-fidelity surfaces with superior detail preservation and robustness to common data degradations.

Conclusion: The hybrid strategy effectively preserves fine geometric details while leveraging learned priors to regularize sparse regions, demonstrating the effectiveness of self-supervised learning for surface reconstruction.

Abstract: Recovering high-quality surfaces from irregular point cloud is ill-posed
unless strong geometric priors are available. We introduce an implicit
self-prior approach that distills a shape-specific prior directly from the
input point cloud itself and embeds it within an implicit neural
representation. This is achieved by jointly training a small dictionary of
learnable embeddings with an implicit distance field; at every query location,
the field attends to the dictionary via cross-attention, enabling the network
to capture and reuse repeating structures and long-range correlations inherent
to the shape. Optimized solely with self-supervised point cloud reconstruction
losses, our approach requires no external training data. To effectively
integrate this learned prior while preserving input fidelity, the trained field
is then sampled to extract densely distributed points and analytic normals via
automatic differentiation. We integrate the resulting dense point cloud and
corresponding normals into a robust implicit moving least squares (RIMLS)
formulation. We show this hybrid strategy preserves fine geometric details in
the input data, while leveraging the learned prior to regularize sparse
regions. Experiments show that our method outperforms both classical and
learning-based approaches in generating high-fidelity surfaces with superior
detail preservation and robustness to common data degradations.

### [12] [Clinical-ComBAT: a diffusion-weighted MRI harmonization method for clinical applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04871)
*Gabriel Girard,Manon Edde,Félix Dumais,Yoan David,Matthieu Dumont,Guillaume Theaud,Jean-Christophe Houde,Arnaud Boré,Maxime Descoteaux,Pierre-Marc Jodoin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Clinical-ComBAT is a flexible harmonization method for diffusion-weighted MRI data that overcomes limitations of traditional ComBAT by enabling independent site harmonization, non-linear modeling, and adaptation to small cohorts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ComBAT method has limitations including reliance on linear covariate relationships, homogeneous populations, fixed site numbers, and well-populated sites, which constrain its clinical applicability.

Method: Clinical-ComBAT harmonizes each site independently using a non-linear polynomial data model, site-specific harmonization referenced to a normative site, variance priors adaptable to small cohorts, hyperparameter tuning, and goodness-of-fit metrics.

Result: The method demonstrates improved alignment of diffusion metrics and enhanced applicability for normative modeling on both simulated and real data.

Conclusion: Clinical-ComBAT provides a practical solution for harmonizing DW-MRI data in real-world clinical scenarios with flexible integration of new data and clinics.

Abstract: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) derived scalar maps
are effective for assessing neurodegenerative diseases and microstructural
properties of white matter in large number of brain conditions. However, DW-MRI
inherently limits the combination of data from multiple acquisition sites
without harmonization to mitigate scanner-specific biases. While the widely
used ComBAT method reduces site effects in research, its reliance on linear
covariate relationships, homogeneous populations, fixed site numbers, and well
populated sites constrains its clinical use. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Clinical-ComBAT, a method designed for real-world clinical scenarios.
Clinical-ComBAT harmonizes each site independently, enabling flexibility as new
data and clinics are introduced. It incorporates a non-linear polynomial data
model, site-specific harmonization referenced to a normative site, and variance
priors adaptable to small cohorts. It further includes hyperparameter tuning
and a goodness-of-fit metric for harmonization assessment. We demonstrate its
effectiveness on simulated and real data, showing improved alignment of
diffusion metrics and enhanced applicability for normative modeling.

### [13] [Validating Vision Transformers for Otoscopy: Performance and Data-Leakage Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04872)
*James Ndubuisi,Fernando Auat,Marta Vallejo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision transformers (Swin v1/v2) initially showed superior accuracy (100%/99.1%) for ear disease diagnosis compared to ResNet (99.5%), but performance dropped significantly (83%/82%) after fixing data leakage in preprocessing, highlighting the critical importance of rigorous data handling in medical ML.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the 27% misdiagnosis rate among otolaryngologists by improving diagnostic accuracy for ear diseases using advanced vision transformer models compared to traditional CNNs.

Method: Used Swin transformer models (v1 and v2) on otoscopic video frames from a real-world clinical dataset, with frame selection based on Laplacian and Shannon entropy thresholds, and compared performance against ResNet CNN.

Result: Initial results showed excellent performance (Swin v1: 100%, Swin v2: 99.1%, ResNet: 99.5%), but after correcting data leakage in preprocessing, accuracy dropped significantly (Swin v1/v2: 83%, ResNet: 82%).

Conclusion: While vision transformers show promise for medical diagnosis, rigorous data preprocessing and handling are crucial, and finding the optimal balance between advanced model architectures and effective data processing is key for reliable medical ML applications.

Abstract: This study evaluates the efficacy of vision transformer models, specifically
Swin transformers, in enhancing the diagnostic accuracy of ear diseases
compared to traditional convolutional neural networks. With a reported 27%
misdiagnosis rate among specialist otolaryngologists, improving diagnostic
accuracy is crucial. The research utilised a real-world dataset from the
Department of Otolaryngology at the Clinical Hospital of the Universidad de
Chile, comprising otoscopic videos of ear examinations depicting various middle
and external ear conditions. Frames were selected based on the Laplacian and
Shannon entropy thresholds, with blank frames removed. Initially, Swin v1 and
Swin v2 transformer models achieved accuracies of 100% and 99.1%, respectively,
marginally outperforming the ResNet model (99.5%). These results surpassed
metrics reported in related studies. However, the evaluation uncovered a
critical data leakage issue in the preprocessing step, affecting both this
study and related research using the same raw dataset. After mitigating the
data leakage, model performance decreased significantly. Corrected accuracies
were 83% for both Swin v1 and Swin v2, and 82% for the ResNet model. This
finding highlights the importance of rigorous data handling in machine learning
studies, especially in medical applications. The findings indicate that while
vision transformers show promise, it is essential to find an optimal balance
between the benefits of advanced model architectures and those derived from
effective data preprocessing. This balance is key to developing a reliable
machine learning model for diagnosing ear diseases.

TL;DR: A geospatial deep learning framework using satellite imagery to predict fatal crash risks with uncertainty-aware Beta probability distributions, achieving 17-23% recall improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional traffic safety studies overlook spatial complexity and contextual interactions, while conventional neural networks lack uncertainty quantification, limiting their utility in critical decision-making for roadway safety.

Method: Novel geospatial deep learning framework that leverages satellite imagery as comprehensive spatial input to capture nuanced spatial patterns and environmental risk factors, estimating full Beta probability distributions over fatal crash risk.

Result: Model outperforms baselines with 17-23% improvement in recall (key for flagging potential dangers) and delivers superior calibration, providing reliable and interpretable risk assessments from satellite imagery alone.

Conclusion: The framework enables safer autonomous navigation and offers a highly scalable tool for urban planners and policymakers to enhance roadway safety equitably and cost-effectively through uncertainty-aware predictions.

Abstract: Roadway traffic accidents represent a global health crisis, responsible for
over a million deaths annually and costing many countries up to 3% of their
GDP. Traditional traffic safety studies often examine risk factors in
isolation, overlooking the spatial complexity and contextual interactions
inherent in the built environment. Furthermore, conventional Neural
Network-based risk estimators typically generate point estimates without
conveying model uncertainty, limiting their utility in critical
decision-making. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel geospatial
deep learning framework that leverages satellite imagery as a comprehensive
spatial input. This approach enables the model to capture the nuanced spatial
patterns and embedded environmental risk factors that contribute to fatal crash
risks. Rather than producing a single deterministic output, our model estimates
a full Beta probability distribution over fatal crash risk, yielding accurate
and uncertainty-aware predictions--a critical feature for trustworthy AI in
safety-critical applications. Our model outperforms baselines by achieving a
17-23% improvement in recall, a key metric for flagging potential dangers,
while delivering superior calibration. By providing reliable and interpretable
risk assessments from satellite imagery alone, our method enables safer
autonomous navigation and offers a highly scalable tool for urban planners and
policymakers to enhance roadway safety equitably and cost-effectively.

### [15] [Learning to Restore Multi-Degraded Images via Ingredient Decoupling and Task-Aware Path Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04920)
*Hu Gao,Xiaoning Lei,Ying Zhang,Xichen Xu,Guannan Jiang,Lizhuang Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IMDNet is an adaptive multi-degradation image restoration network that handles multiple coexisting degradations (rain, noise, haze) by decoupling degradation ingredients and dynamically selecting restoration paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing image restoration methods focus on single degradation types, but real-world images often suffer from multiple coexisting degradations, limiting practical effectiveness.

Method: Uses degradation ingredient decoupling blocks (DIDBlock) to separate degradation ingredients statistically, fusion blocks (FBlock) to integrate degradation information, and task adaptation blocks (TABlock) to dynamically activate/fuse functional branches for optimal path selection.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior performance on multi-degradation restoration while maintaining strong competitiveness on single-degradation tasks.

Conclusion: IMDNet provides an effective tightly integrated architecture for handling complex real-world image restoration scenarios with multiple coexisting degradations.

Abstract: Image restoration (IR) aims to recover clean images from degraded
observations. Despite remarkable progress, most existing methods focus on a
single degradation type, whereas real-world images often suffer from multiple
coexisting degradations, such as rain, noise, and haze coexisting in a single
image, which limits their practical effectiveness. In this paper, we propose an
adaptive multi-degradation image restoration network that reconstructs images
by leveraging decoupled representations of degradation ingredients to guide
path selection. Specifically, we design a degradation ingredient decoupling
block (DIDBlock) in the encoder to separate degradation ingredients
statistically by integrating spatial and frequency domain information,
enhancing the recognition of multiple degradation types and making their
feature representations independent. In addition, we present fusion block
(FBlock) to integrate degradation information across all levels using learnable
matrices. In the decoder, we further introduce a task adaptation block
(TABlock) that dynamically activates or fuses functional branches based on the
multi-degradation representation, flexibly selecting optimal restoration paths
under diverse degradation conditions. The resulting tightly integrated
architecture, termed IMDNet, is extensively validated through experiments,
showing superior performance on multi-degradation restoration while maintaining
strong competitiveness on single-degradation tasks.

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence in oral healthcare relies on the
availability of large-scale multimodal datasets that capture the complexity of
clinical practice. In this paper, we present a comprehensive multimodal
dataset, comprising 8775 dental checkups from 4800 patients collected over
eight years (2018-2025), with patients ranging from 10 to 90 years of age. The
dataset includes 50000 intraoral images, 8056 radiographs, and detailed textual

classification of six oro-dental anomalies and generation of complete
diagnostic reports from multimodal inputs. We compared the fine-tuned models
with their base counterparts and GPT-4o. The fine-tuned models achieved
substantial gains over these baselines, validating the dataset and underscoring

*Tharindu Fernando,Clinton Fookes,Sridha Sridharan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel deep learning framework using high-dimensional latent space representations and Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (MAARL) for robust deepfake watermarking that balances robustness against benign distortions with sensitivity to malicious tampering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapid advances in generative AI create increasingly realistic deepfakes that challenge law enforcement and public trust. Existing passive detectors struggle to generalize to new deepfake types, while current watermarking methods fail to balance robustness against benign distortions with sensitivity to malicious tampering.

Method: Developed a learnable watermark embedder operating in latent space to capture high-level image semantics, combined with MAARL paradigm where a watermarking agent interacts with adversarial attacker agent simulating benign and malicious image manipulations to achieve optimal robustness-fragility balance.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on CelebA and CelebA-HQ benchmarks show consistent outperformance over state-of-the-art methods, achieving improvements of over 4.5% on CelebA and more than 5.3% on CelebA-HQ under challenging manipulation scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the limitations of existing deepfake detection methods by providing an adaptive watermarking approach that maintains robustness against benign distortions while remaining sensitive to malicious tampering through the MAARL paradigm.

Abstract: Rapid advances in generative AI have led to increasingly realistic deepfakes,
posing growing challenges for law enforcement and public trust. Existing
passive deepfake detectors struggle to keep pace, largely due to their
dependence on specific forgery artifacts, which limits their ability to
generalize to new deepfake types. Proactive deepfake detection using watermarks
has emerged to address the challenge of identifying high-quality synthetic
media. However, these methods often struggle to balance robustness against
benign distortions with sensitivity to malicious tampering. This paper
introduces a novel deep learning framework that harnesses high-dimensional
latent space representations and the Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning (MAARL) paradigm to develop a robust and adaptive watermarking
approach. Specifically, we develop a learnable watermark embedder that operates
in the latent space, capturing high-level image semantics, while offering
precise control over message encoding and extraction. The MAARL paradigm
empowers the learnable watermarking agent to pursue an optimal balance between
robustness and fragility by interacting with a dynamic curriculum of benign and
malicious image manipulations simulated by an adversarial attacker agent.
Comprehensive evaluations on the CelebA and CelebA-HQ benchmarks reveal that
our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving
improvements of over 4.5% on CelebA and more than 5.3% on CelebA-HQ under
challenging manipulation scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLM enables 3D Gaussian Splatting to render large scenes on consumer GPUs by offloading Gaussians to CPU memory and using smart pipelining to overlap communication and computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting has high memory requirements that exceed GPU capacity for large scenes, limiting its practical use on consumer hardware.

Method: Offloads Gaussians to CPU memory and loads them to GPU only when needed, using pipelining to overlap GPU-CPU communication with computation, and reduces communication volume through optimized access patterns.

Result: Can render scenes with 100 million Gaussians on a single RTX4090 while achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: CLM successfully enables large-scale 3DGS rendering on consumer GPUs through efficient memory management and communication optimization.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is an increasingly popular novel view synthesis
approach due to its fast rendering time, and high-quality output. However,
scaling 3DGS to large (or intricate) scenes is challenging due to its large
memory requirement, which exceed most GPU's memory capacity. In this paper, we
describe CLM, a system that allows 3DGS to render large scenes using a single
consumer-grade GPU, e.g., RTX4090. It does so by offloading Gaussians to CPU
memory, and loading them into GPU memory only when necessary. To reduce
performance and communication overheads, CLM uses a novel offloading strategy
that exploits observations about 3DGS's memory access pattern for pipelining,
and thus overlap GPU-to-CPU communication, GPU computation and CPU computation.
Furthermore, we also exploit observation about the access pattern to reduce
communication volume. Our evaluation shows that the resulting implementation
can render a large scene that requires 100 million Gaussians on a single
RTX4090 and achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PDS proposes a novel framework for cross-modal MRI synthesis between fMRI and dMRI using pattern-aware dual-modal 3D diffusion and tissue refinement networks, achieving state-of-the-art results in both synthesis quality and clinical diagnostic performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing modalities in MRI (especially fMRI and dMRI) pose major barriers to clinical use of neurodegenerative disease studies. Existing GAN- and diffusion-based approaches have limitations in fMRI-dMRI synthesis due to significant signal differences and inadequate integration of disease-related neuroanatomical patterns.

Method: PDS introduces two key innovations: (1) a pattern-aware dual-modal 3D diffusion framework for cross-modality learning, and (2) a tissue refinement network integrated with efficient microstructure refinement to maintain structural fidelity and fine details.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results on OASIS-3, ADNI, and in-house datasets with PSNR/SSIM scores of 29.83 dB/90.84% for fMRI synthesis (+1.54 dB/+4.12% over baselines) and 30.00 dB/77.55% for dMRI synthesis (+1.02 dB/+2.2%). Clinical validation showed strong diagnostic performance with 67.92%/66.02%/64.15% accuracy for NC vs. MCI vs. AD classification.

Conclusion: PDS effectively addresses the challenges of fMRI-dMRI synthesis through pattern-aware diffusion modeling and tissue refinement, demonstrating superior performance in both synthesis quality and clinical utility for neurodegenerative disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), especially functional MRI (fMRI) and
diffusion MRI (dMRI), is essential for studying neurodegenerative diseases.
However, missing modalities pose a major barrier to their clinical use.
Although GAN- and diffusion model-based approaches have shown some promise in
modality completion, they remain limited in fMRI-dMRI synthesis due to (1)
significant BOLD vs. diffusion-weighted signal differences between fMRI and
dMRI in time/gradient axis, and (2) inadequate integration of disease-related
neuroanatomical patterns during generation. To address these challenges, we
propose PDS, introducing two key innovations: (1) a pattern-aware dual-modal 3D
diffusion framework for cross-modality learning, and (2) a tissue refinement
network integrated with a efficient microstructure refinement to maintain
structural fidelity and fine details. Evaluated on OASIS-3, ADNI, and in-house
datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, with PSNR/SSIM scores
of 29.83 dB/90.84\% for fMRI synthesis (+1.54 dB/+4.12\% over baselines) and
30.00 dB/77.55\% for dMRI synthesis (+1.02 dB/+2.2\%). In clinical validation,
the synthesized data show strong diagnostic performance, achieving
67.92\%/66.02\%/64.15\% accuracy (NC vs. MCI vs. AD) in hybrid real-synthetic

*Jian Wang,Yixing Yong,Haixia Bi,Lijun He,Fan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to probe deep neural networks' geometric understanding by optimizing shapes as semantic carriers, interpretability tools, and adversarial examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks have focused heavily on texture while neglecting geometric understanding. The authors aim to investigate DNNs' geometric perception capabilities.

Method: An end-to-end differentiable framework combining Fourier series for shape parameterization, winding number-based pixel mapping, and signal energy constraints for efficient optimization of physically plausible shapes.

Result: Optimized shapes can generate high-confidence classifications, precisely isolate model salient regions as interpretability tools, and create generalizable adversarial examples that deceive downstream visual tasks.

Conclusion: The work provides a versatile framework for probing DNNs' geometric understanding and opens new frontiers for challenging and understanding machine perception.

Abstract: While both shape and texture are fundamental to visual recognition, research
on deep neural networks (DNNs) has predominantly focused on the latter, leaving
their geometric understanding poorly probed. Here, we show: first, that
optimized shapes can act as potent semantic carriers, generating
high-confidence classifications from inputs defined purely by their geometry;
second, that they are high-fidelity interpretability tools that precisely
isolate a model's salient regions; and third, that they constitute a new,
generalizable adversarial paradigm capable of deceiving downstream visual
tasks. This is achieved through an end-to-end differentiable framework that
unifies a powerful Fourier series to parameterize arbitrary shapes, a winding
number-based mapping to translate them into the pixel grid required by DNNs,
and signal energy constraints that enhance optimization efficiency while
ensuring physically plausible shapes. Our work provides a versatile framework
for probing the geometric world of DNNs and opens new frontiers for challenging
and understanding machine perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional TDA methods like persistent homology are computationally demanding, and there's a lack of labeled 3D data with appropriate class distributions and diversity for supervised learning in TDA tasks.

Method: Systematic generation of labeled 3D datasets using the Repulsive Surface algorithm, which allows control over topological invariants like hole count, and training a genus estimator network using a 3D convolutional transformer architecture.

Result: The synthetic dataset enables training of neural network estimators, with observed decrease in accuracy as deformations increase, highlighting the importance of both topological and geometric complexity for generalized estimators.

Conclusion: The generated dataset fills a gap in labeled 3D datasets for TDA, providing varied geometry with topological labeling suitable for training and benchmarking neural network estimators in topological data analysis.

Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) involves techniques of analyzing the
underlying structure and connectivity of data. However, traditional methods
like persistent homology can be computationally demanding, motivating the
development of neural network-based estimators capable of reducing
computational overhead and inference time. A key barrier to advancing these
methods is the lack of labeled 3D data with class distributions and diversity
tailored specifically for supervised learning in TDA tasks. To address this, we
introduce a novel approach for systematically generating labeled 3D datasets
using the Repulsive Surface algorithm, allowing control over topological
invariants, such as hole count. The resulting dataset offers varied geometry
with topological labeling, making it suitable for training and benchmarking
neural network estimators. This paper uses a synthetic 3D dataset to train a
genus estimator network, created using a 3D convolutional transformer
architecture. An observed decrease in accuracy as deformations increase
highlights the role of not just topological complexity, but also geometric
complexity, when training generalized estimators. This dataset fills a gap in
labeled 3D datasets and generation for training and evaluating models and
techniques for TDA.

TL;DR: Proposes DRE-SLCL method for end-to-end WSI representation using dynamic residual encoding with slide-level contrastive learning to handle gigapixel slides with tens of thousands of tiles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training end-to-end WSI representation models is challenging due to GPU limitations when processing gigapixel slides containing tens of thousands of image tiles in a single mini-batch.

Method: Uses memory bank to store tile features across all WSIs, samples tiles during training, combines sampled features with memory bank features using residual encoding, and applies slide-level contrastive learning with histopathology reports.

Result: Experiments on cancer subtyping, cancer recognition, and mutation prediction tasks demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed DRE-SLCL method.

Conclusion: DRE-SLCL provides an effective solution for end-to-end WSI representation learning by overcoming GPU memory limitations through dynamic residual encoding and contrastive learning.

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) representation is critical for cancer subtyping,
cancer recognition and mutation prediction.Training an end-to-end WSI
representation model poses significant challenges, as a standard gigapixel
slide can contain tens of thousands of image tiles, making it difficult to
compute gradients of all tiles in a single mini-batch due to current GPU
limitations. To address this challenge, we propose a method of dynamic residual
encoding with slide-level contrastive learning (DRE-SLCL) for end-to-end WSI
representation. Our approach utilizes a memory bank to store the features of
tiles across all WSIs in the dataset. During training, a mini-batch usually
contains multiple WSIs. For each WSI in the batch, a subset of tiles is
randomly sampled and their features are computed using a tile encoder. Then,
additional tile features from the same WSI are selected from the memory bank.
The representation of each individual WSI is generated using a residual
encoding technique that incorporates both the sampled features and those
retrieved from the memory bank. Finally, the slide-level contrastive loss is
computed based on the representations and histopathology reports ofthe WSIs
within the mini-batch. Experiments conducted over cancer subtyping, cancer
recognition, and mutation prediction tasks proved the effectiveness of the
proposed DRE-SLCL method.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inherent bias in LVLM architectures toward language modality caused by simply appending visual embeddings to text sequences, which leads to poor visual grounding and hallucinations.

Method: Propose refining textual embeddings by integrating average-pooled visual features as a simple yet effective approach to incorporate visual information.

Result: Demonstrably improves visual grounding and significantly reduces hallucinations on established benchmarks.

Conclusion: While average pooling is effective, more sophisticated fusion methods could further enhance visual grounding and cross-modal alignment, but this is left for future work as the main focus is highlighting modality imbalance and its impact.

Abstract: In this work, we identify an inherent bias in prevailing LVLM architectures
toward the language modality, largely resulting from the common practice of
simply appending visual embeddings to the input text sequence. To address this,
we propose a simple yet effective method that refines textual embeddings by
integrating average-pooled visual features. Our approach demonstrably improves
visual grounding and significantly reduces hallucinations on established
benchmarks. While average pooling offers a straightforward, robust, and
efficient means of incorporating visual information, we believe that more
sophisticated fusion methods could further enhance visual grounding and
cross-modal alignment. Given that the primary focus of this work is to
highlight the modality imbalance and its impact on hallucinations -- and to
show that refining textual embeddings with visual information mitigates this
issue -- we leave exploration of advanced fusion strategies for future work.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PITTA is a novel test-time adaptation framework for monocular depth estimation that enables pose-agnostic adaptation without camera pose information and uses instance-aware masking for dynamic objects, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular depth estimation models often need to be deployed in environments different from training conditions, and existing test-time adaptation methods are ineffective in diverse dynamic environments.

Method: Proposes PITTA with two key strategies: (1) pose-agnostic TTA paradigm that doesn't require camera pose information, and (2) instance-aware image masking that extracts masks for dynamic objects using pretrained panoptic segmentation, plus an edge extraction method for images and depth maps.

Result: Extensive experiments on DrivingStereo and Waymo datasets show PITTA surpasses state-of-the-art techniques with remarkable performance improvements in monocular depth estimation during test-time adaptation.

Conclusion: PITTA provides an effective test-time adaptation framework for monocular depth estimation that works well in diverse dynamic environments without requiring camera pose information.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE), inferring pixel-level depths in single RGB
images from a monocular camera, plays a crucial and pivotal role in a variety
of AI applications demanding a three-dimensional (3D) topographical scene. In
the real-world scenarios, MDE models often need to be deployed in environments
with different conditions from those for training. Test-time (domain)
adaptation (TTA) is one of the compelling and practical approaches to address
the issue. Although there have been notable advancements in TTA for MDE,
particularly in a self-supervised manner, existing methods are still
ineffective and problematic when applied to diverse and dynamic environments.
To break through this challenge, we propose a novel and high-performing TTA
framework for MDE, named PITTA. Our approach incorporates two key innovative
strategies: (i) pose-agnostic TTA paradigm for MDE and (ii) instance-aware
image masking. Specifically, PITTA enables highly effective TTA on a pretrained
MDE network in a pose-agnostic manner without resorting to any camera pose
information. Besides, our instance-aware masking strategy extracts
instance-wise masks for dynamic objects (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, etc.)
from a segmentation mask produced by a pretrained panoptic segmentation
network, by removing static objects including background components. To further
boost performance, we also present a simple yet effective edge extraction
methodology for the input image (i.e., a single monocular image) and depth map.
Extensive experimental evaluations on DrivingStereo and Waymo datasets with
varying environmental conditions demonstrate that our proposed framework,
PITTA, surpasses the existing state-of-the-art techniques with remarkable
performance improvements in MDE during TTA.

TL;DR: Adversarial examples are more sensitive to occlusion than clean samples, enabling detection via confidence fluctuation analysis with sliding window masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand intrinsic differences between adversarial and clean samples for improving DNN robustness and adversarial detection.

Method: Introduced Sliding Mask Confidence Entropy (SMCE) to quantify model confidence fluctuation under occlusion, and proposed SWM-AED detection method based on occlusion sensitivity.

Result: Adversarial examples show significantly higher confidence volatility under occlusion; SWM-AED achieves 62-96.5% detection accuracy across classifiers and attacks on CIFAR-10.

Conclusion: Occlusion sensitivity is a key intrinsic property distinguishing adversarial examples, enabling effective detection without catastrophic overfitting from adversarial training.

Abstract: Understanding intrinsic differences between adversarial examples and clean
samples is key to enhancing DNN robustness and detection against adversarial
attacks. This study first empirically finds that image-based adversarial
examples are notably sensitive to occlusion. Controlled experiments on CIFAR-10
used nine canonical attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD) to generate adversarial examples,
paired with original samples for evaluation. We introduce Sliding Mask
Confidence Entropy (SMCE) to quantify model confidence fluctuation under
occlusion. Using 1800+ test images, SMCE calculations supported by Mask Entropy
Field Maps and statistical distributions show adversarial examples have
significantly higher confidence volatility under occlusion than originals.
Based on this, we propose Sliding Window Mask-based Adversarial Example
Detection (SWM-AED), which avoids catastrophic overfitting of conventional
adversarial training. Evaluations across classifiers and attacks on CIFAR-10
demonstrate robust performance, with accuracy over 62% in most cases and up to
96.5%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable privacy-preserving, low-light, and low-cost motion capture without specialized equipment, addressing the ill-posed nature of inferring full-body motion from pressure signals alone.

Method: Uses a dual-level feature extractor to interpret pressure data, followed by a hierarchical diffusion model that leverages both physical pressure cues and semantic text guidance to generate motion.

Result: The method generates high-fidelity, physically plausible motions and establishes a new state-of-the-art for pressure-based motion capture.

Conclusion: Pressure2Motion is a pioneering work that successfully combines pressure data and linguistic priors for motion generation, with publicly released code and benchmarks.

Abstract: We present Pressure2Motion, a novel motion capture algorithm that synthesizes
human motion from a ground pressure sequence and text prompt. It eliminates the
need for specialized lighting setups, cameras, or wearable devices, making it
suitable for privacy-preserving, low-light, and low-cost motion capture
scenarios. Such a task is severely ill-posed due to the indeterminate nature of
the pressure signals to full-body motion. To address this issue, we introduce
Pressure2Motion, a generative model that leverages pressure features as input
and utilizes a text prompt as a high-level guiding constraint. Specifically,
our model utilizes a dual-level feature extractor that accurately interprets
pressure data, followed by a hierarchical diffusion model that discerns
broad-scale movement trajectories and subtle posture adjustments. Both the
physical cues gained from the pressure sequence and the semantic guidance
derived from descriptive texts are leveraged to guide the motion generation
with precision. To the best of our knowledge, Pressure2Motion is a pioneering
work in leveraging both pressure data and linguistic priors for motion
generation, and the established MPL benchmark is the first benchmark for this
task. Experiments show our method generates high-fidelity, physically plausible
motions, establishing a new state-of-the-art for this task. The codes and
benchmarks will be publicly released upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NTP-MRISeg reformulates medical referring image segmentation as an autoregressive next-token prediction task using unified multimodal sequences, eliminating complex fusion designs and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify the complex multimodal fusion and multi-stage decoder designs in existing MRIS approaches by reformulating the problem as a unified autoregressive sequence prediction task.

Method: Proposes NTP-MRISeg framework with three key strategies: Next-k Token Prediction (NkTP) to reduce cumulative errors, Token-level Contrastive Learning (TCL) for boundary sensitivity, and memory-based Hard Error Token (HET) optimization for difficult tokens.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on QaTa-COV19 and MosMedData+ datasets, demonstrating superior segmentation accuracy compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: NTP-MRISeg provides a streamlined and effective alternative to traditional MRIS pipelines by leveraging unified multimodal sequences and addressing key challenges through novel training strategies.

Abstract: Medical Referring Image Segmentation (MRIS) involves segmenting target
regions in medical images based on natural language descriptions. While
achieving promising results, recent approaches usually involve complex design
of multimodal fusion or multi-stage decoders. In this work, we propose
NTP-MRISeg, a novel framework that reformulates MRIS as an autoregressive
next-token prediction task over a unified multimodal sequence of tokenized
image, text, and mask representations. This formulation streamlines model
design by eliminating the need for modality-specific fusion and external
segmentation models, supports a unified architecture for end-to-end training.
It also enables the use of pretrained tokenizers from emerging large-scale
multimodal models, enhancing generalization and adaptability. More importantly,
to address challenges under this formulation-such as exposure bias, long-tail
token distributions, and fine-grained lesion edges-we propose three novel
strategies: (1) a Next-k Token Prediction (NkTP) scheme to reduce cumulative
prediction errors, (2) Token-level Contrastive Learning (TCL) to enhance
boundary sensitivity and mitigate long-tail distribution effects, and (3) a
memory-based Hard Error Token (HET) optimization strategy that emphasizes
difficult tokens during training. Extensive experiments on the QaTa-COV19 and
MosMedData+ datasets demonstrate that NTP-MRISeg achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, offering a streamlined and effective alternative to traditional
MRIS pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4D3R is a pose-free dynamic neural rendering framework that decouples static and dynamic components using motion-aware bundle adjustment and efficient Gaussian splatting, achieving superior performance with reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Novel view synthesis from monocular videos of dynamic scenes with unknown camera poses remains challenging, as existing methods like NeRF and 3DGS struggle with dynamic content and rely on pre-computed poses.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Uses 3D foundational models for initial pose/geometry estimation, 2) Motion-aware refinement with MA-BA module (transformer priors + SAM2 for dynamic segmentation) and MA-GS representation (control points with deformation field MLP and linear blend skinning).

Result: Achieves up to 1.8dB PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios with large dynamic objects, while reducing computational requirements by 5x.

Conclusion: 4D3R provides an effective pose-free solution for dynamic scene rendering that significantly outperforms existing methods in both quality and efficiency.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis from monocular videos of dynamic scenes with unknown
camera poses remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics.
While recent advances in 3D representations such as Neural Radiance Fields
(NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown promising results for static
scenes, they struggle with dynamic content and typically rely on pre-computed
camera poses. We present 4D3R, a pose-free dynamic neural rendering framework
that decouples static and dynamic components through a two-stage approach. Our
method first leverages 3D foundational models for initial pose and geometry
estimation, followed by motion-aware refinement. 4D3R introduces two key
technical innovations: (1) a motion-aware bundle adjustment (MA-BA) module that
combines transformer-based learned priors with SAM2 for robust dynamic object
segmentation, enabling more accurate camera pose refinement; and (2) an
efficient Motion-Aware Gaussian Splatting (MA-GS) representation that uses
control points with a deformation field MLP and linear blend skinning to model
dynamic motion, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining
high-quality reconstruction. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 1.8dB PSNR improvement
over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with large
dynamic objects, while reducing computational requirements by 5x compared to
previous dynamic scene representations.

*Mohamed Sanim Akremi,Rim Slama,Hedi Tabia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an online skeleton-based motion recognition system using SPD matrix representation and Siamese network for continuous detection and classification of motions in streaming sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing skeleton-based approaches focus on segment-based recognition and are not suitable for online scenarios where continuous motion detection is needed in real-time applications.

Method: Uses a two-component system: detector and classifier based on Semi-Positive Definite (SPD) matrix representation and Siamese network to learn semantic similarity for predicting motion intervals in unsegmented sequences.

Result: Extensive experiments on hand gesture and body action benchmarks show the system outperforms state-of-the-art methods in most cases, proving accuracy for online recognition.

Conclusion: The proposed system provides flexible continuous motion detection and recognition capability suitable for real-time online applications, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Online continuous motion recognition is a hot topic of research since it is
more practical in real life application cases. Recently, Skeleton-based
approaches have become increasingly popular, demonstrating the power of using
such 3D temporal data. However, most of these works have focused on
segment-based recognition and are not suitable for the online scenarios. In
this paper, we propose an online recognition system for skeleton sequence
streaming composed from two main components: a detector and a classifier, which
use a Semi-Positive Definite (SPD) matrix representation and a Siamese network.
The powerful statistical representations for the skeletal data given by the SPD
matrices and the learning of their semantic similarity by the Siamese network
enable the detector to predict time intervals of the motions throughout an
unsegmented sequence. In addition, they ensure the classifier capability to
recognize the motion in each predicted interval. The proposed detector is
flexible and able to identify the kinetic state continuously. We conduct
extensive experiments on both hand gesture and body action recognition
benchmarks to prove the accuracy of our online recognition system which in most
cases outperforms state-of-the-art performances.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Role-SynthCLIP is a data synthesis framework that uses multi-perspective role-playing prompts with MLLMs to generate semantically diverse captions, improving CLIP model performance with fewer training pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic data generation methods focus on increasing data volume but result in limited semantic diversity and redundant captions, which limits CLIP model effectiveness.

Method: Proposes Role-SynthCLIP framework that uses multi-perspective role-playing prompts (e.g., compositional analyst, interpreter of image context) to guide MLLMs in generating semantically diverse captions from distinct viewpoints.

Result: CLIP-B/16 model trained on only 1 million Role-SynthCLIP pairs achieves 64.1% Recall@1 on MS COCO, surpassing the best existing synthetic baseline (trained on 5M pairs) by 2.8 percentage points.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances semantic diversity and fine-grained image-text alignment of synthetic pairs, improving caption expressiveness and accuracy while maintaining the same number of image-text pairs.

Abstract: The effectiveness of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models
critically depends on the semantic diversity and quality of their training
data. However, while existing synthetic data generation methods primarily focus
on increasing data volume, such emphasis often leads to limited semantic
diversity and redundant or shallow captions. To address this limitation, we
propose Role-SynthCLIP, a novel data synthesis framework that leverages
multi-perspective role-playing prompts (e.g., a compositional analyst, an
interpreter of image context) to guide Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
in generating semantically diverse captions from distinct viewpoints. This
mechanism enhances the semantic diversity and fine-grained image-text alignment
of synthetic pairs, thereby improving caption expressiveness and accuracy while
keeping the total number of image-text pairs unchanged. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. A CLIP-B/16 model
trained on only 1 million Role-SynthCLIP pairs achieves a Recall@1 of 64.1% on
the MS COCO validation set, surpassing the best existing synthetic data
baseline (trained on 5M pairs) by 2.8 percentage points. The code and trained
models are released at https://github.com/huangfu170/Role-SynthCLIP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurgiATM is a lightweight plug-and-play module for surgical smoke removal that bridges physics-based atmospheric models with deep learning, enhancing existing desmoking methods without adding trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical smoke during laparoscopic procedures degrades visual quality, increasing surgical error risks and hindering clinical decision-making and computer-assisted analysis, making smoke removal critical for patient safety and operative efficiency.

Method: SurgiATM statistically combines physics-based atmospheric models with data-driven deep learning, designed as a plug-and-play module with only two hyperparameters and no additional trainable weights that can integrate with various surgical desmoking architectures.

Result: Experiments on three public surgical datasets with ten desmoking methods show SurgiATM commonly reduces restoration errors and enhances generalizability across multiple procedures without adding trainable layers or weights.

Conclusion: SurgiATM provides a convenient, low-cost, effective, and generalizable solution for surgical smoke removal that preserves original network architectures with minimal computational overhead while improving accuracy and stability.

Abstract: During laparoscopic surgery, smoke generated by tissue cauterization can
significantly degrade the visual quality of endoscopic frames, increasing the
risk of surgical errors and hindering both clinical decision-making and
computer-assisted visual analysis. Consequently, removing surgical smoke is
critical to ensuring patient safety and maintaining operative efficiency. In
this study, we propose the Surgical Atmospheric Model (SurgiATM) for surgical
smoke removal. SurgiATM statistically bridges a physics-based atmospheric model
and data-driven deep learning models, combining the superior generalizability
of the former with the high accuracy of the latter. Furthermore, SurgiATM is
designed as a lightweight, plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly
integrated into diverse surgical desmoking architectures to enhance their
accuracy and stability, better meeting clinical requirements. It introduces
only two hyperparameters and no additional trainable weights, preserving the
original network architecture with minimal computational and modification
overhead. We conduct extensive experiments on three public surgical datasets
with ten desmoking methods, involving multiple network architectures and
covering diverse procedures, including cholecystectomy, partial nephrectomy,
and diaphragm dissection. The results demonstrate that incorporating SurgiATM
commonly reduces the restoration errors of existing models and relatively
enhances their generalizability, without adding any trainable layers or
weights. This highlights the convenience, low cost, effectiveness, and
generalizability of the proposed method. The code for SurgiATM is released at

TL;DR: DeepEyesV2 is an agentic multimodal model that integrates tool use (code execution, web search) with reasoning through a two-stage training pipeline and demonstrates effective real-world multimodal reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic multimodal models need to not only understand text and images but also actively invoke external tools and integrate these operations into reasoning processes.

Method: Two-stage training pipeline: cold-start stage to establish tool-use patterns, followed by reinforcement learning stage to refine tool invocation. Uses curated diverse training dataset with examples where tool use is beneficial.

Result: DeepEyesV2 shows effectiveness across real-world understanding, mathematical reasoning, and search-intensive tasks. Exhibits task-adaptive tool invocation and selective tool use based on context through reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: The study provides guidance for developing agentic multimodal models, demonstrating that reinforcement learning enables complex tool combinations and context-aware tool selection.

Abstract: Agentic multimodal models should not only comprehend text and images, but
also actively invoke external tools, such as code execution environments and
web search, and integrate these operations into reasoning. In this work, we
introduce DeepEyesV2 and explore how to build an agentic multimodal model from
the perspectives of data construction, training methods, and model evaluation.
We observe that direct reinforcement learning alone fails to induce robust
tool-use behavior. This phenomenon motivates a two-stage training pipeline: a
cold-start stage to establish tool-use patterns, and reinforcement learning
stage to further refine tool invocation. We curate a diverse, moderately
challenging training dataset, specifically including examples where tool use is
beneficial. We further introduce RealX-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate real-world multimodal reasoning, which inherently requires
the integration of multiple capabilities, including perception, search, and
reasoning. We evaluate DeepEyesV2 on RealX-Bench and other representative
benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness across real-world understanding,
mathematical reasoning, and search-intensive tasks. Moreover, DeepEyesV2
exhibits task-adaptive tool invocation, tending to use image operations for
perception tasks and numerical computations for reasoning tasks. Reinforcement
learning further enables complex tool combinations and allows model to
selectively invoke tools based on context. We hope our study can provide
guidance for community in developing agentic multimodal models.

TL;DR: Proposes DPPP, a dual-stage framework using diffusion models to generate privacy-preserving virtual data for person re-identification, achieving SOTA generalization performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns in person Re-ID by creating virtual datasets that avoid sensitive real-world images, while overcoming limitations of existing virtual datasets like complex construction and poor domain generalization.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Generate diverse virtual dataset (GenePerson) using multi-dimensional prompts with diffusion models; 2) Use Prompt-driven Disentanglement Mechanism with contrastive learning to separate style and content features for domain-invariant learning.

Result: GenePerson dataset with 130,519 images of 6,641 identities. Models trained with PDM achieve state-of-the-art generalization performance, surpassing those on both real and virtual Re-ID datasets.

Conclusion: DPPP provides an effective privacy-preserving solution for person Re-ID that generates high-quality virtual data and learns domain-invariant features, enabling better generalization to real scenarios.

Abstract: With growing concerns over data privacy, researchers have started using
virtual data as an alternative to sensitive real-world images for training
person re-identification (Re-ID) models. However, existing virtual datasets
produced by game engines still face challenges such as complex construction and
poor domain generalization, making them difficult to apply in real scenarios.
To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-stage Prompt-driven
Privacy-preserving Paradigm (DPPP). In the first stage, we generate rich
prompts incorporating multi-dimensional attributes such as pedestrian
appearance, illumination, and viewpoint that drive the diffusion model to
synthesize diverse data end-to-end, building a large-scale virtual dataset
named GenePerson with 130,519 images of 6,641 identities. In the second stage,
we propose a Prompt-driven Disentanglement Mechanism (PDM) to learn
domain-invariant generalization features. With the aid of contrastive learning,
we employ two textual inversion networks to map images into pseudo-words
representing style and content, respectively, thereby constructing
style-disentangled content prompts to guide the model in learning
domain-invariant content features at the image level. Experiments demonstrate
that models trained on GenePerson with PDM achieve state-of-the-art
generalization performance, surpassing those on popular real and virtual Re-ID
datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper exposes flaws in Chamfer Distance-based metrics for evaluating generated point clouds and proposes a new metric (SNC) and architecture (Diffusion Point Transformer) that achieve state-of-the-art results on ShapeNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current metrics for evaluating generated point clouds lack robustness and fail to capture geometric fidelity and local shape consistency, while existing generative models need improvement in quality.

Method: Proposed Surface Normal Concordance (SNC) metric for surface similarity evaluation, introduced sample alignment and Density-Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD), and developed Diffusion Point Transformer architecture using transformer-based models for point cloud generation.

Result: Extensive experiments on ShapeNet show the proposed model outperforms previous solutions and achieves new state-of-the-art in generated point cloud quality.

Conclusion: The combination of improved evaluation metrics (SNC, DCD with alignment) and the novel Diffusion Point Transformer architecture provides more comprehensive evaluation and higher-quality point cloud generation.

Abstract: As 3D point clouds become a cornerstone of modern technology, the need for
sophisticated generative models and reliable evaluation metrics has grown
exponentially. In this work, we first expose that some commonly used metrics
for evaluating generated point clouds, particularly those based on Chamfer
Distance (CD), lack robustness against defects and fail to capture geometric
fidelity and local shape consistency when used as quality indicators. We
further show that introducing samples alignment prior to distance calculation
and replacing CD with Density-Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) are simple yet
essential steps to ensure the consistency and robustness of point cloud
generative model evaluation metrics. While existing metrics primarily focus on
directly comparing 3D Euclidean coordinates, we present a novel metric, named
Surface Normal Concordance (SNC), which approximates surface similarity by
comparing estimated point normals. This new metric, when combined with
traditional ones, provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the quality of
generated samples. Finally, leveraging recent advancements in transformer-based
models for point cloud analysis, such as serialized patch attention , we
propose a new architecture for generating high-fidelity 3D structures, the
Diffusion Point Transformer. We perform extensive experiments and comparisons
on the ShapeNet dataset, showing that our model outperforms previous solutions,
particularly in terms of quality of generated point clouds, achieving new
state-of-the-art. Code available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision models trained on synthetic data with fixed parameters struggle to generalize to complex weather degradations in real-world scenarios.

Method: Construct HFLS-Weather dataset, then implement dual-level RL framework: local level refines weather-specific restoration models through perturbation-driven quality optimization; global level uses meta-controller to dynamically orchestrate model selection and execution order based on scene degradation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of adverse weather scenarios and enables continuous adaptation to real-world conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses adverse weather visual perception challenges through physics-driven data and adaptive reinforcement learning, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Adverse weather severely impairs real-world visual perception, while existing
vision models trained on synthetic data with fixed parameters struggle to
generalize to complex degradations. To address this, we first construct
HFLS-Weather, a physics-driven, high-fidelity dataset that simulates diverse
weather phenomena, and then design a dual-level reinforcement learning
framework initialized with HFLS-Weather for cold-start training. Within this
framework, at the local level, weather-specific restoration models are refined
through perturbation-driven image quality optimization, enabling reward-based
learning without paired supervision; at the global level, a meta-controller
dynamically orchestrates model selection and execution order according to scene
degradation. This framework enables continuous adaptation to real-world
conditions and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of
adverse weather scenarios. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study explores using deep learning on raw OCT B-scan images for early Alzheimer's disease detection, achieving an AUC of 0.62 with ResNet-34, which provides a baseline but falls short of clinical application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies focused on segmented retinal layer thickness measurements for AD detection, but this study aims to directly classify raw OCT B-scan images using deep learning for early AD prediction, which is more challenging than diagnosis.

Method: Fine-tuned multiple pretrained models (ImageNet-based networks and OCT-specific RETFound transformer) using subject-level cross-validation from UK Biobank, with standard and OCT-specific augmentation techniques and a year-weighted loss function prioritizing cases diagnosed within four years.

Result: ResNet-34 achieved the most stable results with an AUC of 0.62 in the 4-year cohort. Explainability analyses confirmed localized structural differences in the central macular subfield between AD and control groups.

Conclusion: The findings provide a baseline for OCT-based AD prediction, highlight challenges in detecting subtle retinal biomarkers years before diagnosis, and point to the need for larger datasets and multimodal approaches.

Abstract: Alterations in retinal layer thickness, measurable using Optical Coherence
Tomography (OCT), have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as
Alzheimer's disease (AD). While previous studies have mainly focused on
segmented layer thickness measurements, this study explored the direct
classification of OCT B-scan images for the early detection of AD. To our
knowledge, this is the first application of deep learning to raw OCT B-scans
for AD prediction in the literature. Unlike conventional medical image
classification tasks, early detection is more challenging than diagnosis
because imaging precedes clinical diagnosis by several years. We fine-tuned and
evaluated multiple pretrained models, including ImageNet-based networks and the
OCT-specific RETFound transformer, using subject-level cross-validation
datasets matched for age, sex, and imaging instances from the UK Biobank
cohort. To reduce overfitting in this small, high-dimensional dataset, both
standard and OCT-specific augmentation techniques were applied, along with a
year-weighted loss function that prioritized cases diagnosed within four years
of imaging. ResNet-34 produced the most stable results, achieving an AUC of
0.62 in the 4-year cohort. Although below the threshold for clinical
application, our explainability analyses confirmed localized structural
differences in the central macular subfield between the AD and control groups.
These findings provide a baseline for OCT-based AD prediction, highlight the
challenges of detecting subtle retinal biomarkers years before AD diagnosis,
and point to the need for larger datasets and multimodal approaches.

*Laura Alejandra Encinar Gonzalez,John Folkesson,Rudolph Triebel,Riccardo Giubilato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MPRF is a multimodal pipeline that combines vision and LiDAR using transformer foundation models for robust loop closure detection in unstructured GNSS-denied environments, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual place recognition fails due to aliasing and weak textures in planetary exploration environments, while LiDAR methods suffer from sparsity and ambiguity. There's a need for robust loop closure detection in severely unstructured settings.

Method: Two-stage visual retrieval strategy with explicit 6-DoF pose estimation, combining DINOv2 features with SALAD aggregation for candidate screening and SONATA-based LiDAR descriptors for geometric verification.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in precision on S3LI and S3LI Vulcano datasets, enhances pose estimation robustness in low-texture regions, and achieves favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and reliability.

Conclusion: MPRF demonstrates the potential of foundation models to unify place recognition and pose estimation, providing interpretable correspondences suitable for SLAM back-ends in challenging environments.

Abstract: Robust loop closure detection is a critical component of Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms in GNSS-denied environments, such as
in the context of planetary exploration. In these settings, visual place
recognition often fails due to aliasing and weak textures, while LiDAR-based
methods suffer from sparsity and ambiguity. This paper presents MPRF, a
multimodal pipeline that leverages transformer-based foundation models for both
vision and LiDAR modalities to achieve robust loop closure in severely
unstructured environments. Unlike prior work limited to retrieval, MPRF
integrates a two-stage visual retrieval strategy with explicit 6-DoF pose
estimation, combining DINOv2 features with SALAD aggregation for efficient
candidate screening and SONATA-based LiDAR descriptors for geometric
verification. Experiments on the S3LI dataset and S3LI Vulcano dataset show
that MPRF outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in precision while
enhancing pose estimation robustness in low-texture regions. By providing
interpretable correspondences suitable for SLAM back-ends, MPRF achieves a
favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and reliability,
demonstrating the potential of foundation models to unify place recognition and
pose estimation. Code and models will be released at github.com/DLR-RM/MPRF.

*Jörg Gamerdinger,Benedict Wetzel,Patrick Schulz,Sven Teufel,Oliver Bringmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel lane detection method for autonomous driving in snow-covered environments that detects roadside delineators instead of traditional lane markings, using Bezier curve modeling and a new synthetic dataset called SnowyLane.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lane detection in snow-covered environments is challenging due to frequent absence or occlusion of lane markings, requiring alternative approaches for reliable autonomous driving in winter conditions.

Method: Detects vertical roadside posts (delineators) as indirect lane indicators, then fits smooth lane trajectories using parameterized Bezier curve models that leverage spatial consistency and road geometry.

Result: Demonstrates significantly improved robustness in adverse weather compared to state-of-the-art lane detection systems, particularly in cases with heavy snow occlusion.

Conclusion: Establishes a strong foundation for reliable lane detection in winter scenarios and contributes a valuable resource (SnowyLane dataset) for future all-weather autonomous driving research.

Abstract: Lane detection for autonomous driving in snow-covered environments remains a
major challenge due to the frequent absence or occlusion of lane markings. In
this paper, we present a novel, robust and realtime capable approach that
bypasses the reliance on traditional lane markings by detecting roadside
features,specifically vertical roadside posts called delineators, as indirect
lane indicators. Our method first perceives these posts, then fits a smooth
lane trajectory using a parameterized Bezier curve model, leveraging spatial
consistency and road geometry. To support training and evaluation in these
challenging scenarios, we introduce SnowyLane, a new synthetic dataset
containing 80,000 annotated frames capture winter driving conditions, with
varying snow coverage, and lighting conditions. Compared to state-of-the-art
lane detection systems, our approach demonstrates significantly improved
robustness in adverse weather, particularly in cases with heavy snow occlusion.
This work establishes a strong foundation for reliable lane detection in winter
scenarios and contributes a valuable resource for future research in

*Junwen Pan,Qizhe Zhang,Rui Zhang,Ming Lu,Xin Wan,Yuan Zhang,Chang Liu,Qi She*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TimeSearch-R reformulates temporal search as interleaved text-video thinking using reinforcement learning with a novel GRPO-CSV method that verifies search completeness, achieving state-of-the-art performance on temporal search and long-form video understanding benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing temporal search methods rely on hand-crafted search processes without end-to-end optimization, lacking learning of optimal search strategies.

Method: Proposes TimeSearch-R with GRPO-CSV (Group Relative Policy Optimization with Completeness Self-Verification) that integrates searching video clips into reasoning through RL and verifies search adequacy using the same policy model.

Result: Achieves significant improvements on temporal search benchmarks (Haystack-LVBench, Haystack-Ego4D) and long-form video understanding benchmarks (VideoMME, MLVU), establishing new SOTA on LongVideoBench with 4.1% improvement over Qwen2.5-VL and 2.0% over Video-R1.

Conclusion: TimeSearch-R effectively addresses the limitations of unsupervised intermediate search decisions in RL-based video reasoning by introducing completeness self-verification, leading to improved temporal search capabilities and video understanding performance.

Abstract: Temporal search aims to identify a minimal set of relevant frames from tens
of thousands based on a given query, serving as a foundation for accurate
long-form video understanding. Existing works attempt to progressively narrow
the search space. However, these approaches typically rely on a hand-crafted
search process, lacking end-to-end optimization for learning optimal search
strategies. In this paper, we propose TimeSearch-R, which reformulates temporal
search as interleaved text-video thinking, seamlessly integrating searching
video clips into the reasoning process through reinforcement learning (RL).
However, applying RL training methods, such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), to video reasoning can result in unsupervised intermediate
search decisions. This leads to insufficient exploration of the video content
and inconsistent logical reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce GRPO
with Completeness Self-Verification (GRPO-CSV), which gathers searched video
frames from the interleaved reasoning process and utilizes the same policy
model to verify the adequacy of searched frames, thereby improving the
completeness of video reasoning. Additionally, we construct datasets
specifically designed for the SFT cold-start and RL training of GRPO-CSV,
filtering out samples with weak temporal dependencies to enhance task
difficulty and improve temporal search capabilities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that TimeSearch-R achieves significant improvements on temporal
search benchmarks such as Haystack-LVBench and Haystack-Ego4D, as well as
long-form video understanding benchmarks like VideoMME and MLVU. Notably,
TimeSearch-R establishes a new state-of-the-art on LongVideoBench with 4.1%
improvement over the base model Qwen2.5-VL and 2.0% over the advanced video
reasoning model Video-R1. Our code is available at

### [45] [Splatography: Sparse multi-view dynamic Gaussian Splatting for filmmaking challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05152)
*Adrian Azzarelli,Nantheera Anantrasirichai,David R Bull*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method that improves dynamic 3D reconstruction from sparse multi-view video by separating foreground and background components using minimal mask supervision, achieving state-of-the-art results with smaller model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of current methods in handling sparse camera configurations common in filmmaking budgets, which struggle to capture complex dynamic features.

Method: Splits canonical Gaussians and deformation field into foreground/background components using sparse masks at t=0, trains each separately with different loss functions, and models different parameters for each deformation field based on their characteristics.

Result: Achieves up to 3 PSNR higher with half the model size on 3D scenes, produces segmented dynamic reconstructions including transparent and dynamic textures without dense mask supervision.

Conclusion: The approach enables high-quality dynamic 3D reconstruction from sparse camera setups while maintaining smaller model sizes and producing segmented outputs, making it practical for filmmaking applications.

Abstract: Deformable Gaussian Splatting (GS) accomplishes photorealistic dynamic 3-D
reconstruction from dense multi-view video (MVV) by learning to deform a
canonical GS representation. However, in filmmaking, tight budgets can result
in sparse camera configurations, which limits state-of-the-art (SotA) methods
when capturing complex dynamic features. To address this issue, we introduce an
approach that splits the canonical Gaussians and deformation field into
foreground and background components using a sparse set of masks for frames at
t=0. Each representation is separately trained on different loss functions
during canonical pre-training. Then, during dynamic training, different
parameters are modeled for each deformation field following common filmmaking
practices. The foreground stage contains diverse dynamic features so changes in
color, position and rotation are learned. While, the background containing
film-crew and equipment, is typically dimmer and less dynamic so only changes
in point position are learned. Experiments on 3-D and 2.5-D entertainment
datasets show that our method produces SotA qualitative and quantitative
results; up to 3 PSNR higher with half the model size on 3-D scenes. Unlike the
SotA and without the need for dense mask supervision, our method also produces
segmented dynamic reconstructions including transparent and dynamic textures.

*Alexander Lappe,Martin A. Giese*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BRIXEL is a knowledge distillation method that enables DINOv3 models to produce high-resolution feature maps efficiently by having students learn to reproduce their own feature maps at higher resolution, reducing computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision foundation models like DINOv3 require high-resolution inputs and large computational resources due to transformer's quadratic complexity, making them inefficient for practical applications.

Method: Proposes BRIXEL - a simple knowledge distillation approach where the student model learns to reproduce its own feature maps at higher resolution through self-supervised learning.

Result: Outperforms baseline DINOv3 models by large margins on downstream tasks at fixed resolution, produces feature maps similar to teacher models at fraction of computational cost.

Conclusion: BRIXEL provides an effective solution to reduce computational requirements of high-resolution vision models while maintaining or improving performance through knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Vision foundation models achieve strong performance on both global and
locally dense downstream tasks. Pretrained on large images, the recent DINOv3
model family is able to produce very fine-grained dense feature maps, enabling
state-of-the-art performance. However, computing these feature maps requires
the input image to be available at very high resolution, as well as large
amounts of compute due to the squared complexity of the transformer
architecture. To address these issues, we propose BRIXEL, a simple knowledge
distillation approach that has the student learn to reproduce its own feature
maps at higher resolution. Despite its simplicity, BRIXEL outperforms the
baseline DINOv3 models by large margins on downstream tasks when the resolution
is kept fixed. Moreover, it is able to produce feature maps that are very
similar to those of the teacher at a fraction of the computational cost. Code
and model weights are available at https://github.com/alexanderlappe/BRIXEL.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MUSE is a self-supervised learning method for nucleus detection and classification in histopathology that uses multi-scale dense self-distillation and a nucleus-based local self-distillation mechanism to learn discriminative representations without requiring labor-intensive nucleus-level annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing nucleus detection and classification methods rely heavily on labor-intensive nucleus-level annotations and struggle to exploit large-scale unlabeled data for learning discriminative nucleus representations.

Method: Proposes MUSE with NuLo (Nucleus-based Local self-distillation) - a coordinate-guided mechanism for flexible local self-distillation based on predicted nucleus positions, enabling cross-scale alignment without strict spatial alignment requirements. Also includes an encoder-decoder architecture and large field-of-view semi-supervised fine-tuning strategy.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show MUSE effectively addresses core challenges of histopathological NDC, surpassing state-of-the-art supervised baselines and outperforming generic pathology foundation models.

Conclusion: MUSE provides an effective self-supervised approach for nucleus detection and classification that reduces annotation dependency while achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Nucleus detection and classification (NDC) in histopathology analysis is a
fundamental task that underpins a wide range of high-level pathology
applications. However, existing methods heavily rely on labor-intensive
nucleus-level annotations and struggle to fully exploit large-scale unlabeled
data for learning discriminative nucleus representations. In this work, we
propose MUSE (MUlti-scale denSE self-distillation), a novel self-supervised
learning method tailored for NDC. At its core is NuLo (Nucleus-based Local
self-distillation), a coordinate-guided mechanism that enables flexible local
self-distillation based on predicted nucleus positions. By removing the need
for strict spatial alignment between augmented views, NuLo allows critical
cross-scale alignment, thus unlocking the capacity of models for fine-grained
nucleus-level representation. To support MUSE, we design a simple yet effective
encoder-decoder architecture and a large field-of-view semi-supervised
fine-tuning strategy that together maximize the value of unlabeled pathology
images. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmarks demonstrate that
MUSE effectively addresses the core challenges of histopathological NDC. The
resulting models not only surpass state-of-the-art supervised baselines but
also outperform generic pathology foundation models.

TL;DR: WtL2 is an enhanced contour tracking algorithm for detailed segmentation of IR ships and RGB objects, extending the original WtL method by replacing NMS with contour refinement to create precise 1-pixel-wide closed shapes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the original Walk the Lines algorithm beyond color ship segmentation to handle IR ships and diverse RGB objects, providing detailed segmentation for specialized applications requiring high-quality samples.

Method: Uses contour tracking to refine object contours until achieving 1-pixel-wide closed shapes that can be binarized, adapting the object contour detector for IR ships and enhancing the algorithm for various RGB objects.

Result: Outperforms latest contour-based methods in achieving closed object contours, delivers high peak IoU with impressive detail, and broadens application range to IR and diverse RGB objects.

Conclusion: WtL2 is a compelling method for specialized applications requiring detailed segmentation or high-quality samples, potentially accelerating progress in niche image segmentation areas.

Abstract: This paper presents Walk the Lines 2 (WtL2), a unique contour tracking
algorithm specifically adapted for detailed segmentation of infrared (IR) ships
and various objects in RGB.1 This extends the original Walk the Lines (WtL)
[12], which focused solely on detailed ship segmentation in color. These
innovative WtLs can replace the standard non-maximum suppression (NMS) by using
contour tracking to refine the object contour until a 1-pixel-wide closed shape
can be binarized, forming a segmentable area in foreground-background
scenarios. WtL2 broadens the application range of WtL beyond its original
scope, adapting to IR and expanding to diverse objects within the RGB context.
To achieve IR segmentation, we adapt its input, the object contour detector, to
IR ships. In addition, the algorithm is enhanced to process a wide range of RGB
objects, outperforming the latest generation of contour-based methods when
achieving a closed object contour, offering high peak Intersection over Union
(IoU) with impressive details. This positions WtL2 as a compelling method for
specialized applications that require detailed segmentation or high-quality
samples, potentially accelerating progress in several niche areas of image
segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeControl is a training-free framework for semantic structural control in diffusion models that enables efficient structural guidance without inversion or retraining through one-step attention extraction and Latent-Condition Decoupling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like ControlNet rely on handcrafted condition maps and retraining, limiting flexibility and generalization, while inversion-based approaches offer stronger alignment but incur high inference costs due to dual-path denoising.

Method: FreeControl performs one-step attention extraction from a single, optimally chosen key timestep and reuses it throughout denoising. It introduces Latent-Condition Decoupling (LCD) to separate the key timestep from the noised latent used in attention extraction, and supports compositional control via reference images assembled from multiple sources.

Result: FreeControl enables structurally and semantically aligned, visually coherent generation directly from raw images, with the flexibility for intuitive compositional design and compatibility with modern diffusion models at approximately 5% additional cost.

Conclusion: FreeControl introduces a new paradigm for test-time control that eliminates structural artifacts while providing efficient structural guidance without the need for inversion or retraining.

Abstract: Controlling the spatial and semantic structure of diffusion-generated images
remains a challenge. Existing methods like ControlNet rely on handcrafted
condition maps and retraining, limiting flexibility and generalization.
Inversion-based approaches offer stronger alignment but incur high inference
cost due to dual-path denoising. We present FreeControl, a training-free
framework for semantic structural control in diffusion models. Unlike prior
methods that extract attention across multiple timesteps, FreeControl performs
one-step attention extraction from a single, optimally chosen key timestep and
reuses it throughout denoising. This enables efficient structural guidance
without inversion or retraining. To further improve quality and stability, we
introduce Latent-Condition Decoupling (LCD): a principled separation of the key
timestep and the noised latent used in attention extraction. LCD provides finer
control over attention quality and eliminates structural artifacts. FreeControl
also supports compositional control via reference images assembled from
multiple sources - enabling intuitive scene layout design and stronger prompt
alignment. FreeControl introduces a new paradigm for test-time control,
enabling structurally and semantically aligned, visually coherent generation
directly from raw images, with the flexibility for intuitive compositional
design and compatibility with modern diffusion models at approximately 5
percent additional cost.

### [50] [ADPretrain: Advancing Industrial Anomaly Detection via Anomaly Representation Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05245)
*Xincheng Yao,Yan Luo,Zefeng Qian,Chongyang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel anomaly detection representation learning framework that creates specialized pretrained features for industrial anomaly detection, addressing limitations of ImageNet-pretrained features by using AD-specific contrastive losses and pretraining on a large-scale AD dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current anomaly detection methods rely on ImageNet-pretrained features, which are suboptimal because ImageNet pretraining doesn't focus on distinguishing normal vs abnormal patterns, and there's a distribution shift between natural images and industrial AD images.

Method: Proposes angle- and norm-oriented contrastive losses to maximize angle size and norm difference between normal and abnormal features, pretrains on large-scale AD dataset RealIAD, and uses class-generalizable residual features to handle distribution shifts.

Result: Extensive experiments on five AD datasets and five backbones show superiority of the proposed pretrained features when replacing original features in five embedding-based AD methods.

Conclusion: The proposed AD-specific pretraining framework produces more robust and discriminative representations for industrial anomaly detection, outperforming traditional ImageNet-pretrained features across multiple datasets and backbones.

Abstract: The current mainstream and state-of-the-art anomaly detection (AD) methods
are substantially established on pretrained feature networks yielded by
ImageNet pretraining. However, regardless of supervised or self-supervised
pretraining, the pretraining process on ImageNet does not match the goal of
anomaly detection (i.e., pretraining in natural images doesn't aim to
distinguish between normal and abnormal). Moreover, natural images and
industrial image data in AD scenarios typically have the distribution shift.
The two issues can cause ImageNet-pretrained features to be suboptimal for AD
tasks. To further promote the development of the AD field, pretrained
representations specially for AD tasks are eager and very valuable. To this
end, we propose a novel AD representation learning framework specially designed
for learning robust and discriminative pretrained representations for
industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, closely surrounding the goal of
anomaly detection (i.e., focus on discrepancies between normals and anomalies),
we propose angle- and norm-oriented contrastive losses to maximize the angle
size and norm difference between normal and abnormal features simultaneously.
To avoid the distribution shift from natural images to AD images, our
pretraining is performed on a large-scale AD dataset, RealIAD. To further
alleviate the potential shift between pretraining data and downstream AD
datasets, we learn the pretrained AD representations based on the
class-generalizable representation, residual features. For evaluation, based on
five embedding-based AD methods, we simply replace their original features with
our pretrained representations. Extensive experiments on five AD datasets and
five backbones consistently show the superiority of our pretrained features.

Motivation: Accurate intraoperative delineation of colorectal liver metastases is crucial for achieving negative resection margins but remains challenging using intraoperative ultrasound due to low contrast, noise, and operator dependency. Automated segmentation could enhance precision and efficiency in ultrasound-based navigation workflows.

Method: Eighty-five tracked 3D iUS volumes from 85 CRLM patients were used to train and evaluate a 3D U-Net implemented via the nnU-Net framework. Two variants were compared: one trained on full iUS volumes and another on cropped regions around tumors. The workflow was integrated into 3D Slicer for real-time intraoperative use.

Prospective intraoperative testing confirmed robust and consistent performance.

Conclusion: Automatic 3D segmentation of CRLM in iUS using a cropped 3D U-Net provides reliable, near real-time results with minimal operator input, enabling efficient, registration-free ultrasound-based navigation for hepatic surgery, approaching expert-level accuracy while substantially reducing manual workload and procedure time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional self-report methods have recall bias, camera-based approaches raise privacy concerns, and existing wearable methods only handle limited food types, failing to address the diversity of Chinese cuisine.

Method: Two-stage detection pipeline: first stage identifies eating states by distinguishing temporal patterns from non-eating behaviors, second stage conducts fine-grained food type recognition using hand motion from smartwatch and head dynamics from smart glasses.

Result: Evaluated on dataset with 27.5 hours of IMU recordings across 11 food categories and 10 participants, achieving high accuracy in both eating state detection and food classification.

Conclusion: CuisineSense offers a practical solution for unobtrusive, wearable-based dietary monitoring, addressing the limitations of existing methods for diverse Chinese cuisine.

Abstract: Accurate food intake detection is vital for dietary monitoring and chronic
disease prevention. Traditional self-report methods are prone to recall bias,
while camera-based approaches raise concerns about privacy. Furthermore,
existing wearable-based methods primarily focus on a limited number of food
types, such as hamburgers and pizza, failing to address the vast diversity of
Chinese cuisine. To bridge this gap, we propose CuisineSense, a system that
classifies Chinese food types by integrating hand motion cues from a smartwatch
with head dynamics from smart glasses. To filter out irrelevant daily
activities, we design a two-stage detection pipeline. The first stage
identifies eating states by distinguishing characteristic temporal patterns
from non-eating behaviors. The second stage then conducts fine-grained food
type recognition based on the motions captured during food intake. To evaluate
CuisineSense, we construct a dataset comprising 27.5 hours of IMU recordings
across 11 food categories and 10 participants. Experiments demonstrate that
CuisineSense achieves high accuracy in both eating state detection and food
classification, offering a practical solution for unobtrusive, wearable-based
dietary monitoring.The system code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional steganography struggles with embedding semantically rich, sentence-level information, which is increasingly important in the AIGC era where steganography capacity is critical.

Method: Proposes S²LM (Semantic Steganographic Language Model) that uses LLMs to embed high-level textual information into images through a novel pipeline where the LLM is involved throughout the entire process.

Result: Both quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that the method effectively unlocks new semantic steganographic capabilities for LLMs.

Conclusion: The approach enables the integration of semantically rich content like sentences and paragraphs into images, representing a significant advancement beyond traditional bit-level steganography.

Abstract: Although steganography has made significant advancements in recent years, it
still struggles to embed semantically rich, sentence-level information into
carriers. However, in the era of AIGC, the capacity of steganography is more
critical than ever. In this work, we present Sentence-to-Image Steganography,
an instance of Semantic Steganography, a novel task that enables the hiding of
arbitrary sentence-level messages within a cover image. Furthermore, we
establish a benchmark named Invisible Text (IVT), comprising a diverse set of
sentence-level texts as secret messages for evaluation. Finally, we present
$\mathbf{S^2LM}$: Semantic Steganographic Language Model, which utilizes large
language models (LLMs) to embed high-level textual information, such as
sentences or even paragraphs, into images. Unlike traditional bit-level
counterparts, $\mathrm{S^2LM}$ enables the integration of semantically rich
content through a newly designed pipeline in which the LLM is involved

### [55] [Canonical Space Representation for 4D Panoptic Segmentation of Articulated Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05356)
*Manuel Gomes,Bogdan Raducanu,Miguel Oliveira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Artic4D dataset and CanonSeg4D framework for 4D panoptic segmentation of articulated objects, using temporal data and canonical space alignment to improve part-level segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods ignore temporal dynamics in articulated object perception, and 4D temporal data remains unexplored for panoptic segmentation. The lack of benchmark datasets also hinders progress in this field.

Method: Proposed CanonSeg4D framework that estimates per-frame offsets to map observed object parts to a learned canonical space, enabling consistent alignment of object parts across sequential frames for enhanced part-level segmentation.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on Artic4D dataset show that CanonSeg4D outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in panoptic segmentation accuracy, particularly in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: Temporal modeling and canonical alignment are effective for dynamic object understanding, and the work paves the way for future advances in 4D articulated object perception.

Abstract: Articulated object perception presents significant challenges in computer
vision, particularly because most existing methods ignore temporal dynamics
despite the inherently dynamic nature of such objects. The use of 4D temporal
data has not been thoroughly explored in articulated object perception and
remains unexamined for panoptic segmentation. The lack of a benchmark dataset
further hurt this field. To this end, we introduce Artic4D as a new dataset
derived from PartNet Mobility and augmented with synthetic sensor data,
featuring 4D panoptic annotations and articulation parameters. Building on this
dataset, we propose CanonSeg4D, a novel 4D panoptic segmentation framework.
This approach explicitly estimates per-frame offsets mapping observed object
parts to a learned canonical space, thereby enhancing part-level segmentation.
The framework employs this canonical representation to achieve consistent
alignment of object parts across sequential frames. Comprehensive experiments
on Artic4D demonstrate that the proposed CanonSeg4D outperforms state of the
art approaches in panoptic segmentation accuracy in more complex scenarios.
These findings highlight the effectiveness of temporal modeling and canonical
alignment in dynamic object understanding, and pave the way for future advances
in 4D articulated object perception.

*Shiyao Xu,Benedetta Liberatori,Gül Varol,Paolo Rota*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dense Motion Captioning - a task for temporally localizing and captioning actions in 3D human motion sequences, presents the Complex Motion Dataset (CompMo) with 60K richly annotated sequences, and proposes DEMO model that outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D human motion and language research focuses mainly on text-to-motion generation, leaving motion understanding relatively unexplored. Existing datasets lack detailed temporal annotations and consist of short sequences with few actions.

Method: Created CompMo dataset through a carefully designed data generation pipeline with 60,000 motion sequences featuring multiple actions (2-10 per sequence) and precise temporal boundaries. Proposed DEMO model that integrates a large language model with a simple motion adapter to generate dense, temporally grounded captions.

Result: DEMO substantially outperforms existing methods on CompMo dataset as well as on adapted benchmarks, establishing a robust baseline for future research.

Conclusion: The work addresses the gap in 3D motion understanding by introducing dense motion captioning, providing a comprehensive dataset, and demonstrating superior performance with the proposed DEMO model.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D human motion and language integration have primarily
focused on text-to-motion generation, leaving the task of motion understanding
relatively unexplored. We introduce Dense Motion Captioning, a novel task that
aims to temporally localize and caption actions within 3D human motion
sequences. Current datasets fall short in providing detailed temporal
annotations and predominantly consist of short sequences featuring few actions.
To overcome these limitations, we present the Complex Motion Dataset (CompMo),
the first large-scale dataset featuring richly annotated, complex motion
sequences with precise temporal boundaries. Built through a carefully designed
data generation pipeline, CompMo includes 60,000 motion sequences, each
composed of multiple actions ranging from at least two to ten, accurately
annotated with their temporal extents. We further present DEMO, a model that
integrates a large language model with a simple motion adapter, trained to
generate dense, temporally grounded captions. Our experiments show that DEMO
substantially outperforms existing methods on CompMo as well as on adapted
benchmarks, establishing a robust baseline for future research in 3D motion
understanding and captioning.

*Zehui Feng,Tian Qiu,Tong Wu,Junxuan Li,Huayuan Xu,Ting Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PreResQ-R1 is a reinforcement learning framework for visual quality assessment that combines absolute score regression and relative ranking through dual-branch rewards, achieving state-of-the-art results with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal LLMs for quality assessment rely on supervised fine-tuning or rank-only objectives, leading to shallow reasoning, poor score calibration, and limited cross-domain generalization.

Method: Preference-Response Disentangled Reinforcement Learning with dual-branch reward formulation that separates intra-sample response coherence and inter-sample preference alignment, optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Extends to video quality assessment with global-temporal and local-spatial data flow.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results across 10 IQA and 5 VQA benchmarks, surpassing by 5.30% and 2.15% in IQA task under SRCC and PLCC metrics respectively. Produces human-aligned reasoning traces with only 6K image and 28K video training samples.

Conclusion: PreResQ-R1 enables fine-grained, stable, and interpretable chain-of-thought reasoning about perceptual quality while achieving superior quantitative performance and cross-domain generalization.

Abstract: Visual Quality Assessment (QA) seeks to predict human perceptual judgments of
visual fidelity. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show
promise in reasoning about image and video quality, existing approaches mainly
rely on supervised fine-tuning or rank-only objectives, resulting in shallow
reasoning, poor score calibration, and limited cross-domain generalization. We
propose PreResQ-R1, a Preference-Response Disentangled Reinforcement Learning
framework that unifies absolute score regression and relative ranking
consistency within a single reasoning-driven optimization scheme. Unlike prior
QA methods, PreResQ-R1 introduces a dual-branch reward formulation that
separately models intra-sample response coherence and inter-sample preference
alignment, optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This design
encourages fine-grained, stable, and interpretable chain-of-thought reasoning
about perceptual quality. To extend beyond static imagery, we further design a
global-temporal and local-spatial data flow strategy for Video Quality
Assessment. Remarkably, with reinforcement fine-tuning on only 6K images and
28K videos, PreResQ-R1 achieves state-of-the-art results across 10 IQA and 5
VQA benchmarks under both SRCC and PLCC metrics, surpassing by margins of 5.30%
and textbf2.15% in IQA task, respectively. Beyond quantitative gains, it
produces human-aligned reasoning traces that reveal the perceptual cues
underlying quality judgments. Code and model are available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PALM is a large-scale hand dataset with 13k scans from 263 subjects and 90k multi-view images, addressing the lack of diverse hand data for realistic avatar creation. PALM-Net uses inverse rendering to enable single-image hand avatar personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating high-quality personalized hand avatars from images is challenging due to complex geometry, appearance, and articulation under unconstrained conditions. Existing datasets lack accurate 3D geometry, high-resolution multiview imagery, and diverse subject populations.

Method: Created PALM dataset with 13k hand scans from 263 subjects and 90k multi-view images capturing skin tone, age, and geometry variations. Developed PALM-Net baseline model using multi-subject prior over hand geometry and material properties learned via physically based inverse rendering.

Result: PALM provides a large-scale diverse dataset for hand modeling research. PALM-Net enables realistic, relightable single-image hand avatar personalization by leveraging the learned priors from the dataset.

Conclusion: PALM's scale and diversity make it a valuable real-world resource for hand modeling and related research, addressing previous limitations in hand avatar creation through comprehensive data collection and inverse rendering techniques.

Abstract: The ability to grasp objects, signal with gestures, and share emotion through
touch all stem from the unique capabilities of human hands. Yet creating
high-quality personalized hand avatars from images remains challenging due to
complex geometry, appearance, and articulation, particularly under
unconstrained lighting and limited views. Progress has also been limited by the
lack of datasets that jointly provide accurate 3D geometry, high-resolution
multiview imagery, and a diverse population of subjects. To address this, we
present PALM, a large-scale dataset comprising 13k high-quality hand scans from
263 subjects and 90k multi-view images, capturing rich variation in skin tone,
age, and geometry. To show its utility, we present a baseline PALM-Net, a
multi-subject prior over hand geometry and material properties learned via
physically based inverse rendering, enabling realistic, relightable
single-image hand avatar personalization. PALM's scale and diversity make it a
valuable real-world resource for hand modeling and related research.

*Aupendu Kar,Krishnendu Ghosh,Prabir Kumar Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a simple convolution layer modification for continual learning in image restoration that adapts knowledge from previous tasks without architectural changes, maintaining performance while minimizing computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of continual learning in image restoration where existing methods require heavy architectural modifications and are computationally expensive, while regularization-based approaches are unsuitable due to different restoration tasks requiring different feature processing.

Method: A simple modification of the convolution layer that adapts knowledge from previous restoration tasks without changing the main backbone architecture, allowing seamless application to any deep architecture without structural changes.

Result: Experimental validation shows the model can introduce new restoration tasks without compromising existing task performance, improves new task performance by leveraging knowledge from previous tasks, and increases trainable parameters without significant computational overhead or inference time increase.

Conclusion: The proposed convolution layer modification provides an effective solution for continual learning in image restoration that is computationally efficient, architecture-agnostic, and maintains performance across tasks while enabling knowledge transfer between restoration challenges.

Abstract: Continual learning is an emerging topic in the field of deep learning, where
a model is expected to learn continuously for new upcoming tasks without
forgetting previous experiences. This field has witnessed numerous
advancements, but few works have been attempted in the direction of image
restoration. Handling large image sizes and the divergent nature of various
degradation poses a unique challenge in the restoration domain. However,
existing works require heavily engineered architectural modifications for new
task adaptation, resulting in significant computational overhead.
Regularization-based methods are unsuitable for restoration, as different
restoration challenges require different kinds of feature processing. In this
direction, we propose a simple modification of the convolution layer to adapt
the knowledge from previous restoration tasks without touching the main
backbone architecture. Therefore, it can be seamlessly applied to any deep
architecture without any structural modifications. Unlike other approaches, we
demonstrate that our model can increase the number of trainable parameters
without significantly increasing computational overhead or inference time.
Experimental validation demonstrates that new restoration tasks can be
introduced without compromising the performance of existing tasks. We also show
that performance on new restoration tasks improves by adapting the knowledge
from the knowledge base created by previous restoration tasks. The code is

Motivation: To create a unified framework for generating synchronized talking faces from text without ground-truth audio, addressing distribution shifts between clean and TTS-predicted features while preserving speaker identity and natural expressiveness.

Method: Two-stage training approach: pretraining on Wav2Vec2 embeddings and finetuning on TTS outputs, using latent speech representations from HierSpeech++ and a Text-to-Vec module to generate embeddings that jointly condition both speech and face generation.

Result: The framework achieves tight audio-visual alignment, preserves speaker identity, and produces natural expressive speech with synchronized facial motion. Conditioning on TTS-predicted latent features outperforms cascaded pipelines, improving both lip-sync accuracy and visual realism.

Conclusion: The proposed text-to-talking-face synthesis framework successfully generates synchronized facial animations from text without ground-truth audio, demonstrating superior performance over cascaded approaches through joint conditioning on latent speech representations.

Abstract: We propose a text-to-talking-face synthesis framework leveraging latent
speech representations from HierSpeech++. A Text-to-Vec module generates
Wav2Vec2 embeddings from text, which jointly condition speech and face
generation. To handle distribution shifts between clean and TTS-predicted
features, we adopt a two-stage training: pretraining on Wav2Vec2 embeddings and
finetuning on TTS outputs. This enables tight audio-visual alignment, preserves
speaker identity, and produces natural, expressive speech and synchronized
facial motion without ground-truth audio at inference. Experiments show that
conditioning on TTS-predicted latent features outperforms cascaded pipelines,
improving both lip-sync and visual realism.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces gitmerge3D, a globally informed graph token merging method that reduces token count by 90-95% in 3D point cloud transformers while maintaining competitive performance, challenging the assumption that more tokens yield better results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D point cloud transformers rely on dense token representations that incur high computational and memory costs, with tokens being remarkably redundant and leading to substantial inefficiency.

Method: gitmerge3D - a globally informed graph token merging method that reduces token count by up to 90-95% through intelligent token merging while maintaining model performance.

Result: The method achieves significant token reduction (90-95%) while maintaining competitive performance across multiple 3D vision tasks, with consistent improvements in computational efficiency.

Conclusion: This work challenges the prevailing assumption that more tokens inherently yield better performance, reveals that current models are over-tokenized and under-optimized for scalability, and provides insights for developing more efficient 3D foundation architectures.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D point cloud transformers have led to state-of-the-art
results in tasks such as semantic segmentation and reconstruction. However,
these models typically rely on dense token representations, incurring high
computational and memory costs during training and inference. In this work, we
present the finding that tokens are remarkably redundant, leading to
substantial inefficiency. We introduce gitmerge3D, a globally informed graph
token merging method that can reduce the token count by up to 90-95% while
maintaining competitive performance. This finding challenges the prevailing
assumption that more tokens inherently yield better performance and highlights
that many current models are over-tokenized and under-optimized for
scalability. We validate our method across multiple 3D vision tasks and show
consistent improvements in computational efficiency. This work is the first to
assess redundancy in large-scale 3D transformer models, providing insights into
the development of more efficient 3D foundation architectures. Our code and

*Olivier Dietrich,Merlin Alfredsson,Emilia Arens,Nando Metzger,Torben Peters,Linus Scheibenreif,Jan Dirk Wegner,Konrad Schindler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Medium-resolution Copernicus satellite imagery (Sentinel-1/2) can effectively detect building damage for rapid disaster assessment, with simple models outperforming complex architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural disasters require rapid damage assessment, but very-high resolution imagery has limited availability. The study explores whether more widely available medium-resolution Copernicus data can complement VHR imagery for building damage assessment.

Method: Created xBD-S12 dataset of 10,315 pre/post-disaster image pairs from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, aligned with xBD benchmark. Conducted experiments to evaluate damage detection performance at 10m resolution.

Result: Building damage can be detected and mapped well in many disaster scenarios despite moderate resolution. Simple model architectures generalize better to unseen disasters than complex ones, and geospatial foundation models provide little practical benefit.

Conclusion: Copernicus images are a viable data source for rapid, wide-area damage assessment and could play important role alongside VHR imagery. Dataset, code, and models released to support further research.

Abstract: Natural disasters demand rapid damage assessment to guide humanitarian
response. Here, we investigate whether medium-resolution Earth observation
images from the Copernicus program can support building damage assessment,
complementing very-high resolution imagery with often limited availability. We
introduce xBD-S12, a dataset of 10,315 pre- and post-disaster image pairs from
both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, spatially and temporally aligned with the
established xBD benchmark. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that
building damage can be detected and mapped rather well in many disaster
scenarios, despite the moderate 10$\,$m ground sampling distance. We also find
that, for damage mapping at that resolution, architectural sophistication does
not seem to bring much advantage: more complex model architectures tend to
struggle with generalization to unseen disasters, and geospatial foundation
models bring little practical benefit. Our results suggest that Copernicus
images are a viable data source for rapid, wide-area damage assessment and
could play an important role alongside VHR imagery. We release the xBD-S12
dataset, code, and trained models to support further research.

TL;DR: A novel photo dating method that estimates when photos were taken using face analysis, combining face recognition, age estimation, and career-based priors, with a new 1.6M face dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more accurate photo dating system by leveraging facial information from multiple people in images, overcoming limitations of scene-based approaches.

Method: Probabilistic framework combining modern face recognition and age estimation models with career-based temporal priors, using a new CSFD-1.6M dataset with multi-face annotations.

Result: Aggregating evidence from multiple faces consistently improves performance, significantly outperforming scene-based baselines, especially for images with several identifiable individuals.

Conclusion: Multi-face information aggregation provides superior photo dating accuracy compared to traditional scene-based methods, with the proposed probabilistic framework effectively combining visual and temporal evidence.

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for Photo Dating which estimates the year a
photograph was taken by leveraging information from the faces of people present
in the image. To facilitate this research, we publicly release CSFD-1.6M, a new
dataset containing over 1.6 million annotated faces, primarily from movie
stills, with identity and birth year annotations. Uniquely, our dataset
provides annotations for multiple individuals within a single image, enabling
the study of multi-face information aggregation. We propose a probabilistic
framework that formally combines visual evidence from modern face recognition
and age estimation models, and career-based temporal priors to infer the photo
capture year. Our experiments demonstrate that aggregating evidence from
multiple faces consistently improves the performance and the approach
significantly outperforms strong, scene-based baselines, particularly for
images containing several identifiable individuals.

TL;DR: Proposes a real-time flow regime classification framework using neuromorphic sensors that detects brightness changes at individual pixels, achieving 97.6% accuracy with 0.28ms processing time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow boiling is efficient for heat transfer but sudden flow regime shifts disrupt thermal performance. Conventional optical imaging has high computational demands and insufficient temporal resolution for capturing transient flow behavior.

Method: Developed five classification models using both traditional image data and event-based data from neuromorphic sensors. The event-based LSTM model provided the best performance with an asynchronous processing pipeline and majority voting mechanism.

Result: Event-based models outperformed frame-based approaches. The event-based LSTM achieved 97.6% classification accuracy with 0.28ms processing time, enabling continuous low-latency predictions.

Conclusion: Neuromorphic sensor-based framework enables reliable real-time flow regime monitoring for experimental control and intelligent thermal management, overcoming limitations of conventional optical methods.

Abstract: Flow boiling is an efficient heat transfer mechanism capable of dissipating
high heat loads with minimal temperature variation, making it an ideal thermal
management method. However, sudden shifts between flow regimes can disrupt
thermal performance and system reliability, highlighting the need for accurate
and low-latency real-time monitoring. Conventional optical imaging methods are
limited by high computational demands and insufficient temporal resolution,
making them inadequate for capturing transient flow behavior. To address this,
we propose a real-time framework based on signals from neuromorphic sensors for
flow regime classification. Neuromorphic sensors detect changes in brightness
at individual pixels, which typically correspond to motion at edges, enabling
fast and efficient detection without full-frame reconstruction, providing
event-based information. We develop five classification models using both
traditional image data and event-based data, demonstrating that models
leveraging event data outperform frame-based approaches due to their
sensitivity to dynamic flow features. Among these models, the event-based long
short-term memory model provides the best balance between accuracy and speed,
achieving 97.6% classification accuracy with a processing time of 0.28 ms. Our
asynchronous processing pipeline supports continuous, low-latency predictions
and delivers stable output through a majority voting mechanisms, enabling
reliable real-time feedback for experimental control and intelligent thermal
management.

Abstract: This paper introduces a cutting-edge approach to cross-modal interaction for
tiny object detection by combining semantic-guided natural language processing
with advanced visual recognition backbones. The proposed method integrates the
BERT language model with the CNN-based Parallel Residual Bi-Fusion Feature
Pyramid Network (PRB-FPN-Net), incorporating innovative backbone architectures
such as ELAN, MSP, and CSP to optimize feature extraction and fusion. By
employing lemmatization and fine-tuning techniques, the system aligns semantic
cues from textual inputs with visual features, enhancing detection precision
for small and complex objects. Experimental validation using the COCO and
Objects365 datasets demonstrates that the model achieves superior performance.
On the COCO2017 validation set, it attains a 52.6% average precision (AP),
outperforming YOLO-World significantly while maintaining half the parameter

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GroupKAN is a lightweight medical image segmentation network that improves upon U-KAN by using grouped channel transformations to reduce computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical image segmentation models face trade-offs between accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability. Convolutional networks lack adaptive nonlinearity, Transformers have quadratic complexity and opaque attention, and U-KAN has O(C^2) complexity that limits scalability.

Method: GroupKAN introduces two structured functional modules: (1) Grouped KAN Transform that partitions channels into G groups for multivariate spline mappings, reducing complexity to O(C^2/G), and (2) Grouped KAN Activation that applies shared spline-based mappings within each channel group for efficient token-wise nonlinearity.

Result: On three medical benchmarks (BUSI, GlaS, CVC), GroupKAN achieves 79.80% average IoU, surpassing U-KAN by +1.11% while using only 47.6% of parameters (3.02M vs 6.35M), with improved interpretability.

Conclusion: GroupKAN successfully addresses the scalability limitations of U-KAN while maintaining superior accuracy, parameter efficiency, and interpretability for medical image segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation requires models that are accurate, lightweight,
and interpretable. Convolutional architectures lack adaptive nonlinearity and
transparent decision-making, whereas Transformer architectures are hindered by
quadratic complexity and opaque attention mechanisms. U-KAN addresses these
challenges using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, achieving higher accuracy than
both convolutional and attention-based methods, fewer parameters than
Transformer variants, and improved interpretability compared to conventional
approaches. However, its O(C^2) complexity due to full-channel transformations
limits its scalability as the number of channels increases. To overcome this,
we introduce GroupKAN, a lightweight segmentation network that incorporates two
novel, structured functional modules: (1) Grouped KAN Transform, which
partitions channels into G groups for multivariate spline mappings, reducing
complexity to O(C^2/G), and (2) Grouped KAN Activation, which applies shared
spline-based mappings within each channel group for efficient, token-wise
nonlinearity. Evaluated on three medical benchmarks (BUSI, GlaS, and CVC),
GroupKAN achieves an average IoU of 79.80 percent, surpassing U-KAN by +1.11
percent while requiring only 47.6 percent of the parameters (3.02M vs 6.35M),
and shows improved interpretability.

TL;DR: Visual Spatial Tuning (VST) is a framework that enhances Vision-Language Models' spatial abilities through progressive training on large-scale datasets (VST-P for perception, VST-R for reasoning), achieving state-of-the-art results without harming general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance spatial awareness in Vision-Language Models using general architectures without adding extra expert encoders that bring overhead and harm general capabilities, aiming for human-like visuospatial abilities.

Method: Progressive training pipeline: supervised fine-tuning on VST-P dataset (4.1M samples across 19 spatial skills) followed by reinforcement learning on VST-R dataset (135K samples) for spatial reasoning, without modifying model architecture.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results on spatial benchmarks: 34.8% on MMSI-Bench and 61.2% on VSIBench, with no negative impact on general capabilities.

Conclusion: Vision-Language-Action models can be significantly enhanced through the proposed spatial tuning paradigm, paving the way for more physically grounded AI systems with human-like spatial abilities.

Abstract: Capturing spatial relationships from visual inputs is a cornerstone of
human-like general intelligence. Several previous studies have tried to enhance
the spatial awareness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by adding extra expert
encoders, which brings extra overhead and usually harms general capabilities.
To enhance the spatial ability in general architectures, we introduce Visual
Spatial Tuning (VST), a comprehensive framework to cultivate VLMs with
human-like visuospatial abilities, from spatial perception to reasoning. We
first attempt to enhance spatial perception in VLMs by constructing a
large-scale dataset termed VST-P, which comprises 4.1 million samples spanning
19 skills across single views, multiple images, and videos. Then, we present
VST-R, a curated dataset with 135K samples that instruct models to reason in
space. In particular, we adopt a progressive training pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning to build foundational spatial knowledge, followed by reinforcement
learning to further improve spatial reasoning abilities. Without the
side-effect to general capabilities, the proposed VST consistently achieves
state-of-the-art results on several spatial benchmarks, including $34.8\%$ on
MMSI-Bench and $61.2\%$ on VSIBench. It turns out that the
Vision-Language-Action models can be significantly enhanced with the proposed
spatial tuning paradigm, paving the way for more physically grounded AI.

TL;DR: ScheduleStream is a framework for planning & scheduling with sampling operations that enables bimanual robots to perform parallel arm motions by modeling temporal dynamics with hybrid durative actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bimanual and humanoid robots need to control multiple arms simultaneously, but current TAMP algorithms typically produce sequential plans where only one arm moves at a time, missing opportunities for parallel execution and efficiency.

Method: ScheduleStream uses hybrid durative actions that can be started asynchronously and persist for parameter-dependent durations, with domain-independent algorithms and GPU acceleration in samplers for TAMPAS (Task and Motion Planning & Scheduling).

Result: ScheduleStream algorithms produce more efficient solutions compared to ablations in simulation, and demonstrate successful real-world bimanual robot tasks with parallel arm motions.

Conclusion: ScheduleStream successfully extends TAMP to produce schedules for parallel arm motion in bimanual robots, improving efficiency through its general-purpose framework for planning & scheduling with sampling operations.

Abstract: Bimanual and humanoid robots are appealing because of their human-like
ability to leverage multiple arms to efficiently complete tasks. However,
controlling multiple arms at once is computationally challenging due to the
growth in the hybrid discrete-continuous action space. Task and Motion Planning
(TAMP) algorithms can efficiently plan in hybrid spaces but generally produce
plans, where only one arm is moving at a time, rather than schedules that allow
for parallel arm motion. In order to extend TAMP to produce schedules, we
present ScheduleStream, the first general-purpose framework for planning &
scheduling with sampling operations. ScheduleStream models temporal dynamics
using hybrid durative actions, which can be started asynchronously and persist
for a duration that's a function of their parameters. We propose
domain-independent algorithms that solve ScheduleStream problems without any
application-specific mechanisms. We apply ScheduleStream to Task and Motion
Planning & Scheduling (TAMPAS), where we use GPU acceleration within samplers
to expedite planning. We compare ScheduleStream algorithms to several ablations
in simulation and find that they produce more efficient solutions. We
demonstrate ScheduleStream on several real-world bimanual robot tasks at

TL;DR: ReGen is a generative simulation framework that automates simulation design via inverse design, using LLMs to infer plausible scenarios from robot behaviors and translate them into executable simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulation construction is labor-intensive, limiting scalable robot learning and policy validation. There's a need to automate simulation design to enhance robot generalization and robustness.

Method: Uses LLMs to synthesize scenarios by expanding cause-and-effect graphs, then translates structured graphs into symbolic programs that configure robot simulation environments.

Result: Generates more diverse, complex simulated environments with high success rates, enables controllable corner case generation, and supports autonomous driving and robot manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: ReGen advances scalable robot learning by automating simulation design, improving policy validation and data augmentation for better generalization and robustness.

Abstract: Simulation plays a key role in scaling robot learning and validating
policies, but constructing simulations remains a labor-intensive process. This
paper introduces ReGen, a generative simulation framework that automates
simulation design via inverse design. Given a robot's behavior -- such as a
motion trajectory or an objective function -- and its textual description,
ReGen infers plausible scenarios and environments that could have caused the
behavior. ReGen leverages large language models to synthesize scenarios by
expanding a directed graph that encodes cause-and-effect relationships,
relevant entities, and their properties. This structured graph is then
translated into a symbolic program, which configures and executes a robot
simulation environment. Our framework supports (i) augmenting simulations based
on ego-agent behaviors, (ii) controllable, counterfactual scenario generation,
(iii) reasoning about agent cognition and mental states, and (iv) reasoning
with distinct sensing modalities, such as braking due to faulty GPS signals. We
demonstrate ReGen in autonomous driving and robot manipulation tasks,
generating more diverse, complex simulated environments compared to existing
simulations with high success rates, and enabling controllable generation for
corner cases. This approach enhances the validation of robot policies and
supports data or simulation augmentation, advancing scalable robot learning for
improved generalization and robustness. We provide code and example videos at:

### [70] [Unified Multimodal Diffusion Forcing for Forceful Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04812)
*Zixuan Huang,Huaidian Hou,Dmitry Berenson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Multimodal Diffusion Forcing (MDF) is a unified framework for learning from multimodal robot trajectories using diffusion models with random partial masking to capture temporal and cross-modal dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard imitation learning approaches overlook the rich interplay between different modalities (sensory inputs, actions, rewards) which is crucial for modeling robot behavior and understanding task outcomes.

Method: MDF applies random partial masking and trains a diffusion model to reconstruct trajectories, encouraging learning of temporal and cross-modal dependencies like predicting action effects on force signals or inferring states from partial observations.

Result: MDF achieves strong performance and robustness under noisy observations on contact-rich, forceful manipulation tasks in both simulated and real-world environments, while delivering versatile functionalities.

Conclusion: The proposed MDF framework effectively learns multimodal dependencies in robot trajectories and demonstrates robust performance across various manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Given a dataset of expert trajectories, standard imitation learning
approaches typically learn a direct mapping from observations (e.g., RGB
images) to actions. However, such methods often overlook the rich interplay
between different modalities, i.e., sensory inputs, actions, and rewards, which
is crucial for modeling robot behavior and understanding task outcomes. In this
work, we propose Multimodal Diffusion Forcing, a unified framework for learning
from multimodal robot trajectories that extends beyond action generation.
Rather than modeling a fixed distribution, MDF applies random partial masking
and trains a diffusion model to reconstruct the trajectory. This training
objective encourages the model to learn temporal and cross-modal dependencies,
such as predicting the effects of actions on force signals or inferring states
from partial observations. We evaluate MDF on contact-rich, forceful
manipulation tasks in simulated and real-world environments. Our results show
that MDF not only delivers versatile functionalities, but also achieves strong
performance, and robustness under noisy observations. More visualizations can

Conclusion: Pixi enables scalable, reproducible, collaborative research infrastructure that accelerates progress in robotics and AI by solving the reproducibility crisis in scientific computing.

Abstract: The reproducibility crisis in scientific computing constrains robotics
research. Existing studies reveal that up to 70% of robotics algorithms cannot
be reproduced by independent teams, while many others fail to reach deployment
because creating shareable software environments remains prohibitively complex.
These challenges stem from fragmented, multi-language, and hardware-software
toolchains that lead to dependency hell. We present Pixi, a unified
package-management framework that addresses these issues by capturing exact
dependency states in project-level lockfiles, ensuring bit-for-bit
reproducibility across platforms. Its high-performance SAT solver achieves up
to 10x faster dependency resolution than comparable tools, while integration of
the conda-forge and PyPI ecosystems removes the need for multiple managers.
Adopted in over 5,300 projects since 2023, Pixi reduces setup times from hours

*Shubham Natraj,Bruno Sinopoli,Yiannis Kantaros*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel non-uniform sampling strategy for sampling-based motion planners that biases sampling toward certified regions using conformal prediction, providing probabilistic guarantees on containing optimal solutions and improving planning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sampling-based motion planners rely on uniform sampling, which leads to poor efficiency and slow planning in complex environments, especially when dealing with narrow passages or cluttered spaces.

Method: Integrates into existing SBMPs by: (1) generating initial path using heuristic predictors (A* or vision-language models), (2) applying conformal prediction to quantify predictor uncertainty and create prediction sets, (3) biasing sampling toward these certified regions that guarantee containing optimal solutions with specified probability.

Result: Extensive evaluations show the method consistently finds feasible paths faster and generalizes better to unseen environments compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: This is the first non-uniform sampling approach for SBMPs that provides probabilistically correct guarantees on sampling regions, significantly improving planning efficiency while maintaining theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Sampling-based motion planners (SBMPs) are widely used to compute dynamically
feasible robot paths. However, their reliance on uniform sampling often leads
to poor efficiency and slow planning in complex environments. We introduce a
novel non-uniform sampling strategy that integrates into existing SBMPs by
biasing sampling toward `certified' regions. These regions are constructed by
(i) generating an initial, possibly infeasible, path using any heuristic path
predictor (e.g., A* or vision-language models) and (ii) applying conformal
prediction to quantify the predictor's uncertainty. This process yields
prediction sets around the initial-guess path that are guaranteed, with
user-specified probability, to contain the optimal solution. To our knowledge,
this is the first non-uniform sampling approach for SBMPs that provides such
probabilistically correct guarantees on the sampling regions. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that our method consistently finds feasible paths
faster and generalizes better to unseen environments than existing baselines.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses solar panel maintenance issues from dust and debris by developing cleaning mechanisms and protective materials. A wiper-based cleaning system outperformed rail-based systems in efficiency, and polycarbonate with layered soft-hard materials showed promise for protection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solar energy powers mission-critical applications like space exploration and wildfire monitoring systems, but their operation can be compromised when solar panels get covered with dust or damaged by space debris.

Method: Designed and compared two cleaning mechanisms (wiper system vs rail system) and tested protective materials through collision tests, evaluating polycarbonate and material layering strategies.

Result: The wiper-based cleaning system was more efficient than the rail-based system in cost, cleaning speed, and power consumption. For protection, polycarbonate performed well, but the key factor was layering soft material between the panel surface and hard material.

Conclusion: Wiper-based cleaning systems are superior for solar panel maintenance, and protective materials should use a layered soft-hard approach with polycarbonate showing particular promise for debris protection.

Abstract: Solar energy is used for many mission-critical applications including space
exploration, sensor systems to monitor wildfires, etc. Their operation can be
limited or even terminated if solar panels are covered with dust or hit by
space debris. To address this issue, we designed panel cleaning mechanisms and
tested protective materials. For cleaning mechanisms, we designed and compared
a wiper system and a rail system. For protective materials, we found through
collision tests that polycarbonate was very promising, though the most
important factor was layering a soft material between the panel's surface and a
hard material. In the cleaning system comparisons, the wiper-based system was
more efficient than the rail-based system in terms of cost, cleaning speed, and
total power consumption.

Motivation: Maintaining system stability and accurate position tracking in networked robotic systems, especially for haptics-enabled human-robot interaction, is challenging due to position desynchronization from imperfect communication and non-passive behaviors.

Result: Conducted grid simulations and systematic experiments comparing performance with state-of-the-art solutions under varying time delays and environmental conditions.

Conclusion: TBPS2 effectively addresses position desynchronization challenges in networked robotic systems while maintaining stability and reducing conservatism through biomechanics-aware design.

Abstract: Maintaining system stability and accurate position tracking is imperative in
networked robotic systems, particularly for haptics-enabled human-robot
interaction. Recent literature has integrated human biomechanics into the
stabilizers implemented for teleoperation, enhancing force preservation while
guaranteeing convergence and safety. However, position desynchronization due to
imperfect communication and non-passive behaviors remains a challenge. This
paper proposes a two-port biomechanics-aware passivity-based synchronizer and

synchronization by leveraging human biomechanics while reducing the
stabilizer's conservatism in its activation. We provide the mathematical design

TL;DR: MoE-DP enhances diffusion policies for robotic control by inserting a Mixture of Experts layer between visual encoder and diffusion model, improving robustness to failures and enabling interpretable skill decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard diffusion policies lack robustness to recover from subtask failures in long-horizon tasks and their learned representations are difficult to interpret.

Method: Insert a Mixture of Experts (MoE) layer between visual encoder and diffusion model to decompose policy knowledge into specialized experts that handle different task phases.

Result: 36% average relative improvement in success rate under disturbed conditions across 6 long-horizon simulation tasks, with real-world validation showing significant performance gains. Learned interpretable skill decomposition where experts correspond to semantic task primitives.

Conclusion: MoE-DP provides enhanced robustness and interpretability for robotic visuomotor control, enabling recovery from disturbances and inference-time control without retraining.

Abstract: Diffusion policies have emerged as a powerful framework for robotic
visuomotor control, yet they often lack the robustness to recover from subtask
failures in long-horizon, multi-stage tasks and their learned representations
of observations are often difficult to interpret. In this work, we propose the
Mixture of Experts-Enhanced Diffusion Policy (MoE-DP), where the core idea is
to insert a Mixture of Experts (MoE) layer between the visual encoder and the
diffusion model. This layer decomposes the policy's knowledge into a set of
specialized experts, which are dynamically activated to handle different phases
of a task. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that MoE-DP exhibits a
strong capability to recover from disturbances, significantly outperforming
standard baselines in robustness. On a suite of 6 long-horizon simulation
tasks, this leads to a 36% average relative improvement in success rate under
disturbed conditions. This enhanced robustness is further validated in the real
world, where MoE-DP also shows significant performance gains. We further show
that MoE-DP learns an interpretable skill decomposition, where distinct experts
correspond to semantic task primitives (e.g., approaching, grasping). This
learned structure can be leveraged for inference-time control, allowing for the
rearrangement of subtasks without any re-training.Our video and code are

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a centralized optimal passivity-based stabilization framework called TCoPC for CMND systems, which uses a centralized passivity observer and optimal controller to distribute dissipation among nodes while ensuring stability and relaxing restrictive assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CMND systems face stability challenges due to network artifacts, and conventional passivity-based approaches have limitations like decentralized compensation distribution and restrictive node passivity assumptions, limiting flexibility and scalability.

Method: The proposed TCoPC framework consists of a centralized passivity observer monitoring overall energy flow and an optimal passivity controller that distributes just-needed dissipation among nodes using a data-driven model-free approach.

Result: Simulation results show the framework performs well in complex tasks under different time-varying delay scenarios while relaxing remote nodes' minimum phase and passivity assumptions.

Conclusion: The centralized optimal passivity control approach enhances scalability and generalizability of CMND systems by providing flexible dissipation distribution while guaranteeing strict passivity and L2 stability.

Abstract: Centralized Multiport Networked Dynamic (CMND) systems have emerged as a key
architecture with applications in several complex network systems, such as
multilateral telerobotics and multi-agent control. These systems consist of a
hub node/subsystem connecting with multiple remote nodes/subsystems via a
networked architecture. One challenge for this system is stability, which can
be affected by non-ideal network artifacts. Conventional passivity-based
approaches can stabilize the system under specialized applications like
small-scale networked systems. However, those conventional passive stabilizers
have several restrictions, such as distributing compensation across subsystems
in a decentralized manner, limiting flexibility, and, at the same time, relying
on the restrictive assumptions of node passivity. This paper synthesizes a
centralized optimal passivity-based stabilization framework for CMND systems.
It consists of a centralized passivity observer monitoring overall energy flow
and an optimal passivity controller that distributes the just-needed
dissipation among various nodes, guaranteeing strict passivity and, thus, L2
stability. The proposed data-driven model-free approach, i.e., Tunable
Centralized Optimal Passivity Control (TCoPC), optimizes total performance
based on the prescribed dissipation distribution strategy while ensuring
stability. The controller can put high dissipation loads on some sub-networks
while relaxing the dissipation on other nodes. Simulation results demonstrate
the proposed frameworks performance in a complex task under different
time-varying delay scenarios while relaxing the remote nodes minimum phase and
passivity assumption, enhancing the scalability and generalizability.

TL;DR: DAP is a Dual-Actor Policy that explicitly divides object manipulation into approaching and manipulation stages, using affordance-based and motion flow-based actors respectively, with a decision maker to switch between stages. It outperforms SOTA methods by significant margins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous works ignore the two-stage nature of object manipulation (approaching and manipulation) and rely on a single policy for the entire process, which limits performance.

Method: Proposes DAP with two specialized actors: affordance-based actor for locating functional parts in approaching stage, and motion flow-based actor for capturing component movement in manipulation stage. Includes a decision maker to determine current stage. Also creates Dual-Prior Object Manipulation Dataset with 7 tasks.

Result: Outperforms SOTA methods by 5.55% on their dataset, 14.7% on RoboTwin benchmark, and 10.4% in real-world scenarios on average.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling the two-stage nature of object manipulation with specialized actors and visual priors significantly improves performance over single-policy approaches.

Abstract: Object manipulation, which focuses on learning to perform tasks on similar
parts across different types of objects, can be divided into an approaching
stage and a manipulation stage. However, previous works often ignore this
characteristic of the task and rely on a single policy to directly learn the
whole process of object manipulation. To address this problem, we propose a
novel Dual-Actor Policy, termed DAP, which explicitly considers different
stages and leverages heterogeneous visual priors to enhance each stage.
Specifically, we introduce an affordance-based actor to locate the functional
part in the manipulation task, thereby improving the approaching process.
Following this, we propose a motion flow-based actor to capture the movement of
the component, facilitating the manipulation process. Finally, we introduce a
decision maker to determine the current stage of DAP and select the
corresponding actor. Moreover, existing object manipulation datasets contain
few objects and lack the visual priors needed to support training. To address
this, we construct a simulated dataset, the Dual-Prior Object Manipulation
Dataset, which combines the two visual priors and includes seven tasks,
including two challenging long-term, multi-stage tasks. Experimental results on
our dataset, the RoboTwin benchmark and real-world scenarios illustrate that
our method consistently outperforms the SOTA method by 5.55%, 14.7% and 10.4%
on average respectively.

TL;DR: Imitation learning produces smoother autonomous wheelchair controllers that prioritize user comfort over traditional robotics metrics like time or distance, achieving state-of-the-art performance in follow-me mode for mobility assistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous micro-mobility platforms in crowded environments need to optimize user comfort and experience rather than traditional robotics metrics, which is critical for commercial applications.

Method: Used imitation learning with different neural network architectures for end-to-end control, comparing against manually-tuned controllers.

Result: Demonstrated that imitation learning delivers smoother and better controllers, with DAAV's autonomous wheelchair achieving state-of-the-art comfort in follow-me mode for persons with reduced mobility.

Conclusion: Imitation learning-based controllers outperform manually-tuned controllers in real-world production-level deployments, providing superior user comfort for autonomous mobility assistance.

Abstract: Autonomous micro-mobility platforms face challenges from the perspective of
the typical deployment environment: large indoor spaces or urban areas that are
potentially crowded and highly dynamic. While social navigation algorithms have
progressed significantly, optimizing user comfort and overall user experience
over other typical metrics in robotics (e.g., time or distance traveled) is
understudied. Specifically, these metrics are critical in commercial
applications. In this paper, we show how imitation learning delivers smoother
and overall better controllers, versus previously used manually-tuned
controllers. We demonstrate how DAAV's autonomous wheelchair achieves
state-of-the-art comfort in follow-me mode, in which it follows a human
operator assisting persons with reduced mobility (PRM). This paper analyzes
different neural network architectures for end-to-end control and demonstrates
their usability in real-world production-level deployments.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Retrieval-from-Video (RfV) method that enables robots to learn manipulation tasks by watching human video demonstrations, using analogies to address unfamiliar tasks without extensive training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots face challenges in complex environments and typically require extensive datasets, while humans can learn from watching video demonstrations of unfamiliar tasks like chair assembly.

Method: Builds a video bank of human daily tasks, extracts mid-level information (object affordance masks, hand motion trajectories), and uses a dual-component system with video retriever and policy generator to integrate retrieved knowledge into learning.

Result: The system shows marked performance improvement over conventional robotic systems in multiple simulated and real-world settings, demonstrating better generalization to tasks beyond training data.

Conclusion: The RfV approach represents a significant breakthrough in robotics by enabling robots to craft adaptive responses and generalize using video demonstrations as learning resources.

Abstract: Robots operating in complex and uncertain environments face considerable
challenges. Advanced robotic systems often rely on extensive datasets to learn
manipulation tasks. In contrast, when humans are faced with unfamiliar tasks,
such as assembling a chair, a common approach is to learn by watching video
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel method for learning robot
policies by Retrieving-from-Video (RfV), using analogies from human
demonstrations to address manipulation tasks. Our system constructs a video
bank comprising recordings of humans performing diverse daily tasks. To enrich
the knowledge from these videos, we extract mid-level information, such as
object affordance masks and hand motion trajectories, which serve as additional
inputs to enhance the robot model's learning and generalization capabilities.
We further feature a dual-component system: a video retriever that taps into an
external video bank to fetch task-relevant video based on task specification,
and a policy generator that integrates this retrieved knowledge into the
learning cycle. This approach enables robots to craft adaptive responses to
various scenarios and generalize to tasks beyond those in the training data.
Through rigorous testing in multiple simulated and real-world settings, our
system demonstrates a marked improvement in performance over conventional
robotic systems, showcasing a significant breakthrough in the field of
robotics.

*Linus Nwankwo,Björn Ellensohn,Christian Rauch,Elmar Rueckert*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SIL enables bidirectional co-adaptation between humans and embodied agents through mutual learning in a shared latent task space, moving beyond traditional master-apprentice models to enable proactive clarification and shared plan refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current human-robot interaction approaches perpetuate a master-apprentice model where agents passively execute commands without reciprocal learning, failing to capture co-adaptive dynamics in human-human interactions.

Method: Formalized as a co-adaptation process in a shared latent task space with joint belief states, leveraging pre-trained foundation models for spatial perception/reasoning and a lightweight latent encoder for task-specific grounding, augmented with memory architecture to prevent forgetting.

Result: Validated on simulated and real-world embodied tasks including instruction following, information retrieval, query-oriented reasoning, and interactive dialogues.

Conclusion: SIL enables embodied agents to move beyond reactive execution to proactive behaviors like clarification, adaptive suggestions, and shared plan refinement through bidirectional co-adaptation.

Abstract: Today's autonomous agents can understand free-form natural language
instructions and execute long-horizon tasks in a manner akin to human-level
reasoning. These capabilities are mostly driven by large-scale pre-trained
foundation models (FMs). However, the approaches with which these models are
grounded for human-robot interaction (HRI) perpetuate a master-apprentice
model, where the apprentice (embodied agent) passively receives and executes
the master's (human's) commands without reciprocal learning. This reactive
interaction approach does not capture the co-adaptive dynamics inherent in
everyday multi-turn human-human interactions. To address this, we propose a
Symbiotic Interactive Learning (SIL) approach that enables both the master and
the apprentice to co-adapt through mutual, bidirectional interactions. We
formalised SIL as a co-adaptation process within a shared latent task space,
where the agent and human maintain joint belief states that evolve based on
interaction history. This enables the agent to move beyond reactive execution
to proactive clarification, adaptive suggestions, and shared plan refinement.
To realise these novel behaviours, we leveraged pre-trained FMs for spatial
perception and reasoning, alongside a lightweight latent encoder that grounds
the models' outputs into task-specific representations. Furthermore, to ensure
stability as the tasks evolve, we augment SIL with a memory architecture that
prevents the forgetting of learned task-space representations. We validate SIL
on both simulated and real-world embodied tasks, including instruction
following, information retrieval, query-oriented reasoning, and interactive
dialogues. Demos and resources are public

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: M3GN is a novel learned simulator that uses trajectory-level meta-learning with movement primitives to predict fast, stable, and accurate object deformation simulations from a single model call, outperforming existing graph network simulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learned simulators rely on single-step observations and auto-regressive rollouts, which limit their ability to infer material properties and accumulate errors over long trajectories. There's a need for simulators that can exploit temporal context and provide stable long-term predictions.

Method: Frames mesh-based simulation as a trajectory-level meta-learning problem using Conditional Neural Processes. Uses movement primitives to directly predict entire simulations from a single model call, enabling rapid adaptation to new scenarios from limited data.

Result: M3GN provides higher simulation accuracy at a fraction of the runtime cost compared to state-of-the-art Graph Network Simulators across several tasks, offering fast, stable, and accurate predictions.

Conclusion: The trajectory-level meta-learning approach with movement primitives enables more accurate and efficient object deformation simulations than existing methods, addressing key limitations of current learned simulators.

Abstract: Simulating object deformations is a critical challenge across many scientific
domains, including robotics, manufacturing, and structural mechanics. Learned
Graph Network Simulators (GNSs) offer a promising alternative to traditional
mesh-based physics simulators. Their speed and inherent differentiability make
them particularly well suited for applications that require fast and accurate
simulations, such as robotic manipulation or manufacturing optimization.
However, existing learned simulators typically rely on single-step
observations, which limits their ability to exploit temporal context. Without
this information, these models fail to infer, e.g., material properties.
Further, they rely on auto-regressive rollouts, which quickly accumulate error
for long trajectories. We instead frame mesh-based simulation as a
trajectory-level meta-learning problem. Using Conditional Neural Processes, our
method enables rapid adaptation to new simulation scenarios from limited
initial data while capturing their latent simulation properties. We utilize
movement primitives to directly predict fast, stable and accurate simulations
from a single model call. The resulting approach, Movement-primitive
Meta-MeshGraphNet (M3GN), provides higher simulation accuracy at a fraction of
the runtime cost compared to state-of-the-art GNSs across several tasks.

TL;DR: TwinVLA is a modular framework that composes two pretrained single-arm VLAs into a coordinated bimanual system, achieving state-of-the-art performance without requiring bimanual pretraining data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most public robotic datasets focus on single-arm demonstrations, making it challenging to adapt vision-language-action models for bimanual tasks without substantial additional data and fine-tuning.

Method: TwinVLA composes two copies of a pretrained single-arm VLA into a coordinated bimanual system, using a modular approach rather than training monolithic cross-embodiment models.

Result: TwinVLA outperforms comparably-sized monolithic models without bimanual pretraining and narrows the performance gap to state-of-the-art models that use extensive proprietary bimanual data.

Conclusion: Modular composition of pretrained single-arm policies provides a data-efficient and scalable path toward high-performance bimanual manipulation using public single-arm data.

Abstract: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) trained on large-scale robotic datasets
have demonstrated strong performance on manipulation tasks, including bimanual
tasks. However, because most public datasets focus on single-arm
demonstrations, adapting VLAs for bimanual tasks typically requires substantial
additional bimanual data and fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we
introduce TwinVLA, a modular framework that composes two copies of a pretrained
single-arm VLA into a coordinated bimanual VLA. Unlike monolithic
cross-embodiment models trained on mixtures of single-arm and bimanual data,
TwinVLA improves both data efficiency and performance by composing pretrained
single-arm policies. Across diverse bimanual tasks in real-world and simulation
settings, TwinVLA outperforms a comparably-sized monolithic RDT-1B model
without requiring any bimanual pretraining. Furthermore, it narrows the gap to
state-of-the-art model, $\pi_0$ which rely on extensive proprietary bimanual
data and compute cost. These results establish our modular composition approach
as a data-efficient and scalable path toward high-performance bimanual
manipulation, leveraging public single-arm data.

TL;DR: A framework for real-time force safety detection in soft robot manipulators that maps force safety criteria from task space to configuration space, ensuring provably safe configurations below maximum force thresholds during environmental interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing obstacle detection and avoidance methods don't consider force limits that manipulators can exert on delicate obstacles, limiting deployment in sensitive environments.

Method: Maps force safety criteria from task space (positions along robot body) to configuration space (joint angles) through forward kinematics, incorporating limits on allowable environmental contact forces for given obstacles.

Result: Validated in simulation and hardware experiments on a two-segment pneumatic soft robot manipulator, accurately detecting force safety during interactions with deformable obstacles.

Conclusion: The method lays foundation for real-time safe planning of soft manipulators in delicate, cluttered environments by ensuring provably safe configurations below force thresholds.

Abstract: Soft robot manipulators have the potential for deployment in delicate
environments to perform complex manipulation tasks. However, existing obstacle
detection and avoidance methods do not consider limits on the forces that
manipulators may exert upon contact with delicate obstacles. This work
introduces a framework that maps force safety criteria from task space (i.e.
positions along the robot's body) to configuration space (i.e. the robot's
joint angles) and enables real-time force safety detection. We incorporate
limits on allowable environmental contact forces for given task-space
obstacles, and map them into configuration space (C-space) through the
manipulator's forward kinematics. This formulation ensures that configurations
classified as safe are provably below the maximum force thresholds, thereby
allowing us to determine force-safe configurations of the soft robot
manipulator in real-time. We validate our approach in simulation and hardware
experiments on a two-segment pneumatic soft robot manipulator. Results
demonstrate that the proposed method accurately detects force safety during
interactions with deformable obstacles, thereby laying the foundation for
real-time safe planning of soft manipulators in delicate, cluttered
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable natural physical contact in virtual reality during social interactions, addressing the lack of haptic feedback in current VR systems for interpersonal interactions.

Method: Integrates torque-controlled robotic manipulator with interchangeable passive props, marker-based physical-virtual registration via ChArUco board, safety monitor, and two control strategies: static mode (stationary prop) and dynamic mode (continuously updated prop position with exponential blending).

Result: Achieved static colocation accuracy of 5.09 +/- 0.94 mm and temporal alignment with average contact latency of 28.53 +/- 31.21 ms across all interaction conditions.

Conclusion: ETHOS demonstrates feasibility of recreating socially meaningful haptics in VR and establishes a practical foundation for high-fidelity, dynamic interpersonal interactions in virtual environments.

Abstract: We present ETHOS (Encountered-Type Haptics for On-demand Social Interaction),
a dynamic encountered-type haptic display (ETHD) that enables natural physical
contact in virtual reality (VR) during social interactions such as handovers,
fist bumps, and high-fives. The system integrates a torque-controlled robotic
manipulator with interchangeable passive props (silicone hand replicas and a
baton), marker-based physical-virtual registration via a ChArUco board, and a
safety monitor that gates motion based on the user's head and hand pose. We
introduce two control strategies: (i) a static mode that presents a stationary
prop aligned with its virtual counterpart, consistent with prior ETHD
baselines, and (ii) a dynamic mode that continuously updates prop position by
exponentially blending an initial mid-point trajectory with real-time hand
tracking, generating a unique contact point for each interaction. Bench tests
show static colocation accuracy of 5.09 +/- 0.94 mm, while user interactions
achieved temporal alignment with an average contact latency of 28.53 +/- 31.21
ms across all interaction and control conditions. These results demonstrate the
feasibility of recreating socially meaningful haptics in VR. By incorporating
essential safety and control mechanisms, ETHOS establishes a practical
foundation for high-fidelity, dynamic interpersonal interactions in virtual
environments.

Conclusion: EverydayVLA democratizes access to robotic foundation models by combining state-of-the-art VLA capabilities with affordable hardware, enabling economical deployment in homes and research labs.

Abstract: While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models map visual inputs and language

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop stable dynamic motion control for quadruped robots inspired by biological quadruped behaviors and bouncing gaits observed in nature and bio-inspired robotic systems.

Method: Model robot as SLIP with leg-orientation control during flight and leg-length control during stance. Use energy conservation principle to track stable parabolic spline during stance based on reduced-order SLIP dynamics.

Result: Control algorithm generates stable bouncing gaits in simulations based on Ghost Robotics Minitaur specifications. Maintains stable bouncing even with up to 10% error in sensor measurements.

Conclusion: Energy-conservation based control using SLIP model effectively achieves stable dynamic motion in quadruped robots with demonstrated robustness to sensor inaccuracies.

Abstract: In this paper, we present an energy-conservation based control architecture
for stable dynamic motion in quadruped robots. We model the robot as a
Spring-loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP), a model well-suited to represent the
bouncing motion characteristic of running gaits observed in various biological
quadrupeds and bio-inspired robotic systems. The model permits leg-orientation
control during flight and leg-length control during stance, a design choice
inspired by natural quadruped behaviors and prevalent in robotic quadruped
systems. Our control algorithm uses the reduced-order SLIP dynamics of the
quadruped to track a stable parabolic spline during stance, which is calculated
using the principle of energy conservation. Through simulations based on the
design specifications of an actual quadruped robot, Ghost Robotics Minitaur, we
demonstrate that our control algorithm generates stable bouncing gaits.
Additionally, we illustrate the robustness of our controller by showcasing its
ability to maintain stable bouncing even when faced with up to a 10% error in
sensor measurements.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FlexiQuad is a soft-frame quadrotor design inspired by biological flyers that achieves both high agility (80+ km/h speeds, 3g+ accelerations) and superior collision resilience (4x higher), while enabling flight through narrow gaps 70% of its width.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional rigid quadrotors face a trade-off between agility and collision resilience/squeezability in cluttered environments. Biological flyers use soft wings to enable both agile flight and robust physical interactions.

Method: Inspired by anisotropic stiffness and distributed mass-energy structures in biological organisms, FlexiQuad uses a soft-frame design approach with optimal structural softness range (0.006-0.77 N/mm) comparable to natural flyers' wings.

Result: A 405g prototype achieved 80+ km/h speeds, 3g linear/300 rad/s² angular accelerations, 4x higher collision resilience (survives 5 m/s frontal impacts), and can fly through gaps 70% of nominal width. Analysis shows it can replicate rigid quadrotor accelerations up to thrust-to-weight ratio of 8.

Conclusion: FlexiQuad expands hovering drone capabilities in complex environments by enabling robust physical interactions without compromising flight performance, bridging the gap between agility and collision resilience that limits conventional quadrotors.

Abstract: Natural flyers use soft wings to seamlessly enable a wide range of flight
behaviours, including agile manoeuvres, squeezing through narrow passageways,
and withstanding collisions. In contrast, conventional quadrotor designs rely
on rigid frames that support agile flight but inherently limit collision
resilience and squeezability, thereby constraining flight capabilities in
cluttered environments. Inspired by the anisotropic stiffness and distributed
mass-energy structures observed in biological organisms, we introduce
FlexiQuad, a soft-frame quadrotor design approach that limits this trade-off.
We demonstrate a 405-gram FlexiQuad prototype, three orders of magnitude more
compliant than conventional quadrotors, yet capable of acrobatic manoeuvres
with peak speeds above 80 km/h and linear and angular accelerations exceeding 3
g and 300 rad/s$^2$, respectively. Analysis demonstrates it can replicate
accelerations of rigid counterparts up to a thrust-to-weight ratio of 8.
Simultaneously, FlexiQuad exhibits fourfold higher collision resilience,
surviving frontal impacts at 5 m/s without damage and reducing destabilising
forces in glancing collisions by a factor of 39. Its frame can fully compress,
enabling flight through gaps as narrow as 70% of its nominal width. Our
analysis identifies an optimal structural softness range, from 0.006 to 0.77
N/mm, comparable to that of natural flyers' wings, whereby agility,
squeezability, and collision resilience are jointly achieved for FlexiQuad
models from 20 to 3000 grams. FlexiQuad expands hovering drone capabilities in
complex environments, enabling robust physical interactions without
compromising flight performance.

### [95] [Epistemic Reject Option Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04855)
*Vojtech Franc,Jakub Paplham*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces an epistemic reject-option predictor that abstains from predictions in regions of high epistemic uncertainty caused by insufficient training data, using Bayesian learning to minimize expected regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reject-option approaches only consider aleatoric uncertainty and assume large training data makes epistemic uncertainty negligible, but this assumption fails in practical scenarios with limited data where epistemic uncertainty becomes significant.

Method: The method builds on Bayesian learning and redefines the optimal predictor as one that minimizes expected regret - the performance gap between the learned model and the Bayes-optimal predictor with full knowledge of the data distribution. The model abstains when regret exceeds a specified rejection cost.

Result: The paper presents the first principled framework for learning predictors that can identify inputs where training data is insufficient to make reliable decisions, addressing epistemic uncertainty directly.

Conclusion: The epistemic reject-option predictor provides a theoretically grounded approach for uncertainty quantification in practical scenarios with limited data, enabling models to abstain when epistemic uncertainty is high due to insufficient training data.

Abstract: In high-stakes applications, predictive models must not only produce accurate
predictions but also quantify and communicate their uncertainty. Reject-option
prediction addresses this by allowing the model to abstain when prediction
uncertainty is high. Traditional reject-option approaches focus solely on
aleatoric uncertainty, an assumption valid only when large training data makes
the epistemic uncertainty negligible. However, in many practical scenarios,
limited data makes this assumption unrealistic. This paper introduces the
epistemic reject-option predictor, which abstains in regions of high epistemic
uncertainty caused by insufficient data. Building on Bayesian learning, we
redefine the optimal predictor as the one that minimizes expected regret -- the
performance gap between the learned model and the Bayes-optimal predictor with
full knowledge of the data distribution. The model abstains when the regret for
a given input exceeds a specified rejection cost. To our knowledge, this is the
first principled framework that enables learning predictors capable of
identifying inputs for which the training data is insufficient to make reliable
decisions.

TL;DR: Dynamic Memory Alignment (DMA) is an online learning framework that incorporates multi-granularity human feedback to adapt retrieval ranking in RAG systems, improving engagement and performance without sacrificing baseline retrieval capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG systems use static retrieval that cannot adapt to evolving user intent and content drift, limiting their effectiveness in interactive settings.

Method: DMA organizes document-, list-, and response-level feedback into a learning pipeline with supervised training for rankers, policy optimization using response preferences, and knowledge distillation into a lightweight scorer for low-latency serving.

Result: Online deployment showed substantial improvements in human engagement, while offline tests demonstrated competitive foundational retrieval with notable gains on conversational QA benchmarks like TriviaQA and HotpotQA.

Conclusion: DMA provides a principled approach for feedback-driven, real-time adaptation in RAG systems that maintains baseline capabilities while improving performance through multi-granularity learning.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems often rely on static retrieval,
limiting adaptation to evolving intent and content drift. We introduce Dynamic
Memory Alignment (DMA), an online learning framework that systematically
incorporates multi-granularity human feedback to align ranking in interactive
settings. DMA organizes document-, list-, and response-level signals into a
coherent learning pipeline: supervised training for pointwise and listwise
rankers, policy optimization driven by response-level preferences, and
knowledge distillation into a lightweight scorer for low-latency serving.
Throughout this paper, memory refers to the model's working memory, which is
the entire context visible to the LLM for In-Context Learning.
  We adopt a dual-track evaluation protocol mirroring deployment: (i)
large-scale online A/B ablations to isolate the utility of each feedback
source, and (ii) few-shot offline tests on knowledge-intensive benchmarks.
Online, a multi-month industrial deployment further shows substantial
improvements in human engagement. Offline, DMA preserves competitive
foundational retrieval while yielding notable gains on conversational QA
(TriviaQA, HotpotQA). Taken together, these results position DMA as a
principled approach to feedback-driven, real-time adaptation in RAG without
sacrificing baseline capability.

### [97] [Real-Time Reasoning Agents in Evolving Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04898)
*Yule Wen,Yixin Ye,Yanzhe Zhang,Diyi Yang,Hao Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces real-time reasoning for agents in dynamic environments, showing that current language models struggle with timely judgments, and proposes AgileThinker which combines reactive and planning paradigms to balance reasoning depth and response latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world agents need to make both logical and timely judgments in dynamic environments where hazards emerge and opportunities arise while reasoning is still unfolding, but existing language model approaches fail to account for this dynamic nature.

Method: Built Real-Time Reasoning Gym to study two paradigms: reactive agents (bounded reasoning for rapid responses) and planning agents (extended reasoning for complex problems). Proposed AgileThinker which simultaneously engages both reasoning paradigms.

Result: Experiments show state-of-the-art models struggle with making logical and timely judgments in either paradigm. AgileThinker consistently outperforms single-paradigm agents as task difficulty and time pressure rise, effectively balancing reasoning depth and response latency.

Conclusion: Establishes real-time reasoning as a critical testbed for practical agents and provides foundation for temporally constrained AI systems, highlighting a path toward real-time capable agents.

Abstract: Agents in the real world must make not only logical but also timely
judgments. This requires continuous awareness of the dynamic environment:
hazards emerge, opportunities arise, and other agents act, while the agent's
reasoning is still unfolding. Despite advances in language model reasoning,
existing approaches fail to account for this dynamic nature. We introduce
real-time reasoning as a new problem formulation for agents in evolving
environments and build Real-Time Reasoning Gym to demonstrate it. We study two
paradigms for deploying language models in agents: (1) reactive agents, which
employ language models with bounded reasoning computation for rapid responses,
and (2) planning agents, which allow extended reasoning computation for complex
problems. Our experiments show that even state-of-the-art models struggle with
making logical and timely judgments in either paradigm. To address this
limitation, we propose AgileThinker, which simultaneously engages both
reasoning paradigms. AgileThinker consistently outperforms agents engaging only
one reasoning paradigm as the task difficulty and time pressure rise,
effectively balancing reasoning depth and response latency. Our work
establishes real-time reasoning as a critical testbed for developing practical
agents and provides a foundation for research in temporally constrained AI
systems, highlighting a path toward real-time capable agents.

### [98] [ORCHID: Orchestrated Retrieval-Augmented Classification with Human-in-the-Loop Intelligent Decision-Making for High-Risk Property](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04956)
*Maria Mahbub,Vanessa Lama,Sanjay Das,Brian Starks,Christopher Polchek,Saffell Silvers,Lauren Deck,Prasanna Balaprakash,Tirthankar Ghosal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ORCHID is a modular agentic system for High-Risk Property classification at DOE sites that combines RAG with human oversight to create auditable policy-based decisions, improving accuracy and traceability over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional expert-only workflows for HRP classification are time-consuming, backlog-prone, and struggle to keep pace with evolving export control regulations, requiring a more efficient and transparent solution.

Method: Uses small cooperating agents (retrieval, description refiner, classifier, validator, feedback logger) coordinated via agent-to-agent messaging with Model Context Protocol for model-agnostic on-premise operation, following an Item to Evidence to Decision loop with step-by-step reasoning.

Result: In preliminary tests on real HRP cases, ORCHID improves accuracy and traceability over non-agentic baseline while deferring uncertain items to Subject Matter Experts, with demonstrated single item submission, grounded citations, and exportable audit artifacts.

Conclusion: ORCHID provides a practical path to trustworthy LLM assistance in sensitive DOE compliance workflows by combining AI automation with human oversight and comprehensive audit capabilities.

Abstract: High-Risk Property (HRP) classification is critical at U.S. Department of
Energy (DOE) sites, where inventories include sensitive and often dual-use
equipment. Compliance must track evolving rules designated by various export
control policies to make transparent and auditable decisions. Traditional
expert-only workflows are time-consuming, backlog-prone, and struggle to keep
pace with shifting regulatory boundaries. We demo ORCHID, a modular agentic
system for HRP classification that pairs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
with human oversight to produce policy-based outputs that can be audited. Small
cooperating agents, retrieval, description refiner, classifier, validator, and
feedback logger, coordinate via agent-to-agent messaging and invoke tools
through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for model-agnostic on-premise
operation. The interface follows an Item to Evidence to Decision loop with
step-by-step reasoning, on-policy citations, and append-only audit bundles
(run-cards, prompts, evidence). In preliminary tests on real HRP cases, ORCHID
improves accuracy and traceability over a non-agentic baseline while deferring
uncertain items to Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). The demonstration shows
single item submission, grounded citations, SME feedback capture, and
exportable audit artifacts, illustrating a practical path to trustworthy LLM
assistance in sensitive DOE compliance workflows.

### [99] [Autonomous generation of different courses of action in mechanized combat operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05182)
*Johan Schubert,Patrik Hansen,Pontus Hörling,Ronnie Johansson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A methodology for generating and evaluating military courses of action for mechanized battalions during combat operations, producing thousands of alternatives and identifying superior options based on opponent status and battle conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support decision-making during military ground combat operations by providing systematic recommendations for mechanized battalion actions, addressing the need for adaptive planning as combat conditions evolve.

Method: Generates thousands of individual action alternatives from initial assessments, evaluates them based on opponent status, unit composition, force ratios, offense/defense types, and advance rates using field manuals, with concurrent generation and evaluation processes.

Result: Produces a variety of alternative courses of action with superior outcomes, enabling management of new course generation based on previously evaluated actions and facilitating revised planning as combat unfolds.

Conclusion: The methodology effectively supports sequential decision-making in military operations by systematically generating, evaluating, and updating courses of action as combat conditions change, providing decision-makers with adaptive planning capabilities.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a methodology designed to support decision-making
during the execution phase of military ground combat operations, with a focus
on one's actions. This methodology generates and evaluates recommendations for
various courses of action for a mechanized battalion, commencing with an
initial set assessed by their anticipated outcomes. It systematically produces
thousands of individual action alternatives, followed by evaluations aimed at
identifying alternative courses of action with superior outcomes. These
alternatives are appraised in light of the opponent's status and actions,
considering unit composition, force ratios, types of offense and defense, and
anticipated advance rates. Field manuals evaluate battle outcomes and
advancement rates. The processes of generation and evaluation work
concurrently, yielding a variety of alternative courses of action. This
approach facilitates the management of new course generation based on
previously evaluated actions. As the combat unfolds and conditions evolve,
revised courses of action are formulated for the decision-maker within a
sequential decision-making framework.

*Valeriu Dimidov,Faisal Hawlader,Sasan Jafarnejad,Raphaël Frank*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-based agents show promise for cleaning predictive maintenance logs by handling generic errors effectively, though domain-specific errors remain challenging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Economic constraints, limited datasets, and expertise shortages hinder predictive maintenance adoption in automotive sector; LLMs offer opportunity to overcome these barriers.

Method: Evaluate LLM agents on cleaning tasks involving six types of noise in maintenance logs, including typos, missing fields, near-duplicates, and incorrect dates.

Result: LLMs are effective at handling generic cleaning tasks and offer promising foundation for industrial applications, though domain-specific errors remain challenging.

Conclusion: LLM-based agents provide viable approach for predictive maintenance data cleaning pipelines, with potential for further improvements through specialized training and enhanced agentic capabilities.

Abstract: Economic constraints, limited availability of datasets for reproducibility
and shortages of specialized expertise have long been recognized as key
challenges to the adoption and advancement of predictive maintenance (PdM) in
the automotive sector. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) presents
an opportunity to overcome these barriers and speed up the transition of PdM
from research to industrial practice. Under these conditions, we explore the
potential of LLM-based agents to support PdM cleaning pipelines. Specifically,
we focus on maintenance logs, a critical data source for training
well-performing machine learning (ML) models, but one often affected by errors
such as typos, missing fields, near-duplicate entries, and incorrect dates. We
evaluate LLM agents on cleaning tasks involving six distinct types of noise.
Our findings show that LLMs are effective at handling generic cleaning tasks
and offer a promising foundation for future industrial applications. While
domain-specific errors remain challenging, these results highlight the
potential for further improvements through specialized training and enhanced
agentic capabilities.

### [101] [Reasoning Is All You Need for Urban Planning AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05375)
*Sijie Yang,Jiatong Li,Filip Biljecki*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This position paper introduces an Agentic Urban Planning AI Framework that uses reasoning-capable agents to assist urban planning decisions through multi-agent collaboration, transparent reasoning, and constraint verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems excel at pattern recognition in urban planning but lack reasoning capabilities for decision-making. The next frontier is AI-assisted decision-making that can recommend sites, allocate resources, and evaluate trade-offs while reasoning transparently about constraints and stakeholder values.

Method: The framework integrates three cognitive layers (Perception, Foundation, Reasoning) with six logic components (Analysis, Generation, Verification, Evaluation, Collaboration, Decision) through a multi-agent collaboration framework. It emphasizes value-based reasoning, rule-grounded constraint satisfaction, and explainable justifications.

Result: The framework demonstrates how AI agents can augment human planners by systematically exploring solution spaces, verifying regulatory compliance, and deliberating over trade-offs transparently. It provides a comprehensive architecture with benchmark evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The Agentic Urban Planning AI Framework shows how AI can amplify human judgment with computational reasoning capabilities rather than replacing it, addressing critical gaps in current statistical learning approaches for urban planning decision-making.

Abstract: AI has proven highly successful at urban planning analysis -- learning
patterns from data to predict future conditions. The next frontier is
AI-assisted decision-making: agents that recommend sites, allocate resources,
and evaluate trade-offs while reasoning transparently about constraints and
stakeholder values. Recent breakthroughs in reasoning AI -- CoT prompting,
ReAct, and multi-agent collaboration frameworks -- now make this vision
achievable.
  This position paper presents the Agentic Urban Planning AI Framework for
reasoning-capable planning agents that integrates three cognitive layers
(Perception, Foundation, Reasoning) with six logic components (Analysis,
Generation, Verification, Evaluation, Collaboration, Decision) through a
multi-agents collaboration framework. We demonstrate why planning decisions
require explicit reasoning capabilities that are value-based (applying
normative principles), rule-grounded (guaranteeing constraint satisfaction),
and explainable (generating transparent justifications) -- requirements that
statistical learning alone cannot fulfill. We compare reasoning agents with
statistical learning, present a comprehensive architecture with benchmark
evaluation metrics, and outline critical research challenges. This framework
shows how AI agents can augment human planners by systematically exploring
solution spaces, verifying regulatory compliance, and deliberating over
trade-offs transparently -- not replacing human judgment but amplifying it with
computational reasoning capabilities.
