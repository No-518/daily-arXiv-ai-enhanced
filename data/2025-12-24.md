### [1] [PHANTOM: PHysical ANamorphic Threats Obstructing Connected Vehicle Mobility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19711)
*Md Nahid Hasan Shuvo,Moinul Hossain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHANTOM is a novel framework that uses anamorphic art to create perspective-dependent adversarial attacks on connected autonomous vehicles, achieving high success rates while disrupting both perception and V2X communication systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAVs rely on vision-based DNNs and V2X communication but remain vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks. Current attacks often require model access or lack transferability across different detector architectures.

Method: PHANTOM uses anamorphic art principles to craft perspective-dependent adversarial examples that appear natural to humans but cause misclassification by object detectors. It operates in black-box settings without model access and exploits geometric distortions that transfer across multiple detector architectures.

Result: Achieves over 90% attack success rate under optimal conditions, maintains 60-80% effectiveness in degraded environments, activates within 6-10 meters, and causes network-wide disruption increasing Peak Age of Information by 68-89% in V2X communications.

Conclusion: PHANTOM exposes critical vulnerabilities in both perception and communication layers of CAV ecosystems, demonstrating that perspective-dependent adversarial attacks can effectively disrupt connected vehicle systems without requiring model access.

Abstract: Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) rely on vision-based deep neural networks (DNNs) and low-latency (Vehicle-to-Everything) V2X communication to navigate safely and efficiently. Despite their advances, these systems remain vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce PHANTOM (PHysical ANamorphic Threats Obstructing connected vehicle Mobility), a novel framework for crafting and deploying perspective-dependent adversarial examples using \textit{anamorphic art}. PHANTOM exploits geometric distortions that appear natural to humans but are misclassified with high confidence by state-of-the-art object detectors. Unlike conventional attacks, PHANTOM operates in black-box settings without model access and demonstrates strong transferability across four diverse detector architectures (YOLOv5, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and RetinaNet). Comprehensive evaluation in CARLA across varying speeds, weather conditions, and lighting scenarios shows that PHANTOM achieves over 90\% attack success rate under optimal conditions and maintains 60-80\% effectiveness even in degraded environments. The attack activates within 6-10 meters of the target, providing insufficient time for safe maneuvering. Beyond individual vehicle deception, PHANTOM triggers network-wide disruption in CAV systems: SUMO-OMNeT++ co-simulation demonstrates that false emergency messages propagate through V2X links, increasing Peak Age of Information by 68-89\% and degrading safety-critical communication. These findings expose critical vulnerabilities in both perception and communication layers of CAV ecosystems.

### [2] [Generating the Past, Present and Future from a Motion-Blurred Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19817)
*SaiKiran Tedla,Kelly Zhu,Trevor Canham,Felix Taubner,Michael S. Brown,Kiriakos N. Kutulakos,David B. Lindell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new technique uses pre-trained video diffusion models to recover complex scene dynamics from motion-blurred images, revealing what happened before, during, and after image capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion blur encodes information about scene and camera motion during exposure, but existing methods rely on handcrafted priors and struggle with complex dynamics. They also don't recover what occurred before or after image capture.

Method: Repurposes a pre-trained video diffusion model trained on internet-scale datasets to recover videos showing scene dynamics during capture and what might have occurred immediately before or after.

Result: Outperforms previous methods, generalizes to challenging in-the-wild images, and supports downstream tasks like recovering camera trajectories, object motion, and dynamic 3D scene structure.

Conclusion: The approach is robust and versatile, demonstrating that motion-blurred images can reveal rich information about scene dynamics across time when leveraging large-scale video priors.

Abstract: We seek to answer the question: what can a motion-blurred image reveal about a scene's past, present, and future? Although motion blur obscures image details and degrades visual quality, it also encodes information about scene and camera motion during an exposure. Previous techniques leverage this information to estimate a sharp image from an input blurry one, or to predict a sequence of video frames showing what might have occurred at the moment of image capture. However, they rely on handcrafted priors or network architectures to resolve ambiguities in this inverse problem, and do not incorporate image and video priors on large-scale datasets. As such, existing methods struggle to reproduce complex scene dynamics and do not attempt to recover what occurred before or after an image was taken. Here, we introduce a new technique that repurposes a pre-trained video diffusion model trained on internet-scale datasets to recover videos revealing complex scene dynamics during the moment of capture and what might have occurred immediately into the past or future. Our approach is robust and versatile; it outperforms previous methods for this task, generalizes to challenging in-the-wild images, and supports downstream tasks such as recovering camera trajectories, object motion, and dynamic 3D scene structure.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for realistic post-capture refocusing using video diffusion models that generates focal stacks from single defocused images, enabling interactive focus adjustment after photo capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autofocus systems often fail to capture the intended subject, and users frequently wish to adjust focus after capture, but current solutions are limited.

We release a large-scale focal stack dataset acquired under diverse real-world smartphone conditions to support this work and future research.

### [4] [RANSAC Scoring Functions: Analysis and Reality Check](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19850)
*A. Shekhovtsov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper re-examines scoring functions for geometric model fitting in RANSAC, shows MAGSAC++ is equivalent to basic Gaussian-uniform likelihood, and finds all scoring functions perform similarly in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically re-examine scoring functions for robust geometric model fitting, particularly analyzing the state-of-the-art MAGSAC++ method and establishing proper theoretical foundations.

Method: Extends geometric error to spherical noises, analyzes robust mixture models with uniform outliers, provides theoretical analysis of MAGSAC++ derivation, and proposes experimental methodology with validation sets.

Result: MAGSAC++ derivation lacks sound principles and is numerically equivalent to simple Gaussian-uniform likelihood. All scoring functions perform identically in experiments, including learned distributions.

Conclusion: Comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis reveals MAGSAC++ offers no advantage over simpler methods, providing critical foundation for future robust fitting research.

Abstract: We revisit the problem of assigning a score (a quality of fit) to candidate geometric models -- one of the key components of RANSAC for robust geometric fitting. In a non-robust setting, the ``gold standard'' scoring function, known as the geometric error, follows from a probabilistic model with Gaussian noises. We extend it to spherical noises. In a robust setting, we consider a mixture with uniformly distributed outliers and show that a threshold-based parameterization leads to a unified view of likelihood-based and robust M-estimators and associated local optimization schemes.
  Next we analyze MAGSAC++ which stands out for two reasons. First, it achieves the best results according to existing benchmarks. Second, it makes quite different modeling assumptions and derivation steps. We discovered, however that the derivation does not correspond to sound principles and the resulting score function is in fact numerically equivalent to a simple Gaussian-uniform likelihood, a basic model within the proposed framework.
  Finally, we propose an experimental methodology for evaluating scoring functions: assuming either a large validation set, or a small random validation set in expectation. We find that all scoring functions, including using a learned inlier distribution, perform identically. In particular, MAGSAC++ score is found to be neither better performing than simple contenders nor less sensitive to the choice of the threshold hyperparameter.
  Our theoretical and experimental analysis thus comprehensively revisit the state-of-the-art, which is critical for any future research seeking to improve the methods or apply them to other robust fitting problems.

### [5] [HyGE-Occ: Hybrid View-Transformation with 3D Gaussian and Edge Priors for 3D Panoptic Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19871)
*Jong Wook Kim,Wonseok Roh,Ha Dam Baek,Pilhyeon Lee,Jonghyun Choi,Sangpil Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyGE-Occ introduces a hybrid view-transformation branch with 3D Gaussian and edge priors to improve geometric consistency and boundary awareness for 3D panoptic occupancy prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for 3D panoptic occupancy prediction struggle with maintaining precise geometry and capturing accurate spatial ranges of 3D instances, which is critical for robust panoptic separation in complex environments.

Method: HyGE-Occ uses a hybrid view-transformation branch that fuses continuous Gaussian-based depth representation with discretized depth-bin formulation to produce BEV features with improved geometric consistency. It also extracts edge maps from BEV features as auxiliary information to learn edge cues for better boundary awareness.

Result: On the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset, HyGE-Occ outperforms existing work, demonstrating superior 3D geometric reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid approach with Gaussian and edge priors effectively enhances both geometric consistency and boundary awareness in 3D panoptic occupancy prediction, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: 3D Panoptic Occupancy Prediction aims to reconstruct a dense volumetric scene map by predicting the semantic class and instance identity of every occupied region in 3D space. Achieving such fine-grained 3D understanding requires precise geometric reasoning and spatially consistent scene representation across complex environments. However, existing approaches often struggle to maintain precise geometry and capture the precise spatial range of 3D instances critical for robust panoptic separation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce HyGE-Occ, a novel framework that leverages a hybrid view-transformation branch with 3D Gaussian and edge priors to enhance both geometric consistency and boundary awareness in 3D panoptic occupancy prediction. HyGE-Occ employs a hybrid view-transformation branch that fuses a continuous Gaussian-based depth representation with a discretized depth-bin formulation, producing BEV features with improved geometric consistency and structural coherence. In parallel, we extract edge maps from BEV features and use them as auxiliary information to learn edge cues. In our extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset, HyGE-Occ outperforms existing work, demonstrating superior 3D geometric reasoning.

### [6] [Widget2Code: From Visual Widgets to UI Code via Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19918)
*Houston H. Zhang,Tao Zhang,Baoze Lin,Yuanqi Xue,Yincheng Zhu,Huan Liu,Li Gu,Linfeng Ye,Ziqiang Wang,Xinxin Zuo,Yang Wang,Yuanhao Yu,Zhixiang Chi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Widget2Code: Generating executable code from widget images using multimodal LLMs with improved perceptual understanding and structured code generation via WidgetFactory infrastructure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Widgets are compact, context-free micro-interfaces with dense layouts and iconography under strict spatial constraints, but lack accessible markup and are proprietary, unlike web/mobile UIs with available (image, code) pairs.

Method: Joint approach with perceptual understanding (assembling atomic components with icon retrieval) and structured code generation via WidgetFactory infrastructure including WidgetDSL (framework-agnostic domain-specific language), compiler for multiple front-end implementations, and adaptive rendering module.

Result: Multimodal LLMs outperform specialized UI2Code methods but still produce unreliable code; proposed baseline substantially enhances visual fidelity and establishes strong foundation for Widget2Code research.

Conclusion: Widget2Code addresses unique challenges of widget code generation, introduces benchmark with fine-grained metrics, and provides unified infrastructure (WidgetFactory) that advances both perceptual understanding and structured code generation for compact widget interfaces.

Abstract: User interface to code (UI2Code) aims to generate executable code that can faithfully reconstruct a given input UI. Prior work focuses largely on web pages and mobile screens, leaving app widgets underexplored. Unlike web or mobile UIs with rich hierarchical context, widgets are compact, context-free micro-interfaces that summarize key information through dense layouts and iconography under strict spatial constraints. Moreover, while (image, code) pairs are widely available for web or mobile UIs, widget designs are proprietary and lack accessible markup. We formalize this setting as the Widget-to-Code (Widget2Code) and introduce an image-only widget benchmark with fine-grained, multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. Benchmarking shows that although generalized multimodal large language models (MLLMs) outperform specialized UI2Code methods, they still produce unreliable and visually inconsistent code. To address these limitations, we develop a baseline that jointly advances perceptual understanding and structured code generation. At the perceptual level, we follow widget design principles to assemble atomic components into complete layouts, equipped with icon retrieval and reusable visualization modules. At the system level, we design an end-to-end infrastructure, WidgetFactory, which includes a framework-agnostic widget-tailored domain-specific language (WidgetDSL) and a compiler that translates it into multiple front-end implementations (e.g., React, HTML/CSS). An adaptive rendering module further refines spatial dimensions to satisfy compactness constraints. Together, these contributions substantially enhance visual fidelity, establishing a strong baseline and unified infrastructure for future Widget2Code research.

### [7] [Unified Brain Surface and Volume Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19928)
*S. Mazdak Abulnaga,Andrew Hoopes,Malte Hoffmann,Robin Magnet,Maks Ovsjanikov,Lilla Zöllei,John Guttag,Bruce Fischl,Adrian Dalca*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeurAlign is a deep learning framework that jointly registers both cortical surface and subcortical volume in brain MRI scans using a unified volume-and-surface representation, achieving better accuracy and speed than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional brain MRI registration methods treat volumetric and surface-based registration separately, leading to inconsistencies that limit downstream neuroscientific analyses. There's a need for a unified approach that aligns both cortical and subcortical regions consistently.

Method: NeurAlign uses a deep learning framework with an intermediate spherical coordinate space to bridge anatomical surface topology with volumetric anatomy. It integrates spherical registration into learning to ensure geometric coherence between volume and surface domains, requiring only an MRI scan as input.

Result: The method consistently outperforms both classical and machine learning-based registration methods, improving Dice score by up to 7 points while maintaining regular deformation fields. It's orders of magnitude faster than standard methods and simpler to use.

Conclusion: NeurAlign sets a new standard for joint cortical and subcortical registration with superior accuracy, fast inference, and ease of use, enabling more consistent cross-subject analysis in neuroscientific studies.

Abstract: Accurate registration of brain MRI scans is fundamental for cross-subject analysis in neuroscientific studies. This involves aligning both the cortical surface of the brain and the interior volume. Traditional methods treat volumetric and surface-based registration separately, which often leads to inconsistencies that limit downstream analyses. We propose a deep learning framework, NeurAlign, that registers $3$D brain MRI images by jointly aligning both cortical and subcortical regions through a unified volume-and-surface-based representation. Our approach leverages an intermediate spherical coordinate space to bridge anatomical surface topology with volumetric anatomy, enabling consistent and anatomically accurate alignment. By integrating spherical registration into the learning, our method ensures geometric coherence between volume and surface domains. In a series of experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, our method consistently outperforms both classical and machine learning-based registration methods -- improving the Dice score by up to 7 points while maintaining regular deformation fields. Additionally, it is orders of magnitude faster than the standard method for this task, and is simpler to use because it requires no additional inputs beyond an MRI scan. With its superior accuracy, fast inference, and ease of use, NeurAlign sets a new standard for joint cortical and subcortical registration.

### [8] [Vehicle-centric Perception via Multimodal Structured Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19934)
*Wentao Wu,Xiao Wang,Chenglong Li,Jin Tang,Bin Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VehicleMAE-V2 is a vehicle-centric pre-trained model that uses multimodal structured priors (symmetry, contour, semantics) to enhance masked token reconstruction for better vehicle perception representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches lack effective learning of vehicle-related knowledge during pre-training, resulting in poor capability for modeling general vehicle perception representations needed for surveillance, transportation, and autonomous driving systems.

Method: Proposes VehicleMAE-V2 with three modules: Symmetry-guided Mask Module (SMM) uses vehicle symmetry constraints to select high-quality masked patches; Contour-guided Representation Module (CRM) preserves holistic vehicle structure; Semantics-guided Representation Module (SRM) aligns image-text features through contrastive learning and cross-modal distillation. Pre-trained on Autobot4M dataset (4M vehicle images, 12,693 text descriptions).

Result: Extensive experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate superior performance of VehicleMAE-V2 compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: VehicleMAE-V2 effectively incorporates vehicle-related multimodal structured priors to enhance masked token reconstruction, enabling better learning of generalizable representations for vehicle-centric perception tasks.

Abstract: Vehicle-centric perception plays a crucial role in many intelligent systems, including large-scale surveillance systems, intelligent transportation, and autonomous driving. Existing approaches lack effective learning of vehicle-related knowledge during pre-training, resulting in poor capability for modeling general vehicle perception representations. To handle this problem, we propose VehicleMAE-V2, a novel vehicle-centric pre-trained large model. By exploring and exploiting vehicle-related multimodal structured priors to guide the masked token reconstruction process, our approach can significantly enhance the model's capability to learn generalizable representations for vehicle-centric perception. Specifically, we design the Symmetry-guided Mask Module (SMM), Contour-guided Representation Module (CRM) and Semantics-guided Representation Module (SRM) to incorporate three kinds of structured priors into token reconstruction including symmetry, contour and semantics of vehicles respectively. SMM utilizes the vehicle symmetry constraints to avoid retaining symmetric patches and can thus select high-quality masked image patches and reduce information redundancy. CRM minimizes the probability distribution divergence between contour features and reconstructed features and can thus preserve holistic vehicle structure information during pixel-level reconstruction. SRM aligns image-text features through contrastive learning and cross-modal distillation to address the feature confusion caused by insufficient semantic understanding during masked reconstruction. To support the pre-training of VehicleMAE-V2, we construct Autobot4M, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 4 million vehicle images and 12,693 text descriptions. Extensive experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate the superior performance of VehicleMAE-V2.

### [9] [Block-Recurrent Dynamics in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19941)
*Mozes Jacobs,Thomas Fel,Richard Hakim,Alessandra Brondetta,Demba Ba,T. Andy Keller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Transformers exhibit block-recurrent depth structure where computation can be accurately approximated using far fewer distinct blocks applied recurrently, enabling dynamical systems analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite Vision Transformers becoming standard vision backbones, there's no settled framework that interprets Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow. The authors seek to provide a mechanistic account of ViTs' computational phenomenology through dynamical systems analysis.

Method: Introduce Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH) arguing trained ViTs admit block-recurrent depth structure. Train block-recurrent surrogates called Raptor (Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers) to test the hypothesis. Analyze representational similarity matrices and train models to recover performance with fewer blocks.

Result: Demonstrate that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure. Train a Raptor model achieving 96% of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy with only 2 blocks at equivalent computational cost. Discover directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins, token-specific dynamics, and collapse to low rank updates in late depth.

Conclusion: A compact recurrent program emerges along ViT depth, pointing to a low-complexity normative solution that enables these models to be studied through principled dynamical systems analysis, supporting the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis.

Abstract: As Vision Transformers (ViTs) become standard vision backbones, a mechanistic account of their computational phenomenology is essential. Despite architectural cues that hint at dynamical structure, there is no settled framework that interprets Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow. In this work, we introduce the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH), arguing that trained ViTs admit a block-recurrent depth structure such that the computation of the original $L$ blocks can be accurately rewritten using only $k \ll L$ distinct blocks applied recurrently. Across diverse ViTs, between-layer representational similarity matrices suggest few contiguous phases. To determine whether these phases reflect genuinely reusable computation, we train block-recurrent surrogates of pretrained ViTs: Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers (Raptor). In small-scale, we demonstrate that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure and subsequently correlate with our ability to accurately fit Raptor. We then provide an empirical existence proof for BRH by training a Raptor model to recover $96\%$ of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy in only 2 blocks at equivalent computational cost. Finally, we leverage our hypothesis to develop a program of Dynamical Interpretability. We find i) directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins with self-correcting trajectories under small perturbations, ii) token-specific dynamics, where cls executes sharp late reorientations while patch tokens exhibit strong late-stage coherence toward their mean direction, and iii) a collapse to low rank updates in late depth, consistent with convergence to low-dimensional attractors. Altogether, we find a compact recurrent program emerges along ViT depth, pointing to a low-complexity normative solution that enables these models to be studied through principled dynamical systems analysis.

### [10] [Enhancing annotations for 5D apple pose estimation through 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20148)
*Robert van de Ven,Trim Bresilla,Bram Nelissen,Ard Nieuwenhuizen,Eldert J. van Henten,Gert Kootstra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pipeline using 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction to automate apple pose estimation annotations, reducing manual labeling by 99.6% while achieving high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Apple pose estimation is challenging due to environmental variation, occlusions, and the difficulty/time-consuming nature of manual keypoint annotation. Traditional methods require visible keypoints like calyx for annotations, but these are often occluded, leading to conflicting/missing annotations across images.

Method: Proposed pipeline: 1) 3D Gaussian Splatting for orchard scene reconstruction, 2) simplified annotations in 3D space, 3) automated projection of annotations to 2D images, 4) training and evaluation of pose estimation method. This reduces manual annotation from thousands to just 105 annotations.

Result: 105 manual annotations generated 28,191 training labels (99.6% reduction). Best performance with labels of fruits ≤95% occluded: F1 score 0.927 on original images, 0.970 on rendered images. Training dataset size had minimal effect on performance. Position estimation best for least occluded fruits, worsening with occlusion. Orientation estimation failed to learn correctly.

Conclusion: 3D reconstruction enables efficient large-scale annotation for occluded fruit pose estimation, dramatically reducing manual effort while maintaining good position estimation performance, though orientation estimation remains challenging.

Abstract: Automating tasks in orchards is challenging because of the large amount of variation in the environment and occlusions. One of the challenges is apple pose estimation, where key points, such as the calyx, are often occluded. Recently developed pose estimation methods no longer rely on these key points, but still require them for annotations, making annotating challenging and time-consuming. Due to the abovementioned occlusions, there can be conflicting and missing annotations of the same fruit between different images. Novel 3D reconstruction methods can be used to simplify annotating and enlarge datasets. We propose a novel pipeline consisting of 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct an orchard scene, simplified annotations, automated projection of the annotations to images, and the training and evaluation of a pose estimation method. Using our pipeline, 105 manual annotations were required to obtain 28,191 training labels, a reduction of 99.6%. Experimental results indicated that training with labels of fruits that are $\leq95\%$ occluded resulted in the best performance, with a neutral F1 score of 0.927 on the original images and 0.970 on the rendered images. Adjusting the size of the training dataset had small effects on the model performance in terms of F1 score and pose estimation accuracy. It was found that the least occluded fruits had the best position estimation, which worsened as the fruits became more occluded. It was also found that the tested pose estimation method was unable to correctly learn the orientation estimation of apples.

*Haoyi Zhong,Fang-Lue Zhang,Andrew Chalmers,Taehyun Rhee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SE360 is a framework for multi-condition guided object editing in 360° panoramas using a coarse-to-fine autonomous data generation pipeline and a Transformer-based diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing instruction-based image editing methods produce implausible results when applied to 360° panoramas in both equirectangular projections and perspective views, creating a need for specialized 360° panorama editing solutions.

Method: 1) Novel coarse-to-fine autonomous data generation pipeline using Vision-Language Model and adaptive projection adjustment for hierarchical analysis; 2) Cost-effective two-stage data refinement strategy; 3) Transformer-based diffusion model trained on the constructed dataset for flexible object editing guided by text, mask, or reference image.

Result: The method outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and semantic accuracy for 360° panorama editing, producing semantically meaningful and geometrically consistent results even from unlabeled panoramas.

Conclusion: SE360 provides an effective framework for multi-condition guided object editing in 360° panoramas, addressing the limitations of existing methods through autonomous data generation and specialized training.

Abstract: While instruction-based image editing is emerging, extending it to 360$^\circ$ panoramas introduces additional challenges. Existing methods often produce implausible results in both equirectangular projections (ERP) and perspective views. To address these limitations, we propose SE360, a novel framework for multi-condition guided object editing in 360$^\circ$ panoramas. At its core is a novel coarse-to-fine autonomous data generation pipeline without manual intervention. This pipeline leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and adaptive projection adjustment for hierarchical analysis, ensuring the holistic segmentation of objects and their physical context. The resulting data pairs are both semantically meaningful and geometrically consistent, even when sourced from unlabeled panoramas. Furthermore, we introduce a cost-effective, two-stage data refinement strategy to improve data realism and mitigate model overfitting to erase artifacts. Based on the constructed dataset, we train a Transformer-based diffusion model to allow flexible object editing guided by text, mask, or reference image in 360$^\circ$ panoramas. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and semantic accuracy.

*Zixuan Huang,Xiang Li,Zhaoyang Lv,James M. Rehg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video Foundation Models trained on 2D videos develop strong 3D understanding without explicit 3D training, sometimes surpassing specialized 3D models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether 3D understanding naturally emerges in Video Foundation Models trained on large-scale 2D video data, and to quantify their 3D awareness capabilities.

Method: Proposed a model-agnostic framework that measures 3D awareness by estimating multiple 3D properties from model features using shallow read-outs, benchmarking major Video Foundation Models.

Result: State-of-the-art video generation models show strong 3D understanding of objects and scenes despite no 3D training, sometimes exceeding specialized 3D models. The study provides comprehensive 3D benchmarking of major VidFMs.

Conclusion: 3D understanding emerges naturally from training on large video data, providing valuable insights for building scalable 3D models and challenging assumptions about needing explicit 3D supervision.

Abstract: Videos are continuous 2D projections of 3D worlds. After training on large video data, will global 3D understanding naturally emerge? We study this by quantifying the 3D understanding of existing Video Foundation Models (VidFMs) pretrained on vast video data. We propose the first model-agnostic framework that measures the 3D awareness of various VidFMs by estimating multiple 3D properties from their features via shallow read-outs. Our study presents meaningful findings regarding the 3D awareness of VidFMs on multiple axes. In particular, we show that state-of-the-art video generation models exhibit a strong understanding of 3D objects and scenes, despite not being trained on any 3D data. Such understanding can even surpass that of large expert models specifically trained for 3D tasks. Our findings, together with the 3D benchmarking of major VidFMs, provide valuable observations for building scalable 3D models.

*Long Nguyen,Micha Fauth,Bernhard Jaeger,Daniel Dauner,Maximilian Igl,Andreas Geiger,Kashyap Chitta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TransFuser v6 achieves SOTA on CARLA benchmarks by addressing expert-student misalignment in imitation learning through interventions that narrow visibility, uncertainty, and intent specification gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulators generate unlimited data but imitation learning policies still struggle with robust performance due to misalignment between privileged expert demonstrations (with higher visibility and lower uncertainty) and sensor-based student observations.

Method: Empirical study of expert-student asymmetries, followed by practical interventions to narrow gaps in visibility, uncertainty, and navigational intent specification. TransFuser v6 architecture with perception supervision integrated into shared sim-to-real pipeline.

Result: TFv6 achieves 95 DS on Bench2Drive, more than doubles prior performances on Longest6~v2 and Town13, sets new SOTA on all major CARLA closed-loop benchmarks, and shows consistent gains on NAVSIM and Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End benchmarks.

Conclusion: Addressing expert-student misalignment through targeted interventions significantly improves imitation learning performance in autonomous driving, enabling state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks and demonstrating transferability to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Simulators can generate virtually unlimited driving data, yet imitation learning policies in simulation still struggle to achieve robust closed-loop performance. Motivated by this gap, we empirically study how misalignment between privileged expert demonstrations and sensor-based student observations can limit the effectiveness of imitation learning. More precisely, experts have significantly higher visibility (e.g., ignoring occlusions) and far lower uncertainty (e.g., knowing other vehicles' actions), making them difficult to imitate reliably. Furthermore, navigational intent (i.e., the route to follow) is under-specified in student models at test time via only a single target point. We demonstrate that these asymmetries can measurably limit driving performance in CARLA and offer practical interventions to address them. After careful modifications to narrow the gaps between expert and student, our TransFuser v6 (TFv6) student policy achieves a new state of the art on all major publicly available CARLA closed-loop benchmarks, reaching 95 DS on Bench2Drive and more than doubling prior performances on Longest6~v2 and Town13. Additionally, by integrating perception supervision from our dataset into a shared sim-to-real pipeline, we show consistent gains on the NAVSIM and Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End driving benchmarks. Our code, data, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/autonomousvision/lead.

Conclusion: HistoWAS addresses limitations in current pathomic analysis by providing a framework to link tissue spatial organization to clinical outcomes, enabling biomarker discovery and better understanding of tissue characteristics' clinical relevance.

Abstract: High-throughput "pathomic" analysis of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) offers new opportunities to study tissue characteristics and for biomarker discovery. However, the clinical relevance of the tissue characteristics at the micro- and macro-environment level is limited by the lack of tools that facilitate the measurement of the spatial interaction of individual structure characteristics and their association with clinical parameters. To address these challenges, we introduce HistoWAS (Histology-Wide Association Study), a computational framework designed to link tissue spatial organization to clinical outcomes. Specifically, HistoWAS implements (1) a feature space that augments conventional metrics with 30 topological and spatial features, adapted from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) point pattern analysis, to quantify tissue micro-architecture; and (2) an association study engine, inspired by Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS), that performs mass univariate regression for each feature with statistical correction. As a proof of concept, we applied HistoWAS to analyze a total of 102 features (72 conventional object-level features and our 30 spatial features) using 385 PAS-stained WSIs from 206 participants in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP). The code and data have been released to https://github.com/hrlblab/histoWAS.

*Le Feng,Li Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WSD-MIL is a new multiple instance learning method for computational pathology that uses window scale decay attention and region gating to efficiently model tumor regions at varying scales while reducing computational memory by 62%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MIL methods overlook complex semantic relationships among instances in whole slide images. Transformer-based approaches have quadratic computational complexity limiting scalability, and fixed-scale attention mechanisms struggle with varying tumor region scales and distance-based decay effects of patch relevance.

Method: WSD-MIL consists of: 1) Window scale decay attention module using cluster-based sampling to reduce computation while progressively decaying attention window-scale to capture local instance relationships at varying scales; 2) Squeeze-and-excitation based region gate module that dynamically adjusts window weights to enhance global information modeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CAMELYON16 and TCGA-BRCA datasets while reducing computational memory by 62%.

Conclusion: WSD-MIL effectively addresses computational efficiency and scale variation challenges in computational pathology MIL, providing a scalable solution for whole slide image analysis with improved diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: In recent years, the integration of pre-trained foundational models with multiple instance learning (MIL) has improved diagnostic accuracy in computational pathology. However, existing MIL methods focus on optimizing feature extractors and aggregation strategies while overlooking the complex semantic relationships among instances within whole slide image (WSI). Although Transformer-based MIL approaches aiming to model instance dependencies, the quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability to large-scale WSIs. Moreover, due to the pronounced variations in tumor region scales across different WSIs, existing Transformer-based methods employing fixed-scale attention mechanisms face significant challenges in precisely capturing local instance correlations and fail to account for the distance-based decay effect of patch relevance. To address these challenges, we propose window scale decay MIL (WSD-MIL), designed to enhance the capacity to model tumor regions of varying scales while improving computational efficiency. WSD-MIL comprises: 1) a window scale decay based attention module, which employs a cluster-based sampling strategy to reduce computational costs while progressively decaying attention window-scale to capture local instance relationships at varying scales; and 2) a squeeze-and-excitation based region gate module, which dynamically adjusts window weights to enhance global information modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that WSD-MIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CAMELYON16 and TCGA-BRCA datasets while reducing 62% of the computational memory. The code will be publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Guava is economically important in Bangladesh, but anthracnose and fruit fly infections reduce quality and productivity. Early disease detection through expert systems can minimize losses and protect harvests.

Method: Used CNN combined with traditional machine learning techniques, specifically proposing ensemble models that combine CNN-ML with Gradient Boosting Machine. Applied to GFDD24 dataset from Rajshahi and Pabna plantations.

Result: Achieved highest classification accuracy of approximately 99.99% for guava disease detection using the CNN-ML ensemble approach with Gradient Boosting Machine.

Conclusion: CNN-ML cascade framework demonstrates strong, high-accuracy guava disease detection suitable for real-time agricultural monitoring systems in Bangladesh.

Abstract: As a significant agricultural country, Bangladesh utilizes its fertile land for guava cultivation and dedicated labor to boost its economic development. In a nation like Bangladesh, enhancing guava production and agricultural practices plays a crucial role in its economy. Anthracnose and fruit fly infection can lower the quality and productivity of guava, a crucial tropical fruit. Expert systems that detect diseases early can reduce losses and safeguard the harvest. Images of guava fruits classified into the Healthy, Fruit Flies, and Anthracnose classes are included in the Guava Fruit Disease Dataset 2024 (GFDD24), which comes from plantations in Rajshahi and Pabna, Bangladesh. This study aims to create models using CNN alongside traditional machine learning techniques that can effectively identify guava diseases in locally cultivated varieties in Bangladesh. In order to achieve the highest classification accuracy of approximately 99.99% for the guava dataset, we propose utilizing ensemble models that combine CNNML with Gradient Boosting Machine. In general, the CNN-ML cascade framework exhibits strong, high-accuracy guava disease detection that is appropriate for real-time agricultural monitoring systems.

### [17] [A Dual-Branch Local-Global Framework for Cross-Resolution Land Cover Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19990)
*Peng Gao,Ke Li,Di Wang,Yongshan Zhu,Yiming Zhang,Xuemei Luo,Yifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DDTM: A dual-branch weakly supervised framework for cross-resolution land cover mapping that decouples local semantic refinement from global contextual reasoning to address resolution mismatch challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-resolution land cover mapping suffers from severe resolution mismatch between coarse/low-resolution supervision and high-resolution predictions, causing noisy supervision and degraded accuracy. Existing weakly supervised approaches struggle to align fine-grained spatial structures with coarse labels.

Method: Proposes DDTM with two branches: 1) diffusion-based branch for progressive fine-scale local semantic refinement under coarse supervision, and 2) transformer-based branch for long-range contextual consistency across large spatial extents. Also includes pseudo-label confidence evaluation module to mitigate noise from cross-resolution inconsistencies.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Chesapeake Bay benchmark with 66.52% mIoU, substantially outperforming prior weakly supervised methods.

Conclusion: DDTM effectively addresses cross-resolution land cover mapping challenges by decoupling local refinement from global reasoning, with the dual-branch framework and confidence evaluation module enabling more accurate predictions from coarse supervision.

Abstract: Cross-resolution land cover mapping aims to produce high-resolution semantic predictions from coarse or low-resolution supervision, yet the severe resolution mismatch makes effective learning highly challenging. Existing weakly supervised approaches often struggle to align fine-grained spatial structures with coarse labels, leading to noisy supervision and degraded mapping accuracy. To tackle this problem, we propose DDTM, a dual-branch weakly supervised framework that explicitly decouples local semantic refinement from global contextual reasoning. Specifically, DDTM introduces a diffusion-based branch to progressively refine fine-scale local semantics under coarse supervision, while a transformer-based branch enforces long-range contextual consistency across large spatial extents. In addition, we design a pseudo-label confidence evaluation module to mitigate noise induced by cross-resolution inconsistencies and to selectively exploit reliable supervisory signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDTM establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Chesapeake Bay benchmark, achieving 66.52\% mIoU and substantially outperforming prior weakly supervised methods.

*Zhenhao Li,Shaohan Yi,Zheng Liu,Leonartinus Gao,Minh Ngoc Le,Ambrose Ling,Zhuoran Wang,Md Amirul Islam,Zhixiang Chi,Yuanhao Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIVA is a lightweight modular adapter system for diffusion models that enables precise motion control for image animation using minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models struggle with image animation due to video data scarcity causing memorization over prompt compliance, and poor generalization to novel motion patterns with limited training data.

Method: Proposes Modular Image-to-Video Adapter (MIVA) - lightweight sub-networks attachable to pre-trained DMs, each capturing a single motion pattern, trainable on ~10 samples with consumer GPUs, scalable via parallelization.

Result: MIVA enables more precise motion control while maintaining or surpassing generation quality of models trained on much larger datasets, eliminating need for prompt engineering.

Conclusion: MIVA provides an efficient, scalable solution for motion-controlled image animation using diffusion models with minimal training data requirements.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have recently achieved impressive photorealism in image and video generation. However, their application to image animation remains limited, even when trained on large-scale datasets. Two primary challenges contribute to this: the high dimensionality of video signals leads to a scarcity of training data, causing DMs to favor memorization over prompt compliance when generating motion; moreover, DMs struggle to generalize to novel motion patterns not present in the training set, and fine-tuning them to learn such patterns, especially using limited training data, is still under-explored. To address these limitations, we propose Modular Image-to-Video Adapter (MIVA), a lightweight sub-network attachable to a pre-trained DM, each designed to capture a single motion pattern and scalable via parallelization. MIVAs can be efficiently trained on approximately ten samples using a single consumer-grade GPU. At inference time, users can specify motion by selecting one or multiple MIVAs, eliminating the need for prompt engineering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MIVA enables more precise motion control while maintaining, or even surpassing, the generation quality of models trained on significantly larger datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaSeRS dataset and SegEarth-R2 model address complex language-to-pixel grounding in remote sensing, handling hierarchical granularity, multi-target instructions, and implicit intent for better geospatial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models fail at complex geospatial scenarios like segmenting objects at various granularities, executing multi-target instructions, and interpreting implicit user intent in remote sensing applications. Existing datasets oversimplify these challenges, leading to sensitivity-prone real-world models.

Method: 1) LaSeRS dataset: First large-scale dataset for comprehensive training/evaluation across four dimensions: hierarchical granularity, target multiplicity, reasoning requirements, and linguistic variability. 2) SegEarth-R2 MLLM architecture: Features spatial attention supervision for small object localization and flexible segmentation query mechanism for single/multi-target scenarios.

Result: SegEarth-R2 achieves outstanding performance on LaSeRS and other benchmarks, establishing a powerful baseline for next-generation geospatial segmentation. The model effectively handles complex language-guided segmentation tasks in remote sensing.

Conclusion: LaSeRS dataset and SegEarth-R2 model address critical gaps in language-guided segmentation for remote sensing, enabling better handling of complex geospatial reasoning scenarios and moving beyond simple commands to support real-world applications like disaster response and environmental monitoring.

Abstract: Effectively grounding complex language to pixels in remote sensing (RS) images is a critical challenge for applications like disaster response and environmental monitoring. Current models can parse simple, single-target commands but fail when presented with complex geospatial scenarios, e.g., segmenting objects at various granularities, executing multi-target instructions, and interpreting implicit user intent. To drive progress against these failures, we present LaSeRS, the first large-scale dataset built for comprehensive training and evaluation across four critical dimensions of language-guided segmentation: hierarchical granularity, target multiplicity, reasoning requirements, and linguistic variability. By capturing these dimensions, LaSeRS moves beyond simple commands, providing a benchmark for complex geospatial reasoning. This addresses a critical gap: existing datasets oversimplify, leading to sensitivity-prone real-world models. We also propose SegEarth-R2, an MLLM architecture designed for comprehensive language-guided segmentation in RS, which directly confronts these challenges. The model's effectiveness stems from two key improvements: (1) a spatial attention supervision mechanism specifically handles the localization of small objects and their components, and (2) a flexible and efficient segmentation query mechanism that handles both single-target and multi-target scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our SegEarth-R2 achieves outstanding performance on LaSeRS and other benchmarks, establishing a powerful baseline for the next generation of geospatial segmentation. All data and code will be released at https://github.com/earth-insights/SegEarth-R2.

### [21] [A Contextual Analysis of Driver-Facing and Dual-View Video Inputs for Distraction Detection in Naturalistic Driving Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20025)
*Anthony Dontoh,Stephanie Ivey,Armstrong Aboah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dual-view (driver + road) distraction detection shows mixed results: SlowOnly improves 9.8% with dual views, but SlowFast drops 7.2% due to representational conflicts, highlighting need for fusion-aware architecture design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing distracted driving detection models rely only on driver-facing views and overlook important environmental context that influences driving behavior, limiting their effectiveness in real-world conditions.

Method: Used synchronized dual-camera recordings from real-world driving to benchmark three spatiotemporal action recognition models (SlowFast-R50, X3D-M, SlowOnly-R50) under two configurations: driver-only and stacked dual-view inputs.

Result: Performance gains depend strongly on architecture: SlowOnly improved 9.8% with dual-view inputs, but SlowFast experienced 7.2% drop in accuracy due to representational conflicts. X3D-M results not specified but implied mixed outcomes.

Conclusion: Simply adding visual context is insufficient and may cause interference; architecture must be specifically designed for multi-view integration. Future driver monitoring systems need fusion-aware design for effective multimodal analysis.

Abstract: Despite increasing interest in computer vision-based distracted driving detection, most existing models rely exclusively on driver-facing views and overlook crucial environmental context that influences driving behavior. This study investigates whether incorporating road-facing views alongside driver-facing footage improves distraction detection accuracy in naturalistic driving conditions. Using synchronized dual-camera recordings from real-world driving, we benchmark three leading spatiotemporal action recognition architectures: SlowFast-R50, X3D-M, and SlowOnly-R50. Each model is evaluated under two input configurations: driver-only and stacked dual-view. Results show that while contextual inputs can improve detection in certain models, performance gains depend strongly on the underlying architecture. The single-pathway SlowOnly model achieved a 9.8 percent improvement with dual-view inputs, while the dual-pathway SlowFast model experienced a 7.2 percent drop in accuracy due to representational conflicts. These findings suggest that simply adding visual context is not sufficient and may lead to interference unless the architecture is specifically designed to support multi-view integration. This study presents one of the first systematic comparisons of single- and dual-view distraction detection models using naturalistic driving data and underscores the importance of fusion-aware design for future multimodal driver monitoring systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAPI-GNN learns multifaceted graph profiles from disentangled feature subspaces to model patient-specific pathological relationships, outperforming SOTA methods on medical diagnosis tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph neural networks for multimodal medical diagnosis rely on single static graphs built from indiscriminate features, which limits their ability to model patient-specific pathological relationships.

Method: MAPI-GNN reconstructs the single-graph paradigm by learning multifaceted graph profiles from semantically disentangled feature subspaces using: 1) multi-dimensional discriminator to uncover latent graph-aware patterns, 2) dynamic construction of activation graphs guided by these patterns, and 3) relational fusion engine to aggregate and contextualize the multifaceted profile.

Result: Extensive experiments on two diverse tasks with over 1300 patient samples demonstrate that MAPI-GNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MAPI-GNN's approach of learning multifaceted graph profiles from disentangled feature subspaces enables better modeling of patient-specific pathological relationships and leads to superior medical diagnosis performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Graph neural networks are increasingly applied to multimodal medical diagnosis for their inherent relational modeling capabilities. However, their efficacy is often compromised by the prevailing reliance on a single, static graph built from indiscriminate features, hindering the ability to model patient-specific pathological relationships. To this end, the proposed Multi-Activation Plane Interaction Graph Neural Network (MAPI-GNN) reconstructs this single-graph paradigm by learning a multifaceted graph profile from semantically disentangled feature subspaces. The framework first uncovers latent graph-aware patterns via a multi-dimensional discriminator; these patterns then guide the dynamic construction of a stack of activation graphs; and this multifaceted profile is finally aggregated and contextualized by a relational fusion engine for a robust diagnosis. Extensive experiments on two diverse tasks, comprising over 1300 patient samples, demonstrate that MAPI-GNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

*Lin Li,Jiahui Li,Jiaming Lei,Jun Xiao,Feifei Shao,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: H2em introduces hyperbolic embeddings for compositional zero-shot learning, addressing limitations of Euclidean space in modeling hierarchical structures through dual-hierarchical entailment loss and discriminative alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CZSL methods fail to scale to large-scale taxonomies because Euclidean space's polynomial volume growth cannot match the exponential structure of hierarchical relationships, impairing generalization capacity for real-world applications.

Method: H2em learns Hierarchical Hyperbolic EMbeddings using hyperbolic geometry's tree-like structure properties. It includes: Dual-Hierarchical Entailment Loss with hyperbolic entailment cones to enforce hierarchies; Discriminative Alignment Loss with hard negative mining for geodesic distance between similar compositions; and Hyperbolic Cross-Modal Attention for instance-aware cross-modal infusion.

Result: Extensive ablations on three benchmarks demonstrate that H2em establishes new state-of-the-art performance in both closed-world and open-world CZSL scenarios.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic geometry provides a natural space for embedding hierarchical structures in CZSL, and the proposed H2em framework effectively addresses hierarchical collapse and fine-grained discrimination issues through specialized learning objectives, achieving superior generalization capacity.

Abstract: Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen state-object compositions by generalizing from a training set of their primitives (state and object). Current methods often overlook the rich hierarchical structures, such as the semantic hierarchy of primitives (e.g., apple fruit) and the conceptual hierarchy between primitives and compositions (e.g, sliced apple apple). A few recent efforts have shown effectiveness in modeling these hierarchies through loss regularization within Euclidean space. In this paper, we argue that they fail to scale to the large-scale taxonomies required for real-world CZSL: the space's polynomial volume growth in flat geometry cannot match the exponential structure, impairing generalization capacity. To this end, we propose H2em, a new framework that learns Hierarchical Hyperbolic EMbeddings for CZSL. H2em leverages the unique properties of hyperbolic geometry, a space naturally suited for embedding tree-like structures with low distortion. However, a naive hyperbolic mapping may suffer from hierarchical collapse and poor fine-grained discrimination. We further design two learning objectives to structure this space: a Dual-Hierarchical Entailment Loss that uses hyperbolic entailment cones to enforce the predefined hierarchies, and a Discriminative Alignment Loss with hard negative mining to establish a large geodesic distance between semantically similar compositions. Furthermore, we devise Hyperbolic Cross-Modal Attention to realize instance-aware cross-modal infusion within hyperbolic geometry. Extensive ablations on three benchmarks demonstrate that H2em establishes a new state-of-the-art in both closed-world and open-world scenarios. Our codes will be released.

*Chang Sun,Dongliang Xie,Bo Qin,Hong Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VALLR-Pin extends VALLR to Mandarin lip-reading using dual decoders for characters and Pinyin, with LLM refinement using phonetic context and synthetic error training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mandarin visual speech recognition is challenging due to ambiguous visemes and prevalent homophones, requiring better approaches than existing English-focused methods.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Shared video encoder with dual decoders predicting Chinese characters and Pinyin romanization, 2) LLM refinement using Pinyin-text prompts and fine-tuning on synthetic noisy examples from intermediate checkpoints.

Result: The approach synergizes visual features with phonetic and linguistic context to improve Mandarin lip-reading performance by resolving homophone ambiguities.

Conclusion: VALLR-Pin effectively addresses Mandarin-specific challenges through multi-task learning of character and phonetic outputs combined with LLM-based error correction trained on model-specific error patterns.

Abstract: Visual Speech Recognition aims to transcribe spoken words from silent lip-motion videos. This task is particularly challenging for Mandarin, as visemes are highly ambiguous and homophones are prevalent. We propose VALLR-Pin, a novel two-stage framework that extends the recent VALLR architecture from English to Mandarin. First, a shared video encoder feeds into dual decoders, which jointly predict both Chinese character sequences and their standard Pinyin romanization. The multi-task learning of character and phonetic outputs fosters robust visual-semantic representations. During inference, the text decoder generates multiple candidate transcripts. We construct a prompt by concatenating the Pinyin output with these candidate Chinese sequences and feed it to a large language model to resolve ambiguities and refine the transcription. This provides the LLM with explicit phonetic context to correct homophone-induced errors. Finally, we fine-tune the LLM on synthetic noisy examples: we generate imperfect Pinyin-text pairs from intermediate VALLR-Pin checkpoints using the training data, creating instruction-response pairs for error correction. This endows the LLM with awareness of our model's specific error patterns. In summary, VALLR-Pin synergizes visual features with phonetic and linguistic context to improve Mandarin lip-reading performance.

*Andreas Zinonos,Michał Stypułkowski,Antoni Bigata,Stavros Petridis,Maja Pantic,Nikita Drobyshev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashLips is a real-time lip-sync system that separates lips control from rendering, achieving 100+ FPS with quality matching larger models, using a two-stage approach without masks or complex generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current lip-sync systems often require explicit masks, complex generative models (GANs/diffusion), or have slow inference speeds. There's a need for real-time, high-quality lip-sync that can operate without masks while maintaining visual quality comparable to larger state-of-the-art models.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Compact one-step latent-space editor trained with reconstruction losses (no GANs/diffusion) that uses reference identity, masked target frame, and lips-pose vector; uses self-supervision with mouth-altered variants to eliminate explicit masks at inference. 2) Audio-to-pose transformer trained with flow-matching objective to predict lips-poses vectors from speech.

Result: Achieves real-time performance at over 100 FPS on a single GPU while matching visual quality of larger state-of-the-art models. The system combines deterministic reconstruction with robust audio control in a simple, stable pipeline.

Conclusion: FlashLips demonstrates that high-quality, real-time lip-sync can be achieved through a decoupled approach that separates lips control from rendering, using simple reconstruction losses and self-supervision instead of complex generative models, while eliminating the need for explicit masks at inference.

Abstract: We present FlashLips, a two-stage, mask-free lip-sync system that decouples lips control from rendering and achieves real-time performance running at over 100 FPS on a single GPU, while matching the visual quality of larger state-of-the-art models. Stage 1 is a compact, one-step latent-space editor that reconstructs an image using a reference identity, a masked target frame, and a low-dimensional lips-pose vector, trained purely with reconstruction losses - no GANs or diffusion. To remove explicit masks at inference, we use self-supervision: we generate mouth-altered variants of the target image, that serve as pseudo ground truth for fine-tuning, teaching the network to localize edits to the lips while preserving the rest. Stage 2 is an audio-to-pose transformer trained with a flow-matching objective to predict lips-poses vectors from speech. Together, these stages form a simple and stable pipeline that combines deterministic reconstruction with robust audio control, delivering high perceptual quality and faster-than-real-time speed.

TL;DR: Multimodal pipeline combines visual retrieval, geometric reranking, and semantic search to augment image captions with external contextual knowledge, producing richer event-enriched descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world image captions often lack contextual depth (event background, temporal cues, outcomes, named entities), limiting effectiveness in journalism, education, and digital archives where richer descriptions are essential.

Method: Pipeline retrieves similar images using BEIT-3 and SigLIP, reranks with ORB and SIFT for geometric alignment, extracts context from related articles via semantic search, then fine-tuned Qwen3 model with QLoRA integrates context with base captions from Instruct BLIP.

Result: Evaluated on OpenEvents v1 dataset, approach generates significantly more informative captions compared to traditional methods, showing strong potential for real-world applications.

Conclusion: Multimodal pipeline effectively addresses contextual gaps in image captions by combining visual and textual knowledge, demonstrating practical value for domains requiring deeper visual-textual understanding.

Abstract: Real-world image captions often lack contextual depth, omitting crucial details such as event background, temporal cues, outcomes, and named entities that are not visually discernible. This gap limits the effectiveness of image understanding in domains like journalism, education, and digital archives, where richer, more informative descriptions are essential. To address this, we propose a multimodal pipeline that augments visual input with external textual knowledge. Our system retrieves semantically similar images using BEIT-3 (Flickr30k-384 and COCO-384) and SigLIP So-384, reranks them using ORB and SIFT for geometric alignment, and extracts contextual information from related articles via semantic search. A fine-tuned Qwen3 model with QLoRA then integrates this context with base captions generated by Instruct BLIP (Vicuna-7B) to produce event-enriched, context-aware descriptions. Evaluated on the OpenEvents v1 dataset, our approach generates significantly more informative captions compared to traditional methods, showing strong potential for real-world applications requiring deeper visual-textual understanding

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While learned image codecs have been extended from human to machine perception, progressive compression with fine granular scalability remains unexplored for machine-oriented codecs. There's a need for efficient progressive transmission that maintains high performance in downstream machine tasks.

Method: Proposes PICM-Net based on trit-plane coding, analyzes differences between human- and machine-oriented rate-distortion priorities, examines latent prioritization strategies for machine codecs, and designs an adaptive decoding controller that dynamically determines necessary decoding level during inference to maintain desired confidence in downstream predictions.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate efficient and adaptive progressive transmission while maintaining high performance in downstream classification tasks, establishing a new paradigm for machine-aware progressive image compression.

Conclusion: The work successfully creates a progressive learned image compression codec for machine perception that enables fine granular scalability and adaptive decoding, addressing the gap in machine-oriented progressive compression while maintaining downstream task performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in learned image codecs have been extended from human perception toward machine perception. However, progressive image compression with fine granular scalability (FGS)-which enables decoding a single bitstream at multiple quality levels-remains unexplored for machine-oriented codecs. In this work, we propose a novel progressive learned image compression codec for machine perception, PICM-Net, based on trit-plane coding. By analyzing the difference between human- and machine-oriented rate-distortion priorities, we systematically examine the latent prioritization strategies in terms of machine-oriented codecs. To further enhance real-world adaptability, we design an adaptive decoding controller, which dynamically determines the necessary decoding level during inference time to maintain the desired confidence of downstream machine prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enables efficient and adaptive progressive transmission while maintaining high performance in the downstream classification task, establishing a new paradigm for machine-aware progressive image compression.

*Jinyoung Choi,Youngchae Kwon,Injung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IRSN improves fashion style classification by analyzing item-specific features and their combinations using item region pooling and gated feature fusion, achieving 6.9-15.1% accuracy improvements over baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fashion style classification is challenging due to large visual variation within styles and similarity between different styles. Styles are expressed through both global appearance and attributes of individual items and their combinations.

Method: Propose Item Region-based Style Network (IRSN) with: 1) Item Region Pooling (IRP) to extract features from each item region, 2) Separate analysis of item-specific features, 3) Gated Feature Fusion (GFF) to combine features, and 4) Dual-backbone architecture combining domain-specific and general feature extractors pre-trained on large-scale image-text data.

Result: IRSN improved style classification accuracy by average 6.9% (max 14.5%) on FashionStyle14 and average 7.6% (max 15.1%) on ShowniqV3 across six backbones (EfficientNet, ConvNeXt, Swin Transformer). Visualization shows better capture of differences between similar style classes.

Conclusion: IRSN effectively classifies fashion styles by analyzing item-specific features and their combinations, outperforming baseline models and better capturing subtle differences between visually similar styles.

Abstract: Fashion style classification is a challenging task because of the large visual variation within the same style and the existence of visually similar styles.
  Styles are expressed not only by the global appearance, but also by the attributes of individual items and their combinations.
  In this study, we propose an item region-based fashion style classification network (IRSN) to effectively classify fashion styles by analyzing item-specific features and their combinations in addition to global features.
  IRSN extracts features of each item region using item region pooling (IRP), analyzes them separately, and combines them using gated feature fusion (GFF).
  In addition, we improve the feature extractor by applying a dual-backbone architecture that combines a domain-specific feature extractor and a general feature extractor pre-trained with a large-scale image-text dataset.
  In experiments, applying IRSN to six widely-used backbones, including EfficientNet, ConvNeXt, and Swin Transformer, improved style classification accuracy by an average of 6.9% and a maximum of 14.5% on the FashionStyle14 dataset and by an average of 7.6% and a maximum of 15.1% on the ShowniqV3 dataset. Visualization analysis also supports that the IRSN models are better than the baseline models at capturing differences between similar style classes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates how activation functions and optimizers affect Human Activity Recognition performance using BiLSTM and ConvLSTM architectures on medical activity datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The impact of activation functions and model optimizers on HAR performance is understudied, especially their combined effects in practical healthcare scenarios where reliable activity recognition is critical for timely decision-making.

Method: Tested three activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh) combined with four optimizers (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, Adagrad) using BiLSTM and ConvLSTM architectures on six medically relevant activity classes from HMDB51 and UCF101 datasets.

Result: ConvLSTM consistently outperformed BiLSTM, achieving up to 99% accuracy with Adam/RMSprop optimizers. BiLSTM showed dataset-dependent performance (98% on UCF101, ~60% on HMDB51) and was less robust to AF/MO variations.

Conclusion: The study provides practical insights for optimizing HAR systems, recommending ConvLSTM with Adam/RMSprop for healthcare applications requiring fast, precise activity detection due to superior spatio-temporal learning and stability.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a vital role in healthcare, surveillance, and innovative environments, where reliable action recognition supports timely decision-making and automation. Although deep learning-based HAR systems are widely adopted, the impact of Activation Functions (AFs) and Model Optimizers (MOs) on performance has not been sufficiently analyzed, particularly regarding how their combinations influence model behavior in practical scenarios. Most existing studies focus on architecture design, while the interaction between AF and MO choices remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we investigate the effect of three commonly used activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh) combined with four optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad) using two recurrent deep learning architectures, namely BiLSTM and ConvLSTM. Experiments are conducted on six medically relevant activity classes selected from the HMDB51 and UCF101 datasets, considering their suitability for healthcare-oriented HAR applications. Our experimental results show that ConvLSTM consistently outperforms BiLSTM across both datasets. ConvLSTM, combined with Adam or RMSprop, achieves an accuracy of up to 99.00%, demonstrating strong spatio-temporal learning capabilities and stable performance. While BiLSTM performs reasonably well on UCF101, with accuracy approaching 98.00%, its performance drops to approximately 60.00% on HMDB51, indicating limited robustness across datasets and weaker sensitivity to AF and MO variations. This study provides practical insights for optimizing HAR systems, particularly for real-world healthcare environments where fast and precise activity detection is critical.

TL;DR: LiDARDraft: A method for generating realistic LiDAR point clouds from various inputs (text, images, sketches) using 3D layouts as intermediate representation and ControlNet for generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous LiDAR generation methods struggle with high-quality results and versatile controllability due to the imbalance between complex LiDAR distributions and simple control signals.

Method: Proposes LiDARDraft that: 1) converts text, images, and point clouds into unified 3D layouts, 2) transforms layouts into semantic and depth control signals, 3) uses rangemap-based ControlNet for pixel-level aligned LiDAR generation.

Result: Demonstrates excellent performance in controllable LiDAR point cloud generation, enabling "simulation from scratch" from arbitrary textual descriptions, images, and sketches.

Conclusion: LiDARDraft effectively bridges versatile conditional signals and LiDAR point clouds through 3D layouts, enabling flexible creation of self-driving environments from various user inputs.

Abstract: Generating realistic and diverse LiDAR point clouds is crucial for autonomous driving simulation. Although previous methods achieve LiDAR point cloud generation from user inputs, they struggle to attain high-quality results while enabling versatile controllability, due to the imbalance between the complex distribution of LiDAR point clouds and the simple control signals. To address the limitation, we propose LiDARDraft, which utilizes the 3D layout to build a bridge between versatile conditional signals and LiDAR point clouds. The 3D layout can be trivially generated from various user inputs such as textual descriptions and images. Specifically, we represent text, images, and point clouds as unified 3D layouts, which are further transformed into semantic and depth control signals. Then, we employ a rangemap-based ControlNet to guide LiDAR point cloud generation. This pixel-level alignment approach demonstrates excellent performance in controllable LiDAR point clouds generation, enabling "simulation from scratch", allowing self-driving environments to be created from arbitrary textual descriptions, images and sketches.

*Thanh-Tung Le,Tuan Pham,Tung Nguyen,Deying Kong,Xiaohui Xie,Stephan Mandt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid framework combining deterministic and stochastic methods for novel view synthesis, achieving SOTA quality with 10x faster rendering than fully generative baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deterministic NVS methods render quickly but blur unobserved areas, while diffusion-based methods hallucinate plausible content but are computationally expensive. Need a unified approach that combines speed and quality.

Method: Bidirectional transformer encodes multi-view image tokens and Plucker-ray embeddings into shared latent representation. Two lightweight heads: feed-forward regression head for well-constrained geometry, and masked autoregressive diffusion head for occluded/unseen regions. End-to-end training with joint photometric and diffusion losses.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art image quality while reducing rendering time by an order of magnitude compared to fully generative baselines.

Conclusion: Proposed hybrid framework successfully unifies deterministic and stochastic paradigms for NVS, enabling scalable, high-quality rendering with significantly improved efficiency.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) seeks to render photorealistic, 3D-consistent images of a scene from unseen camera poses given only a sparse set of posed views. Existing deterministic networks render observed regions quickly but blur unobserved areas, whereas stochastic diffusion-based methods hallucinate plausible content yet incur heavy training- and inference-time costs. In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework that unifies the strengths of both paradigms. A bidirectional transformer encodes multi-view image tokens and Plucker-ray embeddings, producing a shared latent representation. Two lightweight heads then act on this representation: (i) a feed-forward regression head that renders pixels where geometry is well constrained, and (ii) a masked autoregressive diffusion head that completes occluded or unseen regions. The entire model is trained end-to-end with joint photometric and diffusion losses, without handcrafted 3D inductive biases, enabling scalability across diverse scenes. Experiments demonstrate that our method attains state-of-the-art image quality while reducing rendering time by an order of magnitude compared with fully generative baselines.

*Alireza Moayedikia,Sattar Dorafshan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multi-modal attention network fusing radar and thermal data for bridge deck delamination detection with uncertainty quantification, outperforming single-modal and simple fusion methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated inspection of deteriorating civil infrastructure needs to overcome limitations of visual assessment. Single-modal approaches (Ground Penetrating Radar and Infrared Thermography) have complementary constraints: radar struggles with moisture and shallow defects, while thermography is weather-dependent and has limited depth.

Method: Multi-modal attention network with temporal attention for radar processing, spatial attention for thermal features, and cross-modal fusion with learnable embeddings. Incorporates uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo dropout and learned variance estimation, decomposing uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components.

Result: On balanced to moderately imbalanced data from five bridge datasets, the approach substantially outperforms baselines in accuracy and AUC. Cross-modal attention provides critical gains beyond within-modality attention, and uncertainty quantification reduces calibration error enabling selective prediction. However, under extreme class imbalance, attention mechanisms show vulnerability to majority class collapse.

Conclusion: Attention-based architecture performs well across typical scenarios, while extreme imbalance requires specialized techniques. The system maintains deployment efficiency for real-time inspection with characterized capabilities and limitations.

Abstract: Deteriorating civil infrastructure requires automated inspection techniques overcoming limitations of visual assessment. While Ground Penetrating Radar and Infrared Thermography enable subsurface defect detection, single modal approaches face complementary constraints radar struggles with moisture and shallow defects, while thermography exhibits weather dependency and limited depth. This paper presents a multi modal attention network fusing radar temporal patterns with thermal spatial signatures for bridge deck delamination detection. Our architecture introduces temporal attention for radar processing, spatial attention for thermal features, and cross modal fusion with learnable embeddings discovering complementary defect patterns invisible to individual sensors. We incorporate uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo dropout and learned variance estimation, decomposing uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components for safety critical decisions. Experiments on five bridge datasets reveal that on balanced to moderately imbalanced data, our approach substantially outperforms baselines in accuracy and AUC representing meaningful improvements over single modal and concatenation based fusion. Ablation studies demonstrate cross modal attention provides critical gains beyond within modality attention, while multi head mechanisms achieve improved calibration. Uncertainty quantification reduces calibration error, enabling selective prediction by rejecting uncertain cases. However, under extreme class imbalance, attention mechanisms show vulnerability to majority class collapse. These findings provide actionable guidance: attention based architecture performs well across typical scenarios, while extreme imbalance requires specialized techniques. Our system maintains deployment efficiency, enabling real time inspection with characterized capabilities and limitations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DDAVS framework uses disentangled audio semantics and delayed bidirectional alignment to solve multi-source entanglement and audio-visual misalignment in audio-visual segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AVS methods suffer from multi-source entanglement and audio-visual misalignment, causing biases toward louder/larger objects while overlooking weaker/smaller/co-occurring sources.

Method: DDAVS uses learnable queries to extract audio semantics anchored in semantic space from audio prototype memory bank, optimized via contrastive learning. Introduces dual cross-attention with delayed modality interaction for robust multimodal alignment.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches on AVS-Objects and VPO benchmarks, showing strong performance across single-source, multi-source, and multi-instance scenarios.

Conclusion: DDAVS effectively addresses key challenges in AVS with strong generalization ability under challenging real-world conditions.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to localize sound-producing objects at the pixel level by jointly leveraging auditory and visual information. However, existing methods often suffer from multi-source entanglement and audio-visual misalignment, which lead to biases toward louder or larger objects while overlooking weaker, smaller, or co-occurring sources. To address these challenges, we propose DDAVS, a Disentangled Audio Semantics and Delayed Bidirectional Alignment framework. To mitigate multi-source entanglement, DDAVS employs learnable queries to extract audio semantics and anchor them within a structured semantic space derived from an audio prototype memory bank. This is further optimized through contrastive learning to enhance discriminability and robustness. To alleviate audio-visual misalignment, DDAVS introduces dual cross-attention with delayed modality interaction, improving the robustness of multimodal alignment. Extensive experiments on the AVS-Objects and VPO benchmarks demonstrate that DDAVS consistently outperforms existing approaches, exhibiting strong performance across single-source, multi-source, and multi-instance scenarios. These results validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our framework under challenging real-world audio-visual segmentation conditions.

### [34] [HEART-VIT: Hessian-Guided Efficient Dynamic Attention and Token Pruning in Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20120)
*Mohammad Helal Uddin,Liam Seymour,Sabur Baidya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HEART-ViT is a Hessian-guided dynamic attention and token pruning framework for Vision Transformers that uses second-order sensitivity analysis to achieve efficient pruning while maintaining or improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers have high computational costs due to quadratic attention and redundant computations, making deployment difficult on resource-constrained platforms. Existing pruning methods are heuristic-based, treat tokens and heads in isolation, and often sacrifice accuracy.

Method: HEART-ViT uses Hessian-vector products to estimate curvature-weighted sensitivities of both tokens and attention heads, enabling principled pruning decisions under explicit loss budgets. It combines token pruning (for computational savings) with head pruning (for redundancy removal) in a unified second-order framework.

Result: Achieves up to 49.4% FLOPs reduction, 36% lower latency, and 46% higher throughput on ImageNet datasets with ViT-B/16 and DeiT-B/16, while matching or surpassing baseline accuracy (e.g., 4.7% recovery at 40% token pruning). Real-world deployment on edge devices shows improved inference speed and energy efficiency.

Conclusion: HEART-ViT bridges theory and practice as the first unified, curvature-driven pruning framework that is both accuracy-preserving and edge-efficient, revealing that token pruning dominates computational savings while head pruning provides fine-grained redundancy removal.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) deliver state-of-the-art accuracy but their quadratic attention cost and redundant computations severely hinder deployment on latency and resource-constrained platforms. Existing pruning approaches treat either tokens or heads in isolation, relying on heuristics or first-order signals, which often sacrifice accuracy or fail to generalize across inputs. We introduce HEART-ViT, a Hessian-guided efficient dynamic attention and token pruning framework for vision transformers, which to the best of our knowledge is the first unified, second-order, input-adaptive framework for ViT optimization. HEART-ViT estimates curvature-weighted sensitivities of both tokens and attention heads using efficient Hessian-vector products, enabling principled pruning decisions under explicit loss budgets.This dual-view sensitivity reveals an important structural insight: token pruning dominates computational savings, while head pruning provides fine-grained redundancy removal, and their combination achieves a superior trade-off. On ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1K with ViT-B/16 and DeiT-B/16, HEART-ViT achieves up to 49.4 percent FLOPs reduction, 36 percent lower latency, and 46 percent higher throughput, while consistently matching or even surpassing baseline accuracy after fine-tuning, for example 4.7 percent recovery at 40 percent token pruning. Beyond theoretical benchmarks, we deploy HEART-ViT on different edge devices such as AGX Orin, demonstrating that our reductions in FLOPs and latency translate directly into real-world gains in inference speed and energy efficiency. HEART-ViT bridges the gap between theory and practice, delivering the first unified, curvature-driven pruning framework that is both accuracy-preserving and edge-efficient.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Millimeter-wave radar provides privacy-preserving and lighting-invariant human pose estimation, but suffers from sparse signals due to specular reflection, making robust feature extraction challenging.

Method: Joint spatio-temporal modeling with Cross-View Fusion Mamba encoder for efficient feature extraction from longer sequences (linear complexity), Spatio-Temporal-Cross Attention decoder for joint coordinate prediction across frames, and velocity loss for motion smoothness.

Result: Achieves significant performance improvements: 11.0 AP improvement on TransHuPR dataset and 14.6 AP improvement on HuPR dataset compared to baselines, while maintaining reasonable complexity.

Conclusion: milliMamba effectively addresses radar signal sparsity through joint spatio-temporal modeling, demonstrating superior performance for radar-based human pose estimation while preserving privacy and lighting invariance advantages.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar offers a privacy-preserving and lighting-invariant alternative to RGB sensors for Human Pose Estimation (HPE) task. However, the radar signals are often sparse due to specular reflection, making the extraction of robust features from radar signals highly challenging. To address this, we present milliMamba, a radar-based 2D human pose estimation framework that jointly models spatio-temporal dependencies across both the feature extraction and decoding stages. Specifically, given the high dimensionality of radar inputs, we adopt a Cross-View Fusion Mamba encoder to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features from longer sequences with linear complexity. A Spatio-Temporal-Cross Attention decoder then predicts joint coordinates across multiple frames. Together, this spatio-temporal modeling pipeline enables the model to leverage contextual cues from neighboring frames and joints to infer missing joints caused by specular reflections. To reinforce motion smoothness, we incorporate a velocity loss alongside the standard keypoint loss during training. Experiments on the TransHuPR and HuPR datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements, exceeding the baselines by 11.0 AP and 14.6 AP, respectively, while maintaining reasonable complexity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoDi is a latent diffusion-based low-shot object counter that generates high-quality density maps for accurate object localization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by significant margins on FSC and MCAC benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing low-shot object counting methods have limitations: density-based counters have poor localization capabilities, while point-detection-based counters underperform on images with very large numbers of objects and resort to ad-hoc techniques like upsampling and tiling.

Method: CoDi uses latent diffusion to generate high-quality density maps, with a novel exemplar-based conditioning module that extracts and adjusts object prototypes to intermediate layers of the denoising network for accurate object location estimation.

Result: On FSC benchmark: 15% MAE improvement in few-shot, 13% MAE in one-shot, and 10% MAE in reference-less scenarios. On MCAC benchmark: 44% MAE improvement over top method, setting new state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: CoDi is the first latent diffusion-based low-shot counter that effectively addresses dense regions with small objects through high-quality density maps, significantly outperforming existing methods across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Low-shot object counting addresses estimating the number of previously unobserved objects in an image using only few or no annotated test-time exemplars. A considerable challenge for modern low-shot counters are dense regions with small objects. While total counts in such situations are typically well addressed by density-based counters, their usefulness is limited by poor localization capabilities. This is better addressed by point-detection-based counters, which are based on query-based detectors. However, due to limited number of pre-trained queries, they underperform on images with very large numbers of objects, and resort to ad-hoc techniques like upsampling and tiling. We propose CoDi, the first latent diffusion-based low-shot counter that produces high-quality density maps on which object locations can be determined by non-maxima suppression. Our core contribution is the new exemplar-based conditioning module that extracts and adjusts the object prototypes to the intermediate layers of the denoising network, leading to accurate object location estimation. On FSC benchmark, CoDi outperforms state-of-the-art by 15% MAE, 13% MAE and 10% MAE in the few-shot, one-shot, and reference-less scenarios, respectively, and sets a new state-of-the-art on MCAC benchmark by outperforming the top method by 44% MAE.

Abstract: Vision foundation models trained via multi-teacher distillation offer a promising path toward unified visual representations, yet the learning dynamics and data efficiency of such approaches remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically study multi-teacher distillation for vision foundation models and identify key factors that enable training at lower computational cost. We introduce Agglomerative Mixture-of-Experts Vision Foundation Models (AMoE), which distill knowledge from SigLIP2 and DINOv3 simultaneously into a Mixture-of-Experts student. We show that (1) our Asymmetric Relation-Knowledge Distillation loss preserves the geometric properties of each teacher while enabling effective knowledge transfer, (2) token-balanced batching that packs varying-resolution images into sequences with uniform token budgets stabilizes representation learning across resolutions without sacrificing performance, and (3) hierarchical clustering and sampling of training data--typically reserved for self-supervised learning--substantially improves sample efficiency over random sampling for multi-teacher distillation. By combining these findings, we curate OpenLVD200M, a 200M-image corpus that demonstrates superior efficiency for multi-teacher distillation. Instantiated in a Mixture-of-Experts. We release OpenLVD200M and distilled models.

TL;DR: Proposes NL-DIR, a new benchmark for document image retrieval using natural language queries with fine-grained semantics, addressing limitations of existing image-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing document image retrieval methods use image queries that only work within coarse semantic categories and struggle with real-world scenarios where users provide textual queries with fine-grained semantics.

Method: Introduces NL-DIR benchmark with 41K authentic document images, each paired with 5 high-quality semantic queries generated via LLMs and manual verification. Evaluates contrastive vision-language models and OCR-free VDU models with zero-shot/fine-tuning, and investigates a two-stage retrieval method.

Result: Creates comprehensive benchmark dataset with evaluation metrics. Performs evaluations of existing models and proposes efficient two-stage retrieval method that improves performance while maintaining time/space efficiency.

Conclusion: NL-DIR benchmark bridges gap between coarse image-based retrieval and fine-grained natural language queries, providing new opportunities for visual document understanding research with publicly available dataset and code.

Abstract: Document image retrieval (DIR) aims to retrieve document images from a gallery according to a given query. Existing DIR methods are primarily based on image queries that retrieve documents within the same coarse semantic category, e.g., newspapers or receipts. However, these methods struggle to effectively retrieve document images in real-world scenarios where textual queries with fine-grained semantics are usually provided. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new Natural Language-based Document Image Retrieval (NL-DIR) benchmark with corresponding evaluation metrics. In this work, natural language descriptions serve as semantically rich queries for the DIR task. The NL-DIR dataset contains 41K authentic document images, each paired with five high-quality, fine-grained semantic queries generated and evaluated through large language models in conjunction with manual verification. We perform zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations of existing mainstream contrastive vision-language models and OCR-free visual document understanding (VDU) models. A two-stage retrieval method is further investigated for performance improvement while achieving both time and space efficiency. We hope the proposed NL-DIR benchmark can bring new opportunities and facilitate research for the VDU community. Datasets and codes will be publicly available at huggingface.co/datasets/nianbing/NL-DIR.

*Zhaoyang Jia,Jiahao Li,Bin Li,Houqiang Li,Yan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLC performs image compression in generative latent space instead of pixel space, achieving high realism/fidelity at ultra-low bitrates (<0.04 bpp) with applications to restoration and style transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-space compression struggles with high-realism and high-fidelity at low bitrates because pixel distortion doesn't align well with human perception. Need better perceptual alignment for low-bitrate compression.

Method: Generative Latent Coding (GLC) architecture performs transform coding in VQ-VAE latent space instead of pixel space. Uses categorical hyper module to reduce hyper-information bit cost and code-prediction-based supervision for semantic consistency.

Result: Achieves high visual quality with <0.04 bpp on natural images and <0.01 bpp on facial images. On CLIC2020, matches MS-ILLM FID with 45% fewer bits. Enables applications like image restoration and style transfer.

Conclusion: Generative latent space offers sparsity, semantic richness, and better perceptual alignment for compression, enabling high-quality low-bitrate coding with extended applications beyond compression.

Abstract: Most existing image compression approaches perform transform coding in the pixel space to reduce its spatial redundancy. However, they encounter difficulties in achieving both high-realism and high-fidelity at low bitrate, as the pixel-space distortion may not align with human perception. To address this issue, we introduce a Generative Latent Coding (GLC) architecture, which performs transform coding in the latent space of a generative vector-quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE), instead of in the pixel space. The generative latent space is characterized by greater sparsity, richer semantic and better alignment with human perception, rendering it advantageous for achieving high-realism and high-fidelity compression. Additionally, we introduce a categorical hyper module to reduce the bit cost of hyper-information, and a code-prediction-based supervision to enhance the semantic consistency. Experiments demonstrate that our GLC maintains high visual quality with less than 0.04 bpp on natural images and less than 0.01 bpp on facial images. On the CLIC2020 test set, we achieve the same FID as MS-ILLM with 45% fewer bits. Furthermore, the powerful generative latent space enables various applications built on our GLC pipeline, such as image restoration and style transfer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JDPNet is a joint degradation processing network that mines and unifies coupled degradation information in underwater images using joint feature-mining modules, probabilistic bootstrap distribution, and AquaBalanceLoss for balanced restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater images suffer from complex coupled degradations with nonlinear interactions, but most existing methods focus on specific degradations individually and fail to capture the embedded coupling information between multiple degradations.

Method: Proposes JDPNet with: 1) joint feature-mining module to extract coupled degradation features, 2) probabilistic bootstrap distribution strategy for unified adjustment of features, and 3) AquaBalanceLoss to balance color, clarity, and contrast through multiple coupled degradation losses.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on six public underwater datasets and two new datasets, with better tradeoff between performance, parameter size, and computational cost compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: JDPNet effectively addresses the challenge of processing coupled degradations in underwater images by mining and unifying their potential information within a unified framework, achieving superior performance with balanced computational efficiency.

Abstract: Given the complexity of underwater environments and the variability of water as a medium, underwater images are inevitably subject to various types of degradation. The degradations present nonlinear coupling rather than simple superposition, which renders the effective processing of such coupled degradations particularly challenging. Most existing methods focus on designing specific branches, modules, or strategies for specific degradations, with little attention paid to the potential information embedded in their coupling. Consequently, they struggle to effectively capture and process the nonlinear interactions of multiple degradations from a bottom-up perspective. To address this issue, we propose JDPNet, a joint degradation processing network, that mines and unifies the potential information inherent in coupled degradations within a unified framework. Specifically, we introduce a joint feature-mining module, along with a probabilistic bootstrap distribution strategy, to facilitate effective mining and unified adjustment of coupled degradation features. Furthermore, to balance color, clarity, and contrast, we design a novel AquaBalanceLoss to guide the network in learning from multiple coupled degradation losses. Experiments on six publicly available underwater datasets, as well as two new datasets constructed in this study, show that JDPNet exhibits state-of-the-art performance while offering a better tradeoff between performance, parameter size, and computational cost.

### [41] [LiteFusion: Taming 3D Object Detectors from Vision-Based to Multi-Modal with Minimal Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20217)
*Xiangxuan Ren,Zhongdao Wang,Pin Tang,Guoqing Wang,Jilai Zheng,Chao Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiteFusion is a LiDAR-camera fusion 3D detector that uses LiDAR as geometric enhancement for camera features instead of separate modality, eliminating 3D backbone for better deployment across hardware platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal 3D detectors rely heavily on LiDAR and complex architectures, causing performance drops when LiDAR is absent and deployment difficulties on non-GPU hardware due to 3D sparse convolution operators.

Method: Treats LiDAR as complementary geometric information rather than independent modality, integrates LiDAR features into image features in quaternion space to preserve orthogonal constraints, eliminating need for 3D backbone.

Result: Improves baseline vision-based detector by +20.4% mAP and +19.7% NDS on nuScenes with only 1.1% parameter increase, maintains strong performance even without LiDAR input.

Conclusion: LiteFusion offers robust, deployment-friendly multi-modal 3D detection that works well across different fusion paradigms and hardware platforms while reducing LiDAR dependency.

Abstract: 3D object detection is fundamental for safe and robust intelligent transportation systems. Current multi-modal 3D object detectors often rely on complex architectures and training strategies to achieve higher detection accuracy. However, these methods heavily rely on the LiDAR sensor so that they suffer from large performance drops when LiDAR is absent, which compromises the robustness and safety of autonomous systems in practical scenarios. Moreover, existing multi-modal detectors face difficulties in deployment on diverse hardware platforms, such as NPUs and FPGAs, due to their reliance on 3D sparse convolution operators, which are primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs. To address these challenges, we reconsider the role of LiDAR in the camera-LiDAR fusion paradigm and introduce a novel multi-modal 3D detector, LiteFusion. Instead of treating LiDAR point clouds as an independent modality with a separate feature extraction backbone, LiteFusion utilizes LiDAR data as a complementary source of geometric information to enhance camera-based detection. This straightforward approach completely eliminates the reliance on a 3D backbone, making the method highly deployment-friendly. Specifically, LiteFusion integrates complementary features from LiDAR points into image features within a quaternion space, where the orthogonal constraints are well-preserved during network training. This helps model domain-specific relations across modalities, yielding a compact cross-modal embedding. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that LiteFusion improves the baseline vision-based detector by +20.4% mAP and +19.7% NDS with a minimal increase in parameters (1.1%) without using dedicated LiDAR encoders. Notably, even in the absence of LiDAR input, LiteFusion maintains strong results , highlighting its favorable robustness and effectiveness across diverse fusion paradigms and deployment scenarios.

*Oikantik Nath,Sahithi Kukkala,Mitesh Khapra,Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IndicDLP is a large-scale multilingual document layout dataset covering 11 Indic languages plus English across 12 domains, addressing gaps in existing datasets for robust document layout analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets have limitations: large-scale ones (PubLayNet, DocBank) lack fine-grained labels and multilingual diversity, while human-annotated ones (M6Doc, D4LA) are too small and lack multilingual coverage. Indic documents are particularly underrepresented despite their script diversity.

Method: Created IndicDLP dataset spanning 11 Indic languages and English across 12 document domains. Also curated UED-mini from DocLayNet and M6Doc for pretraining. Fine-tuned existing English models on IndicDLP to validate effectiveness.

Result: Fine-tuning English models on IndicDLP significantly boosts performance. Models trained on IndicDLP generalize well beyond Indic layouts, making it valuable for broader document digitization tasks.

Conclusion: IndicDLP bridges gaps in scale, diversity, and annotation granularity for document layout analysis, driving inclusive and efficient document understanding, especially for underrepresented Indic languages.

Abstract: Document layout analysis is essential for downstream tasks such as information retrieval, extraction, OCR, and digitization. However, existing large-scale datasets like PubLayNet and DocBank lack fine-grained region labels and multilingual diversity, making them insufficient for representing complex document layouts. In contrast, human-annotated datasets such as M6Doc and D4LA offer richer labels and greater domain diversity, but are too small to train robust models and lack adequate multilingual coverage. This gap is especially pronounced for Indic documents, which encompass diverse scripts yet remain underrepresented in current datasets, further limiting progress in this space. To address these shortcomings, we introduce IndicDLP, a large-scale foundational document layout dataset spanning 11 representative Indic languages alongside English and 12 common document domains. Additionally, we curate UED-mini, a dataset derived from DocLayNet and M6Doc, to enhance pretraining and provide a solid foundation for Indic layout models. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning existing English models on IndicDLP significantly boosts performance, validating its effectiveness. Moreover, models trained on IndicDLP generalize well beyond Indic layouts, making it a valuable resource for document digitization. This work bridges gaps in scale, diversity, and annotation granularity, driving inclusive and efficient document understanding.

*Jiawei Ge,Jiuxin Cao,Xinyi Li,Xuelin Zhu,Chang Liu,Bo Liu,Chen Feng,Ioannis Patras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D³ETOR is a two-stage weakly-supervised camouflaged object detection framework that uses debate-enhanced pseudo labeling and frequency-aware progressive debiasing to overcome limitations of unreliable pseudo masks and scribble annotation bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing WSCOD methods underperform fully supervised approaches due to: (1) unreliable pseudo masks from general segmentation models lacking COD-specific understanding, and (2) neglect of inherent scribble annotation bias that prevents capturing global object structure.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling with adaptive entropy-driven point sampling and multi-agent debate mechanism to improve SAM's COD capability; 2) FADeNet with progressive fusion of multi-level frequency-aware features and dynamic supervision reweighting to balance global semantics with local details while alleviating scribble bias.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, significantly narrowing the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD approaches.

Conclusion: D³ETOR effectively addresses key limitations in WSCOD by jointly exploiting pseudo masks and scribble semantics through debate-enhanced labeling and frequency-aware debiasing, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (WSCOD) aims to locate and segment objects that are visually concealed within their surrounding scenes, relying solely on sparse supervision such as scribble annotations. Despite recent progress, existing WSCOD methods still lag far behind fully supervised ones due to two major limitations: (1) the pseudo masks generated by general-purpose segmentation models (e.g., SAM) and filtered via rules are often unreliable, as these models lack the task-specific semantic understanding required for effective pseudo labeling in COD; and (2) the neglect of inherent annotation bias in scribbles, which hinders the model from capturing the global structure of camouflaged objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework consisting of Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing. In the first stage, we introduce an adaptive entropy-driven point sampling method and a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance the capability of SAM for COD, improving the interpretability and precision of pseudo masks. In the second stage, we design FADeNet, which progressively fuses multi-level frequency-aware features to balance global semantic understanding with local detail modeling, while dynamically reweighting supervision strength across regions to alleviate scribble bias. By jointly exploiting the supervision signals from both the pseudo masks and scribble semantics, ${D}^{3}$ETOR significantly narrows the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.

TL;DR: DAMP is a unified HSI restoration framework that uses degradation metrics as prompts instead of explicit degradation labels, enabling adaptive restoration under diverse degradations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unified HSI restoration methods rely on explicit degradation priors/labels that are difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios with complex mixed degradations.

Method: Proposes Degradation-Aware Metric Prompting (DAMP) with spatial-spectral degradation metrics as prompts, and Spatial-Spectral Adaptive Module (SSAM) integrated into Mixture-of-Experts architecture using DP as gating router.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on natural and remote sensing HSI datasets with exceptional generalization capability under diverse, mixed, or unseen degradations.

Conclusion: DAMP provides a practical unified HSI restoration solution that doesn't require explicit degradation labels, enabling robust performance in real-world scenarios with complex degradations.

Abstract: Unified hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration aims to recover various degraded HSIs using a single model, offering great practical value. However, existing methods often depend on explicit degradation priors (e.g., degradation labels) as prompts to guide restoration, which are difficult to obtain due to complex and mixed degradations in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a Degradation-Aware Metric Prompting (DAMP) framework. Instead of relying on predefined degradation priors, we design spatial-spectral degradation metrics to continuously quantify multi-dimensional degradations, serving as Degradation Prompts (DP). These DP enable the model to capture cross-task similarities in degradation distributions and enhance shared feature learning. Furthermore, we introduce a Spatial-Spectral Adaptive Module (SSAM) that dynamically modulates spatial and spectral feature extraction through learnable parameters. By integrating SSAM as experts within a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, and using DP as the gating router, the framework enables adaptive, efficient, and robust restoration under diverse, mixed, or unseen degradations. Extensive experiments on natural and remote sensing HSI datasets show that DAMP achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates exceptional generalization capability.

TL;DR: A framework combining Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify uncertainty in SHAP explanations for medical imaging models, addressing instability from epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in medical imaging have become increasingly complex (ResNets, Vision Transformers, Hybrid CNNs), compromising explainability. SHAP provides interpretable visualizations but suffers from instability and unreliability due to epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, especially in medical imaging with varying data characteristics.

Method: Uses Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify uncertainty in SHAP explanations. Implements belief, plausible, and fusion map approach alongside statistical quantitative analysis to produce uncertainty quantification for SHAP.

Result: Framework evaluated on three medical imaging datasets with varying class distributions, image qualities, and modality types (pathology, ophthalmology, radiology), introducing significant epistemic uncertainty from varying resolutions and modality-specific aspects.

Conclusion: Proposes a novel uncertainty quantification framework for SHAP explanations in medical imaging that addresses the instability problem through probabilistic and evidential reasoning approaches, making model explanations more reliable for clinical use.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to its widespread adoption across diverse domains, including medical imaging. This progress is driven by increasingly sophisticated model architectures, such as ResNets, Vision Transformers, and Hybrid Convolutional Neural Networks, that offer enhanced performance at the cost of greater complexity. This complexity often compromises model explainability and interpretability. SHAP has emerged as a prominent method for providing interpretable visualizations that aid domain experts in understanding model predictions. However, SHAP explanations can be unstable and unreliable in the presence of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. In this study, we address this challenge by using Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify the uncertainty that arises from these unstable explanations in medical imaging applications. The framework uses a belief, plausible, and fusion map approach alongside statistical quantitative analysis to produce quantification of uncertainty in SHAP. Furthermore, we evaluated our framework on three medical imaging datasets with varying class distributions, image qualities, and modality types which introduces noise due to varying image resolutions and modality-specific aspect covering the examples from pathology, ophthalmology, and radiology, introducing significant epistemic uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HRSS faces challenges of high inter-class similarity and large intra-class variability, leading to blurred boundaries and class confusion. Existing methods struggle to effectively inject abstract semantic knowledge into pixel-level feature learning.

Method: Proposes BiCoR-Seg with: 1) Heatmap-driven Bidirectional Information Synergy Module (HBIS) establishing bidirectional flow between feature maps and class embeddings via class-level heatmaps; 2) Hierarchical supervision using interpretable heatmaps as low-resolution predictions; 3) Cross-layer class embedding Fisher Discriminative Loss for intra-class compactness and inter-class separability.

Result: Extensive experiments on LoveDA, Vaihingen, and Potsdam datasets demonstrate outstanding segmentation performance with stronger interpretability.

Conclusion: BiCoR-Seg effectively addresses HRSS challenges through bidirectional co-refinement, achieving superior performance while providing enhanced interpretability for complex remote sensing scenes.

Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing image semantic segmentation (HRSS) is a fundamental yet critical task in the field of Earth observation. However, it has long faced the challenges of high inter-class similarity and large intra-class variability. Existing approaches often struggle to effectively inject abstract yet strongly discriminative semantic knowledge into pixel-level feature learning, leading to blurred boundaries and class confusion in complex scenes. To address these challenges, we propose Bidirectional Co-Refinement Framework for HRSS (BiCoR-Seg). Specifically, we design a Heatmap-driven Bidirectional Information Synergy Module (HBIS), which establishes a bidirectional information flow between feature maps and class embeddings by generating class-level heatmaps. Based on HBIS, we further introduce a hierarchical supervision strategy, where the interpretable heatmaps generated by each HBIS module are directly utilized as low-resolution segmentation predictions for supervision, thereby enhancing the discriminative capacity of shallow features. In addition, to further improve the discriminability of the embedding representations, we propose a cross-layer class embedding Fisher Discriminative Loss to enforce intra-class compactness and enlarge inter-class separability. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA, Vaihingen, and Potsdam datasets demonstrate that BiCoR-Seg achieves outstanding segmentation performance while offering stronger interpretability.

Motivation: Existing works study talking/listening head generation and conversational speech in isolation, overlooking the tightly coupled audio-visual interactions in human conversation. The goal is to build more human-like conversational systems.

Method: TAVID integrates face and speech generation pipelines through two cross-modal mappers (motion mapper and speaker mapper) that enable bidirectional exchange of complementary information between audio and visual modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness across four dimensions: talking face realism, listening head responsiveness, dyadic interaction fluency, and speech quality.

Conclusion: TAVID successfully generates both interactive faces and conversational speech in a synchronized manner, addressing the multimodal nature of human conversation through cross-modal information exchange.

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to jointly synthesize interactive videos and conversational speech from text and reference images. With the ultimate goal of building human-like conversational systems, recent studies have explored talking or listening head generation as well as conversational speech generation. However, these works are typically studied in isolation, overlooking the multimodal nature of human conversation, which involves tightly coupled audio-visual interactions. In this paper, we introduce TAVID, a unified framework that generates both interactive faces and conversational speech in a synchronized manner. TAVID integrates face and speech generation pipelines through two cross-modal mappers (i.e., a motion mapper and a speaker mapper), which enable bidirectional exchange of complementary information between the audio and visual modalities. We evaluate our system across four dimensions: talking face realism, listening head responsiveness, dyadic interaction fluency, and speech quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across all these aspects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Realistic synthetic multimedia manipulations have become widespread threats for spreading misinformation, especially through image-text pairs. Existing detection methods are computationally intensive or require large annotated datasets.

Method: LADLE-MM uses a model-soup initialized architecture with two unimodal branches and a multimodal branch enhanced by BLIP embeddings as fixed reference space, designed for limited annotation setups and constrained training resources.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on DGM4 benchmark for binary and multi-label classification, outperforms methods without grounding annotations, and beats SOTA approaches with complex LVLM architectures on VERITE dataset.

Conclusion: LADLE-MM demonstrates effective generalization in open-set settings, strong robustness to unimodal bias, and efficient performance with significantly fewer parameters than existing state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: With the rise of easily accessible tools for generating and manipulating multimedia content, realistic synthetic alterations to digital media have become a widespread threat, often involving manipulations across multiple modalities simultaneously. Recently, such techniques have been increasingly employed to distort narratives of important events and to spread misinformation on social media, prompting the development of misinformation detectors. In the context of misinformation conveyed through image-text pairs, several detection methods have been proposed. However, these approaches typically rely on computationally intensive architectures or require large amounts of annotated data. In this work we introduce LADLE-MM: Limited Annotation based Detector with Learned Ensembles for Multimodal Misinformation, a model-soup initialized multimodal misinformation detector designed to operate under a limited annotation setup and constrained training resources. LADLE-MM is composed of two unimodal branches and a third multimodal one that enhances image and text representations with additional multimodal embeddings extracted from BLIP, serving as fixed reference space. Despite using 60.3% fewer trainable parameters than previous state-of-the-art models, LADLE-MM achieves competitive performance on both binary and multi-label classification tasks on the DGM4 benchmark, outperforming existing methods when trained without grounding annotations. Moreover, when evaluated on the VERITE dataset, LADLE-MM outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches that utilize more complex architectures involving Large Vision-Language-Models, demonstrating the effective generalization ability in an open-set setting and strong robustness to unimodal bias.

*Junho Yoon,Jaemo Jung,Hyunju Kim,Dongman Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DETACH: A decomposed spatio-temporal framework for aligning exocentric video with ambient sensors, addressing limitations of global alignment approaches in capturing local details and handling similar temporal patterns with different contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Egocentric video with wearable sensors has practical limitations including user discomfort, privacy concerns, and scalability. Exocentric video with ambient sensors offers a non-intrusive, scalable alternative, but existing global alignment methods fail to capture local details and misalign actions with similar temporal patterns but different spatio-semantic contexts.

Method: DETACH uses decomposed spatio-temporal framework with explicit decomposition to preserve local details. It employs novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering for semantic grounding. A two-stage alignment approach establishes spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, then performs temporal alignment via spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles different types of negatives.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on Opportunity++ and HWU-USP datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over adapted egocentric-wearable baselines in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: DETACH effectively addresses the limitations of global alignment in exocentric-ambient settings by decomposing spatio-temporal features and providing context-aware alignment, offering a practical solution for non-intrusive human action recognition.

Abstract: Aligning egocentric video with wearable sensors have shown promise for human action recognition, but face practical limitations in user discomfort, privacy concerns, and scalability. We explore exocentric video with ambient sensors as a non-intrusive, scalable alternative. While prior egocentric-wearable works predominantly adopt Global Alignment by encoding entire sequences into unified representations, this approach fails in exocentric-ambient settings due to two problems: (P1) inability to capture local details such as subtle motions, and (P2) over-reliance on modality-invariant temporal patterns, causing misalignment between actions sharing similar temporal patterns with different spatio-semantic contexts. To resolve these problems, we propose DETACH, a decomposed spatio-temporal framework. This explicit decomposition preserves local details, while our novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering provide semantic grounding for context-aware alignment. To align the decomposed features, our two-stage approach establishes spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, then performs temporal alignment via a spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles easy negatives, hard negatives, and false negatives. Comprehensive experiments with downstream tasks on Opportunity++ and HWU-USP datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over adapted egocentric-wearable baselines.

TL;DR: KeyTailor is a diffusion transformer-based video virtual try-on framework that uses keyframe-driven details injection to improve garment dynamics and background consistency, paired with a new high-quality dataset ViT-HD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DiT-based video virtual try-on methods struggle with capturing fine-grained garment dynamics, preserving background integrity across frames, and have high computational costs due to additional modules. Limited dataset quality also restricts model generalization.

Method: KeyTailor uses an instruction-guided keyframe sampling strategy to select informative frames, then employs two keyframe-driven modules: garment details enhancement module to distill garment dynamics into latents, and collaborative background optimization module to optimize background integrity. These enriched details are injected into standard DiT blocks with pose, mask, and noise latents.

Result: KeyTailor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in garment fidelity and background integrity across both dynamic and static scenarios. The framework achieves consistency without modifying DiT architecture while avoiding additional complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed KeyTailor framework with keyframe-driven details injection effectively addresses challenges in video virtual try-on by capturing garment dynamics and preserving background integrity efficiently, supported by the new high-quality ViT-HD dataset.

Abstract: Although diffusion transformer (DiT)-based video virtual try-on (VVT) has made significant progress in synthesizing realistic videos, existing methods still struggle to capture fine-grained garment dynamics and preserve background integrity across video frames. They also incur high computational costs due to additional interaction modules introduced into DiTs, while the limited scale and quality of existing public datasets also restrict model generalization and effective training. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, KeyTailor, along with a large-scale, high-definition dataset, ViT-HD. The core idea of KeyTailor is a keyframe-driven details injection strategy, motivated by the fact that keyframes inherently contain both foreground dynamics and background consistency. Specifically, KeyTailor adopts an instruction-guided keyframe sampling strategy to filter informative frames from the input video. Subsequently,two tailored keyframe-driven modules, the garment details enhancement module and the collaborative background optimization module, are employed to distill garment dynamics into garment-related latents and to optimize the integrity of background latents, both guided by keyframes.These enriched details are then injected into standard DiT blocks together with pose, mask, and noise latents, enabling efficient and realistic try-on video synthesis. This design ensures consistency without explicitly modifying the DiT architecture, while simultaneously avoiding additional complexity. In addition, our dataset ViT-HD comprises 15, 070 high-quality video samples at a resolution of 810*1080, covering diverse garments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KeyTailor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of garment fidelity and background integrity across both dynamic and static scenarios.

*V. Kovalev,A. Kuvshinov,A. Buzovkin,D. Pokidov,D. Timonin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRAFT is a training-free framework that uses structured reasoning with visual question decomposition, verification, and targeted prompt editing to improve text-to-image generation at inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inference-time reasoning methods for text-to-image generation rely on implicit critiques or unconstrained prompt rewrites, making them difficult to interpret, control, or stop reliably. The paper aims to bring the structured reasoning paradigm that has benefited large language models (verification, targeted correction, early stopping) to multimodal image generation.

Method: CRAFT decomposes prompts into dependency-structured visual questions, verifies generated images using a vision-language model, applies targeted prompt edits through an LLM agent only where constraints fail, and iterates with explicit stopping criteria once all constraints are satisfied.

Result: CRAFT consistently improves compositional accuracy, text rendering, and preference-based evaluations across multiple model families and challenging benchmarks, with particularly strong gains for lightweight generators. Improvements come with negligible inference-time overhead, allowing smaller models to approach the quality of more expensive systems.

Conclusion: Explicitly structured, constraint-driven inference-time reasoning is a key ingredient for improving the reliability of multimodal generative models, offering interpretable and controllable refinement without retraining.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that inference-time reasoning and reflection can improve text-to-image generation without retraining. However, existing approaches often rely on implicit, holistic critiques or unconstrained prompt rewrites, making their behavior difficult to interpret, control, or stop reliably. In contrast, large language models have benefited from explicit, structured forms of **thinking** based on verification, targeted correction, and early stopping.
  We introduce CRAFT (Continuous Reasoning and Agentic Feedback Tuning), a training-free, model-agnostic framework that brings this structured reasoning paradigm to multimodal image generation. CRAFT decomposes a prompt into dependency-structured visual questions, veries generated images using a vision-language model, and applies targeted prompt edits through an LLM agent only where constraints fail. The process iterates with an explicit stopping criterion once all constraints are satised, yielding an interpretable and controllable inference-time renement loop.
  Across multiple model families and challenging benchmarks, CRAFT consistently improves compositional accuracy, text rendering, and preference-based evaluations, with particularly strong gains for lightweight generators. Importantly, these improvements incur only a negligible inference-time overhead, allowing smaller or cheaper models to approach the quality of substantially more expensive systems. Our results suggest that explicitly structured, constraint-driven inference-time reasoning is a key ingredient for improving the reliability of multimodal generative models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SmartSplat: A Gaussian Splatting-based image compression framework that uses adaptive sampling strategies to achieve high compression ratios while maintaining reconstruction quality for ultra-high-resolution images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid production of ultra-high-resolution visual content through generative AI creates challenges for efficient compression and real-time decoding on end-user devices. Existing 2D Gaussian image models struggle to balance compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity at ultra-high resolutions.

Method: SmartSplat uses image-aware features (gradients and color variances) with Gradient-Color Guided Variational Sampling and Exclusion-based Uniform Sampling to improve non-overlapping coverage of Gaussian primitives. It also employs Scale-Adaptive Gaussian Color Sampling for better color initialization across scales, with joint optimization of spatial layout, scale, and color initialization.

Result: Extensive experiments on DIV8K and a newly constructed 16K dataset show that SmartSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods at comparable compression ratios, exceeds their compression limits, and demonstrates strong scalability and practical applicability.

Conclusion: SmartSplat provides an effective solution for ultra-high-resolution image compression by efficiently capturing both local structures and global textures using limited Gaussians, achieving high reconstruction quality under strong compression with practical applicability.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have accelerated the production of ultra-high-resolution visual content, posing significant challenges for efficient compression and real-time decoding on end-user devices. Inspired by 3D Gaussian Splatting, recent 2D Gaussian image models improve representation efficiency, yet existing methods struggle to balance compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity in ultra-high-resolution scenarios. To address this issue, we propose SmartSplat, a highly adaptive and feature-aware GS-based image compression framework that supports arbitrary image resolutions and compression ratios. SmartSplat leverages image-aware features such as gradients and color variances, introducing a Gradient-Color Guided Variational Sampling strategy together with an Exclusion-based Uniform Sampling scheme to improve the non-overlapping coverage of Gaussian primitives in pixel space. In addition, we propose a Scale-Adaptive Gaussian Color Sampling method to enhance color initialization across scales. Through joint optimization of spatial layout, scale, and color initialization, SmartSplat efficiently captures both local structures and global textures using a limited number of Gaussians, achieving high reconstruction quality under strong compression. Extensive experiments on DIV8K and a newly constructed 16K dataset demonstrate that SmartSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods at comparable compression ratios and exceeds their compression limits, showing strong scalability and practical applicability. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/lif314/SmartSplat.

TL;DR: CoAT framework introduces criminal bias into multi-agent reasoning to improve video anomaly detection and classification by steering models away from normal interpretations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Large Vision-Language Models have inherent bias towards normality, causing them to often fail at detecting crimes in automated video surveillance. Chain-of-Thought reasoning lacks inductive anomaly biases, further steering models toward normal interpretations.

Method: Proposed Chain-of-Anomaly-Thoughts (CoAT), a multi-agent reasoning framework that introduces inductive criminal bias through a final, anomaly-focused classification layer.

Result: Significantly improves Anomaly Detection by 11.8 percentage points on challenging low-resolution footage and Anomaly Classification by 3.78 percentage points in high-resolution videos.

Conclusion: Introducing inductive criminal bias through the CoAT framework effectively addresses the normality bias problem in automated video surveillance, substantially improving anomaly detection and classification performance.

Abstract: Automated video surveillance with Large Vision-Language Models is limited by their inherent bias towards normality, often failing to detect crimes. While Chain-of-Thought reasoning strategies show significant potential for improving performance in language tasks, the lack of inductive anomaly biases in their reasoning further steers the models towards normal interpretations. To address this, we propose Chain-of-Anomaly-Thoughts (CoAT), a multi-agent reasoning framework that introduces inductive criminal bias in the reasoning process through a final, anomaly-focused classification layer. Our method significantly improves Anomaly Detection, boosting F1-score by 11.8 p.p. on challenging low-resolution footage and Anomaly Classification by 3.78 p.p. in high-resolution videos.

Conclusion: The ensemble approach with segmentation preprocessing effectively focuses classification on clinically significant features, reduces background artifacts, and balances accuracy with speed for real-world deployment in skin cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: Skin cancer can be identified by dermoscopic examination and ocular inspection, but early detection significantly increases survival chances. Artificial intelligence (AI), using annotated skin images and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), improves diagnostic accuracy. This paper presents an early skin cancer classification method using a soft voting ensemble of CNNs. In this investigation, three benchmark datasets, namely HAM10000, ISIC 2016, and ISIC 2019, were used. The process involved rebalancing, image augmentation, and filtering techniques, followed by a hybrid dual encoder for segmentation via transfer learning. Accurate segmentation focused classification models on clinically significant features, reducing background artifacts and improving accuracy. Classification was performed through an ensemble of MobileNetV2, VGG19, and InceptionV3, balancing accuracy and speed for real-world deployment. The method achieved lesion recognition accuracies of 96.32\%, 90.86\%, and 93.92\% for the three datasets. The system performance was evaluated using established skin lesion detection metrics, yielding impressive results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes TBSD method for efficient anomaly detection in textured images with smooth backgrounds, using texture basis functions to extract quasi-periodic patterns and reduce misidentification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional anomaly detection methods have limitations when applied to textured defect images, including non-negligible misidentification, low robustness, and excessive reliance on large-scale structured datasets.

Method: Texture Basis integrated Smooth Decomposition (TBSD) approach with two processes: 1) learns texture basis functions to extract quasi-periodic texture patterns, 2) uses texture basis as prior knowledge for anomaly detection to prevent texture misidentification.

Result: The method surpasses benchmarks with less misidentification, smaller training dataset requirement, and superior anomaly detection performance on both simulation and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: TBSD provides an effective solution for anomaly detection in textured images with smooth backgrounds and sparse anomalies, addressing key limitations of conventional methods.

Abstract: In the realm of diverse high-dimensional data, images play a significant role across various processes of manufacturing systems where efficient image anomaly detection has emerged as a core technology of utmost importance. However, when applied to textured defect images, conventional anomaly detection methods have limitations including non-negligible misidentification, low robustness, and excessive reliance on large-scale and structured datasets. This paper proposes a texture basis integrated smooth decomposition (TBSD) approach, which is targeted at efficient anomaly detection in textured images with smooth backgrounds and sparse anomalies. Mathematical formulation of quasi-periodicity and its theoretical properties are investigated for image texture estimation. TBSD method consists of two principal processes: the first process learns the texture basis functions to effectively extract quasi-periodic texture patterns; the subsequent anomaly detection process utilizes that texture basis as prior knowledge to prevent texture misidentification and capture potential anomalies with high accuracy.The proposed method surpasses benchmarks with less misidentification, smaller training dataset requirement, and superior anomaly detection performance on both simulation and real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Incorporating physically inferred joint actuation forces into motion understanding pipelines consistently improves performance across gait recognition, action recognition, and video captioning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing human motion understanding methods overlook physical cues like joint actuation forces that are fundamental in biomechanics, creating a gap in understanding when and how these forces enhance motion analysis.

Method: Incorporating physically inferred forces into established motion understanding pipelines and systematically evaluating their impact across baseline models on three major tasks: gait recognition, action recognition, and fine-grained video captioning.

Result: Across 8 benchmarks, force incorporation yielded consistent performance gains: +0.87% on CASIA-B gait recognition (larger gains under challenging conditions: +2.7% with coat, +3.0% side view), +1.3% on Gait3D, +2.00% on Penn Action recognition (+6.96% for high-exertion classes), and +0.029 ROUGE-L improvement in video captioning.

Conclusion: Physics-inferred forces substantially complement visual and kinematic features, especially under dynamic, occluded, or appearance-varying conditions, enhancing temporal grounding and semantic richness in motion understanding.

Abstract: Human motion understanding has advanced rapidly through vision-based progress in recognition, tracking, and captioning. However, most existing methods overlook physical cues such as joint actuation forces that are fundamental in biomechanics. This gap motivates our study: if and when do physically inferred forces enhance motion understanding? By incorporating forces into established motion understanding pipelines, we systematically evaluate their impact across baseline models on 3 major tasks: gait recognition, action recognition, and fine-grained video captioning. Across 8 benchmarks, incorporating forces yields consistent performance gains; for example, on CASIA-B, Rank-1 gait recognition accuracy improved from 89.52% to 90.39% (+0.87), with larger gain observed under challenging conditions: +2.7% when wearing a coat and +3.0% at the side view. On Gait3D, performance also increases from 46.0% to 47.3% (+1.3). In action recognition, CTR-GCN achieved +2.00% on Penn Action, while high-exertion classes like punching/slapping improved by +6.96%. Even in video captioning, Qwen2.5-VL's ROUGE-L score rose from 0.310 to 0.339 (+0.029), indicating that physics-inferred forces enhance temporal grounding and semantic richness. These results demonstrate that force cues can substantially complement visual and kinematic features under dynamic, occluded, or appearance-varying conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While AI-assisted graphic design tools have advanced, diffusion-based text-to-image models struggle with text rendering, especially for small-scale typography and non-Latin scripts like Chinese. There's a need for better text editing and generation capabilities in design workflows.

Method: Proposes UTDesign with three key components: 1) A novel DiT-based text style transfer model trained from scratch on synthetic data to generate transparent RGBA text foregrounds, 2) Extension to conditional text generation via multi-modal condition encoder trained on curated text annotations, and 3) Integration into automated text-to-design pipeline with pre-trained T2I models and MLLM-based layout planner.

Result: UTDesign achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source methods in stylistic consistency and text accuracy, and shows unique advantages compared to proprietary commercial approaches. The framework supports both English and Chinese scripts effectively.

Conclusion: UTDesign provides a comprehensive solution for high-precision text editing and generation in design images, addressing limitations of existing diffusion models in text rendering, particularly for non-Latin scripts, and enabling fully automated text-to-design workflows.

Abstract: AI-assisted graphic design has emerged as a powerful tool for automating the creation and editing of design elements such as posters, banners, and advertisements. While diffusion-based text-to-image models have demonstrated strong capabilities in visual content generation, their text rendering performance, particularly for small-scale typography and non-Latin scripts, remains limited. In this paper, we propose UTDesign, a unified framework for high-precision stylized text editing and conditional text generation in design images, supporting both English and Chinese scripts. Our framework introduces a novel DiT-based text style transfer model trained from scratch on a synthetic dataset, capable of generating transparent RGBA text foregrounds that preserve the style of reference glyphs. We further extend this model into a conditional text generation framework by training a multi-modal condition encoder on a curated dataset with detailed text annotations, enabling accurate, style-consistent text synthesis conditioned on background images, prompts, and layout specifications. Finally, we integrate our approach into a fully automated text-to-design (T2D) pipeline by incorporating pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models and an MLLM-based layout planner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UTDesign achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source methods in terms of stylistic consistency and text accuracy, and also exhibits unique advantages compared to proprietary commercial approaches.

*James E. Gallagher,Edward J. Oughton,Jana Kosecka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOLOv11 with 10-30% thermal fusion at 5-10m altitude achieves optimal landmine detection (86.8% mAP), balancing accuracy with 17.7x faster training than transformer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Landmines cause 26,000 annual casualties across 60 countries, creating urgent need for efficient UAS-based detection methods leveraging thermal contrast between mines and soil.

Method: Evaluated adaptive RGB-LWIR fusion using YOLO architectures (v8, v10, v11) on 114 test images, comparing with RF-DETR, Faster R-CNN, and RetinaNet across 35,640 model-condition evaluations.

Result: YOLOv11 achieved 86.8% mAP with optimal thermal fusion parameters; aggregated multi-temporal datasets outperformed season-specific approaches by 1.8-9.6%; AT mines detected at 61.9% vs AP mines at 19.2%.

Conclusion: YOLOv11 offers best accuracy-efficiency tradeoff for operational deployment; future research should examine buried mines across different soil types where thermal contrast varies.

Abstract: Landmines remain a persistent humanitarian threat, with 110 million actively deployed mines across 60 countries, claiming 26,000 casualties annually. This research evaluates adaptive Red-Green-Blue (RGB) and Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) fusion for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)-based detection of surface-laid landmines, leveraging the thermal contrast between the ordnance and the surrounding soil to enhance feature extraction. Using You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures (v8, v10, v11) across 114 test images, generating 35,640 model-condition evaluations, YOLOv11 achieved optimal performance (86.8% mAP), with 10 to 30% thermal fusion at 5 to 10m altitude identified as the optimal detection parameters. A complementary architectural comparison revealed that while RF-DETR achieved the highest accuracy (69.2% mAP), followed by Faster R-CNN (67.6%), YOLOv11 (64.2%), and RetinaNet (50.2%), YOLOv11 trained 17.7 times faster than the transformer-based RF-DETR (41 minutes versus 12 hours), presenting a critical accuracy-efficiency tradeoff for operational deployment. Aggregated multi-temporal training datasets outperformed season-specific approaches by 1.8 to 9.6%, suggesting that models benefit from exposure to diverse thermal conditions. Anti-Tank (AT) mines achieved 61.9% detection accuracy, compared with 19.2% for Anti-Personnel (AP) mines, reflecting both the size differential and thermal-mass differences between these ordnance classes. As this research examined surface-laid mines where thermal contrast is maximized, future research should quantify thermal contrast effects for mines buried at varying depths across heterogeneous soil types.

Abstract: This manuscript explores multimodal alignment, translation, fusion, and transference to enhance machine understanding of complex inputs. We organize the work into five chapters, each addressing unique challenges in multimodal machine learning.
  Chapter 3 introduces Spatial-Reasoning Bert for translating text-based spatial relations into 2D arrangements between clip-arts. This enables effective decoding of spatial language into visual representations, paving the way for automated scene generation aligned with human spatial understanding.
  Chapter 4 presents a method for translating medical texts into specific 3D locations within an anatomical atlas. We introduce a loss function leveraging spatial co-occurrences of medical terms to create interpretable mappings, significantly enhancing medical text navigability.
  Chapter 5 tackles translating structured text into canonical facts within knowledge graphs. We develop a benchmark for linking natural language to entities and predicates, addressing ambiguities in text extraction to provide clearer, actionable insights.
  Chapter 6 explores multimodal fusion methods for compositional action recognition. We propose a method fusing video frames and object detection representations, improving recognition robustness and accuracy.
  Chapter 7 investigates multimodal knowledge transference for egocentric action recognition. We demonstrate how multimodal knowledge distillation enables RGB-only models to mimic multimodal fusion-based capabilities, reducing computational requirements while maintaining performance.
  These contributions advance methodologies for spatial language understanding, medical text interpretation, knowledge graph enrichment, and action recognition, enhancing computational systems' ability to process complex, multimodal inputs across diverse applications.

Abstract: We introduce SirenPose, a geometry-aware loss formulation that integrates the periodic activation properties of sinusoidal representation networks with keypoint-based geometric supervision, enabling accurate and temporally consistent reconstruction of dynamic 3D scenes from monocular videos. Existing approaches often struggle with motion fidelity and spatiotemporal coherence in challenging settings involving fast motion, multi-object interaction, occlusion, and rapid scene changes. SirenPose incorporates physics inspired constraints to enforce coherent keypoint predictions across both spatial and temporal dimensions, while leveraging high frequency signal modeling to capture fine grained geometric details. We further expand the UniKPT dataset to 600,000 annotated instances and integrate graph neural networks to model keypoint relationships and structural correlations. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including Sintel, Bonn, and DAVIS demonstrate that SirenPose consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. On DAVIS, SirenPose achieves a 17.8 percent reduction in FVD, a 28.7 percent reduction in FID, and a 6.0 percent improvement in LPIPS compared to MoSCA. It also improves temporal consistency, geometric accuracy, user score, and motion smoothness. In pose estimation, SirenPose outperforms Monst3R with lower absolute trajectory error as well as reduced translational and rotational relative pose error, highlighting its effectiveness in handling rapid motion, complex dynamics, and physically plausible reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlignPose is a multi-view 6D object pose estimation method that aggregates RGB information from calibrated cameras without object-specific training, using multi-view feature-metric refinement to optimize consistent world-frame poses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-view RGB pose estimation suffers from depth ambiguity, clutter, and occlusions. Multi-view methods could solve these issues but existing approaches either rely on precise single-view estimates or lack generalization to unseen objects.

Method: AlignPose aggregates information from multiple extrinsically calibrated RGB views without object-specific training. Key innovation is multi-view feature-metric refinement that optimizes a single consistent world-frame object pose by minimizing feature discrepancy between rendered object features and observed image features across all views simultaneously.

Result: Extensive experiments on four datasets (YCB-V, T-LESS, ITODD-MV, HouseCat6D) using BOP benchmark show AlignPose outperforms other published methods, especially on challenging industrial datasets where multiple views are readily available.

Conclusion: AlignPose effectively addresses limitations of single-view pose estimation through multi-view aggregation and feature-metric refinement, demonstrating strong performance particularly in industrial settings where multiple camera views are practical.

Abstract: Single-view RGB model-based object pose estimation methods achieve strong generalization but are fundamentally limited by depth ambiguity, clutter, and occlusions. Multi-view pose estimation methods have the potential to solve these issues, but existing works rely on precise single-view pose estimates or lack generalization to unseen objects. We address these challenges via the following three contributions. First, we introduce AlignPose, a 6D object pose estimation method that aggregates information from multiple extrinsically calibrated RGB views and does not require any object-specific training or symmetry annotation. Second, the key component of this approach is a new multi-view feature-metric refinement specifically designed for object pose. It optimizes a single, consistent world-frame object pose minimizing the feature discrepancy between on-the-fly rendered object features and observed image features across all views simultaneously. Third, we report extensive experiments on four datasets (YCB-V, T-LESS, ITODD-MV, HouseCat6D) using the BOP benchmark evaluation and show that AlignPose outperforms other published methods, especially on challenging industrial datasets where multiple views are readily available in practice.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MTIF introduces multi-grained text guidance with hierarchical cross-modal modulation for better image fusion, outperforming previous methods on exposure and focus fusion tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-guided image fusion methods use coarse-grained descriptions that fail to capture fine details and struggle with precise cross-modal alignment, limiting fusion quality.

Method: Three key designs: 1) Multi-grained textual descriptions (fine details, structural cues, semantic content) with hierarchical cross-modal modulation, 2) Supervision at each granularity for better visual-textual alignment, 3) Saliency-driven enrichment module to augment training data with dense semantic content.

Result: Extensive experiments show MTIF consistently outperforms previous methods on both multi-exposure and multi-focus image fusion tasks.

Conclusion: MTIF's multi-grained text guidance with hierarchical modulation and granular supervision effectively addresses cross-modal alignment challenges, achieving superior image fusion performance.

Abstract: Image fusion aims to synthesize a single high-quality image from a pair of inputs captured under challenging conditions, such as differing exposure levels or focal depths. A core challenge lies in effectively handling disparities in dynamic range and focus depth between the inputs. With the advent of vision-language models, recent methods incorporate textual descriptions as auxiliary guidance to enhance fusion quality. However, simply incorporating coarse-grained descriptions hampers the understanding of fine-grained details and poses challenges for precise cross-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-grained Text-guided Image Fusion (MTIF), a novel fusion paradigm with three key designs. First, it introduces multi-grained textual descriptions that separately capture fine details, structural cues, and semantic content, guiding image fusion through a hierarchical cross-modal modulation module. Second, it involves supervision signals at each granularity to facilitate alignment between visual and textual features and enhance the utility of auxiliary text. Third, it adopts a saliency-driven enrichment module to augment training data with dense semantic content, further strengthening the cross-modal modulation and alignment. Extensive experiments show that MTIF consistently outperforms previous methods on both multi-exposure and multi-focus image fusion tasks.

TL;DR: DSR Suite addresses VLMs' weakness in dynamic spatial reasoning through automated 4D-aware dataset generation and a lightweight geometry integration module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models are strong at general understanding but weak at dynamic spatial reasoning (reasoning about object geometry and relationships in 3D space over time), largely due to lack of scalable 4D-aware training data.

Method: 1) Automated pipeline to generate multiple-choice QA pairs from in-the-wild videos using vision foundation models to extract geometric/motion info; 2) DSR-Train dataset for learning and human-refined DSR-Bench for evaluation; 3) Geometry Selection Module (GSM) to integrate geometric priors into VLMs via compact geometry tokens.

Result: Integrating DSR-Train and GSM into Qwen2.5-VL-7B significantly enhances dynamic spatial reasoning while maintaining accuracy on general video understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: DSR Suite bridges the gap in dynamic spatial reasoning across dataset, benchmark, and model aspects, enabling VLMs to better understand 4D spatial-temporal relationships in videos.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLM) excel at general understanding yet remain weak at dynamic spatial reasoning (DSR), i.e., reasoning about the evolvement of object geometry and relationship in 3D space over time, largely due to the scarcity of scalable 4D-aware training resources. To bridge this gap across aspects of dataset, benchmark and model, we introduce DSR Suite. First, we propose an automated pipeline that generates multiple-choice question-answer pairs from in-the-wild videos for DSR. By leveraging modern vision foundation models, the pipeline extracts rich geometric and motion information, including camera poses, local point clouds, object masks, orientations, and 3D trajectories. These geometric cues enable the construction of DSR-Train for learning and further human-refined DSR-Bench for evaluation. Compared with previous works, our data emphasize (i) in-the-wild video sources, (ii) object- and scene-level 3D requirements, (iii) viewpoint transformations, (iv) multi-object interactions, and (v) fine-grained, procedural answers. Beyond data, we propose a lightweight Geometry Selection Module (GSM) to seamlessly integrate geometric priors into VLMs, which condenses question semantics and extracts question-relevant knowledge from pretrained 4D reconstruction priors into a compact set of geometry tokens. This targeted extraction avoids overwhelming the model with irrelevant knowledge. Experiments show that integrating DSR-Train and GSM into Qwen2.5-VL-7B significantly enhances its dynamic spatial reasoning capability, while maintaining accuracy on general video understanding benchmarks.

TL;DR: FlashVLM is a text-guided visual token selection framework that dynamically prunes visual tokens based on query relevance and visual saliency, achieving beyond-lossless compression while maintaining or improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs process hundreds/thousands of visual tokens per image/frame, incurring quadratic attention costs and redundancy. Existing token reduction methods ignore textual queries or rely on unstable deep attention maps that degrade semantic alignment under aggressive pruning.

Method: Computes explicit cross-modal similarity between projected image tokens and normalized text embeddings in language model space, fuses extrinsic relevance with intrinsic visual saliency using log-domain weighting and temperature-controlled sharpening, and includes diversity-preserving partition to retain minimal background tokens for global context.

Result: Achieves beyond-lossless compression, slightly surpassing unpruned baseline while pruning up to 77.8% of visual tokens on LLaVA 1.5, maintaining 92.8% accuracy under 94.4% compression. State-of-the-art efficiency-performance trade-offs demonstrated across 14 image/video benchmarks with strong robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: FlashVLM provides an effective text-guided visual token selection framework that dynamically adapts visual inputs to queries, achieving significant computational savings while maintaining or improving performance through explicit cross-modal relevance scoring and balanced token selection.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) typically process hundreds or thousands of visual tokens per image or video frame, incurring quadratic attention cost and substantial redundancy. Existing token reduction methods often ignore the textual query or rely on deep attention maps, whose instability under aggressive pruning leads to degraded semantic alignment.
  We propose FlashVLM, a text guided visual token selection framework that dynamically adapts visual inputs to the query. Instead of relying on noisy attention weights, FlashVLM computes an explicit cross modal similarity between projected image tokens and normalized text embeddings in the language model space. This extrinsic relevance is fused with intrinsic visual saliency using log domain weighting and temperature controlled sharpening. In addition, a diversity preserving partition retains a minimal yet representative set of background tokens to maintain global context.
  Under identical token budgets and evaluation protocols, FlashVLM achieves beyond lossless compression, slightly surpassing the unpruned baseline while pruning up to 77.8 percent of visual tokens on LLaVA 1.5, and maintaining 92.8 percent accuracy even under 94.4 percent compression. Extensive experiments on 14 image and video benchmarks demonstrate that FlashVLM delivers state of the art efficiency performance trade offs while maintaining strong robustness and generalization across mainstream VLMs.

Conclusion: Video Diffusion Transformers pre-trained on large-scale real-world videos exhibit strong inherent point tracking capability, providing an effective and efficient foundation for point tracking tasks.

Abstract: Point tracking aims to localize corresponding points across video frames, serving as a fundamental task for 4D reconstruction, robotics, and video editing. Existing methods commonly rely on shallow convolutional backbones such as ResNet that process frames independently, lacking temporal coherence and producing unreliable matching costs under challenging conditions. Through systematic analysis, we find that video Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), pre-trained on large-scale real-world videos with spatio-temporal attention, inherently exhibit strong point tracking capability and robustly handle dynamic motions and frequent occlusions. We propose DiTracker, which adapts video DiTs through: (1) query-key attention matching, (2) lightweight LoRA tuning, and (3) cost fusion with a ResNet backbone. Despite training with 8 times smaller batch size, DiTracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging ITTO benchmark and matches or outperforms state-of-the-art models on TAP-Vid benchmarks.

TL;DR: FedPOD improves federated learning efficiency and communication costs by including outlier participants, eliminating dependency on previous rounds, and using validation loss calculation, achieving comparable performance to FedPIDAvg while being compatible with Kubernetes auto-scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of FedPIDAvg which excludes outlier participants and requires maintaining the same participants throughout training due to its PID controller's dependency on previous rounds' learning information.

Method: Proposes FedPOD with round-wise tasks that include participants excluded as outliers, eliminate dependency on previous rounds' learning information, and apply validation loss calculation at each round. Inspired by Kubernetes' POD concept for flexible scaling.

Result: Achieved comparable performance to FedPIDAvg with Dice scores of 0.78, 0.71, and 0.72 for WT, ET, and TC respectively, and projected convergence score of 0.74 on average.

Conclusion: FedPOD demonstrates potential to enhance federated learning by improving efficiency, flexibility, and performance metrics while being compatible with Kubernetes auto-scaling for flexible deployment.

Abstract: This paper proposes FedPOD (Proportionally Orchestrated Derivative) for optimizing learning efficiency and communication cost in federated learning among multiple clients. Inspired by FedPIDAvg, we define a round-wise task for FedPOD to enhance training efficiency. FedPIDAvg achieved performance improvement by incorporating the training loss reduction for prediction entropy as weights using differential terms. Furthermore, by modeling data distribution with a Poisson distribution and using a PID controller, it reduced communication costs even in skewed data distribution. However, excluding participants classified as outliers based on the Poisson distribution can limit data utilization. Additionally, PID controller requires the same participants to be maintained throughout the federated learning process as it uses previous rounds' learning information in the current round. In our approach, FedPOD addresses these issues by including participants excluded as outliers, eliminating dependency on previous rounds' learning information, and applying a method for calculating validation loss at each round. In this challenge, FedPOD presents comparable performance to FedPIDAvg in metrics of Dice score, 0.78, 0.71 and 0.72 for WT, ET and TC in average, and projected convergence score, 0.74 in average. Furthermore, the concept of FedPOD draws inspiration from Kubernetes' smallest computing unit, POD, designed to be compatible with Kubernetes auto-scaling. Extending round-wise tasks of FedPOD to POD units allows flexible design by applying scale-out similar to Kubernetes' auto-scaling. This work demonstrated the potentials of FedPOD to enhance federated learning by improving efficiency, flexibility, and performance in metrics.

TL;DR: ORCA framework enables video avatars to autonomously pursue long-term goals through adaptive environmental interaction, moving beyond passive animation to active intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video avatar generation methods lack genuine agency - they cannot autonomously pursue long-term goals through adaptive environmental interaction, being limited to identity preservation and motion alignment rather than goal-directed planning.

Method: ORCA framework with Internal World Model capabilities: (1) closed-loop OTAR cycle (Observe-Think-Act-Reflect) for robust state tracking under generative uncertainty, (2) hierarchical dual-system architecture (System 2 for strategic reasoning, System 1 for precise action caption translation), and (3) formulating avatar control as POMDP with continuous belief updating and outcome verification.

Result: ORCA significantly outperforms open-loop and non-reflective baselines in task success rate and behavioral coherence, demonstrating autonomous multi-step task completion in open-domain scenarios.

Conclusion: The IWM-inspired ORCA framework advances video avatar intelligence from passive animation to active, goal-oriented behavior, enabling genuine agency through adaptive environmental interaction and long-term goal pursuit.

Abstract: Current video avatar generation methods excel at identity preservation and motion alignment but lack genuine agency, they cannot autonomously pursue long-term goals through adaptive environmental interaction. We address this by introducing L-IVA (Long-horizon Interactive Visual Avatar), a task and benchmark for evaluating goal-directed planning in stochastic generative environments, and ORCA (Online Reasoning and Cognitive Architecture), the first framework enabling active intelligence in video avatars. ORCA embodies Internal World Model (IWM) capabilities through two key innovations: (1) a closed-loop OTAR cycle (Observe-Think-Act-Reflect) that maintains robust state tracking under generative uncertainty by continuously verifying predicted outcomes against actual generations, and (2) a hierarchical dual-system architecture where System 2 performs strategic reasoning with state prediction while System 1 translates abstract plans into precise, model-specific action captions. By formulating avatar control as a POMDP and implementing continuous belief updating with outcome verification, ORCA enables autonomous multi-step task completion in open-domain scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ORCA significantly outperforms open-loop and non-reflective baselines in task success rate and behavioral coherence, validating our IWM-inspired design for advancing video avatar intelligence from passive animation to active, goal-oriented behavior.

TL;DR: SpatialTree introduces a cognitive-science-inspired hierarchy of spatial abilities for MLLMs, revealing structured skill dependencies and transfer dynamics, with an auto-think strategy that enables consistent improvement across all levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal LLM studies focus on narrow spatial tasks, lacking understanding of the hierarchical development of spatial abilities from perception to reasoning and interaction that cognitive science suggests.

Method: Created SpatialTree hierarchy with four levels (perception, mental mapping, simulation, agentic competence) and corresponding benchmark evaluating 27 sub-abilities. Used targeted supervised fine-tuning to study transfer dynamics and developed auto-think strategy to suppress unnecessary deliberation in RL training.

Result: Evaluation revealed clear structure: L1 skills are orthogonal while higher-level skills are strongly correlated. Found negative transfer within L1 but strong cross-level transfer from low to high abilities. Naive RL helps complex reasoning but hurts perception, while auto-think strategy enables consistent improvement across all levels.

Conclusion: SpatialTree provides a framework for understanding and systematically scaling spatial abilities in MLLMs, demonstrating hierarchical skill dependencies and effective training strategies for improving the entire ability spectrum.

Abstract: Cognitive science suggests that spatial ability develops progressively-from perception to reasoning and interaction. Yet in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), this hierarchy remains poorly understood, as most studies focus on a narrow set of tasks. We introduce SpatialTree, a cognitive-science-inspired hierarchy that organizes spatial abilities into four levels: low-level perception (L1), mental mapping (L2), simulation (L3), and agentic competence (L4). Based on this taxonomy, we construct the first capability-centric hierarchical benchmark, thoroughly evaluating mainstream MLLMs across 27 sub-abilities. The evaluation results reveal a clear structure: L1 skills are largely orthogonal, whereas higher-level skills are strongly correlated, indicating increasing interdependency. Through targeted supervised fine-tuning, we uncover a surprising transfer dynamic-negative transfer within L1, but strong cross-level transfer from low- to high-level abilities with notable synergy. Finally, we explore how to improve the entire hierarchy. We find that naive RL that encourages extensive "thinking" is unreliable: it helps complex reasoning but hurts intuitive perception. We propose a simple auto-think strategy that suppresses unnecessary deliberation, enabling RL to consistently improve performance across all levels. By building SpatialTree, we provide a proof-of-concept framework for understanding and systematically scaling spatial abilities in MLLMs.

TL;DR: SemanticGen generates videos in semantic space first for global planning, then adds details, making it faster and more efficient than direct VAE latent generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generative models using VAE latents are slow to converge and computationally expensive for long videos, needing a more efficient approach.

Method: Two-stage diffusion: first generates compact semantic features for global layout, then generates VAE latents conditioned on those semantic features.

Result: Faster convergence than VAE latent generation, computationally efficient for long videos, and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in quality.

Conclusion: Generating in semantic space enables efficient high-quality video generation by separating global planning from detail addition.

Abstract: State-of-the-art video generative models typically learn the distribution of video latents in the VAE space and map them to pixels using a VAE decoder. While this approach can generate high-quality videos, it suffers from slow convergence and is computationally expensive when generating long videos. In this paper, we introduce SemanticGen, a novel solution to address these limitations by generating videos in the semantic space. Our main insight is that, due to the inherent redundancy in videos, the generation process should begin in a compact, high-level semantic space for global planning, followed by the addition of high-frequency details, rather than directly modeling a vast set of low-level video tokens using bi-directional attention. SemanticGen adopts a two-stage generation process. In the first stage, a diffusion model generates compact semantic video features, which define the global layout of the video. In the second stage, another diffusion model generates VAE latents conditioned on these semantic features to produce the final output. We observe that generation in the semantic space leads to faster convergence compared to the VAE latent space. Our method is also effective and computationally efficient when extended to long video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemanticGen produces high-quality videos and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and strong baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM systems are limited to well-defined benchmarks and general tasks, lacking end-to-end problem-solving ability in open scientific scenarios, especially in physics which requires integrating analytical reasoning with code-based computation.

Method: PhysMaster couples abstract reasoning with numerical computation, leverages LANDAU (Layered Academic Data Universe) for preserving literature, knowledge, and methodological traces, and employs adaptive exploration balancing efficiency and open-ended exploration.

Conclusion: PhysMaster demonstrates robust performance in ultra-long-horizon tasks, enabling autonomous scientific research capabilities that go beyond existing LLM systems limited to well-defined benchmarks.

Abstract: Advances in LLMs have produced agents with knowledge and operational capabilities comparable to human scientists, suggesting potential to assist, accelerate, and automate research. However, existing studies mainly evaluate such systems on well-defined benchmarks or general tasks like literature retrieval, limiting their end-to-end problem-solving ability in open scientific scenarios. This is particularly true in physics, which is abstract, mathematically intensive, and requires integrating analytical reasoning with code-based computation. To address this, we propose PhysMaster, an LLM-based agent functioning as an autonomous theoretical and computational physicist. PhysMaster couples absract reasoning with numerical computation and leverages LANDAU, the Layered Academic Data Universe, which preserves retrieved literature, curated prior knowledge, and validated methodological traces, enhancing decision reliability and stability. It also employs an adaptive exploration strategy balancing efficiency and open-ended exploration, enabling robust performance in ultra-long-horizon tasks. We evaluate PhysMaster on problems from high-energy theory, condensed matter theory to astrophysics, including: (i) acceleration, compressing labor-intensive research from months to hours; (ii) automation, autonomously executing hypothesis-driven loops ; and (iii) autonomous discovery, independently exploring open problems.

TL;DR: Bi-objective vehicle routing for post-disaster relief distribution balancing efficiency (travel time) and equity (Gini-index of unsatisfied demand) using branch-and-price algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-disaster relief distribution requires balancing timely delivery with fair allocation when prepositioned supplies are insufficient to meet all shelter demands.

Method: Formulated bi-objective MIP model with Gini-index for equity and travel time minimization, used ε-constraint method, derived mathematical properties, added valid inequalities, developed branch-and-price algorithm with optimal delivery allocation algorithm.

Result: Branch-and-price algorithm significantly outperforms commercial MIP solvers, reduces aid distribution inequity by 34% without compromising efficiency, shows different optimization strategies needed based on time constraint tightness.

Conclusion: For moderately restrictive time constraints, balanced approach is essential to avoid inequitable outcomes; lexicographic optimization works best for very loose or tight constraints.

Abstract: The distribution of relief supplies to shelters is a critical aspect of post-disaster humanitarian logistics. In major disasters, prepositioned supplies often fall short of meeting all demands. We address the problem of planning vehicle routes from a distribution center to shelters while allocating limited relief supplies. To balance efficiency and equity, we formulate a bi-objective problem: minimizing a Gini-index-based measure of inequity in unsatisfied demand for fair distribution and minimizing total travel time for timely delivery. We propose a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model and use the $ε$-constraint method to handle the bi-objective nature. By deriving mathematical properties of the optimal solution, we introduce valid inequalities and design an algorithm for optimal delivery allocations given feasible vehicle routes. A branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm is developed to solve the problem efficiently. Computational tests on realistic datasets from a past earthquake in Van, Turkey, and predicted data for Istanbul's Kartal region show that the B&P algorithm significantly outperforms commercial MIP solvers. Our bi-objective approach reduces aid distribution inequity by 34% without compromising efficiency. Results indicate that when time constraints are very loose or tight, lexicographic optimization prioritizing demand coverage over fairness is effective. For moderately restrictive time constraints, a balanced approach is essential to avoid inequitable outcomes.

*Eric Yeh,John Cadigan,Ran Chen,Dick Crouch,Melinda Gervasio,Dayne Freitag*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can simulate human behavior in economic games using interpolative decoding to modulate personality traits along Big Five dimensions, enabling more nuanced simulations than rule-based agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based human simulations require separate prompts for each personality profile, creating experimental overhead and reducing replicability. There's a need for a more systematic approach to simulate personality effects on decision-making.

Method: Use interpolative decoding where each Big Five personality dimension is represented as a pair of opposed prompts, with an interpolation parameter to simulate behavior along that dimension continuum.

Result: Interpolative decoding reliably modulates LLM scores along Big Five dimensions, successfully mimics human decision-making in economic games, and can "twin" individual human players through systematic search in interpolation space.

Conclusion: Interpolative decoding provides a systematic, replicable method for using LLMs as human proxies in behavioral simulations, enabling personality modulation without creating separate prompts for each profile.

Abstract: Recent research has explored using very large language models (LLMs) as proxies for humans in tasks such as simulation, surveys, and studies. While LLMs do not possess a human psychology, they often can emulate human behaviors with sufficiently high fidelity to drive simulations to test human behavioral hypotheses, exhibiting more nuance and range than the rule-based agents often employed in behavioral economics. One key area of interest is the effect of personality on decision making, but the requirement that a prompt must be created for every tested personality profile introduces experimental overhead and degrades replicability. To address this issue, we leverage interpolative decoding, representing each dimension of personality as a pair of opposed prompts and employing an interpolation parameter to simulate behavior along the dimension. We show that interpolative decoding reliably modulates scores along each of the Big Five dimensions. We then show how interpolative decoding causes LLMs to mimic human decision-making behavior in economic games, replicating results from human psychological research. Finally, we present preliminary results of our efforts to ``twin'' individual human players in a collaborative game through systematic search for points in interpolation space that cause the system to replicate actions taken by the human subject.

Motivation: To address the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge of fine-grained multi-label species identification from high-resolution images by adapting from multi-class individual species classification to multi-label vegetation plot classification.

Method: Extracts features from training images and creates class prototypes using K-Means clustering (K=number of classes). Uses a customized narrow ViT with frozen DinoV2 patch embedding, trained to reconstruct class prototypes from test images. Attention scores from this model guide classification by identifying areas of interest.

Result: Achieved 5th place in PlantCLEF 2025 private leaderboard with F1 score of 0.33331, only 0.03 lower than top-performing submission, demonstrating competitive performance.

Conclusion: The prototype-guided segmentation ViT approach enables effective domain adaptation for multi-label plant species identification, showing competitive results in the PlantCLEF benchmark with potential for further improvement.

Abstract: This paper presents an approach developed to address the PlantClef 2025 challenge, which consists of a fine-grained multi-label species identification, over high-resolution images. Our solution focused on employing class prototypes obtained from the training dataset as a proxy guidance for training a segmentation Vision Transformer (ViT) on the test set images. To obtain these representations, the proposed method extracts features from training dataset images and create clusters, by applying K-Means, with $K$ equals to the number of classes in the dataset. The segmentation model is a customized narrow ViT, built by replacing the patch embedding layer with a frozen DinoV2, pre-trained on the training dataset for individual species classification. This model is trained to reconstruct the class prototypes of the training dataset from the test dataset images. We then use this model to obtain attention scores that enable to identify and localize areas of interest and consequently guide the classification process. The proposed approach enabled a domain-adaptation from multi-class identification with individual species, into multi-label classification from high-resolution vegetation plots. Our method achieved fifth place in the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge on the private leaderboard, with an F1 score of 0.33331. Besides that, in absolute terms our method scored 0.03 lower than the top-performing submission, suggesting that it may achieved competitive performance in the benchmark task.

TL;DR: Proposes clustering-based hierarchical classification to mitigate intra-class variability in fine-grained visual categorization, achieving SOTA on PlantNet300k despite unoptimized components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intra-class variability combined with class underrepresentation hinders DL model learning in FGVC tasks, requiring methods to learn more fine-grained features.

Method: Applies clustering within each class to discover pseudo-labels encoding similarity, then uses hierarchical classification with these labels to learn fine-grained features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on PlantNet300k dataset, though some components are not fully optimized; initial experiments reveal key areas for future development.

Conclusion: Clustering-based hierarchical classification shows promise for mitigating intra-class variability in FGVC, with SOTA results suggesting effectiveness despite needing further optimization.

Abstract: Intra-class variability is given according to the significance in the degree of dissimilarity between images within a class. In that sense, depending on its intensity, intra-class variability can hinder the learning process for DL models, specially when such classes are also underrepresented, which is a very common scenario in Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) tasks. This paper proposes a novel method that aims at leveraging classification performance in FGVC tasks by learning fine-grained features via classification of class-wise cluster assignments. Our goal is to apply clustering over each class individually, which can allow to discover pseudo-labels that encodes a latent degree of similarity between images. In turn, those labels can be employed in a hierarchical classification process that allows to learn more fine-grained visual features and thereby mitigating intra-class variability issues. Initial experiments over the PlantNet300k enabled to shed light upon several key points in which future work will have to be developed in order to find more conclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of our method. Our method still achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PlantNet300k dataset even though some of its components haven't been shown to be fully optimized.

TL;DR: S³IT benchmark tests embodied social intelligence by requiring agents to arrange seating in 3D environments for LLM-driven NPCs with complex social relationships and preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations fail to integrate social reasoning with physical constraints - they either test disembodied social reasoning or socially-agnostic physical tasks, missing the crucial integration needed for real-world embodied agents.

Method: Created S³IT benchmark with procedurally extensible framework generating diverse scenarios. Features seat-ordering task where agents must: 1) acquire NPC preferences through dialogue, 2) perceive 3D environment via exploration, 3) optimize seating arrangements considering complex social constraints and physical space.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs struggle significantly with S³IT, showing large gap compared to human baseline. LLMs show deficiencies in spatial intelligence but achieve near human-level competence in resolving conflicts with explicit textual cues.

Conclusion: Embodied social intelligence requires integration of social and physical reasoning that current LLMs lack, particularly in spatial aspects. The S³IT benchmark provides a challenging testbed for developing agents that can navigate both social norms and physical constraints in realistic environments.

Abstract: The integration of embodied agents into human environments demands embodied social intelligence: reasoning over both social norms and physical constraints. However, existing evaluations fail to address this integration, as they are limited to either disembodied social reasoning (e.g., in text) or socially-agnostic physical tasks. Both approaches fail to assess an agent's ability to integrate and trade off both physical and social constraints within a realistic, embodied context. To address this challenge, we introduce Spatially Situated Social Intelligence Test (S$^{3}$IT), a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate embodied social intelligence. It is centered on a novel and challenging seat-ordering task, requiring an agent to arrange seating in a 3D environment for a group of large language model-driven (LLM-driven) NPCs with diverse identities, preferences, and intricate interpersonal relationships. Our procedurally extensible framework generates a vast and diverse scenario space with controllable difficulty, compelling the agent to acquire preferences through active dialogue, perceive the environment via autonomous exploration, and perform multi-objective optimization within a complex constraint network. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on S$^{3}$IT and found that they still struggle with this problem, showing an obvious gap compared with the human baseline. Results imply that LLMs have deficiencies in spatial intelligence, yet simultaneously demonstrate their ability to achieve near human-level competence in resolving conflicts that possess explicit textual cues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symmetry is fundamental to physics and improves ML performance, but requires knowledge of underlying symmetries in data. Current methods have limitations in flexibility and assumptions.

Method: Formulates symmetry discovery as learning a distribution over a larger hypothesis group via flow matching on Lie groups. Introduces novel interpolation scheme to address "last-minute convergence" where samples remain stationary until late in flow.

Result: Successfully discovers discrete groups including reflections by flow matching over complex domain in experiments on 2D and 3D point clouds.

Conclusion: LieFlow is more flexible than previous works, requires fewer assumptions, and effectively discovers symmetries directly from data via flow matching on Lie groups.

Abstract: Symmetry is fundamental to understanding physical systems, and at the same time, can improve performance and sample efficiency in machine learning. Both pursuits require knowledge of the underlying symmetries in data. To address this, we propose learning symmetries directly from data via flow matching on Lie groups. We formulate symmetry discovery as learning a distribution over a larger hypothesis group, such that the learned distribution matches the symmetries observed in data. Relative to previous works, our method, \lieflow, is more flexible in terms of the types of groups it can discover and requires fewer assumptions. Experiments on 2D and 3D point clouds demonstrate the successful discovery of discrete groups, including reflections by flow matching over the complex domain. We identify a key challenge where the symmetric arrangement of the target modes causes ``last-minute convergence,'' where samples remain stationary until relatively late in the flow, and introduce a novel interpolation scheme for flow matching for symmetry discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generative models produce good visual predictions but are hard to translate into actions, while latent-action models lack high-level planning capabilities. There's a need to bridge this gap for better robot learning from videos.

Method: SOF learns latent skills from large collections of action-free videos using optical flow as an intermediate representation. This flow-based latent space captures motion information aligned with both video dynamics and robot actions, enabling skill learning and high-level planning.

Result: Experiments show consistent performance improvements in both multitask and long-horizon settings, demonstrating the ability to acquire and compose skills directly from raw visual data.

Conclusion: SOF successfully bridges the gap between video generative models and action models by learning skills from optical flow, enabling better planning and action translation for robot learning from videos.

Abstract: Learning from videos offers a promising path toward generalist robots by providing rich visual and temporal priors beyond what real robot datasets contain. While existing video generative models produce impressive visual predictions, they are difficult to translate into low-level actions. Conversely, latent-action models better align videos with actions, but they typically operate at the single-step level and lack high-level planning capabilities. We bridge this gap by introducing Skill Abstraction from Optical Flow (SOF), a framework that learns latent skills from large collections of action-free videos. Our key idea is to learn a latent skill space through an intermediate representation based on optical flow that captures motion information aligned with both video dynamics and robot actions. By learning skills in this flow-based latent space, SOF enables high-level planning over video-derived skills and allows for easier translation of these skills into actions. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves performance in both multitask and long-horizon settings, demonstrating the ability to acquire and compose skills directly from raw visual data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change is increasing frequency/intensity of disasters, requiring rapid response. Accurate, quick disaster location identification is crucial for decision-making and resource allocation in climate resilience.

Method: Probabilistic Cross-view Geolocalization (ProbGLC) framework combining probabilistic and deterministic models into unified system. Provides uncertainty quantification, probabilistic distributions, and localizability scores for explainability.

Result: Superior geolocalization accuracy: 0.86 in Acc@1km and 0.97 in Acc@25km on MultiIAN and SAGAINDisaster datasets. Provides probabilistic distributions and localizability scores for model explainability.

Conclusion: ProbGLC demonstrates great potential for leveraging generative cross-view approaches to facilitate location awareness for better, faster disaster response. Framework addresses multiple disaster types and offers explainable AI features.

Abstract: As Earth's climate changes, it is impacting disasters and extreme weather events across the planet. Record-breaking heat waves, drenching rainfalls, extreme wildfires, and widespread flooding during hurricanes are all becoming more frequent and more intense. Rapid and efficient response to disaster events is essential for climate resilience and sustainability. A key challenge in disaster response is to accurately and quickly identify disaster locations to support decision-making and resources allocation. In this paper, we propose a Probabilistic Cross-view Geolocalization approach, called ProbGLC, exploring new pathways towards generative location awareness for rapid disaster response. Herein, we combine probabilistic and deterministic geolocalization models into a unified framework to simultaneously enhance model explainability (via uncertainty quantification) and achieve state-of-the-art geolocalization performance. Designed for rapid diaster response, the ProbGLC is able to address cross-view geolocalization across multiple disaster events as well as to offer unique features of probabilistic distribution and localizability score. To evaluate the ProbGLC, we conduct extensive experiments on two cross-view disaster datasets (i.e., MultiIAN and SAGAINDisaster), consisting diverse cross-view imagery pairs of multiple disaster types (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires, floods, to tornadoes). Preliminary results confirms the superior geolocalization accuracy (i.e., 0.86 in Acc@1km and 0.97 in Acc@25km) and model explainability (i.e., via probabilistic distributions and localizability scores) of the proposed ProbGLC approach, highlighting the great potential of leveraging generative cross-view approach to facilitate location awareness for better and faster disaster response.

TL;DR: RL-based content moderation systems show sigmoid-like scaling with data efficiency 100x better than supervised fine-tuning, especially effective for complex policy reasoning tasks with scarce expert labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Content moderation at scale is a critical challenge with billions of user/AI-generated artifacts needing policy evaluation. While LLMs show promise for policy-grounded moderation, practical challenges remain unexplored: label sparsity, evolving policies, and need for nuanced reasoning beyond pattern matching.

Method: Comprehensive empirical investigation of scaling reinforcement learning for content classification. Systematic evaluation of multiple RL training recipes and reward-shaping strategies including verifiable rewards and LLM-as-judge frameworks to transform general-purpose language models into specialized, policy-aligned classifiers across three real-world content moderation tasks.

Result: RL exhibits sigmoid-like scaling behavior where performance improves smoothly with increased training data, rollouts, and optimization steps before saturating. RL substantially improves performance on complex policy-grounded reasoning tasks while achieving up to 100x higher data efficiency than supervised fine-tuning.

Conclusion: RL-based approaches are particularly effective for content moderation in domains where expert annotations are scarce or costly, providing actionable insights for industrial-scale moderation systems.

Abstract: Content moderation at scale remains one of the most pressing challenges in today's digital ecosystem, where billions of user- and AI-generated artifacts must be continuously evaluated for policy violations. Although recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for policy-grounded moderation, the practical challenges of training these systems to achieve expert-level accuracy in real-world settings remain largely unexplored, particularly in regimes characterized by label sparsity, evolving policy definitions, and the need for nuanced reasoning beyond shallow pattern matching. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical investigation of scaling reinforcement learning (RL) for content classification, systematically evaluating multiple RL training recipes and reward-shaping strategies-including verifiable rewards and LLM-as-judge frameworks-to transform general-purpose language models into specialized, policy-aligned classifiers across three real-world content moderation tasks. Our findings provide actionable insights for industrial-scale moderation systems, demonstrating that RL exhibits sigmoid-like scaling behavior in which performance improves smoothly with increased training data, rollouts, and optimization steps before gradually saturating. Moreover, we show that RL substantially improves performance on tasks requiring complex policy-grounded reasoning while achieving up to 100x higher data efficiency than supervised fine-tuning, making it particularly effective in domains where expert annotations are scarce or costly.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ActionFlow is a system-level inference framework that accelerates Vision-Language-Action models on edge devices by 2.55x through cross-request pipelining and memory optimization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models suffer from high inference latency (3-5 Hz) on edge devices due to memory-bound autoregressive decoding, which prevents smooth robotic interaction requiring 20-30 Hz control frequencies. Existing optimizations often require extensive retraining or compromise accuracy.

Method: ActionFlow introduces: 1) Cross-Request Pipelining strategy that batches memory-bound Decode phases with compute-bound Prefill phases across continuous time steps; 2) Cross-Request State Packed Forward operator; 3) Unified KV Ring Buffer to fuse fragmented memory operations into efficient dense computations.

Result: Achieves 2.55x improvement in FPS on OpenVLA-7B model without retraining, enabling real-time dynamic manipulation on edge hardware.

Conclusion: ActionFlow bridges the gap between VLA model capabilities and real-time robotic requirements through system-level optimizations that maximize hardware utilization without compromising model accuracy or requiring retraining.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a unified paradigm for robotic perception and control, enabling emergent generalization and long-horizon task execution. However, their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments is severely hin dered by high inference latency. While smooth robotic interaction requires control frequencies of 20 to 30 Hz, current VLA models typi cally operate at only 3-5 Hz on edge devices due to the memory bound nature of autoregressive decoding. Existing optimizations often require extensive retraining or compromise model accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce ActionFlow, a system-level inference framework tailored for resource-constrained edge plat forms. At the core of ActionFlow is a Cross-Request Pipelin ing strategy, a novel scheduler that redefines VLA inference as a macro-pipeline of micro-requests. The strategy intelligently batches memory-bound Decode phases with compute-bound Prefill phases across continuous time steps to maximize hardware utilization. Furthermore, to support this scheduling, we propose a Cross Request State Packed Forward operator and a Unified KV Ring Buffer, which fuse fragmented memory operations into efficient dense computations. Experimental results demonstrate that ActionFlow achieves a 2.55x improvement in FPS on the OpenVLA-7B model without retraining, enabling real-time dy namic manipulation on edge hardware.

*H M Quamran Hasan,Housam Khalifa Bashier,Jiayi Dai,Mi-Young Kim,Randy Goebel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Reason2Decide is a two-stage training framework that improves clinical decision support by generating predictions with aligned explanations, using scheduled sampling to reduce exposure bias and working effectively with smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical decision support systems need both high predictive accuracy and explanations that align with predictions. Current approaches suffer from exposure bias leading to misaligned explanations.

Method: Two-stage training framework: Stage-1 trains on rationale generation, Stage-2 jointly trains on label prediction and rationale generation using scheduled sampling to transition from gold labels to model predictions.

Result: Outperforms other fine-tuning baselines and some zero-shot LLMs in prediction (F1) and rationale fidelity across three medical datasets. Works with models 40x smaller than foundation models while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: Reason2Decide makes clinical reasoning more accessible for resource-constrained deployments by achieving strong performance with smaller models while providing explainable decision support, reducing reliance on human annotations.

Abstract: Despite the wide adoption of Large Language Models (LLM)s, clinical decision support systems face a critical challenge: achieving high predictive accuracy while generating explanations aligned with the predictions. Current approaches suffer from exposure bias leading to misaligned explanations. We propose Reason2Decide, a two-stage training framework that addresses key challenges in self-rationalization, including exposure bias and task separation. In Stage-1, our model is trained on rationale generation, while in Stage-2, we jointly train on label prediction and rationale generation, applying scheduled sampling to gradually transition from conditioning on gold labels to model predictions. We evaluate Reason2Decide on three medical datasets, including a proprietary triage dataset and public biomedical QA datasets. Across model sizes, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning baselines and some zero-shot LLMs in prediction (F1) and rationale fidelity (BERTScore, BLEU, LLM-as-a-Judge). In triage, Reason2Decide is rationale source-robust across LLM-generated, nurse-authored, and nurse-post-processed rationales. In our experiments, while using only LLM-generated rationales in Stage-1, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning variants. This indicates that LLM-generated rationales are suitable for pretraining models, reducing reliance on human annotations. Remarkably, Reason2Decide achieves these gains with models 40x smaller than contemporary foundation models, making clinical reasoning more accessible for resource-constrained deployments while still providing explainable decision support.

*Chaithra,Kamesh Kadimisetty,Biju R Mohan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Adaptive LLM framework integrates real-time market feedback and reinforcement learning for improved financial sentiment analysis in Indian stock market.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing financial sentiment analysis methods ignore the impact of stock prices and market feedback, limiting their real-world applicability and accuracy in dynamic market conditions.

Method: Fine-tunes LLaMA 3.2 3B with instruction-based learning, uses RAG pipeline for multi-source context retrieval, incorporates feedback-driven source reliability adjustment, and employs PPO-based reinforcement learning for temporal adaptation.

Result: Significantly improves classification accuracy, F1-score, and market alignment over baselines on NIFTY 50 news headlines (2024-2025), demonstrating superior performance compared to static methods.

Conclusion: Combining instruction-tuned LLMs with dynamic market feedback and reinforcement learning enables robust, market-aware financial sentiment modeling that adapts to real-world market behavior.

Abstract: Financial sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in informing investment decisions, assessing market risk, and predicting stock price trends. Existing works in financial sentiment analysis have not considered the impact of stock prices or market feedback on sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose an adaptive framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with real-world stock market feedback to improve sentiment classification in the context of the Indian stock market. The proposed methodology fine-tunes the LLaMA 3.2 3B model using instruction-based learning on the SentiFin dataset. To enhance sentiment predictions, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline is employed that dynamically selects multi-source contextual information based on the cosine similarity of the sentence embeddings. Furthermore, a feedback-driven module is introduced that adjusts the reliability of the source by comparing predicted sentiment with actual next-day stock returns, allowing the system to iteratively adapt to market behavior. To generalize this adaptive mechanism across temporal data, a reinforcement learning agent trained using proximal policy optimization (PPO) is incorporated. The PPO agent learns to optimize source weighting policies based on cumulative reward signals from sentiment-return alignment. Experimental results on NIFTY 50 news headlines collected from 2024 to 2025 demonstrate that the proposed system significantly improves classification accuracy, F1-score, and market alignment over baseline models and static retrieval methods. The results validate the potential of combining instruction-tuned LLMs with dynamic feedback and reinforcement learning for robust, market-aware financial sentiment modeling.

*Zhuo Yang,Yeyun chen,Jiaqing Xie,Ben Gao,Shuaike Shen,Wanhao Liu,Liujia Yang,Beilun Wang,Tianfan Fu,Yuqiang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MolAct is an agentic RL framework for molecular design that trains LLM agents to perform multi-step editing and optimization using chemical tools, achieving state-of-the-art performance on validity and property optimization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Molecular editing and optimization require iterative improvements while maintaining chemical validity and structural similarity, but existing approaches lack formalization as sequential, tool-guided decision processes.

Method: Two-stage training: first build editing capability, then optimize properties while reusing learned editing behaviors. LLM agents learn to interleave reasoning, tool-use, and optimization through multi-turn interactions with chemical tools for validity checking, property assessment, and similarity control.

Result: MolEditAgent-7B achieves 100/95/98% valid add/delete/substitute edits, outperforming DeepSeek-R1. MolOptAgent-7B surpasses Claude 3.7 on LogP optimization and remains competitive on solubility while maintaining balanced performance across objectives.

Conclusion: Treating molecular design as a multi-step, tool-augmented agentic reinforcement learning process enables reliable and interpretable improvements, with MolAct demonstrating superior performance over strong baselines.

Abstract: Molecular editing and optimization are multi-step problems that require iteratively improving properties while keeping molecules chemically valid and structurally similar. We frame both tasks as sequential, tool-guided decisions and introduce MolAct, an agentic reinforcement learning framework that employs a two-stage training paradigm: first building editing capability, then optimizing properties while reusing the learned editing behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize molecular design as an Agentic Reinforcement Learning problem, where an LLM agent learns to interleave reasoning, tool-use, and molecular optimization. The framework enables agents to interact in multiple turns, invoking chemical tools for validity checking, property assessment, and similarity control, and leverages their feedback to refine subsequent edits. We instantiate the MolAct framework to train two model families: MolEditAgent for molecular editing tasks and MolOptAgent for molecular optimization tasks. In molecular editing, MolEditAgent-7B delivers 100, 95, and 98 valid add, delete, and substitute edits, outperforming strong closed "thinking" baselines such as DeepSeek-R1; MolEditAgent-3B approaches the performance of much larger open "thinking" models like Qwen3-32B-think. In molecular optimization, MolOptAgent-7B (trained on MolEditAgent-7B) surpasses the best closed "thinking" baseline (e.g., Claude 3.7) on LogP and remains competitive on solubility, while maintaining balanced performance across other objectives. These results highlight that treating molecular design as a multi-step, tool-augmented process is key to reliable and interpretable improvements.

*Xingyou Yin,Ceyao Zhang,Min Hu,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Injecting noise into time series data before tokenization improves frozen LLMs' forecasting performance by forcing them to focus on robust temporal patterns rather than numerical artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frozen LLMs (without fine-tuning) for time series forecasting are brittle and sensitive to textual representations of numerical data, as their parameters cannot adapt to distribution shifts.

Method: Inject noise into raw time series before tokenization as a form of inference-time augmentation, forcing the frozen LLM to extrapolate based on robust underlying temporal patterns.

Result: Empirical validation across diverse benchmarks shows improved performance. Two novel TS datasets outside LLMs' pre-training scopes were introduced to eliminate data contamination biases, consistently showing performance gains.

Conclusion: Noise injection is a simple yet effective non-invasive intervention that advances the use of truly off-the-shelf LLMs for time series forecasting without fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness as zero-shot time series (TS) forecasters. The key challenge lies in tokenizing TS data into textual representations that align with LLMs' pre-trained knowledge. While existing work often relies on fine-tuning specialized modules to bridge this gap, a distinct, yet challenging, paradigm aims to leverage truly off-the-shelf LLMs without any fine-tuning whatsoever, relying solely on strategic tokenization of numerical sequences. The performance of these fully frozen models is acutely sensitive to the textual representation of the input data, as their parameters cannot adapt to distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet highly effective strategy to overcome this brittleness: injecting noise into the raw time series before tokenization. This non-invasive intervention acts as a form of inference-time augmentation, compelling the frozen LLM to extrapolate based on robust underlying temporal patterns rather than superficial numerical artifacts. We theoretically analyze this phenomenon and empirically validate its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks. Notably, to fully eliminate potential biases from data contamination during LLM pre-training, we introduce two novel TS datasets that fall outside all utilized LLMs' pre-training scopes, and consistently observe improved performance. This study provides a further step in directly leveraging off-the-shelf LLMs for time series forecasting.

TL;DR: BiGRU model outperforms GRU for PUE prediction in data center energy efficiency optimization using feature selection via RFECV.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data centers consume significant global energy with growing demand from edge computing and AI. Improving energy efficiency through PUE prediction helps combat climate change, reduce costs, and promote sustainability.

Method: Developed Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) model for PUE prediction, using Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) for feature selection from 117 features in EnergyPlus simulated dataset of Singapore data center. Compared with standard GRU model.

Result: BiGRU-based PUE prediction model showed better performance than GRU when evaluated using mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared metrics on optimized feature sets.

Conclusion: BiGRU model provides superior PUE prediction capability for data center energy management, enabling targeted feature modifications to improve energy efficiency and sustainability.

Abstract: Data centers account for significant global energy consumption and a carbon footprint. The recent increasing demand for edge computing and AI advancements drives the growth of data center storage capacity. Energy efficiency is a cost-effective way to combat climate change, cut energy costs, improve business competitiveness, and promote IT and environmental sustainability. Thus, optimizing data center energy management is the most important factor in the sustainability of the world. Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) is used to represent the operational efficiency of the data center. Predicting PUE using Neural Networks provides an understanding of the effect of each feature on energy consumption, thus enabling targeted modifications of those key features to improve energy efficiency. In this paper, we have developed Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) based PUE prediction model and compared the model performance with GRU. The data set comprises 52,560 samples with 117 features using EnergyPlus, simulating a DC in Singapore. Sets of the most relevant features are selected using the Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) algorithm for different parameter settings. These feature sets are used to find the optimal hyperparameter configuration and train the BiGRU model. The performance of the optimized BiGRU-based PUE prediction model is then compared with that of GRU using mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared metrics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare how humans and large language models generalize mathematical concepts, specifically examining their inductive biases and inference strategies in concept learning tasks.

Method: Used a Bayesian model as an analytical framework to examine inductive biases and inference strategies of humans and LLMs in the number game concept inference task.

Result: Humans were better captured by the Bayesian model, showing flexible inference of both rule-based and similarity-based concepts, while LLMs relied more on mathematical rules. Humans demonstrated few-shot generalization from single examples, whereas LLMs required more samples.

Conclusion: There are fundamental differences in how humans and LLMs infer and generalize mathematical concepts, with humans showing more flexible reasoning and better generalization from limited data.

Abstract: We compare human and large language model (LLM) generalization in the number game, a concept inference task. Using a Bayesian model as an analytical framework, we examined the inductive biases and inference strategies of humans and LLMs. The Bayesian model captured human behavior better than LLMs in that humans flexibly infer rule-based and similarity-based concepts, whereas LLMs rely more on mathematical rules. Humans also demonstrated a few-shot generalization, even from a single example, while LLMs required more samples to generalize. These contrasts highlight the fundamental differences in how humans and LLMs infer and generalize mathematical concepts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Offline PbRL learns rewards/policies from human preferences but faces safety challenges. PreSa framework learns safe policies directly from preferences and safety labels without explicit reward/cost models, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline PbRL avoids extensive reward engineering but struggles with safety in long-horizon tasks. Previous safe RLHF approaches learn reward/cost models then use constrained RL, but errors accumulate in continuous control, impairing performance.

Method: Proposes PreSa: (1) learns policy directly from pairwise preferences about behavior rewards and binary safety labels of trajectory segments; (2) combines preference learning with safety alignment in constrained optimization solved via Lagrangian method; (3) avoids explicit reward/cost models and constrained RL.

Result: Evaluated on continuous control tasks with synthetic and real human feedback. Method successfully learns safe policies with high rewards, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines and offline safe RL approaches with ground-truth reward/cost.

Conclusion: PreSa framework effectively addresses safety challenges in offline PbRL by directly learning safe policies from preferences and safety labels without explicit reward/cost modeling, demonstrating superior performance in continuous control tasks.

Abstract: Offline Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) learns rewards and policies aligned with human preferences without the need for extensive reward engineering and direct interaction with human annotators. However, ensuring safety remains a critical challenge across many domains and tasks. Previous works on safe RL from human feedback (RLHF) first learn reward and cost models from offline data, then use constrained RL to optimize a safe policy. While such an approach works in the contextual bandits settings (LLMs), in long horizon continuous control tasks, errors in rewards and costs accumulate, leading to impairment in performance when used with constrained RL methods. To address these challenges, (a) instead of indirectly learning policies (from rewards and costs), we introduce a framework that learns a policy directly based on pairwise preferences regarding the agent's behavior in terms of rewards, as well as binary labels indicating the safety of trajectory segments; (b) we propose \textsc{PreSa} (Preference and Safety Alignment), a method that combines preference learning module with safety alignment in a constrained optimization problem. This optimization problem is solved within a Lagrangian paradigm that directly learns reward-maximizing safe policy \textit{without explicitly learning reward and cost models}, avoiding the need for constrained RL; (c) we evaluate our approach on continuous control tasks with both synthetic and real human feedback. Empirically, our method successfully learns safe policies with high rewards, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, and offline safe RL approaches with ground-truth reward and cost.

Conclusion: TongSIM serves as a unified platform that accelerates training, evaluation, and advancement toward general embodied intelligence by offering flexibility and scalability for researchers.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly advances, especially in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), research focus is shifting from single-modality text processing to the more complex domains of multimodal and embodied AI. Embodied intelligence focuses on training agents within realistic simulated environments, leveraging physical interaction and action feedback rather than conventionally labeled datasets. Yet, most existing simulation platforms remain narrowly designed, each tailored to specific tasks. A versatile, general-purpose training environment that can support everything from low-level embodied navigation to high-level composite activities, such as multi-agent social simulation and human-AI collaboration, remains largely unavailable. To bridge this gap, we introduce TongSIM, a high-fidelity, general-purpose platform for training and evaluating embodied agents. TongSIM offers practical advantages by providing over 100 diverse, multi-room indoor scenarios as well as an open-ended, interaction-rich outdoor town simulation, ensuring broad applicability across research needs. Its comprehensive evaluation framework and benchmarks enable precise assessment of agent capabilities, such as perception, cognition, decision-making, human-robot cooperation, and spatial and social reasoning. With features like customized scenes, task-adaptive fidelity, diverse agent types, and dynamic environmental simulation, TongSIM delivers flexibility and scalability for researchers, serving as a unified platform that accelerates training, evaluation, and advancement toward general embodied intelligence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MemR³ is a memory retrieval system with closed-loop control that autonomously decides between retrieve, reflect, and answer actions to optimize LLM agent responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory systems focus too much on compression/storage and not enough on explicit control of memory retrieval. There's a need for autonomous, accurate, and compatible memory retrieval with closed-loop control.

Method: Two core mechanisms: 1) a router that selects among retrieve, reflect, and answer actions; 2) a global evidence-gap tracker that makes the answering process transparent and tracks evidence collection. This replaces the standard retrieve-then-answer pipeline with closed-loop control.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines on LoCoMo benchmark, improves LLM-as-a-Judge scores, and enhances existing retrievers across four categories with overall improvements: +7.29% on RAG and +1.94% on Zep using GPT-4.1-mini backend.

Conclusion: MemR³ provides a plug-and-play controller for existing memory stores that enables autonomous decision-making through closed-loop control, improving answer quality and transparency in memory retrieval systems.

Abstract: Memory systems have been designed to leverage past experiences in Large Language Model (LLM) agents. However, many deployed memory systems primarily optimize compression and storage, with comparatively less emphasis on explicit, closed-loop control of memory retrieval. From this observation, we build memory retrieval as an autonomous, accurate, and compatible agent system, named MemR$^3$, which has two core mechanisms: 1) a router that selects among retrieve, reflect, and answer actions to optimize answer quality; 2) a global evidence-gap tracker that explicitly renders the answering process transparent and tracks the evidence collection process. This design departs from the standard retrieve-then-answer pipeline by introducing a closed-loop control mechanism that enables autonomous decision-making. Empirical results on the LoCoMo benchmark demonstrate that MemR$^3$ surpasses strong baselines on LLM-as-a-Judge score, and particularly, it improves existing retrievers across four categories with an overall improvement on RAG (+7.29%) and Zep (+1.94%) using GPT-4.1-mini backend, offering a plug-and-play controller for existing memory stores.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As networks evolve to 5G/6G, operators face orchestration challenges beyond static automation and DRL. LLM agents offer intent-based networking but introduce stochastic risks like topology hallucinations and policy non-compliance.

Method: Proposes Graph-Symbolic Policy Enforcement and Control (G-SPEC), a neuro-symbolic framework with Governance Triad: telecom-adapted agent (TSLAM-4B), Network Knowledge Graph (NKG), and SHACL constraints to constrain probabilistic planning with deterministic verification.

Result: Evaluated on 450-node 5G Core simulation: achieved zero safety violations and 94.1% remediation success rate (vs 82.4% baseline). NKG validation contributed 68% of safety gains, SHACL policies 24%. Scalable to 10K-100K nodes with O(k¹·²) validation latency and 142ms overhead.

Conclusion: G-SPEC provides a viable neuro-symbolic approach for safe intent-based networking in 5G/6G SMO-layer operations by combining LLM flexibility with deterministic verification through knowledge graphs and policy constraints.

Abstract: As networks evolve toward 5G Standalone and 6G, operators face orchestration challenges that exceed the limits of static automation and Deep Reinforcement Learning. Although Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a path toward intent-based networking, they introduce stochastic risks, including topology hallucinations and policy non-compliance. To mitigate this, we propose Graph-Symbolic Policy Enforcement and Control (G-SPEC), a neuro-symbolic framework that constrains probabilistic planning with deterministic verification. The architecture relies on a Governance Triad - a telecom-adapted agent (TSLAM-4B), a Network Knowledge Graph (NKG), and SHACL constraints. We evaluated G-SPEC on a simulated 450-node 5G Core, achieving zero safety violations and a 94.1% remediation success rate, significantly outperforming the 82.4% baseline. Ablation analysis indicates that NKG validation drives the majority of safety gains (68%), followed by SHACL policies (24%). Scalability tests on topologies ranging from 10K to 100K nodes demonstrate that validation latency scales as $O(k^{1.2})$ where $k$ is subgraph size. With a processing overhead of 142ms, G-SPEC is viable for SMO-layer operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While executable code is optimal for agentic procedural memory, the mechanism for autonomously synthesizing this memory from scratch remains underexplored. The paper aims to transition LLMs from passive tool-users to active workflow architects.

Method: Through a high-fidelity case study of cross-service orchestration (Outlook and OneDrive), the paper addresses four structural bottlenecks: Discovery Gap (navigation of large tool registries), Verification Gap (grounding tool response structures), Decomposition Gap (replacing inefficient search with Linear State Anchoring), and Scaling Gap (concurrency and persistence). The approach enforces a scientific methodology of hypothesize, probe, and code.

Result: The paper demonstrates that agents can autonomously write robust, production-grade code skills by systematically addressing the identified bottlenecks.

Conclusion: By operationalizing the transition of LLMs to active workflow architects and addressing key structural bottlenecks through a scientific methodology, autonomous synthesis of executable code skills from a blank slate becomes achievable.

Abstract: While CodeMem establishes executable code as the optimal representation for agentic procedural memory, the mechanism for autonomously synthesizing this memory from a blank slate remains underexplored. This paper operationalizes the transition of Large Language Models from passive tool-users to active workflow architects. Through a high-fidelity case study of a cross-service orchestration task involving Outlook and OneDrive, we identify and address four structural bottlenecks in automated skill generation: the Discovery Gap involving navigation of large tool registries, the Verification Gap regarding grounding tool response structures, the Decomposition Gap which replaces inefficient search with Linear State Anchoring, and the Scaling Gap focused on concurrency and persistence. We demonstrate that by enforcing a scientific methodology of hypothesize, probe, and code, agents can autonomously write robust, production-grade code skills.

*Junren Li,Luhua Lai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SynCraft is an LLM-based framework that reframes synthesizability optimization as structural editing rather than sequence translation, using atom-level edits to navigate the "synthesis cliff" and generate synthesizable analogs with high structural fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative AI for molecules produces many synthetically inaccessible compounds, and existing solutions (post-hoc filtering or projection methods) compromise structural novelty or disrupt key pharmacophores by forcing molecules into pre-defined synthetic templates.

Method: SynCraft uses reasoning-based framework with Large Language Models to predict executable sequences of atom-level edits rather than generating SMILES strings directly, leveraging LLMs' emergent reasoning capabilities and chemical intuition while circumventing their syntactic fragility.

Result: SynCraft outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating synthesizable analogs with high structural fidelity, successfully replicates expert medicinal chemistry intuition in editing PLK1 inhibitors, and rescues high-scoring but previously discarded RIPK1 candidates from previous molecular generation literature.

Conclusion: SynCraft demonstrates that reframing synthesizability optimization as a precise structural editing problem using LLM reasoning capabilities effectively addresses the "synthesis cliff" and enables generation of synthesizable molecules without compromising structural novelty or pharmacophores.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence has revolutionized the exploration of chemical space, yet a critical bottleneck remains that a substantial fraction of generated molecules is synthetically inaccessible. Current solutions, such as post-hoc filtering or projection-based methods, often compromise structural novelty or disrupt key pharmacophores by forcing molecules into pre-defined synthetic templates. Herein, we introduce SynCraft, a reasoning-based framework that reframes synthesizability optimization not as a sequence translation task, but as a precise structural editing problem. Leveraging the emergent reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models, SynCraft navigates the "synthesis cliff" where minimal structural modifications yield significant gains in synthetic feasibility. By predicting executable sequences of atom-level edits rather than generating SMILES strings directly, SynCraft circumvents the syntactic fragility of LLMs while harnessing their chemical intuition. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that SynCraft outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating synthesizable analogs with high structural fidelity. Furthermore, through interaction-aware prompting, SynCraft successfully replicates expert medicinal chemistry intuition in editing PLK1 inhibitors and rescuing high-scoring but previously discarded RIPK1 candidates in previous molecular generation literatures.

Abstract: A global shortage of radiologists has been exacerbated by the significant volume of chest X-ray workloads, particularly in primary care. Although multimodal large language models show promise, existing evaluations predominantly rely on automated metrics or retrospective analyses, lacking rigorous prospective clinical validation. Janus-Pro-CXR (1B), a chest X-ray interpretation system based on DeepSeek Janus-Pro model, was developed and rigorously validated through a multicenter prospective trial (NCT07117266). Our system outperforms state-of-the-art X-ray report generation models in automated report generation, surpassing even larger-scale models including ChatGPT 4o (200B parameters), while demonstrating reliable detection of six clinically critical radiographic findings. Retrospective evaluation confirms significantly higher report accuracy than Janus-Pro and ChatGPT 4o. In prospective clinical deployment, AI assistance significantly improved report quality scores, reduced interpretation time by 18.3% (P < 0.001), and was preferred by a majority of experts in 54.3% of cases. Through lightweight architecture and domain-specific optimization, Janus-Pro-CXR improves diagnostic reliability and workflow efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained settings. The model architecture and implementation framework will be open-sourced to facilitate the clinical translation of AI-assisted radiology solutions.

TL;DR: Bohrium+SciMaster infrastructure enables scalable AI agentic science by providing traceable AI4S assets and orchestration for long-horizon scientific workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents enable multi-step scientific workflows, but scaling faces challenges: workflows are hard to observe/reproduce, tools aren't agent-ready, execution lacks traceability, and prototype systems are bespoke limiting reuse.

Method: Bohrium acts as a managed hub for AI4S assets (like HuggingFace for AI Science), making scientific data/software/compute/lab systems agent-ready. SciMaster orchestrates these into workflows. A scientific intelligence substrate organizes reusable components for workflow reasoning.

Result: Demonstrated with eleven representative master agents in real workflows, achieving orders-of-magnitude reductions in end-to-end scientific cycle time and generating execution-grounded signals from real workloads at multi-million scale.

Conclusion: Scaling agentic science requires an infrastructure-and-ecosystem approach, which Bohrium+SciMaster provides through traceable asset management, workflow orchestration, and reusable components for composition and auditability.

Abstract: AI agents are emerging as a practical way to run multi-step scientific workflows that interleave reasoning with tool use and verification, pointing to a shift from isolated AI-assisted steps toward \emph{agentic science at scale}. This shift is increasingly feasible, as scientific tools and models can be invoked through stable interfaces and verified with recorded execution traces, and increasingly necessary, as AI accelerates scientific output and stresses the peer-review and publication pipeline, raising the bar for traceability and credible evaluation.
  However, scaling agentic science remains difficult: workflows are hard to observe and reproduce; many tools and laboratory systems are not agent-ready; execution is hard to trace and govern; and prototype AI Scientist systems are often bespoke, limiting reuse and systematic improvement from real workflow signals.
  We argue that scaling agentic science requires an infrastructure-and-ecosystem approach, instantiated in Bohrium+SciMaster. Bohrium acts as a managed, traceable hub for AI4S assets -- akin to a HuggingFace of AI for Science -- that turns diverse scientific data, software, compute, and laboratory systems into agent-ready capabilities. SciMaster orchestrates these capabilities into long-horizon scientific workflows, on which scientific agents can be composed and executed. Between infrastructure and orchestration, a \emph{scientific intelligence substrate} organizes reusable models, knowledge, and components into executable building blocks for workflow reasoning and action, enabling composition, auditability, and improvement through use.
  We demonstrate this stack with eleven representative master agents in real workflows, achieving orders-of-magnitude reductions in end-to-end scientific cycle time and generating execution-grounded signals from real workloads at multi-million scale.

### [97] [Benchmarking LLMs for Predictive Applications in the Intensive Care Units](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20520)
*Chehak Malhotra,Mehak Gopal,Akshaya Devadiga,Pradeep Singh,Ridam Pal,Ritwik Kashyap,Tavpritesh Sethi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs like GatorTron-Base, Llama 8B, and Mistral 7B show comparable performance to smaller language models (BioBERT, DocBERT, etc.) in predicting shock in ICU patients, with GatorTron-Base achieving 80.5% weighted recall but no inherent superiority of LLMs over SLMs for clinical prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs have transformed many NLP tasks, their application in clinical predictive tasks remains under-researched. Timely prediction of shock in critically ill patients could enable early interventions and improve patient outcomes, making this an important clinical application.

Method: Compared LLMs (GatorTron-Base, Llama 8B, Mistral 7B) against smaller models (BioBERT, DocBERT, BioClinicalBERT, Word2Vec, Doc2Vec) for shock prediction using MIMIC III ICU data. Analyzed 17,294 ICU stays, scoring for length of stay >24h and shock index >0.7, resulting in 355 normal and 87 abnormal cases. Used both focal and cross-entropy losses during fine-tuning to address class imbalance.

Result: GatorTron-Base achieved highest weighted recall of 80.5%, but overall performance metrics were comparable between SLMs and LLMs. No inherent superiority of LLMs over SLMs for predicting future clinical events was found, despite LLMs' strong performance on text-based tasks.

Conclusion: LLMs are not inherently superior to SLMs for clinical prediction tasks. Future LLM development should focus on predicting clinical trajectories rather than simpler tasks like named entity recognition or phenotyping to achieve meaningful clinical outcomes.

Abstract: With the advent of LLMs, various tasks across the natural language processing domain have been transformed. However, their application in predictive tasks remains less researched. This study compares large language models, including GatorTron-Base (trained on clinical data), Llama 8B, and Mistral 7B, against models like BioBERT, DocBERT, BioClinicalBERT, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec, setting benchmarks for predicting Shock in critically ill patients. Timely prediction of shock can enable early interventions, thus improving patient outcomes. Text data from 17,294 ICU stays of patients in the MIMIC III database were scored for length of stay > 24 hours and shock index (SI) > 0.7 to yield 355 and 87 patients with normal and abnormal SI-index, respectively. Both focal and cross-entropy losses were used during finetuning to address class imbalances. Our findings indicate that while GatorTron Base achieved the highest weighted recall of 80.5%, the overall performance metrics were comparable between SLMs and LLMs. This suggests that LLMs are not inherently superior to SLMs in predicting future clinical events despite their strong performance on text-based tasks. To achieve meaningful clinical outcomes, future efforts in training LLMs should prioritize developing models capable of predicting clinical trajectories rather than focusing on simpler tasks such as named entity recognition or phenotyping.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Teachers' emotional states significantly impact teaching effectiveness and student outcomes, but existing studies fail to accurately capture teacher emotions due to their performative nature and neglect of instructional context.

Method: Built T-MED dataset with 14,938 instances from 250 real classrooms across 11 subjects using human-machine collaborative labeling; proposed AAM-TSA model with asymmetric attention mechanism and hierarchical gating unit for differentiated cross-modal feature fusion.

Result: AAM-TSA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and interpretability on the T-MED dataset, demonstrating superior teacher sentiment analysis capabilities.

Conclusion: The study provides both a comprehensive dataset and an effective model for teacher sentiment analysis, addressing previous limitations and enabling better understanding of teacher emotions in educational contexts.

Abstract: Teachers' emotional states are critical in educational scenarios, profoundly impacting teaching efficacy, student engagement, and learning achievements. However, existing studies often fail to accurately capture teachers' emotions due to the performative nature and overlook the critical impact of instructional information on emotional expression.In this paper, we systematically investigate teacher sentiment analysis by building both the dataset and the model accordingly. We construct the first large-scale teacher multimodal sentiment analysis dataset, T-MED.To ensure labeling accuracy and efficiency, we employ a human-machine collaborative labeling process.The T-MED dataset includes 14,938 instances of teacher emotional data from 250 real classrooms across 11 subjects ranging from K-12 to higher education, integrating multimodal text, audio, video, and instructional information.Furthermore, we propose a novel asymmetric attention-based multimodal teacher sentiment analysis model, AAM-TSA.AAM-TSA introduces an asymmetric attention mechanism and hierarchical gating unit to enable differentiated cross-modal feature fusion and precise emotional classification. Experimental results demonstrate that AAM-TSA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and interpretability on the T-MED dataset.

TL;DR: Chain-of-thought reasoning in LLM-based SRS planning improves transparency and achieves comparable dosimetry to human planners while reducing cochlear dose.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Black-box AI systems have limited clinical adoption in stereotactic radiosurgery due to opacity concerns, creating a need for transparent automated planning systems.

Method: Developed SAGE (Secure Agent for Generative Dose Expertise), an LLM-based planning agent with two variants: non-reasoning and reasoning models. Tested on retrospective cohort of 41 brain metastases patients treated with 18 Gy single-fraction SRS.

Result: Reasoning model achieved comparable plan dosimetry to human planners on primary endpoints (PTV coverage, max dose, conformity/gradient indices) while reducing cochlear dose below human baselines. Reasoning model demonstrated systematic planning behaviors including constraint verification and trade-off deliberation, with optimization traces serving as auditable logs.

Conclusion: Chain-of-thought reasoning enables transparent, auditable automated SRS planning with clinical-grade performance, offering a path toward trustworthy AI adoption in radiation oncology.

Abstract: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) demands precise dose shaping around critical structures, yet black-box AI systems have limited clinical adoption due to opacity concerns. We tested whether chain-of-thought reasoning improves agentic planning in a retrospective cohort of 41 patients with brain metastases treated with 18 Gy single-fraction SRS. We developed SAGE (Secure Agent for Generative Dose Expertise), an LLM-based planning agent for automated SRS treatment planning. Two variants generated plans for each case: one using a non-reasoning model, one using a reasoning model. The reasoning variant showed comparable plan dosimetry relative to human planners on primary endpoints (PTV coverage, maximum dose, conformity index, gradient index; all p > 0.21) while reducing cochlear dose below human baselines (p = 0.022). When prompted to improve conformity, the reasoning model demonstrated systematic planning behaviors including prospective constraint verification (457 instances) and trade-off deliberation (609 instances), while the standard model exhibited none of these deliberative processes (0 and 7 instances, respectively). Content analysis revealed that constraint verification and causal explanation concentrated in the reasoning agent. The optimization traces serve as auditable logs, offering a path toward transparent automated planning.

TL;DR: Multi-agent framework with master LLM coordinating grounding and vision agents for long-video QA, using RL to optimize efficient cooperation and outperforming non-agent baselines on episode-level datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for long-video QA compress content into lossy summaries or use limited toolsets, which weakens temporal grounding and misses fine-grained visual cues needed for accurate episode-level reasoning.

Method: Proposes a multi-agent framework where a master LLM coordinates: 1) a grounding agent to localize question-relevant segments, and 2) a vision agent to extract targeted textual observations. The master agent plans with step limits and is trained with reinforcement learning to optimize concise, correct, and efficient multi-agent cooperation.

Result: The system significantly outperforms strong non-agent baselines on LongTVQA and LongTVQA+ datasets (episode-level datasets aggregated from TVQA/TVQA+). Experiments show reinforcement learning further strengthens reasoning and planning capabilities.

Conclusion: The multi-agent framework enables effective long-video QA by focusing on relevant clips via grounding, complementing subtitles with visual details, and producing interpretable trajectories, with RL training enhancing reasoning and planning efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal LLMs and systems that use tools for long-video QA point to the promise of reasoning over hour-long episodes. However, many methods still compress content into lossy summaries or rely on limited toolsets, weakening temporal grounding and missing fine-grained cues. We propose a multi-agent framework in which a master LLM coordinates a grounding agent to localize question-relevant segments and a vision agent to extract targeted textual observations. The master agent plans with a step limit, and is trained with reinforcement learning to encourage concise, correct, and efficient multi-agent cooperation. This design helps the master agent focus on relevant clips via grounding, complements subtitles with visual detail, and yields interpretable trajectories. On our proposed LongTVQA and LongTVQA+ which are episode-level datasets aggregated from TVQA/TVQA+, our multi-agent system significantly outperforms strong non-agent baselines. Experiments also show reinforcement learning further strengthens reasoning and planning for the trained agent. Code and data will be shared at https://longvideoagent.github.io/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to estimate states with orientation components while respecting group structure, and handle heavy-tailed/skewed noise distributions common in UWB localization due to NLOS and multipath effects.

Method: Extends ESGVI algorithm to operate on matrix Lie groups for orientation states, and introduces factors to accommodate heavy-tailed and skewed noise distributions while preserving sparse and derivative-free structure.

Result: Validated in UWB localization experiment with NLOS-rich measurements, showing improved accuracy and comparable consistency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Both extensions integrate naturally within ESGVI framework while preserving its advantages, with open-source implementation provided to support broader research in factor-graph-based estimation.

Abstract: This letter extends the exactly sparse Gaussian variational inference (ESGVI) algorithm for state estimation in two complementary directions. First, ESGVI is generalized to operate on matrix Lie groups, enabling the estimation of states with orientation components while respecting the underlying group structure. Second, factors are introduced to accommodate heavy-tailed and skewed noise distributions, as commonly encountered in ultra-wideband (UWB) localization due to non-line-of-sight (NLOS) and multipath effects. Both extensions are shown to integrate naturally within the ESGVI framework while preserving its sparse and derivative-free structure. The proposed approach is validated in a UWB localization experiment with NLOS-rich measurements, demonstrating improved accuracy and comparable consistency. Finally, a Python implementation within a factor-graph-based estimation framework is made open-source (https://github.com/decargroup/gvi_ws) to support broader research use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drone flocking offers enhanced cooperative capabilities but existing algorithms struggle with efficiency and scalability during initial formation, especially when potential collisions force suboptimal trajectories.

Method: A time-efficient prioritised scheduling algorithm assigns each drone a priority based on its number of potential collisions and likelihood of reaching its target without permanently obstructing others, then computes appropriate delays to ensure collision-free paths.

Result: The algorithm successfully generates collision-free trajectories for flocks of up to 5000 drones and outperforms the coupling-degree-based heuristic prioritised planning method (CDH-PP) in both performance and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed prioritised scheduling algorithm provides an effective solution for efficient and scalable initial formation of drone flocks, addressing key challenges in collision avoidance and trajectory optimization.

Abstract: Drone applications continue to expand across various domains, with flocking offering enhanced cooperative capabilities but introducing significant challenges during initial formation. Existing flocking algorithms often struggle with efficiency and scalability, particularly when potential collisions force drones into suboptimal trajectories. This paper presents a time-efficient prioritised scheduling algorithm that improves the initial formation process of drone flocks. The method assigns each drone a priority based on its number of potential collisions and its likelihood of reaching its target position without permanently obstructing other drones. Using this hierarchy, each drone computes an appropriate delay to ensure a collision-free path. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm successfully generates collision-free trajectories for flocks of up to 5000 drones and outperforms the coupling-degree-based heuristic prioritised planning method (CDH-PP) in both performance and computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VAP (Visual Attentive Prompting) is a training-free perceptual adapter that enables Vision-Language-Action models to handle personalized object manipulation tasks by using reference images as visual memory and injecting visual prompts through object highlighting and instruction rewriting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models struggle with personalized commands like "bring my cup" where robots need to identify specific instances among visually similar objects, requiring instance-level understanding beyond generic semantic comprehension.

Method: VAP treats reference images as non-parametric visual memory, grounds personal objects through open-vocabulary detection and embedding-based matching, then injects this grounding as visual prompts by highlighting the object and rewriting instructions, all without requiring additional training.

Result: VAP consistently outperforms generic policies and token-learning baselines in both success rate and correct-object manipulation across simulation benchmarks (Personalized-SIMPLER, Personalized-VLABench) and real-world tabletop tasks.

Conclusion: VAP effectively bridges the gap between semantic understanding and instance-level control by equipping frozen VLAs with top-down selective attention for personalized manipulation tasks.

Abstract: While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models generalize well to generic instructions, they struggle with personalized commands such as "bring my cup", where the robot must act on one specific instance among visually similar objects. We study this setting of manipulating personal objects, in which a VLA must identify and control a user-specific object unseen during training using only a few reference images. To address this challenge, we propose Visual Attentive Prompting (VAP), a simple-yet-effective training-free perceptual adapter that equips frozen VLAs with top-down selective attention. VAP treats the reference images as a non-parametric visual memory, grounds the personal object in the scene through open-vocabulary detection and embedding-based matching, and then injects this grounding as a visual prompt by highlighting the object and rewriting the instruction. We construct two simulation benchmarks, Personalized-SIMPLER and Personalized-VLABench, and a real-world tabletop benchmark to evaluate personalized manipulation across multiple robots and tasks. Experiments show that VAP consistently outperforms generic policies and token-learning baselines in both success rate and correct-object manipulation, helping to bridge the gap between semantic understanding and instance-level control.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LoLA is a VLA framework for long-horizon robot manipulation that integrates historical multi-view observations and proprioception through a State-Aware Latent Re-representation module to ground visual-language representations in physical robot motion space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision-Language-Action models overlook the critical capabilities of leveraging historical information and generating coherent action sequences for long-horizon, language-guided robotic manipulation tasks.

Method: Uses Vision-Language Models to encode contextual features from historical sequences and multi-view observations, plus a key State-Aware Latent Re-representation module that transforms visual inputs and language commands into actionable robot motion space by grounding VL representations in physical scale through an "embodiment-anchored" latent space.

Result: Significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods (e.g., pi0) on simulation benchmarks (SIMPLER and LIBERO) and real-world tasks on Franka and Bi-Manual Aloha robots, particularly in long-horizon manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: LoLA effectively addresses the challenge of long-horizon robotic manipulation by integrating historical context and proprioception through a novel latent space grounding approach, demonstrating superior performance over existing VLA methods.

Abstract: The capability of performing long-horizon, language-guided robotic manipulation tasks critically relies on leveraging historical information and generating coherent action sequences. However, such capabilities are often overlooked by existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. To solve this challenge, we propose LoLA (Long Horizon Latent Action Learning), a framework designed for robot manipulation that integrates long-term multi-view observations and robot proprioception to enable multi-step reasoning and action generation. We first employ Vision-Language Models to encode rich contextual features from historical sequences and multi-view observations. We further introduces a key module, State-Aware Latent Re-representation, which transforms visual inputs and language commands into actionable robot motion space. Unlike existing VLA approaches that merely concatenate robot proprioception (e.g., joint angles) with VL embeddings, this module leverages such robot states to explicitly ground VL representations in physical scale through a learnable "embodiment-anchored" latent space. We trained LoLA on diverse robotic pre-training datasets and conducted extensive evaluations on simulation benchmarks (SIMPLER and LIBERO), as well as two real-world tasks on Franka and Bi-Manual Aloha robots. Results show that LoLA significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods (e.g., pi0), particularly in long-horizon manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DuoCore-FS introduces an asynchronous Fast-Slow VLA framework that separates high-frequency action generation from slow VLM reasoning, enabling 30Hz whole-body control while using a 3B-parameter VLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA systems run VLMs and action experts at a single unified frequency, which limits performance due to slow VLM inference speeds. This synchronous execution constrains control stability and real-time performance in whole-body robotic manipulation with many joints and dynamic views.

Method: Proposes DuoCore-FS with two pathways: fast pathway for high-frequency action generation and slow pathway for rich VLM reasoning. Uses a latent representation buffer to bridge systems and store instruction semantics, plus a whole-body action tokenizer for compact action representation. The VLM and action expert are jointly trained end-to-end while enabling asynchronous execution.

Result: Achieves 30 Hz whole-body action-chunk generation with a 3B-parameter VLM, approximately 3x faster than prior VLA models with comparable sizes. Real-world experiments show improved task success rates and significantly enhanced responsiveness compared to synchronous baselines.

Conclusion: DuoCore-FS enables asynchronous execution of VLM reasoning and action generation, overcoming the performance limitations of synchronous VLA systems. The framework improves real-time whole-body manipulation performance while maintaining unified policy learning through end-to-end training.

Abstract: Most Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems integrate a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for semantic reasoning with an action expert generating continuous action signals, yet both typically run at a single unified frequency. As a result, policy performance is constrained by the low inference speed of large VLMs. This mandatory synchronous execution severely limits control stability and real-time performance in whole-body robotic manipulation, which involves more joints, larger motion spaces, and dynamically changing views. We introduce a truly asynchronous Fast-Slow VLA framework (DuoCore-FS), organizing the system into a fast pathway for high-frequency action generation and a slow pathway for rich VLM reasoning. The system is characterized by two key features. First, a latent representation buffer bridges the slow and fast systems. It stores instruction semantics and action-reasoning representation aligned with the scene-instruction context, providing high-level guidance to the fast pathway. Second, a whole-body action tokenizer provides a compact, unified representation of whole-body actions. Importantly, the VLM and action expert are still jointly trained end-to-end, preserving unified policy learning while enabling asynchronous execution. DuoCore-FS supports a 3B-parameter VLM while achieving 30 Hz whole-body action-chunk generation, approximately three times as fast as prior VLA models with comparable model sizes. Real-world whole-body manipulation experiments demonstrate improved task success rates and significantly enhanced responsiveness compared to synchronous Fast-Slow VLA baselines. The implementation of DuoCore-FS, including training, inference, and deployment, is provided to commercial users by Astribot as part of the Astribot robotic platform.

Conclusion: UrbanV2X addresses the critical gap in real-world vehicle-infrastructure cooperative datasets for dense urban environments, providing valuable resources for advancing smart mobility and autonomous driving research through C-V2X technology.

Abstract: Due to the limitations of a single autonomous vehicle, Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) technology opens a new window for achieving fully autonomous driving through sensor information sharing. However, real-world datasets supporting vehicle-infrastructure cooperative navigation in complex urban environments remain rare. To address this gap, we present UrbanV2X, a comprehensive multisensory dataset collected from vehicles and roadside infrastructure in the Hong Kong C-V2X testbed, designed to support research on smart mobility applications in dense urban areas. Our onboard platform provides synchronized data from multiple industrial cameras, LiDARs, 4D radar, ultra-wideband (UWB), IMU, and high-precision GNSS-RTK/INS navigation systems. Meanwhile, our roadside infrastructure provides LiDAR, GNSS, and UWB measurements. The entire vehicle-infrastructure platform is synchronized using the Precision Time Protocol (PTP), with sensor calibration data provided. We also benchmark various navigation algorithms to evaluate the collected cooperative data. The dataset is publicly available at https://polyu-taslab.github.io/UrbanV2X/.

Conclusion: KnowVal demonstrates that integrating knowledge retrieval with visual-language reasoning enables more robust, interpretable, and value-aligned autonomous driving decision-making compared to purely data-driven approaches.

Abstract: Visual-language reasoning, driving knowledge, and value alignment are essential for advanced autonomous driving systems. However, existing approaches largely rely on data-driven learning, making it difficult to capture the complex logic underlying decision-making through imitation or limited reinforcement rewards. To address this, we propose KnowVal, a new autonomous driving system that enables visual-language reasoning through the synergistic integration of open-world perception and knowledge retrieval. Specifically, we construct a comprehensive driving knowledge graph that encodes traffic laws, defensive driving principles, and ethical norms, complemented by an efficient LLM-based retrieval mechanism tailored for driving scenarios. Furthermore, we develop a human-preference dataset and train a Value Model to guide interpretable, value-aligned trajectory assessment. Experimental results show that our method substantially improves planning performance while remaining compatible with existing architectures. Notably, KnowVal achieves the lowest collision rate on nuScenes and state-of-the-art results on Bench2Drive.

Conclusion: The proposed inflatable robot structure with rolling contact joints enables significant improvements in motion range and payload capacity, expanding potential applications for inflatable robotics.

Abstract: Exploration of various applications is the frontier of research on inflatable robots. We proposed an articulated robots consisting of multiple pneumatic bladder links connected by rolling contact joints called Hillberry joints. The bladder link is made of a double-layered structure of tarpaulin sheet and polyurethane sheet, which is both airtight and flexible in shape. The integration of the Hilberry joint into an inflatable robot is also a new approach. The rolling contact joint allows wide range of motion of $\pm 150 ^{\circ}$, the largest among the conventional inflatable joints. Using the proposed mechanism for inflatable robots, we demonstrated moving a 500 g payload with a 3-DoF arm and lifting 3.4 kg and 5 kg payloads with 2-DoF and 1-DoF arms, respectively. We also experimented with a single 3-DoF inflatable leg attached to a dolly to show that the proposed structure worked for legged locomotion.

### [109] [FAR-AVIO: Fast and Robust Schur-Complement Based Acoustic-Visual-Inertial Fusion Odometry with Sensor Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20355)
*Hao Wei,Peiji Wang,Qianhao Wang,Tong Qin,Fei Gao,Yulin Si*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FAR-AVIO is an efficient acoustic-visual-inertial odometry framework for underwater robots that uses Schur complement in EKF for constant-time optimization with online sensor health monitoring and calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater environments degrade visual-inertial odometry due to poor visibility, marine snow, turbidity, and weak motions. While acoustic-visual-inertial fusion (with DVL) improves accuracy, graph-based optimization is computationally prohibitive for real-time deployment on resource-constrained underwater platforms.

Method: FAR-AVIO embeds Schur complement formulation into an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for tightly coupled acoustic-visual-inertial odometry, enabling joint pose-landmark optimization while marginalizing landmark states for constant-time updates. It includes AWARE (Adaptive Weight Adjustment and Reliability Evaluation) for online sensor health monitoring and adaptive sigma weight regulation, plus an efficient online calibration scheme for DVL-IMU extrinsics without dedicated maneuvers.

Result: Numerical simulations and real-world underwater experiments show FAR-AVIO outperforms state-of-the-art underwater SLAM baselines in both localization accuracy and computational efficiency, enabling robust operation on low-power embedded platforms.

Conclusion: FAR-AVIO provides an efficient, accurate solution for underwater visual-inertial odometry that addresses computational constraints while maintaining robustness through adaptive sensor health monitoring and online calibration, making it suitable for real-time deployment on resource-constrained underwater robots.

Abstract: Underwater environments impose severe challenges to visual-inertial odometry systems, as strong light attenuation, marine snow and turbidity, together with weakly exciting motions, degrade inertial observability and cause frequent tracking failures over long-term operation. While tightly coupled acoustic-visual-inertial fusion, typically implemented through an acoustic Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) integrated with visual-inertial measurements, can provide accurate state estimation, the associated graph-based optimization is often computationally prohibitive for real-time deployment on resource-constrained platforms. Here we present FAR-AVIO, a Schur-Complement based, tightly coupled acoustic-visual-inertial odometry framework tailored for underwater robots. FAR-AVIO embeds a Schur complement formulation into an Extended Kalman Filter(EKF), enabling joint pose-landmark optimization for accuracy while maintaining constant-time updates by efficiently marginalizing landmark states. On top of this backbone, we introduce Adaptive Weight Adjustment and Reliability Evaluation(AWARE), an online sensor health module that continuously assesses the reliability of visual, inertial and DVL measurements and adaptively regulates their sigma weights, and we develop an efficient online calibration scheme that jointly estimates DVL-IMU extrinsics, without dedicated calibration manoeuvres. Numerical simulations and real-world underwater experiments consistently show that FAR-AVIO outperforms state-of-the-art underwater SLAM baselines in both localization accuracy and computational efficiency, enabling robust operation on low-power embedded platforms. Our implementation has been released as open source software at https://far-vido.gitbook.io/far-vido-docs.

*Maulana Bisyir Azhari,Donghun Han,Je In You,Sungjun Park,David Hyunchul Shim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A2RL/DCL competition system for monocular vision-based autonomous drone racing that corrects VIO drift with YOLO gate detection and Kalman filtering, using perception-aware planning to balance speed with gate visibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The competition requires high-speed autonomous drone racing with minimal sensors (single camera + low-quality IMU), mirroring human pilots. This sensor limitation makes the system susceptible to VIO drift during aggressive maneuvers, necessitating robust drift correction methods.

Method: Corrects VIO drift by fusing VIO output with global position measurements from a YOLO-based gate detector using a Kalman filter. Implements a perception-aware planner that generates trajectories balancing speed with the need to keep gates visible for the perception system.

Result: Achieved competitive performance with podium finishes: 3rd place in AI Grand Challenge (43.2 km/h top speed), 2nd place in AI Drag Race (over 59 km/h), and 2nd place in AI Multi-Drone Race.

Conclusion: Presents a complete architecture for monocular vision-based autonomous drone flight that successfully addresses VIO drift through sensor fusion and perception-aware planning, providing insights for building competitive systems in similar constrained-sensor environments.

Abstract: The Abu Dhabi Autonomous Racing League(A2RL) x Drone Champions League competition(DCL) requires teams to perform high-speed autonomous drone racing using only a single camera and a low-quality inertial measurement unit -- a minimal sensor set that mirrors expert human drone racing pilots. This sensor limitation makes the system susceptible to drift from Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), particularly during long and fast flights with aggressive maneuvers. This paper presents the system developed for the championship, which achieved a competitive performance. Our approach corrected VIO drift by fusing its output with global position measurements derived from a YOLO-based gate detector using a Kalman filter. A perception-aware planner generated trajectories that balance speed with the need to keep gates visible for the perception system. The system demonstrated high performance, securing podium finishes across multiple categories: third place in the AI Grand Challenge with top speed of 43.2 km/h, second place in the AI Drag Race with over 59 km/h, and second place in the AI Multi-Drone Race. We detail the complete architecture and present a performance analysis based on experimental data from the competition, contributing our insights on building a successful system for monocular vision-based autonomous drone flight.

### [111] [LightTact: A Visual-Tactile Fingertip Sensor for Deformation-Independent Contact Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20591)
*Changyi Lin,Boda Huo,Mingyang Yu,Emily Ruppel,Bingqing Chen,Jonathan Francis,Ding Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LightTact is a visual-tactile sensor that detects contact via optics rather than deformation, enabling perception of light interactions with liquids and soft materials through high-contrast contact images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tactile sensors rely on surface deformation to detect contact, making them ineffective for perceiving light-contact interactions with liquids, semi-liquids, and ultra-soft materials where macroscopic deformation doesn't occur.

Method: Uses an ambient-blocking optical configuration that suppresses external light and internal illumination at non-contact regions, transmitting only diffuse light generated at true contacts, producing high-contrast raw images with near-black non-contact pixels.

Result: Achieves accurate pixel-level contact segmentation robust to material properties, contact force, surface appearance, and lighting; enables robotic manipulation of water spreading, facial-cream dipping, and thin-film interaction; and integrates with vision-language models for tasks like resistor value reasoning.

Conclusion: LightTact provides a deformation-independent optical approach to tactile sensing that enables robust perception of light-contact interactions and opens possibilities for vision-language model integration in robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Contact often occurs without macroscopic surface deformation, such as during interaction with liquids, semi-liquids, or ultra-soft materials. Most existing tactile sensors rely on deformation to infer contact, making such light-contact interactions difficult to perceive robustly. To address this, we present LightTact, a visual-tactile fingertip sensor that makes contact directly visible via a deformation-independent, optics-based principle. LightTact uses an ambient-blocking optical configuration that suppresses both external light and internal illumination at non-contact regions, while transmitting only the diffuse light generated at true contacts. As a result, LightTact produces high-contrast raw images in which non-contact pixels remain near-black (mean gray value < 3) and contact pixels preserve the natural appearance of the contacting surface. Built on this, LightTact achieves accurate pixel-level contact segmentation that is robust to material properties, contact force, surface appearance, and environmental lighting. We further integrate LightTact on a robotic arm and demonstrate manipulation behaviors driven by extremely light contact, including water spreading, facial-cream dipping, and thin-film interaction. Finally, we show that LightTact's spatially aligned visual-tactile images can be directly interpreted by existing vision-language models, enabling resistor value reasoning for robotic sorting.
