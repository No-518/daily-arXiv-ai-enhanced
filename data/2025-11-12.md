*Hari Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TbVAD is a language-driven framework for weakly supervised video anomaly detection that performs detection and explanation entirely in the textual domain using vision-language models and structured knowledge reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an interpretable and knowledge-grounded video anomaly detection system that moves beyond conventional visual feature-based approaches by leveraging language representations for better explainability.

Method: Three-stage framework: (1) transform video content into fine-grained captions using vision-language model, (2) organize captions into four semantic slots (action, object, context, environment), (3) generate slot-wise explanations identifying which semantic factors contribute most to anomaly decisions.

Result: Evaluated on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence benchmarks, demonstrating that textual knowledge reasoning provides interpretable and reliable anomaly detection for real-world surveillance scenarios.

Conclusion: Text-based reasoning enables interpretable video anomaly detection with structured knowledge organization, offering a promising approach for explainable surveillance systems.

Abstract: We introduce Text-based Explainable Video Anomaly Detection (TbVAD), a language-driven framework for weakly supervised video anomaly detection that performs anomaly detection and explanation entirely within the textual domain. Unlike conventional WSVAD models that rely on explicit visual features, TbVAD represents video semantics through language, enabling interpretable and knowledge-grounded reasoning. The framework operates in three stages: (1) transforming video content into fine-grained captions using a vision-language model, (2) constructing structured knowledge by organizing the captions into four semantic slots (action, object, context, environment), and (3) generating slot-wise explanations that reveal which semantic factors contribute most to the anomaly decision. We evaluate TbVAD on two public benchmarks, UCF-Crime and XD-Violence, demonstrating that textual knowledge reasoning provides interpretable and reliable anomaly detection for real-world surveillance scenarios.

*Joe Kileel,Oscar Mickelin,Amit Singer,Sheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoDM, a data fusion framework that reconstructs molecular structures from cryo-EM using second-order moments of projection images under different orientation distributions, enabling accurate recovery with only second-order statistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage dataset diversity in cryo-EM by using multiple datasets under different experimental conditions to enhance reconstruction quality, addressing the challenge of reconstructing 3D molecular structures from noisy projection images.

Method: Method of double moments (MoDM) framework that fuses data from two instances of second-order moments - one with uniform orientation distribution and another with unknown non-uniform distribution, using convex-relaxation-based algorithm.

Result: The method generically uniquely determines molecular structures (up to global rotation/reflection) and achieves accurate recovery using only second-order statistics, demonstrating improved reconstruction quality through dataset diversity.

Conclusion: Collecting and modeling multiple datasets under different experimental conditions can substantially enhance reconstruction quality in computational imaging, with MoDM providing an effective framework for leveraging dataset diversity in cryo-EM.

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a powerful imaging technique for reconstructing three-dimensional molecular structures from noisy tomographic projection images of randomly oriented particles. We introduce a new data fusion framework, termed the method of double moments (MoDM), which reconstructs molecular structures from two instances of the second-order moment of projection images obtained under distinct orientation distributions--one uniform, the other non-uniform and unknown. We prove that these moments generically uniquely determine the underlying structure, up to a global rotation and reflection, and we develop a convex-relaxation-based algorithm that achieves accurate recovery using only second-order statistics. Our results demonstrate the advantage of collecting and modeling multiple datasets under different experimental conditions, illustrating that leveraging dataset diversity can substantially enhance reconstruction quality in computational imaging tasks.

### [3] [Modulo Video Recovery via Selective Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07479)
*Tianyu Geng,Feng Ji,Wee Peng Tay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSViT is a novel Transformer-based framework for modulo video recovery that uses selective token processing to efficiently reconstruct high-quality HDR videos from 8-bit folded inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional image sensors have limited dynamic range causing saturation in HDR scenes. Modulo cameras fold irradiance into bounded range but require specialized unwrapping algorithms. Existing HDR methods are unsuitable for modulo recovery, and deep learning approaches have been slow to advance in this area.

Method: SSViT (Selective Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer) uses a token selection strategy to improve efficiency and focus on critical regions. It captures global dependencies and spatial-temporal relationships crucial for resolving folded video frames.

Result: SSViT produces high-quality reconstructions from 8-bit folded videos and achieves state-of-the-art performance in modulo video recovery.

Conclusion: SSViT is the first successful deep learning framework for modulo video reconstruction, demonstrating that Transformers with selective token processing can effectively solve the modulo recovery problem.

Abstract: Conventional image sensors have limited dynamic range, causing saturation in high-dynamic-range (HDR) scenes. Modulo cameras address this by folding incident irradiance into a bounded range, yet require specialized unwrapping algorithms to reconstruct the underlying signal. Unlike HDR recovery, which extends dynamic range from conventional sampling, modulo recovery restores actual values from folded samples. Despite being introduced over a decade ago, progress in modulo image recovery has been slow, especially in the use of modern deep learning techniques. In this work, we demonstrate that standard HDR methods are unsuitable for modulo recovery. Transformers, however, can capture global dependencies and spatial-temporal relationships crucial for resolving folded video frames. Still, adapting existing Transformer architectures for modulo recovery demands novel techniques. To this end, we present Selective Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer (SSViT), the first deep learning framework for modulo video reconstruction. SSViT employs a token selection strategy to improve efficiency and concentrate on the most critical regions. Experiments confirm that SSViT produces high-quality reconstructions from 8-bit folded videos and achieves state-of-the-art performance in modulo video recovery.

### [4] [Laplacian Score Sharpening for Mitigating Hallucination in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07496)
*Barath Chandran. C,Srinivas Anumasa,Dianbo Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a post-hoc adjustment using Laplacian of score function to reduce hallucinations in diffusion models, with efficient approximation for high dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models suffer from hallucinations due to mode interpolation and score smoothening, but existing methods lack prevention during sampling.

Method: Post-hoc adjustment to score function using Laplacian (sharpness) with efficient approximation via finite-difference Hutchinson trace estimator for high dimensions.

Result: Significantly reduces hallucinated samples across 1D/2D distributions and high-dimensional image datasets.

Conclusion: Laplacian-based correction effectively reduces mode interpolation hallucinations and shows relationship between Laplacian and score uncertainty.

Abstract: Diffusion models, though successful, are known to suffer from hallucinations that create incoherent or unrealistic samples. Recent works have attributed this to the phenomenon of mode interpolation and score smoothening, but they lack a method to prevent their generation during sampling. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc adjustment to the score function during inference that leverages the Laplacian (or sharpness) of the score to reduce mode interpolation hallucination in unconditional diffusion models across 1D, 2D, and high-dimensional image data. We derive an efficient Laplacian approximation for higher dimensions using a finite-difference variant of the Hutchinson trace estimator. We show that this correction significantly reduces the rate of hallucinated samples across toy 1D/2D distributions and a high- dimensional image dataset. Furthermore, our analysis explores the relationship between the Laplacian and uncertainty in the score.

### [5] [Toward the Frontiers of Reliable Diffusion Sampling via Adversarial Sinkhorn Attention Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07499)
*Kwanyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASAG is a novel guidance method for diffusion models that uses optimal transport theory to adversarially disrupt attention mechanisms, improving sample quality without model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing guidance methods like CFG rely on heuristic perturbation functions without principled foundations, limiting their effectiveness and requiring manual design.

Method: ASAG injects adversarial cost within self-attention layers using Sinkhorn algorithm to reduce pixel-wise similarity between queries and keys, deliberately weakening misleading attention alignments.

Result: ASAG shows consistent improvements in text-to-image diffusion, enhances controllability and fidelity in downstream applications like IP-Adapter and ControlNet, and improves reliability.

Conclusion: The method provides a principled, lightweight, plug-and-play approach to diffusion guidance that improves sample quality without requiring model retraining.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong generative performance when using guidance methods such as classifier-free guidance (CFG), which enhance output quality by modifying the sampling trajectory. These methods typically improve a target output by intentionally degrading another, often the unconditional output, using heuristic perturbation functions such as identity mixing or blurred conditions. However, these approaches lack a principled foundation and rely on manually designed distortions. In this work, we propose Adversarial Sinkhorn Attention Guidance (ASAG), a novel method that reinterprets attention scores in diffusion models through the lens of optimal transport and intentionally disrupt the transport cost via Sinkhorn algorithm. Instead of naively corrupting the attention mechanism, ASAG injects an adversarial cost within self-attention layers to reduce pixel-wise similarity between queries and keys. This deliberate degradation weakens misleading attention alignments and leads to improved conditional and unconditional sample quality. ASAG shows consistent improvements in text-to-image diffusion, and enhances controllability and fidelity in downstream applications such as IP-Adapter and ControlNet. The method is lightweight, plug-and-play, and improves reliability without requiring any model retraining.

### [7] [TrackStudio: An Integrated Toolkit for Markerless Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07624)
*Hristo Dimitrov,Giulia Dominijanni,Viktorija Pavalkyte,Tamar R. Makin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrackStudio is a GUI-based markerless motion tracking toolkit that combines open-source tools into an accessible pipeline requiring no programming skills, validated with high accuracy across diverse conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a gap in accessible, integrated solutions for markerless motion tracking that non-experts can use across diverse settings without requiring substantial technical expertise.

Method: Combined established open-source tools into a single modular GUI pipeline with automatic 2D/3D tracking, calibration, preprocessing, feature extraction, and visualization. Tested across three environments using both low-cost webcams and high-resolution cameras.

Result: Across 76 participants, average inter-frame correlations exceeded 0.98 and average triangulation errors remained low (<13.6mm for hand tracking), demonstrating stable and consistent tracking. The pipeline can be extended to other body and face regions.

Conclusion: TrackStudio provides a practical, accessible route into markerless tracking for researchers or laypeople who need reliable performance without specialist expertise.

Abstract: Markerless motion tracking has advanced rapidly in the past 10 years and currently offers powerful opportunities for behavioural, clinical, and biomechanical research. While several specialised toolkits provide high performance for specific tasks, using existing tools still requires substantial technical expertise. There remains a gap in accessible, integrated solutions that deliver sufficient tracking for non-experts across diverse settings.
  TrackStudio was developed to address this gap by combining established open-source tools into a single, modular, GUI-based pipeline that works out of the box. It provides automatic 2D and 3D tracking, calibration, preprocessing, feature extraction, and visualisation without requiring any programming skills. We supply a user guide with practical advice for video acquisition, synchronisation, and setup, alongside documentation of common pitfalls and how to avoid them.
  To validate the toolkit, we tested its performance across three environments using either low-cost webcams or high-resolution cameras, including challenging conditions for body position, lightning, and space and obstructions. Across 76 participants, average inter-frame correlations exceeded 0.98 and average triangulation errors remained low (<13.6mm for hand tracking), demonstrating stable and consistent tracking. We further show that the same pipeline can be extended beyond hand tracking to other body and face regions. TrackStudio provides a practical, accessible route into markerless tracking for researchers or laypeople who need reliable performance without specialist expertise.

### [8] [Predicting Coronary Artery Calcium Severity based on Non-Contrast Cardiac CT images using Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07695)
*Lachlan Nguyen,Aidan Cousins,Arcot Sowmya,Hugh Dixson,Sonit Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning CNN model achieves 96.5% accuracy in classifying coronary artery calcium scores into six clinical categories from cardiac CT scans, showing high agreement with current semiautomatic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current coronary artery calcium scoring requires time-intensive semiautomatic analysis by radiologists. There's a need for automated methods to improve efficiency in cardiovascular disease risk stratification.

Method: Developed a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) model using 68 patient cardiac CT scans with semiautomatic calcium scores as reference labels. Dataset was divided into training, validation and test sets for model development and evaluation.

Result: Model achieved 96.5% overall accuracy and Cohen's kappa of 0.962 on six-class CAC scoring task. Misclassified 32 cases with tendency to overestimate CAC in 26/32 misclassifications. Demonstrated high generalizability to test data.

Conclusion: The CNN model provides accurate and consistent calcium score classification comparable to current semiautomatic practice, demonstrating viability for automated CAC scoring across expanded clinical categories.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease causes high rates of mortality worldwide. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring is a powerful tool to stratify the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Current scoring practices require time-intensive semiautomatic analysis of cardiac computed tomography by radiologists and trained radiographers. The purpose of this study is to develop a deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNN) model to classify the calcium score in cardiac, non-contrast computed tomography images into one of six clinical categories. A total of 68 patient scans were retrospectively obtained together with their respective reported semiautomatic calcium score using an ECG-gated GE Discovery 570 Cardiac SPECT/CT camera. The dataset was divided into training, validation and test sets. Using the semiautomatic CAC score as the reference label, the model demonstrated high performance on a six-class CAC scoring categorisation task. Of the scans analysed, the model misclassified 32 cases, tending towards overestimating the CAC in 26 out of 32 misclassifications. Overall, the model showed high agreement (Cohen's kappa of 0.962), an overall accuracy of 96.5% and high generalisability. The results suggest that the model outputs were accurate and consistent with current semiautomatic practice, with good generalisability to test data. The model demonstrates the viability of a CNN model to stratify the calcium score into an expanded set of six clinical categories.

### [9] [FlowFeat: Pixel-Dense Embedding of Motion Profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07696)
*Nikita Araslanov,Anna Sonnweber,Daniel Cremers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowFeat is a high-resolution multi-task feature representation that uses motion profile distillation from optical flow networks to enhance spatial detail and temporal consistency for dense prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art networks like transformers produce low-resolution feature grids that are suboptimal for dense prediction tasks, limiting their effectiveness in computer vision applications.

Method: Developed FlowFeat using a novel distillation technique that embeds apparent motion distributions (motion profiles) by leveraging optical flow networks and diverse video data through self-supervised training framework.

Result: FlowFeat significantly enhances representational power of five state-of-the-art encoders across three dense tasks (video object segmentation, monocular depth estimation, semantic segmentation), is computationally inexpensive, and robust to inaccurate flow estimation.

Conclusion: FlowFeat advances reliable and versatile dense image representations by providing high spatial detail with temporal consistency through motion-aware feature learning.

Abstract: Dense and versatile image representations underpin the success of virtually all computer vision applications. However, state-of-the-art networks, such as transformers, produce low-resolution feature grids, which are suboptimal for dense prediction tasks. To address this limitation, we present FlowFeat, a high-resolution and multi-task feature representation. The key ingredient behind FlowFeat is a novel distillation technique that embeds a distribution of plausible apparent motions, or motion profiles. By leveraging optical flow networks and diverse video data, we develop an effective self-supervised training framework that statistically approximates the apparent motion. With its remarkable level of spatial detail, FlowFeat encodes a compelling degree of geometric and semantic cues while exhibiting high temporal consistency. Empirically, FlowFeat significantly enhances the representational power of five state-of-the-art encoders and alternative upsampling strategies across three dense tasks: video object segmentation, monocular depth estimation and semantic segmentation. Training FlowFeat is computationally inexpensive and robust to inaccurate flow estimation, remaining highly effective even when using unsupervised flow networks. Our work takes a step forward towards reliable and versatile dense image representations.

### [10] [Cross Modal Fine-grained Alignment via Granularity-aware and Region-uncertain Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07710)
*Jiale Liu,Haoming Zhou,Yishu Zhu,Bingzhi Chen,Yuncheng Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified approach for fine-grained image-text alignment that incorporates significance-aware modeling and region-level uncertainty modeling to address limitations in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches lack robust intra-modal mechanisms to assess token significance and fail to model fine-grained uncertainty in region-word correspondences, leading to poor generalization in complex scenes.

Method: Proposes significance-aware and granularity-aware modeling with modality-specific biases to identify salient features, and represents region features as a mixture of Gaussian distributions to capture fine-grained uncertainty.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Flickr30K and MS-COCO datasets across various backbone architectures, with enhanced robustness and interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed unified approach effectively addresses fundamental limitations in fine-grained image-text alignment by incorporating significance-aware modeling and uncertainty modeling, leading to improved performance and generalization.

Abstract: Fine-grained image-text alignment is a pivotal challenge in multimodal learning, underpinning key applications such as visual question answering, image captioning, and vision-language navigation. Unlike global alignment, fine-grained alignment requires precise correspondence between localized visual regions and textual tokens, often hindered by noisy attention mechanisms and oversimplified modeling of cross-modal relationships. In this work, we identify two fundamental limitations of existing approaches: the lack of robust intra-modal mechanisms to assess the significance of visual and textual tokens, leading to poor generalization in complex scenes; and the absence of fine-grained uncertainty modeling, which fails to capture the one-to-many and many-to-one nature of region-word correspondences. To address these issues, we propose a unified approach that incorporates significance-aware and granularity-aware modeling and region-level uncertainty modeling. Our method leverages modality-specific biases to identify salient features without relying on brittle cross-modal attention, and represents region features as a mixture of Gaussian distributions to capture fine-grained uncertainty. Extensive experiments on Flickr30K and MS-COCO demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across various backbone architectures, significantly enhancing the robustness and interpretability of fine-grained image-text alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior text- or layout-conditioned models lack dense cross-modal correspondences between imagery and semantic vector geometry, limiting fine-grained spatial editing capabilities for satellite imagery.

Method: Uses a vision language alignment module to produce pixel-level embeddings from polygon semantics, which guide a conditional image generation framework to respect both spatial extents and semantic cues.

Result: Shows strong improvements over prior methods in semantic fidelity and structural realism, with the trained vision language model demonstrating fine-grained spatial grounding.

Conclusion: VectorSynth enables interactive workflows for rapid what-if simulations, spatial edits, and map-informed content generation in satellite imagery applications.

Abstract: We introduce VectorSynth, a diffusion-based framework for pixel-accurate satellite image synthesis conditioned on polygonal geographic annotations with semantic attributes. Unlike prior text- or layout-conditioned models, VectorSynth learns dense cross-modal correspondences that align imagery and semantic vector geometry, enabling fine-grained, spatially grounded edits. A vision language alignment module produces pixel-level embeddings from polygon semantics; these embeddings guide a conditional image generation framework to respect both spatial extents and semantic cues. VectorSynth supports interactive workflows that mix language prompts with geometry-aware conditioning, allowing rapid what-if simulations, spatial edits, and map-informed content generation. For training and evaluation, we assemble a collection of satellite scenes paired with pixel-registered polygon annotations spanning diverse urban scenes with both built and natural features. We observe strong improvements over prior methods in semantic fidelity and structural realism, and show that our trained vision language model demonstrates fine-grained spatial grounding.

### [14] [Class Incremental Medical Image Segmentation via Prototype-Guided Calibration and Dual-Aligned Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07749)
*Shengqian Zhu,Chengrong Yu,Qiang Wang,Ying Song,Guangjun Li,Jiafei Wu,Xiaogang Xu,Zhang Yi,Junjie Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes PGCD and DAPD methods for class incremental medical image segmentation to better preserve old knowledge while learning new classes, addressing limitations in existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either use one-size-fits-all strategies that treat all regions equally, hindering old knowledge preservation, or focus only on global prototype alignment while ignoring local representations in new data, causing knowledge degradation.

Method: Proposes Prototype-Guided Calibration Distillation (PGCD) which uses prototype-to-feature similarity to calibrate class-specific distillation intensity, and Dual-Aligned Prototype Distillation (DAPD) which aligns local prototypes with both global and local prototypes.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on two multi-organ segmentation benchmarks show the method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating robustness and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed PGCD and DAPD methods effectively address knowledge degradation in class incremental medical image segmentation by providing calibrated distillation and dual-aligned prototype learning.

Abstract: Class incremental medical image segmentation (CIMIS) aims to preserve knowledge of previously learned classes while learning new ones without relying on old-class labels. However, existing methods 1) either adopt one-size-fits-all strategies that treat all spatial regions and feature channels equally, which may hinder the preservation of accurate old knowledge, 2) or focus solely on aligning local prototypes with global ones for old classes while overlooking their local representations in new data, leading to knowledge degradation. To mitigate the above issues, we propose Prototype-Guided Calibration Distillation (PGCD) and Dual-Aligned Prototype Distillation (DAPD) for CIMIS in this paper. Specifically, PGCD exploits prototype-to-feature similarity to calibrate class-specific distillation intensity in different spatial regions, effectively reinforcing reliable old knowledge and suppressing misleading information from old classes. Complementarily, DAPD aligns the local prototypes of old classes extracted from the current model with both global prototypes and local prototypes, further enhancing segmentation performance on old categories. Comprehensive evaluations on two widely used multi-organ segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its robustness and generalization capabilities.

### [15] [Filtered-ViT: A Robust Defense Against Multiple Adversarial Patch Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07755)
*Aja Khanal,Ahmed Faid,Apurva Narayan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Filtered-ViT is a vision transformer with adaptive filtering that defends against multiple adversarial patches while maintaining performance on clean images and real-world artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses fail against multiple adversarial patches, which are common in real-world scenarios and safety-critical domains like healthcare.

Method: Integrates SMART Vector Median Filtering (SMART-VMF) - a spatially adaptive, multi-scale mechanism that selectively suppresses corrupted regions while preserving semantic details.

Result: Achieves 79.8% clean accuracy and 46.3% robust accuracy on ImageNet with four simultaneous 1% patches, outperforming existing defenses. Also effective on real medical imagery with natural artifacts.

Conclusion: First transformer demonstrating unified robustness against both adversarial and natural patch-like disruptions, enabling reliable vision systems in high-stakes environments.

Abstract: Deep learning vision systems are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains such as healthcare, yet they remain vulnerable to small adversarial patches that can trigger misclassifications. Most existing defenses assume a single patch and fail when multiple localized disruptions occur, the type of scenario adversaries and real-world artifacts often exploit. We propose Filtered-ViT, a new vision transformer architecture that integrates SMART Vector Median Filtering (SMART-VMF), a spatially adaptive, multi-scale, robustness-aware mechanism that enables selective suppression of corrupted regions while preserving semantic detail. On ImageNet with LaVAN multi-patch attacks, Filtered-ViT achieves 79.8% clean accuracy and 46.3% robust accuracy under four simultaneous 1\% patches, outperforming existing defenses. Beyond synthetic benchmarks, a real-world case study on radiographic medical imagery shows that Filtered-ViT mitigates natural artifacts such as occlusions and scanner noise without degrading diagnostic content. This establishes Filtered-ViT as the first transformer to demonstrate unified robustness against both adversarial and naturally occurring patch-like disruptions, charting a path toward reliable vision systems in truly high-stakes environments.

### [16] [Beyond Randomness: Understand the Order of the Noise in Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07756)
*Song Yan,Min Li,Bi Xinliang,Jian Yang,Yusen Zhang,Guanye Xiong,Yunwei Lan,Tao Zhang,Wei Zhai,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reveals that initial noise in text-to-content diffusion models contains analyzable semantic patterns, not just randomness, and proposes a training-free "Semantic Erasure-Injection" method to modulate noise for better generation control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the conventional view that initial noise in diffusion models is purely random, and demonstrate that noise actually contains rich semantic information that can be analyzed and manipulated.

Method: A two-step training-free process: 1) Semantic Erasure - remove unwanted semantics from noise using information theory principles, 2) Semantic Injection - leverage the equivalence between diffusion generation and semantic injection to add desired semantics to the cleaned noise.

Result: The method is consistently effective across various text-to-content models based on both DiT and UNet architectures, enabling better control over generation consistency.

Conclusion: Provides a novel perspective for optimizing diffusion model generation and offers a universal tool for consistent content generation by revealing and leveraging the semantic patterns hidden in initial noise.

Abstract: In text-driven content generation (T2C) diffusion model, semantic of generated content is mostly attributed to the process of text embedding and attention mechanism interaction. The initial noise of the generation process is typically characterized as a random element that contributes to the diversity of the generated content. Contrary to this view, this paper reveals that beneath the random surface of noise lies strong analyzable patterns. Specifically, this paper first conducts a comprehensive analysis of the impact of random noise on the model's generation. We found that noise not only contains rich semantic information, but also allows for the erasure of unwanted semantics from it in an extremely simple way based on information theory, and using the equivalence between the generation process of diffusion model and semantic injection to inject semantics into the cleaned noise. Then, we mathematically decipher these observations and propose a simple but efficient training-free and universal two-step "Semantic Erasure-Injection" process to modulate the initial noise in T2C diffusion model. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is consistently effective across various T2C models based on both DiT and UNet architectures and presents a novel perspective for optimizing the generation of diffusion model, providing a universal tool for consistent generation.

*Likang Peng,Chao Su,Wenyuan Wu,Yuan Sun,Dezhong Peng,Xi Peng,Xu Wang*

TL;DR: SCBCH is a cross-modal hashing framework that addresses label noise and semantic overlap issues in multi-label datasets through semantic-consistent classification and bidirectional soft contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-modal hashing methods rely on fully annotated datasets and are vulnerable to label noise in real-world multi-label scenarios, while also ignoring partial semantic overlaps that limit robustness.

Method: Proposes two modules: Cross-modal Semantic-Consistent Classification (CSCC) to estimate sample reliability and reduce noisy label impact, and Bidirectional Soft Contrastive Hashing (BSCH) for adaptive contrastive learning based on semantic overlap.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmarks show SCBCH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under noisy multi-label conditions, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: SCBCH effectively handles label noise and semantic overlap in cross-modal retrieval, providing a robust solution for real-world multi-label scenarios with noisy annotations.

Abstract: Cross-modal hashing (CMH) facilitates efficient retrieval across different modalities (e.g., image and text) by encoding data into compact binary representations. While recent methods have achieved remarkable performance, they often rely heavily on fully annotated datasets, which are costly and labor-intensive to obtain. In real-world scenarios, particularly in multi-label datasets, label noise is prevalent and severely degrades retrieval performance. Moreover, existing CMH approaches typically overlook the partial semantic overlaps inherent in multi-label data, limiting their robustness and generalization. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework named Semantic-Consistent Bidirectional Contrastive Hashing (SCBCH). The framework comprises two complementary modules: (1) Cross-modal Semantic-Consistent Classification (CSCC), which leverages cross-modal semantic consistency to estimate sample reliability and reduce the impact of noisy labels; (2) Bidirectional Soft Contrastive Hashing (BSCH), which dynamically generates soft contrastive sample pairs based on multi-label semantic overlap, enabling adaptive contrastive learning between semantically similar and dissimilar samples across modalities. Extensive experiments on four widely-used cross-modal retrieval benchmarks validate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art approaches under noisy multi-label conditions.

*Runmin Cong,Anpeng Wang,Bin Wan,Cong Zhang,Xiaofei Zhou,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCDNet addresses cross-domain few-shot segmentation by decoupling entangled features into category-relevant private and domain-relevant shared representations using adversarial-contrastive learning, then dynamically fusing them while maintaining structural coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Encoder features often entangle domain-relevant and category-relevant information, limiting both generalization and rapid adaptation to new domains in cross-domain few-shot segmentation.

Method: Proposes DCDNet with three modules: Adversarial-Contrastive Feature Decomposition (ACFD) for feature decoupling, Matrix-Guided Dynamic Fusion (MGDF) for adaptive feature integration, and Cross-Adaptive Modulation (CAM) for enhanced generalization during fine-tuning.

Result: Extensive experiments on four challenging datasets show DCDNet outperforms existing CD-FSS methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for cross-domain generalization and few-shot adaptation.

Conclusion: DCDNet effectively addresses feature entanglement in cross-domain few-shot segmentation through decoupled feature representations and adaptive fusion, achieving superior performance across multiple domains.

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) aims to tackle the dual challenge of recognizing novel classes and adapting to unseen domains with limited annotations. However, encoder features often entangle domain-relevant and category-relevant information, limiting both generalization and rapid adaptation to new domains. To address this issue, we propose a Divide-and-Conquer Decoupled Network (DCDNet). In the training stage, to tackle feature entanglement that impedes cross-domain generalization and rapid adaptation, we propose the Adversarial-Contrastive Feature Decomposition (ACFD) module. It decouples backbone features into category-relevant private and domain-relevant shared representations via contrastive learning and adversarial learning. Then, to mitigate the potential degradation caused by the disentanglement, the Matrix-Guided Dynamic Fusion (MGDF) module adaptively integrates base, shared, and private features under spatial guidance, maintaining structural coherence. In addition, in the fine-tuning stage, to enhanced model generalization, the Cross-Adaptive Modulation (CAM) module is placed before the MGDF, where shared features guide private features via modulation ensuring effective integration of domain-relevant information. Extensive experiments on four challenging datasets show that DCDNet outperforms existing CD-FSS methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for cross-domain generalization and few-shot adaptation.

TL;DR: A robust pipeline for multilabel chest X-ray classification using SE-ResNeXt101 with Label-Graph Refinement module that learns inter-label relationships to improve performance with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a practical and reproducible method for multilabel chest X-ray classification that addresses challenges like extreme class imbalance, asymmetric error costs, and label co-occurrence patterns.

Method: Fine-tuned SE-ResNeXt101 backbone with sigmoid head, trained using Multilabel Iterative Stratification for cross-validation. Uses Asymmetric Loss, mixed-precision training, cosine learning-rate decay, gradient clipping, and EMA. Key innovation is a lightweight Label-Graph Refinement module that learns sparse inter-label coupling matrix for logit refinement via message passing.

Result: Strong baseline achieves 92.64% macro AUC. Label-Graph Refinement consistently improves validation macro AUC across folds with negligible computational cost. Method maintains competitive performance while being hardware-friendly.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline offers a practical, reproducible approach for multilabel CXR classification that requires no extra annotations and provides consistent performance improvements through label relationship modeling.

Abstract: We study multilabel classification of chest X-rays and present a simple, strong pipeline built on SE-ResNeXt101 $(32 \times 4d)$. The backbone is finetuned for 14 thoracic findings with a sigmoid head, trained using Multilabel Iterative Stratification (MIS) for robust cross-validation splits that preserve label co-occurrence. To address extreme class imbalance and asymmetric error costs, we optimize with Asymmetric Loss, employ mixed-precision (AMP), cosine learning-rate decay with warm-up, gradient clipping, and an exponential moving average (EMA) of weights. We propose a lightweight Label-Graph Refinement module placed after the classifier: given per-label probabilities, it learns a sparse, trainable inter-label coupling matrix that refines logits via a single message-passing step while adding only an L1-regularized parameter head. At inference, we apply horizontal flip test-time augmentation (TTA) and average predictions across MIS folds (a compact deep ensemble). Evaluation uses macro AUC averaging classwise ROC-AUC and skipping single-class labels in a fold to reflect balanced performance across conditions. On our dataset, a strong SE-ResNeXt101 baseline attains competitive macro AUC (e.g., 92.64% in our runs). Adding the Label-Graph Refinement consistently improves validation macro AUC across folds with negligible compute. The resulting method is reproducible, hardware-friendly, and requires no extra annotations, offering a practical route to stronger multilabel CXR classifiers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PC-Diffusion is a lightweight framework that uses a trainable Preference Classifier to align diffusion models with human preferences, eliminating the need for full model fine-tuning and reference models while achieving comparable results to DPO at much lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DPO methods for diffusion models suffer from high computational costs due to full model fine-tuning and sensitivity to reference model quality, which introduces instability and bias.

Method: Proposes a lightweight Preference Classifier that directly models relative preferences between samples, decoupling preference alignment from the generative model. This eliminates full model fine-tuning and reference model reliance.

Result: PC-Diffusion achieves comparable preference consistency to DPO while significantly reducing training costs and enabling efficient, stable preference-guided generation.

Conclusion: PC-Diffusion provides an effective alternative to DPO for human preference alignment in diffusion models, offering theoretical guarantees and practical efficiency advantages.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in conditional image generation, yet their outputs often remain misaligned with human preferences. To address this, recent work has applied Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to diffusion models, yielding significant improvements.~However, DPO-like methods exhibit two key limitations: 1) High computational cost,due to the entire model fine-tuning; 2) Sensitivity to reference model quality}, due to its tendency to introduce instability and bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework for human preference alignment in diffusion models (PC-Diffusion), using a lightweight, trainable Preference Classifier that directly models the relative preference between samples. By restricting preference learning to this classifier, PC-Diffusion decouples preference alignment from the generative model, eliminating the need for entire model fine-tuning and reference model reliance.~We further provide theoretical guarantees for PC-Diffusion:1) PC-Diffusion ensures that the preference-guided distributions are consistently propagated across timesteps. 2)The training objective of the preference classifier is equivalent to DPO, but does not require a reference model.3) The proposed preference-guided correction can progressively steer generation toward preference-aligned regions.~Empirical results show that PC-Diffusion achieves comparable preference consistency to DPO while significantly reducing training costs and enabling efficient and stable preference-guided generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SAR land-cover classification methods rely heavily on supervised learning with extensive labeled datasets, limiting scalability, generalization, and adaptability to diverse applications.

Method: Proposed DI3CL pre-training framework with Dynamic Instance module for global contextual awareness and Contour Consistency module for structural discrimination, trained on SARSense dataset of 460,532 SAR images.

Result: Extensive experiments across SAR land-cover mapping, water body detection, and road extraction tasks consistently demonstrate that DI3CL outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: The developed foundation model serves as a robust cornerstone for accelerating downstream SAR land-cover classification models, with publicly available code and pre-trained weights.

Abstract: Although significant advances have been achieved in SAR land-cover classification, recent methods remain predominantly focused on supervised learning, which relies heavily on extensive labeled datasets. This dependency not only limits scalability and generalization but also restricts adaptability to diverse application scenarios. In this paper, a general-purpose foundation model for SAR land-cover classification is developed, serving as a robust cornerstone to accelerate the development and deployment of various downstream models. Specifically, a Dynamic Instance and Contour Consistency Contrastive Learning (DI3CL) pre-training framework is presented, which incorporates a Dynamic Instance (DI) module and a Contour Consistency (CC) module. DI module enhances global contextual awareness by enforcing local consistency across different views of the same region. CC module leverages shallow feature maps to guide the model to focus on the geometric contours of SAR land-cover objects, thereby improving structural discrimination. Additionally, to enhance robustness and generalization during pre-training, a large-scale and diverse dataset named SARSense, comprising 460,532 SAR images, is constructed to enable the model to capture comprehensive and representative features. To evaluate the generalization capability of our foundation model, we conducted extensive experiments across a variety of SAR land-cover classification tasks, including SAR land-cover mapping, water body detection, and road extraction. The results consistently demonstrate that the proposed DI3CL outperforms existing methods. Our code and pre-trained weights are publicly available at: https://github.com/SARpre-train/DI3CL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inherent mismatch between discrete token outputs of MLLMs and continuous quality scores in IQA tasks causes performance degradation, and previous conversion methods suffer from errors and semantic confusion from level tokens.

Method: Proposes Q-Scorer framework with a lightweight regression module and IQA-specific score tokens integrated into the MLLM pipeline, based on theoretical analysis of previous approaches' errors.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple IQA benchmarks, demonstrates strong generalization to mixed datasets, and shows further improvement when combined with other methods.

Conclusion: Q-Scorer effectively bridges the gap between MLLM discrete outputs and IQA continuous requirements, enhancing performance while maintaining MLLM capabilities for related tasks.

Abstract: The rapid progress of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has boosted the task of image quality assessment (IQA). However, a key challenge arises from the inherent mismatch between the discrete token outputs of MLLMs and the continuous nature of quality scores required by IQA tasks. This discrepancy significantly hinders the performance of MLLM-based IQA methods. Previous approaches that convert discrete token predictions into continuous scores often suffer from conversion errors. Moreover, the semantic confusion introduced by level tokens (e.g., ``good'') further constrains the performance of MLLMs on IQA tasks and degrades their original capabilities for related tasks. To tackle these problems, we provide a theoretical analysis of the errors inherent in previous approaches and, motivated by this analysis, propose a simple yet effective framework, Q-Scorer. This framework incorporates a lightweight regression module and IQA-specific score tokens into the MLLM pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Scorer achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple IQA benchmarks, generalizes well to mixed datasets, and further improves when combined with other methods.

Conclusion: Sparse3DPR demonstrates superior accuracy, efficiency, and generalization capabilities for open-ended 3D scene understanding without requiring training.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been explored widely for 3D scene understanding. Among them, training-free approaches are gaining attention for their flexibility and generalization over training-based methods. However, they typically struggle with accuracy and efficiency in practical deployment. To address the problems, we propose Sparse3DPR, a novel training-free framework for open-ended scene understanding, which leverages the reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs and requires only sparse-view RGB inputs. Specifically, we introduce a hierarchical plane-enhanced scene graph that supports open vocabulary and adopts dominant planar structures as spatial anchors, which enables clearer reasoning chains and more reliable high-level inferences. Furthermore, we design a task-adaptive subgraph extraction method to filter query-irrelevant information dynamically, reducing contextual noise and improving 3D scene reasoning efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of Sparse3DPR, which achieves a 28.7% EM@1 improvement and a 78.2% speedup compared with ConceptGraphs on the Space3D-Bench. Moreover, Sparse3DPR obtains comparable performance to training-based methods on ScanQA, with additional real-world experiments confirming its robustness and generalization capability.

Motivation: Current deep learning approaches for prostate cancer lesion segmentation achieve limited performance (Dice scores ≤0.32), necessitating better imaging techniques.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation across six state-of-the-art segmentation architectures using 200 patients with co-registered CDI^s, DWI, and ADC sequences.

Result: CDI^s integration enhances or preserves segmentation performance in 94% of configurations, with individual architectures achieving up to 72.5% relative improvement. CDI^s + DWI combination shows significant improvements in half of architectures with zero degradation.

Conclusion: CDI^s enables immediate clinical deployment as a practical drop-in enhancement for prostate cancer lesion segmentation across diverse deep learning architectures, derived from existing DWI acquisitions without additional scan time.

Abstract: Current deep learning approaches for prostate cancer lesion segmentation achieve limited performance, with Dice scores of 0.32 or lower in large patient cohorts. To address this limitation, we investigate synthetic correlated diffusion imaging (CDI$^s$) as an enhancement to standard diffusion-based protocols. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across six state-of-the-art segmentation architectures using 200 patients with co-registered CDI$^s$, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) sequences. We demonstrate that CDI$^s$ integration reliably enhances or preserves segmentation performance in 94% of evaluated configurations, with individual architectures achieving up to 72.5% statistically significant relative improvement over baseline modalities. CDI$^s$ + DWI emerges as the safest enhancement pathway, achieving significant improvements in half of evaluated architectures with zero instances of degradation. Since CDI$^s$ derives from existing DWI acquisitions without requiring additional scan time or architectural modifications, it enables immediate deployment in clinical workflows. Our results establish validated integration pathways for CDI$^s$ as a practical drop-in enhancement for PCa lesion segmentation tasks across diverse deep learning architectures.

Motivation: Current human motion synthesis methods focus mainly on scene structure but ignore semantic understanding, which is crucial for realistic motion generation in 3D scenes.

Method: Proposes a unified Scene Semantic Occupancy (SSO) representation with bi-directional tri-plane decomposition, CLIP encoding for semantic mapping, and frame-wise scene query for motion control using scene hints and movement direction from instructions.

Result: Extensive experiments on cluttered scenes using ShapeNet furniture, PROX and Replica datasets demonstrate cutting-edge performance, validating effectiveness and generalization ability.

Conclusion: SSOMotion successfully integrates semantic understanding with scene structure for human motion synthesis, achieving state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational redundancy through efficient scene representation.

Abstract: Human motion synthesis in 3D scenes relies heavily on scene comprehension, while current methods focus mainly on scene structure but ignore the semantic understanding. In this paper, we propose a human motion synthesis framework that take an unified Scene Semantic Occupancy (SSO) for scene representation, termed SSOMotion. We design a bi-directional tri-plane decomposition to derive a compact version of the SSO, and scene semantics are mapped to an unified feature space via CLIP encoding and shared linear dimensionality reduction. Such strategy can derive the fine-grained scene semantic structures while significantly reduce redundant computations. We further take these scene hints and movement direction derived from instructions for motion control via frame-wise scene query. Extensive experiments and ablation studies conducted on cluttered scenes using ShapeNet furniture, as well as scanned scenes from PROX and Replica datasets, demonstrate its cutting-edge performance while validating its effectiveness and generalization ability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome Mamba's challenges in point cloud analysis including imperfect serialization, insufficient geometric perception, and S6 model overfitting.

Method: Proposes sequence expanding (axis-wise serialization), sequence merging (feature fusion), chainedMamba (bidirectional scanning for geometry), and grouped S6 (parameter sharing to reduce overfitting).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on various point cloud tasks with significantly reduced complexity.

Conclusion: CloudMamba effectively adapts Mamba for point cloud analysis by addressing serialization, geometric perception, and overfitting issues, demonstrating superior performance with lower complexity.

Abstract: Due to the long-range modeling ability and linear complexity property, Mamba has attracted considerable attention in point cloud analysis. Despite some interesting progress, related work still suffers from imperfect point cloud serialization, insufficient high-level geometric perception, and overfitting of the selective state space model (S6) at the core of Mamba. To this end, we resort to an SSM-based point cloud network termed CloudMamba to address the above challenges. Specifically, we propose sequence expanding and sequence merging, where the former serializes points along each axis separately and the latter serves to fuse the corresponding higher-order features causally inferred from different sequences, enabling unordered point sets to adapt more stably to the causal nature of Mamba without parameters. Meanwhile, we design chainedMamba that chains the forward and backward processes in the parallel bidirectional Mamba, capturing high-level geometric information during scanning. In addition, we propose a grouped selective state space model (GS6) via parameter sharing on S6, alleviating the overfitting problem caused by the computational mode in S6. Experiments on various point cloud tasks validate CloudMamba's ability to achieve state-of-the-art results with significantly less complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D detection suffers from ill-posed depth and limited field of view, causing lack of geometric cues and reduced accuracy in occluded/truncated scenes. Existing approaches that incorporate depth information overlook crucial visual cues needed for robust recognition.

Method: 1) K-means clustering on visual features to capture distinct object-level appearance parts (e.g., bonnet, car roof) for partially visible objects; 2) Construct generalized scene memory by aggregating clustered features across images for consistent representations; 3) Integrate both local cluster features and scene memory into object queries to guide attention toward informative regions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI benchmark, enabling robust monocular 3D detection under occlusion and limited visibility.

Conclusion: MonoCLUE's unified local clustering and generalized scene memory strategy effectively addresses geometric ambiguity in monocular 3D detection, improving object-level feature consistency and enabling stable detection across varying environments.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection offers a cost-effective solution for autonomous driving but suffers from ill-posed depth and limited field of view. These constraints cause a lack of geometric cues and reduced accuracy in occluded or truncated scenes. While recent approaches incorporate additional depth information to address geometric ambiguity, they overlook the visual cues crucial for robust recognition. We propose MonoCLUE, which enhances monocular 3D detection by leveraging both local clustering and generalized scene memory of visual features. First, we perform K-means clustering on visual features to capture distinct object-level appearance parts (e.g., bonnet, car roof), improving detection of partially visible objects. The clustered features are propagated across regions to capture objects with similar appearances. Second, we construct a generalized scene memory by aggregating clustered features across images, providing consistent representations that generalize across scenes. This improves object-level feature consistency, enabling stable detection across varying environments. Lastly, we integrate both local cluster features and generalized scene memory into object queries, guiding attention toward informative regions. Exploiting a unified local clustering and generalized scene memory strategy, MonoCLUE enables robust monocular 3D detection under occlusion and limited visibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI benchmark.

TL;DR: A universal visual perception framework using flow matching that generates diverse visual representations across multiple tasks, overcoming the limitations of single-task models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of "single-task-single-model" paradigm in diffusion models and leverage cross-domain generalization similar to large language models for multi-task visual perception.

Method: Formulates visual perception as a universal flow-matching problem from image patch tokens to task-specific representations, using a self-supervised foundation model as anchor with multi-scale circular task embedding mechanism.

Result: Achieves competitive performance in classification, detection, segmentation, depth estimation, and image-text retrieval in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, outperforming prior generalist and specialist models.

Conclusion: The framework represents a significant step towards general-purpose visual perception and provides a solid foundation for future universal vision modeling research.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in isolated computer vision tasks such as text-to-image generation, depth estimation, and optical flow. However, these models are often restricted by a ``single-task-single-model'' paradigm, severely limiting their generalizability and scalability in multi-task scenarios. Motivated by the cross-domain generalization ability of large language models, we propose a universal visual perception framework based on flow matching that can generate diverse visual representations across multiple tasks. Our approach formulates the process as a universal flow-matching problem from image patch tokens to task-specific representations rather than an independent generation or regression problem. By leveraging a strong self-supervised foundation model as the anchor and introducing a multi-scale, circular task embedding mechanism, our method learns a universal velocity field to bridge the gap between heterogeneous tasks, supporting efficient and flexible representation transfer. Extensive experiments on classification, detection, segmentation, depth estimation, and image-text retrieval demonstrate that our model achieves competitive performance in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, outperforming prior generalist and several specialist models. Ablation studies further validate the robustness, scalability, and generalization of our framework. Our work marks a significant step towards general-purpose visual perception, providing a solid foundation for future research in universal vision modeling.

### [29] [Generating Sketches in a Hierarchical Auto-Regressive Process for Flexible Sketch Drawing Manipulation at Stroke-Level](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07889)
*Sicong Zang,Shuhui Gao,Zhijun Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hierarchical auto-regressive sketch generation method that enables flexible stroke-level manipulation during the drawing process, unlike previous approaches that require all conditions to be set before generation starts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sketch generation methods require all stroke-level conditions to be collected and fed into the generator simultaneously before generation begins, preventing further manipulation during the drawing process. The authors aim to enable more flexible sketch manipulation.

Method: The method uses a three-staged hierarchical auto-regressive process: 1) predict stroke embeddings, 2) anchor strokes on canvas, and 3) translate embeddings to drawing actions. This allows considering recently generated strokes and their positions when predicting the next stroke, enabling manipulation at any time during generation.

Result: The proposed approach enables flexible stroke-level sketch manipulation during the generation process by adjusting editable stroke embeddings, rather than requiring all conditions to be set beforehand.

Conclusion: The hierarchical auto-regressive sketch generation method provides more flexible control over sketch drawing by allowing manipulation during the generation process, overcoming limitations of previous approaches that required all conditions to be predetermined.

Abstract: Generating sketches with specific patterns as expected, i.e., manipulating sketches in a controllable way, is a popular task. Recent studies control sketch features at stroke-level by editing values of stroke embeddings as conditions. However, in order to provide generator a global view about what a sketch is going to be drawn, all these edited conditions should be collected and fed into generator simultaneously before generation starts, i.e., no further manipulation is allowed during sketch generating process. In order to realize sketch drawing manipulation more flexibly, we propose a hierarchical auto-regressive sketch generating process. Instead of generating an entire sketch at once, each stroke in a sketch is generated in a three-staged hierarchy: 1) predicting a stroke embedding to represent which stroke is going to be drawn, and 2) anchoring the predicted stroke on the canvas, and 3) translating the embedding to a sequence of drawing actions to form the full sketch. Moreover, the stroke prediction, anchoring and translation are proceeded auto-regressively, i.e., both the recently generated strokes and their positions are considered to predict the current one, guiding model to produce an appropriate stroke at a suitable position to benefit the full sketch generation. It is flexible to manipulate stroke-level sketch drawing at any time during generation by adjusting the exposed editable stroke embeddings.

*Narendra Singh Yadav,Pavan Kumar Perepu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper provides a theoretical analysis of text polarity detection in images, building on previous empirical observations about how power-law transformations affect between-class variance in text vs. background regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text polarity detection is crucial for binarization in computer vision applications like license plate recognition and OCR. Previous work showed empirical evidence that power-law transformations affect between-class variance differently for dark vs. bright text, but lacked theoretical foundation.

Method: The authors conduct a theoretical analysis of the phenomenon where maximum between-class variance increases for dark text on bright background and decreases for bright text on dark background after power-law transformations.

Result: The paper provides theoretical validation for the empirical observations about how power-law transformations affect text-background separation based on polarity.

Conclusion: The theoretical analysis confirms and explains the empirical phenomenon observed in previous work, providing a solid foundation for text polarity detection methods in image binarization.

Abstract: Several computer vision applications like vehicle license plate recognition, captcha recognition, printed or handwriting character recognition from images etc., text polarity detection and binarization are the important preprocessing tasks. To analyze any image, it has to be converted to a simple binary image. This binarization process requires the knowledge of polarity of text in the images. Text polarity is defined as the contrast of text with respect to background. That means, text is darker than the background (dark text on bright background) or vice-versa. The binarization process uses this polarity information to convert the original colour or gray scale image into a binary image. In the literature, there is an intuitive approach based on power-law transformation on the original images. In this approach, the authors have illustrated an interesting phenomenon from the histogram statistics of the transformed images. Considering text and background as two classes, they have observed that maximum between-class variance between two classes is increasing (decreasing) for dark (bright) text on bright (dark) background. The corresponding empirical results have been presented. In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis of the above phenomenon.

*Selim Ahmet Iz,Mustafa Unel*

TL;DR: A novel image-based path planning algorithm using computer vision techniques, compared with A* and PRM algorithms, using disparity maps from UAVs for terrain depth analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 2D images cannot distinguish terrain features like craters and hills that impact path safety, requiring depth information for safer path planning.

Method: Uses disparity maps from UAVs, applies computer vision techniques (edge/line/corner detection, stereo depth reconstruction) to define way-points, and uses ArUco markers for automatic start/end point detection.

Result: The algorithm was tested in V-REP simulations and physical lab setups, showing promising results and effectiveness compared to A* and PRM algorithms.

Conclusion: The proposed image-based path planning algorithm using computer vision and depth information is effective and outperforms traditional deterministic and probabilistic methods.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel image-based path planning algorithm that was developed using computer vision techniques, as well as its comparative analysis with well-known deterministic and probabilistic algorithms, namely A* and Probabilistic Road Map algorithm (PRM). The terrain depth has a significant impact on the calculated path safety. The craters and hills on the surface cannot be distinguished in a two-dimensional image. The proposed method uses a disparity map of the terrain that is generated by using a UAV. Several computer vision techniques, including edge, line and corner detection methods, as well as the stereo depth reconstruction technique, are applied to the captured images and the found disparity map is used to define candidate way-points of the trajectory. The initial and desired points are detected automatically using ArUco marker pose estimation and circle detection techniques. After presenting the mathematical model and vision techniques, the developed algorithm is compared with well-known algorithms on different virtual scenes created in the V-REP simulation program and a physical setup created in a laboratory environment. Results are promising and demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing segmentation datasets and models are largely limited to terrestrial scenes, creating a gap for marine biodiversity monitoring and ecological assessment in underwater environments.

Method: Earth2Ocean framework with two components: Geometric-guided Visual Mask Generator (GMG) for local structure perception using self-similarity geometric priors, and Category-visual Semantic Alignment (CSA) module that enhances text embeddings through MLLM reasoning and scene-aware templates.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and framework successfully bridge the gap in underwater segmentation, enabling effective transfer of terrestrial VLMs to marine environments without additional training.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of marine organisms is vital for biodiversity monitoring and ecological assessment, yet existing datasets and models remain largely limited to terrestrial scenes. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{AquaOV255}, the first large-scale and fine-grained underwater segmentation dataset containing 255 categories and over 20K images, covering diverse categories for open-vocabulary (OV) evaluation. Furthermore, we establish the first underwater OV segmentation benchmark, \textbf{UOVSBench}, by integrating AquaOV255 with five additional underwater datasets to enable comprehensive evaluation. Alongside, we present \textbf{Earth2Ocean}, a training-free OV segmentation framework that transfers terrestrial vision--language models (VLMs) to underwater domains without any additional underwater training. Earth2Ocean consists of two core components: a Geometric-guided Visual Mask Generator (\textbf{GMG}) that refines visual features via self-similarity geometric priors for local structure perception, and a Category-visual Semantic Alignment (\textbf{CSA}) module that enhances text embeddings through multimodal large language model reasoning and scene-aware template construction. Extensive experiments on the UOVSBench benchmark demonstrate that Earth2Ocean achieves significant performance improvement on average while maintaining efficient inference.

TL;DR: HD²-SSC is a camera-based 3D semantic scene completion framework that addresses dimension and density gaps in autonomous driving by expanding 2D image features to 3D and refining voxel occupancies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSC methods suffer from dimension gap (2D input vs 3D output) and density gap (sparse annotations vs real-world dense occupancy), leading to inferior 3D scene understanding.

Method: Proposes HD²-SSC with two modules: High-dimension Semantic Decoupling to expand 2D features to pseudo-3D and identify focal regions, and High-density Occupancy Refinement using detect-and-refine architecture to complete missing voxels and correct errors.

Result: Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 datasets validate the framework's effectiveness in improving 3D semantic scene completion.

Conclusion: HD²-SSC successfully bridges the dimension and density gaps in camera-based 3D semantic scene completion, enabling better 3D scene understanding for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) plays a crucial role in autonomous driving, enabling voxelized 3D scene understanding for effective scene perception and decision-making. Existing SSC methods have shown efficacy in improving 3D scene representations, but suffer from the inherent input-output dimension gap and annotation-reality density gap, where the 2D planner view from input images with sparse annotated labels leads to inferior prediction of real-world dense occupancy with a 3D stereoscopic view. In light of this, we propose the corresponding High-Dimension High-Density Semantic Scene Completion (HD$^2$-SSC) framework with expanded pixel semantics and refined voxel occupancies. To bridge the dimension gap, a High-dimension Semantic Decoupling module is designed to expand 2D image features along a pseudo third dimension, decoupling coarse pixel semantics from occlusions, and then identify focal regions with fine semantics to enrich image features. To mitigate the density gap, a High-density Occupancy Refinement module is devised with a "detect-and-refine" architecture to leverage contextual geometric and semantic structures for enhanced semantic density with the completion of missing voxels and correction of erroneous ones. Extensive experiments and analyses on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 datasets validate the effectiveness of our HD$^2$-SSC framework.

*Yihang Wu,Ahmad Chaddad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedMedCLIP is a federated learning approach using CLIP for medical image classification that reduces communication and computational costs while maintaining privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy concerns limit deep model training in medical imaging, and federated learning faces challenges with data heterogeneity and resource costs, especially with vision language models.

Method: Uses masked feature adaptation module for communication, freezes CLIP encoders, masked MLP as local classifier, KL divergence distillation, and model compression with ensemble predictions.

Result: Achieves 8% higher performance than second best baseline on ISIC2019 and 120x faster than FedAVG with reasonable resource cost.

Conclusion: The proposed FedMedCLIP provides a feasible federated learning solution for medical image classification with improved performance and reduced resource requirements.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of deep models in medical imaging, they still require source data for training, which limits their potential in light of privacy concerns. Federated learning (FL), as a decentralized learning framework that trains a shared model with multiple hospitals (a.k.a., FL clients), provides a feasible solution. However, data heterogeneity and resource costs hinder the deployment of FL models, especially when using vision language models (VLM). To address these challenges, we propose a novel contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) based FL approach for medical image classification (FedMedCLIP). Specifically, we introduce a masked feature adaptation module (FAM) as a communication module to reduce the communication load while freezing the CLIP encoders to reduce the computational overhead. Furthermore, we propose a masked multi-layer perceptron (MLP) as a private local classifier to adapt to the client tasks. Moreover, we design an adaptive Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based distillation regularization method to enable mutual learning between FAM and MLP. Finally, we incorporate model compression to transmit the FAM parameters while using ensemble predictions for classification. Extensive experiments on four publicly available medical datasets demonstrate that our model provides feasible performance (e.g., 8\% higher compared to second best baseline on ISIC2019) with reasonable resource cost (e.g., 120$\times$ faster than FedAVG).

*Sida Huang,Siqi Huang,Ping Luo,Hongyuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Laytrol Network for layout-to-image generation that preserves pretrained knowledge by inheriting parameters from MM-DiT and using a specialized initialization scheme to maintain visual quality and stylistic consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing layout-to-image methods often suffer from low visual quality and stylistic inconsistency with base models due to loss of pretrained knowledge when integrating layout conditions.

Method: Proposes Layout Control (Laytrol) Network that inherits parameters from MM-DiT, uses Layout Synthesis dataset from base model images, specialized initialization with layout encoder as text encoder, and Object-level Rotary Position Embedding for layout tokens.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the method's effectiveness in generating spatially consistent images while maintaining high visual quality and stylistic consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses the spatial controllability challenge in text-to-image generation while preserving pretrained knowledge and maintaining visual quality.

Abstract: With the development of diffusion models, enhancing spatial controllability in text-to-image generation has become a vital challenge. As a representative task for addressing this challenge, layout-to-image generation aims to generate images that are spatially consistent with the given layout condition. Existing layout-to-image methods typically introduce the layout condition by integrating adapter modules into the base generative model. However, the generated images often exhibit low visual quality and stylistic inconsistency with the base model, indicating a loss of pretrained knowledge. To alleviate this issue, we construct the Layout Synthesis (LaySyn) dataset, which leverages images synthesized by the base model itself to mitigate the distribution shift from the pretraining data. Moreover, we propose the Layout Control (Laytrol) Network, in which parameters are inherited from MM-DiT to preserve the pretrained knowledge of the base model. To effectively activate the copied parameters and avoid disturbance from unstable control conditions, we adopt a dedicated initialization scheme for Laytrol. In this scheme, the layout encoder is initialized as a pure text encoder to ensure that its output tokens remain within the data domain of MM-DiT. Meanwhile, the outputs of the layout control network are initialized to zero. In addition, we apply Object-level Rotary Position Embedding to the layout tokens to provide coarse positional information. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

*Seyedehnanita Madani,Rama Chellappa,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffRegCD is a unified framework that integrates dense registration and change detection in a single model, using diffusion features and classification-based correspondence to handle large misalignments in real-world imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world change detection faces challenges with parallax, viewpoint shifts, and temporal gaps causing severe misalignment, while existing methods struggle with large displacements and rely on limited registration approaches.

Method: Reformulates correspondence estimation as Gaussian smoothed classification for sub-pixel accuracy, leverages frozen multi-scale features from pretrained diffusion models, and uses controlled affine perturbations for supervision without pseudo labels.

Result: Extensive experiments on aerial and ground-level datasets show DiffRegCD consistently surpasses recent baselines and remains reliable under wide temporal and geometric variation.

Conclusion: Diffusion features and classification-based correspondence provide a strong foundation for unified change detection that handles real-world misalignment challenges effectively.

Abstract: Change detection (CD) is fundamental to computer vision and remote sensing, supporting applications in environmental monitoring, disaster response, and urban development. Most CD models assume co-registered inputs, yet real-world imagery often exhibits parallax, viewpoint shifts, and long temporal gaps that cause severe misalignment. Traditional two stage methods that first register and then detect, as well as recent joint frameworks (e.g., BiFA, ChangeRD), still struggle under large displacements, relying on regression only flow, global homographies, or synthetic perturbations. We present DiffRegCD, an integrated framework that unifies dense registration and change detection in a single model. DiffRegCD reformulates correspondence estimation as a Gaussian smoothed classification task, achieving sub-pixel accuracy and stable training. It leverages frozen multi-scale features from a pretrained denoising diffusion model, ensuring robustness to illumination and viewpoint variation. Supervision is provided through controlled affine perturbations applied to standard CD datasets, yielding paired ground truth for both flow and change detection without pseudo labels. Extensive experiments on aerial (LEVIR-CD, DSIFN-CD, WHU-CD, SYSU-CD) and ground level (VL-CMU-CD) datasets show that DiffRegCD consistently surpasses recent baselines and remains reliable under wide temporal and geometric variation, establishing diffusion features and classification based correspondence as a strong foundation for unified change detection.

*Rui-Qing Sun,Ang Li,Zhijing Wu,Tian Lan,Qianyu Lu,Xingshan Yao,Chen Xu,Xian-Ling Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes ISExplore, a segment selection strategy that identifies informative 5-second video segments for talking face generation, achieving 5x faster processing and training while maintaining output quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TFG methods require processing several minutes of reference video, taking hours to train. The authors question if such long videos are necessary and find that short informative segments can achieve comparable or better performance.

Method: ISExplore automatically selects 5-second reference video segments based on three quality dimensions: audio feature diversity, lip movement amplitude, and number of camera views.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach increases data processing and training speed by more than 5x for NeRF and 3DGS methods while maintaining high-fidelity output.

Conclusion: Video informative quality is more important than length, and the proposed ISExplore strategy enables efficient talking face generation with minimal reference video requirements.

Abstract: Talking Face Generation (TFG) aims to produce realistic and dynamic talking portraits, with broad applications in fields such as digital education, film and television production, e-commerce live streaming, and other related areas. Currently, TFG methods based on Neural Radiated Field (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian sputtering (3DGS) are received widespread attention. They learn and store personalized features from reference videos of each target individual to generate realistic speaking videos. To ensure models can capture sufficient 3D information and successfully learns the lip-audio mapping, previous studies usually require meticulous processing and fitting several minutes of reference video, which always takes hours. The computational burden of processing and fitting long reference videos severely limits the practical application value of these methods.However, is it really necessary to fit such minutes of reference video? Our exploratory case studies show that using some informative reference video segments of just a few seconds can achieve performance comparable to or even better than the full reference video. This indicates that video informative quality is much more important than its length. Inspired by this observation, we propose the ISExplore (short for Informative Segment Explore), a simple-yet-effective segment selection strategy that automatically identifies the informative 5-second reference video segment based on three key data quality dimensions: audio feature diversity, lip movement amplitude, and number of camera views. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach increases data processing and training speed by more than 5x for NeRF and 3DGS methods, while maintaining high-fidelity output.

*Zhenfeng Zhuang,Fangyu Zhou,Liansheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Multimodal Prototype-based Multi-Instance Learning method that uses bidirectional interaction between vision and text modalities to improve computational pathology analysis of whole slide images with only bag-level labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational challenges of giga-pixel whole slide images and the limitations of existing vision-language MIL methods that use unidirectional guidance, which restricts cross-modal synergy.

Method: Uses frozen LLM to generate task-specific pathological entity descriptions as text prototypes, learns instance-level vision prototypes to reduce data redundancy, and employs Stereoscopic Optimal Transport for fusion to enable broader semantic alignment.

Result: Conducted few-shot classification and explainability experiments on three cancer datasets, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed bidirectional multimodal approach effectively addresses computational pathology challenges by leveraging task-specific prototypes and optimal transport fusion, achieving better generalization in cancer analysis tasks.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as a promising direction in computational pathology, the substantial computational cost of giga-pixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) necessitates the use of Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) to enable effective modeling. A key challenge is that pathological tasks typically provide only bag-level labels, while instance-level descriptions generated by LLMs often suffer from bias due to a lack of fine-grained medical knowledge. To address this, we propose that constructing task-specific pathological entity prototypes is crucial for learning generalizable features and enhancing model interpretability. Furthermore, existing vision-language MIL methods often employ unidirectional guidance, limiting cross-modal synergy. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, Multimodal Prototype-based Multi-Instance Learning, that promotes bidirectional interaction through a balanced information compression scheme. Specifically, we leverage a frozen LLM to generate task-specific pathological entity descriptions, which are learned as text prototypes. Concurrently, the vision branch learns instance-level prototypes to mitigate the model's reliance on redundant data. For the fusion stage, we employ the Stereoscopic Optimal Transport (SOT) algorithm, which is based on a similarity metric, thereby facilitating broader semantic alignment in a higher-dimensional space. We conduct few-shot classification and explainability experiments on three distinct cancer datasets, and the results demonstrate the superior generalization capabilities of our proposed method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReIDMamba is a pure Mamba-based person re-identification framework that addresses Transformer scalability issues by using Mamba architecture with multiple class tokens, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 1/3 the parameters of TransReID.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome Transformer's quadratic memory/computation scaling issues in person ReID while maintaining robust discriminative feature extraction capabilities.

Method: Uses Mamba-based architecture with multiple class tokens, multi-granularity feature extractor (MGFE) with multi-branch design, and ranking-aware triplet regularization (RATR) for feature diversity.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 5 person ReID benchmarks with only 1/3 parameters of TransReID, lower GPU memory usage, and faster inference throughput.

Conclusion: ReIDMamba successfully demonstrates Mamba's superiority over Transformers for person ReID, providing efficient and effective feature extraction with better scalability.

Abstract: Extracting robust discriminative features is a critical challenge in person re-identification (ReID). While Transformer-based methods have successfully addressed some limitations of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as their local processing nature and information loss resulting from convolution and downsampling operations, they still face the scalability issue due to the quadratic increase in memory and computational requirements with the length of the input sequence. To overcome this, we propose a pure Mamba-based person ReID framework named ReIDMamba. Specifically, we have designed a Mamba-based strong baseline that effectively leverages fine-grained, discriminative global features by introducing multiple class tokens. To further enhance robust features learning within Mamba, we have carefully designed two novel techniques. First, the multi-granularity feature extractor (MGFE) module, designed with a multi-branch architecture and class token fusion, effectively forms multi-granularity features, enhancing both discrimination ability and fine-grained coverage. Second, the ranking-aware triplet regularization (RATR) is introduced to reduce redundancy in features from multiple branches, enhancing the diversity of multi-granularity features by incorporating both intra-class and inter-class diversity constraints, thus ensuring the robustness of person features. To our knowledge, this is the pioneering work that integrates a purely Mamba-driven approach into ReID research. Our proposed ReIDMamba model boasts only one-third the parameters of TransReID, along with lower GPU memory usage and faster inference throughput. Experimental results demonstrate ReIDMamba's superior and promising performance, achieving state-of-the-art performance on five person ReID benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Burst imaging creates redundancy that increases storage/transmission demands and reduces downstream task efficiency, necessitating quality assessment for frame selection.

Method: Established benchmark dataset with 7,346 burst sequences and 191,572 quality scores. Proposed unified BuIQA framework with task-driven prompt generation network using heterogeneous knowledge distillation and task-aware quality assessment network.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art across 10 downstream scenarios. Achieves 0.33 dB PSNR improvement in denoising and super-resolution tasks by selecting high-quality burst frames.

Conclusion: BuIQA effectively addresses burst image redundancy by providing task-driven quality assessment, improving downstream task performance through intelligent frame selection.

Abstract: In recent years, the development of burst imaging technology has improved the capture and processing capabilities of visual data, enabling a wide range of applications. However, the redundancy in burst images leads to the increased storage and transmission demands, as well as reduced efficiency of downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a new task of Burst Image Quality Assessment (BuIQA), to evaluate the task-driven quality of each frame within a burst sequence, providing reasonable cues for burst image selection. Specifically, we establish the first benchmark dataset for BuIQA, consisting of $7,346$ burst sequences with $45,827$ images and $191,572$ annotated quality scores for multiple downstream scenarios. Inspired by the data analysis, a unified BuIQA framework is proposed to achieve an efficient adaption for BuIQA under diverse downstream scenarios. Specifically, a task-driven prompt generation network is developed with heterogeneous knowledge distillation, to learn the priors of the downstream task. Then, the task-aware quality assessment network is introduced to assess the burst image quality based on the task prompt. Extensive experiments across 10 downstream scenarios demonstrate the impressive BuIQA performance of the proposed approach, outperforming the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, it can achieve $0.33$ dB PSNR improvement in the downstream tasks of denoising and super-resolution, by applying our approach to select the high-quality burst frames.

*Shenao Zhao,Pengpeng Liang,Zhoufan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMAssist improves 3D unsupervised domain adaptation for LiDAR object detection by using image and text features as bridges to align 3D features between source and target domains, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D UDA methods based on teacher-student architecture with pseudo labels have shown improvements, but they largely ignore the usefulness of image data that is commonly collected alongside point clouds.

Method: Projects ground truth/pseudo labels to images to get 2D boxes, extracts image features from pre-trained vision backbone, uses LVLM for text descriptions and text encoder for text features, aligns 3D features with image/text features, fuses them with learned weights, and enhances pseudo labels using 2D detector.

Result: Achieves promising performance compared with state-of-the-art methods in three domain adaptation tasks on three popular 3D object detection datasets.

Conclusion: MMAssist effectively leverages multi-modal assistance (images and text) to improve 3D UDA performance, demonstrating the value of incorporating additional modalities beyond point clouds alone.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation for LiDAR-based 3D object detection (3D UDA) based on the teacher-student architecture with pseudo labels has achieved notable improvements in recent years. Although it is quite popular to collect point clouds and images simultaneously, little attention has been paid to the usefulness of image data in 3D UDA when training the models. In this paper, we propose an approach named MMAssist that improves the performance of 3D UDA with multi-modal assistance. A method is designed to align 3D features between the source domain and the target domain by using image and text features as bridges. More specifically, we project the ground truth labels or pseudo labels to the images to get a set of 2D bounding boxes. For each 2D box, we extract its image feature from a pre-trained vision backbone. A large vision-language model (LVLM) is adopted to extract the box's text description, and a pre-trained text encoder is used to obtain its text feature. During the training of the model in the source domain and the student model in the target domain, we align the 3D features of the predicted boxes with their corresponding image and text features, and the 3D features and the aligned features are fused with learned weights for the final prediction. The features between the student branch and the teacher branch in the target domain are aligned as well. To enhance the pseudo labels, we use an off-the-shelf 2D object detector to generate 2D bounding boxes from images and estimate their corresponding 3D boxes with the aid of point cloud, and these 3D boxes are combined with the pseudo labels generated by the teacher model. Experimental results show that our approach achieves promising performance compared with state-of-the-art methods in three domain adaptation tasks on three popular 3D object detection datasets.

TL;DR: A modular pipeline that improves spatial and temporal robustness in remote sensing change detection without modifying existing networks, using diffusion-based semantic morphing and registration refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address spatial misalignment challenges in bi-temporal remote sensing images, especially with long seasonal/multi-year gaps, where existing methods rely on precise co-registration and perform poorly across domains.

Method: Integrates diffusion-based semantic morphing, dense registration, and residual flow refinement. Uses diffusion to synthesize intermediate morphing frames, estimates stepwise correspondences, and refines flow through a lightweight U-Net for high-fidelity co-registration.

Result: Extensive experiments on LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and DSIFN-CD show consistent gains in both registration accuracy and downstream change detection across multiple backbones.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates generality and effectiveness in improving spatial and temporal robustness for remote sensing change detection without altering existing networks.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is often challenged by spatial misalignment between bi-temporal images, especially when acquisitions are separated by long seasonal or multi-year gaps. While modern convolutional and transformer-based models perform well on aligned data, their reliance on precise co-registration limits their robustness in real-world conditions. Existing joint registration-detection frameworks typically require retraining and transfer poorly across domains. We introduce a modular pipeline that improves spatial and temporal robustness without altering existing change detection networks. The framework integrates diffusion-based semantic morphing, dense registration, and residual flow refinement. A diffusion module synthesizes intermediate morphing frames that bridge large appearance gaps, enabling RoMa to estimate stepwise correspondences between consecutive frames. The composed flow is then refined through a lightweight U-Net to produce a high-fidelity warp that co-registers the original image pair. Extensive experiments on LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and DSIFN-CD show consistent gains in both registration accuracy and downstream change detection across multiple backbones, demonstrating the generality and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: DANCE is a density-agnostic and class-aware network for point cloud completion that generates missing regions while preserving observed geometry, using ray-based sampling and transformer refinement with semantic guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud completion methods assume fixed input/output densities or rely on image-based representations, making them unsuitable for real-world scenarios with variable sparsity and limited supervision.

Method: DANCE generates candidate points via ray-based sampling from multiple viewpoints, uses a transformer decoder to refine positions and predict opacity scores, and incorporates semantic guidance through a lightweight classification head trained on geometric features.

Result: Extensive experiments on PCN and MVP benchmarks show DANCE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and structural consistency, while remaining robust to varying input densities and noise levels.

Conclusion: DANCE provides an effective solution for point cloud completion that handles variable sparsity, preserves existing geometry, and achieves category-consistent completion without external image supervision.

Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to recover missing geometric structures from incomplete 3D scans, which often suffer from occlusions or limited sensor viewpoints. Existing methods typically assume fixed input/output densities or rely on image-based representations, making them less suitable for real-world scenarios with variable sparsity and limited supervision. In this paper, we introduce Density-agnostic and Class-aware Network (DANCE), a novel framework that completes only the missing regions while preserving the observed geometry. DANCE generates candidate points via ray-based sampling from multiple viewpoints. A transformer decoder then refines their positions and predicts opacity scores, which determine the validity of each point for inclusion in the final surface. To incorporate semantic guidance, a lightweight classification head is trained directly on geometric features, enabling category-consistent completion without external image supervision. Extensive experiments on the PCN and MVP benchmarks show that DANCE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and structural consistency, while remaining robust to varying input densities and noise levels.

While recent vision-language models achieve strong results in general radiology report generation, they often fail to adequately describe rare but clinically important pathologies like fractures. This work addresses this gap by developing specialized models for fracture pathology detection and description. We train fracture-specific vision-language models with encoders from MAIRA-2 and CheXagent, demonstrating significant improvements over general-purpose models in generating accurate fracture descriptions. Analysis of model outputs by fracture type, location, and age reveals distinct strengths and limitations of current vision-language model architectures. We publicly release our best-performing fracture-reporting model, facilitating future research in accurate reporting of rare pathologies.

Conclusion: CSF-Net provides an effective semantic-guided approach for large-mask image inpainting that improves structural accuracy and semantic consistency, working seamlessly with existing models across diverse masking conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a semantic-guided framework to address the challenging problem of large-mask image inpainting, where essential visual content is missing and contextual cues are limited. To compensate for the limited context, we leverage a pretrained Amodal Completion (AC) model to generate structure-aware candidates that serve as semantic priors for the missing regions. We introduce Context-Semantic Fusion Network (CSF-Net), a transformer-based fusion framework that fuses these candidates with contextual features to produce a semantic guidance image for image inpainting. This guidance improves inpainting quality by promoting structural accuracy and semantic consistency. CSF-Net can be seamlessly integrated into existing inpainting models without architectural changes and consistently enhances performance across diverse masking conditions. Extensive experiments on the Places365 and COCOA datasets demonstrate that CSF-Net effectively reduces object hallucination while enhancing visual realism and semantic alignment.

*Jialong Qin,Xin Zou,Di Lu,Yibo Yan,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SharpV is an efficient method for adaptive pruning of visual tokens and KV cache in Video Large Language Models, reducing quadratic computational complexity while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VideoLLMs suffer from quadratic computational complexity and KV cache scaling issues due to processing excessive redundant visual tokens.

Method: SharpV uses adaptive pruning based on spatial-temporal information, with a two-stage approach: dynamic token pruning and self-calibrated KV cache pruning guided by similarity to original features.

Result: Experiments show SharpV achieves superior performance on multiple benchmarks, sometimes even outperforming dense models, while being fully compatible with hardware acceleration.

Conclusion: SharpV offers a novel paradigm for adaptive pruning in VideoLLMs, providing hierarchical cache pruning from an information bottleneck perspective without requiring access to attention scores.

Abstract: Current Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) suffer from quadratic computational complexity and key-value cache scaling, due to their reliance on processing excessive redundant visual tokens. To address this problem, we propose SharpV, a minimalist and efficient method for adaptive pruning of visual tokens and KV cache. Different from most uniform compression approaches, SharpV dynamically adjusts pruning ratios based on spatial-temporal information. Remarkably, this adaptive mechanism occasionally achieves performance gains over dense models, offering a novel paradigm for adaptive pruning. During the KV cache pruning stage, based on observations of visual information degradation, SharpV prunes degraded visual features via a self-calibration manner, guided by similarity to original visual features. In this way, SharpV achieves hierarchical cache pruning from the perspective of information bottleneck, offering a new insight into VideoLLMs' information flow. Experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of SharpV. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, SharpV is notably the first two-stage pruning framework that operates without requiring access to exposed attention scores, ensuring full compatibility with hardware acceleration techniques like Flash Attention.

Conclusion: EAGLE's memory consolidation mechanism effectively handles appearance variations and enables efficient unification of 2D and 3D visual query localization tasks.

Abstract: Egocentric visual query localization is vital for embodied AI and VR/AR, yet remains challenging due to camera motion, viewpoint changes, and appearance variations. We present EAGLE, a novel framework that leverages episodic appearance- and geometry-aware memory to achieve unified 2D-3D visual query localization in egocentric vision. Inspired by avian memory consolidation, EAGLE synergistically integrates segmentation guided by an appearance-aware meta-learning memory (AMM), with tracking driven by a geometry-aware localization memory (GLM). This memory consolidation mechanism, through structured appearance and geometry memory banks, stores high-confidence retrieval samples, effectively supporting both long- and short-term modeling of target appearance variations. This enables precise contour delineation with robust spatial discrimination, leading to significantly improved retrieval accuracy. Furthermore, by integrating the VQL-2D output with a visual geometry grounded Transformer (VGGT), we achieve a efficient unification of 2D and 3D tasks, enabling rapid and accurate back-projection into 3D space. Our method achieves state-ofthe-art performance on the Ego4D-VQ benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdvRoad generates natural-looking road-style adversarial posters that can stealthily fool 3D object detectors in autonomous driving systems by making them perceive non-existent objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual 3D detection models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and existing adversarial posters have unnatural appearances that are easily noticeable by humans and can be easily defended against.

Method: A two-stage approach: Road-Style Adversary Generation and Scenario-Associated Adaptation, which maximizes attack effectiveness while ensuring natural appearance resembling road surfaces.

Result: AdvRoad generalizes well across different detectors, scenes, and spoofing locations, and physical attacks demonstrate practical threats in real-world environments.

Conclusion: The proposed AdvRoad method creates stealthy, natural-looking adversarial road posters that pose significant security threats to autonomous driving systems by compromising 3D object detection capabilities.

Abstract: Modern autonomous driving (AD) systems leverage 3D object detection to perceive foreground objects in 3D environments for subsequent prediction and planning. Visual 3D detection based on RGB cameras provides a cost-effective solution compared to the LiDAR paradigm. While achieving promising detection accuracy, current deep neural network-based models remain highly susceptible to adversarial examples. The underlying safety concerns motivate us to investigate realistic adversarial attacks in AD scenarios. Previous work has demonstrated the feasibility of placing adversarial posters on the road surface to induce hallucinations in the detector. However, the unnatural appearance of the posters makes them easily noticeable by humans, and their fixed content can be readily targeted and defended. To address these limitations, we propose the AdvRoad to generate diverse road-style adversarial posters. The adversaries have naturalistic appearances resembling the road surface while compromising the detector to perceive non-existent objects at the attack locations. We employ a two-stage approach, termed Road-Style Adversary Generation and Scenario-Associated Adaptation, to maximize the attack effectiveness on the input scene while ensuring the natural appearance of the poster, allowing the attack to be carried out stealthily without drawing human attention. Extensive experiments show that AdvRoad generalizes well to different detectors, scenes, and spoofing locations. Moreover, physical attacks further demonstrate the practical threats in real-world environments.

*Zhiyuan Chen,Yuelin Guo,Zitong Huang,Haoyu He,Renhao Lu,Weizhe Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cascade HQP-DETR addresses limitations in Imaginary Supervised Object Detection (ISOD) by introducing a high-quality synthetic data pipeline, image-specific query initialization, and cascade denoising to achieve state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets using only synthetic training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object detection requires expensive annotated datasets. ISOD trains on synthetic images but faces issues with poor data quality, slow convergence in DETR-based detectors, and overfitting to noisy pseudo-labels.

Method: Three key innovations: (1) High-quality data pipeline using LLaMA-3, Flux, and Grounding DINO to create FluxVOC/FluxCOCO datasets; (2) High-Quality Proposal guided query encoding with SAM-generated proposals and RoI features; (3) Cascade denoising with progressive IoU thresholds across decoder layers.

Result: Achieves 61.04% mAP@0.5 on PASCAL VOC 2007 after only 12 epochs of training on FluxVOC, outperforming strong baselines and demonstrating competitive real-data performance.

Conclusion: Cascade HQP-DETR successfully advances ISOD from weak to full supervision, enabling effective object detection using only synthetic data while maintaining strong generalization to real-world images.

Abstract: Object detection models demand large-scale annotated datasets, which are costly and labor-intensive to create. This motivated Imaginary Supervised Object Detection (ISOD), where models train on synthetic images and test on real images. However, existing methods face three limitations: (1) synthetic datasets suffer from simplistic prompts, poor image quality, and weak supervision; (2) DETR-based detectors, due to their random query initialization, struggle with slow convergence and overfitting to synthetic patterns, hindering real-world generalization; (3) uniform denoising pressure promotes model overfitting to pseudo-label noise. We propose Cascade HQP-DETR to address these limitations. First, we introduce a high-quality data pipeline using LLaMA-3, Flux, and Grounding DINO to generate the FluxVOC and FluxCOCO datasets, advancing ISOD from weak to full supervision. Second, our High-Quality Proposal guided query encoding initializes object queries with image-specific priors from SAM-generated proposals and RoI-pooled features, accelerating convergence while steering the model to learn transferable features instead of overfitting to synthetic patterns. Third, our cascade denoising algorithm dynamically adjusts training weights through progressively increasing IoU thresholds across decoder layers, guiding the model to learn robust boundaries from reliable visual cues rather than overfitting to noisy labels. Trained for just 12 epochs solely on FluxVOC, Cascade HQP-DETR achieves a SOTA 61.04\% mAP@0.5 on PASCAL VOC 2007, outperforming strong baselines, with its competitive real-data performance confirming the architecture's universal applicability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-modal deepfake detection and localization framework using Feature Pyramid-Transformer (FPN-Transformer) that leverages cross-modal correlations between audio and video to detect and precisely localize manipulated segments in synthetic media.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unimodal deepfake detection methods lack cross-modal correlation analysis and precise temporal localization capabilities, limiting their effectiveness against sophisticated manipulations in audio-visual content.

Method: Uses pre-trained self-supervised models (WavLM for audio, CLIP for video) to extract hierarchical temporal features, constructs multi-scale feature pyramid with R-TLM blocks and localized attention, and employs dual-branch prediction for forgery probability and temporal offset refinement.

Result: Achieved a score of 0.7535 on the IJCAI'25 DDL-AV benchmark test set, demonstrating effective cross-modal deepfake detection and localization in challenging environments.

Conclusion: The proposed FPN-Transformer framework provides an effective solution for generalized deepfake detection by leveraging cross-modal correlations and achieving precise temporal localization of manipulated segments.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models has enabled the creation of highly realistic deepfake content, posing significant threats to digital trust across audio-visual domains. While unimodal detection methods have shown progress in identifying synthetic media, their inability to leverage cross-modal correlations and precisely localize forged segments limits their practicality against sophisticated, fine-grained manipulations. To address this, we introduce a multi-modal deepfake detection and localization framework based on a Feature Pyramid-Transformer (FPN-Transformer), addressing critical gaps in cross-modal generalization and temporal boundary regression. The proposed approach utilizes pre-trained self-supervised models (WavLM for audio, CLIP for video) to extract hierarchical temporal features. A multi-scale feature pyramid is constructed through R-TLM blocks with localized attention mechanisms, enabling joint analysis of cross-context temporal dependencies. The dual-branch prediction head simultaneously predicts forgery probabilities and refines temporal offsets of manipulated segments, achieving frame-level localization precision. We evaluate our approach on the test set of the IJCAI'25 DDL-AV benchmark, showing a good performance with a final score of 0.7535 for cross-modal deepfake detection and localization in challenging environments. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our approach and provide a novel way for generalized deepfake detection. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zig-HS/MM-DDL

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research focused on algorithmic performance and visual fidelity, but the perceptual quality of 3DGS-rendered content under varying reconstruction conditions remains largely underexplored, with factors like viewpoint sparsity, limited training iterations, and distortions significantly impacting visual quality.

Method: Created 3DGS-QA dataset with 225 degraded reconstructions across 15 object types, then developed a no-reference quality prediction model that directly operates on native 3D Gaussian primitives without requiring rendered images or ground-truth references, using spatial and photometric cues in a structure-aware manner.

Result: The proposed method consistently achieves superior performance compared to existing quality assessment methods, demonstrating robustness and effectiveness for 3DGS content evaluation.

Conclusion: The work bridges the gap in perceptual quality assessment for 3DGS, provides the first comprehensive dataset, and introduces an effective no-reference quality prediction model that outperforms existing methods, with publicly available dataset and code to facilitate future research.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of 3D visualization, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a leading technique for real-time, high-fidelity rendering. While prior research has emphasized algorithmic performance and visual fidelity, the perceptual quality of 3DGS-rendered content, especially under varying reconstruction conditions, remains largely underexplored. In practice, factors such as viewpoint sparsity, limited training iterations, point downsampling, noise, and color distortions can significantly degrade visual quality, yet their perceptual impact has not been systematically studied. To bridge this gap, we present 3DGS-QA, the first subjective quality assessment dataset for 3DGS. It comprises 225 degraded reconstructions across 15 object types, enabling a controlled investigation of common distortion factors. Based on this dataset, we introduce a no-reference quality prediction model that directly operates on native 3D Gaussian primitives, without requiring rendered images or ground-truth references. Our model extracts spatial and photometric cues from the Gaussian representation to estimate perceived quality in a structure-aware manner. We further benchmark existing quality assessment methods, spanning both traditional and learning-based approaches. Experimental results show that our method consistently achieves superior performance, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness for 3DGS content evaluation.

Conclusion: WEDepth effectively adapts Vision Foundation Models for monocular depth estimation by leveraging their inherent priors as feature enhancers, achieving superior performance without structural modifications and demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) has widely applicable but remains highly challenging due to the inherently ill-posed nature of reconstructing 3D scenes from single 2D images. Modern Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), pre-trained on large-scale diverse datasets, exhibit remarkable world understanding capabilities that benefit for various vision tasks. Recent studies have demonstrated significant improvements in MDE through fine-tuning these VFMs. Inspired by these developments, we propose WEDepth, a novel approach that adapts VFMs for MDE without modi-fying their structures and pretrained weights, while effec-tively eliciting and leveraging their inherent priors. Our method employs the VFM as a multi-level feature en-hancer, systematically injecting prior knowledge at differ-ent representation levels. Experiments on NYU-Depth v2 and KITTI datasets show that WEDepth establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, achieving competi-tive results compared to both diffusion-based approaches (which require multiple forward passes) and methods pre-trained on relative depth.

TL;DR: GECO2 is an end-to-end few-shot counting and detection method that addresses object scale issues through dense query representation and multi-scale feature aggregation, achieving 10% better accuracy and 3x faster performance with smaller GPU memory footprint.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot counters struggle with diverse-sized objects and densely populated regions due to ad-hoc solutions like feature merging and image upsampling/tiling, which don't effectively handle scale variations.

Method: Uses a new dense query representation that gradually aggregates exemplar-specific feature information across scales, creating high-resolution dense queries that enable detection of both large and small objects.

Result: Surpasses state-of-the-art few-shot counters by 10% in both counting and detection accuracy while running 3x faster with smaller GPU memory footprint.

Conclusion: GECO2 effectively addresses object scale issues in few-shot counting and detection through its dense query representation approach, achieving superior performance across multiple metrics.

Abstract: Few-shot detection-based counters estimate the number of instances in the image specified only by a few test-time exemplars. A common approach to localize objects across multiple sizes is to merge backbone features of different resolutions. Furthermore, to enable small object detection in densely populated regions, the input image is commonly upsampled and tiling is applied to cope with the increased computational and memory requirements. Because of these ad-hoc solutions, existing counters struggle with images containing diverse-sized objects and densely populated regions of small objects. We propose GECO2, an end-to-end few-shot counting and detection method that explicitly addresses the object scale issues. A new dense query representation gradually aggregates exemplar-specific feature information across scales that leads to high-resolution dense queries that enable detection of large as well as small objects. GECO2 surpasses state-of-the-art few-shot counters in counting as well as detection accuracy by 10% while running 3x times faster at smaller GPU memory footprint.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses the identity-prompt diversity trade-off through efficient fine-tuning and comprehensive evaluation, providing a scalable solution for subject-driven image generation.

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation aims to synthesize novel depictions of a specific subject across diverse contexts while preserving its core identity features. Achieving both strong identity consistency and high prompt diversity presents a fundamental trade-off. We propose a LoRA fine-tuned diffusion model employing a latent concatenation strategy, which jointly processes reference and target images, combined with a masked Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) objective. This approach enables robust identity preservation without architectural modifications. To facilitate large-scale training, we introduce a two-stage Distilled Data Curation Framework: the first stage leverages data restoration and VLM-based filtering to create a compact, high-quality seed dataset from diverse sources; the second stage utilizes these curated examples for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, thus scaling the generation capability across various subjects and contexts. Finally, for filtering and quality assessment, we present CHARIS, a fine-grained evaluation framework that performs attribute-level comparisons along five key axes: identity consistency, prompt adherence, region-wise color fidelity, visual quality, and transformation diversity.

However, traditional radar-based heartbeat sensing methods face performance degradation due to noise. Learning-based radar methods achieve better noise robustness but require costly labeled signals for supervised training. To overcome these limitations, we propose the first unsupervised framework for radar-based heartbeat sensing via Augmented Pseudo-Label and Noise Contrast (Radar-APLANC). We propose to use both the heartbeat range and noise range within the radar range matrix to construct the positive and negative samples, respectively, for improved noise robustness. Our Noise-Contrastive Triplet (NCT) loss only utilizes positive samples, negative samples, and pseudo-label signals generated by the traditional radar method, thereby avoiding dependence on expensive ground-truth physiological signals. We further design a pseudo-label augmentation approach featuring adaptive noise-aware label selection to improve pseudo-label signal quality. Extensive experiments on the Equipleth dataset and our collected radar dataset demonstrate that our unsupervised method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art supervised methods.

### [59] [CLIP is All You Need for Human-like Semantic Representations in Stable Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08075)
*Cameron Braunstein,Mariya Toneva,Eddy Ilg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether latent diffusion models like Stable Diffusion have semantic understanding of generated images, finding that semantic information actually comes from CLIP text encoding rather than the diffusion process itself.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the extent of semantic understanding in latent diffusion models during text-to-image generation, specifically whether their internal representations contain human-meaningful semantic information.

Method: Probing Stable Diffusion with simple regression layers to predict semantic attributes for objects and comparing predictions against human annotations.

Result: Semantic understanding success is attributed to CLIP text encoding rather than the reverse diffusion process; different semantic attributes have varying decoding accuracy; attributes become harder to disambiguate during inverse diffusion.

Conclusion: The separately trained CLIP vision-language model provides human-like semantic representation, while the diffusion process acts as a visual decoder.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion achieve state-of-the-art results on text-to-image generation tasks. However, the extent to which these models have a semantic understanding of the images they generate is not well understood. In this work, we investigate whether the internal representations used by these models during text-to-image generation contain semantic information that is meaningful to humans. To do so, we perform probing on Stable Diffusion with simple regression layers that predict semantic attributes for objects and evaluate these predictions against human annotations. Surprisingly, we find that this success can actually be attributed to the text encoding occurring in CLIP rather than the reverse diffusion process. We demonstrate that groups of specific semantic attributes have markedly different decoding accuracy than the average, and are thus represented to different degrees. Finally, we show that attributes become more difficult to disambiguate from one another during the inverse diffusion process, further demonstrating the strongest semantic representation of object attributes in CLIP. We conclude that the separately trained CLIP vision-language model is what determines the human-like semantic representation, and that the diffusion process instead takes the role of a visual decoder.

*Aditi Singhania,Krutik Malani,Riddhi Dhawan,Arushi Jain,Garv Tandon,Nippun Sharma,Souymodip Chakraborty,Vineet Batra,Ankit Phogat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Beyond the Pixels is a hierarchical evaluation framework that uses structured VLM reasoning to assess identity preservation in generative models by decomposing subjects into feature-level transformations, outperforming existing metrics in alignment with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing identity preservation metrics rely on global embeddings or coarse VLM prompting, failing to capture fine-grained identity changes and providing limited diagnostic insight into how identity is transformed in generative models.

Method: The framework hierarchically decomposes subjects into (type, style) -> attribute -> feature decision trees and prompts VLMs for concrete transformations rather than abstract similarity scores, grounding analysis in verifiable visual evidence to reduce hallucinations.

Result: The method demonstrates strong alignment with human judgments across four state-of-the-art generative models and introduces a new benchmark with 1,078 image-prompt pairs spanning diverse subject types including underrepresented categories, capturing 6-7 transformation axes per prompt.

Conclusion: Beyond the Pixels provides a more reliable and diagnostic framework for evaluating identity preservation in generative models by decomposing identity assessment into verifiable feature-level transformations through structured VLM reasoning.

Abstract: Evaluating identity preservation in generative models remains a critical yet unresolved challenge. Existing metrics rely on global embeddings or coarse VLM prompting, failing to capture fine-grained identity changes and providing limited diagnostic insight. We introduce Beyond the Pixels, a hierarchical evaluation framework that decomposes identity assessment into feature-level transformations. Our approach guides VLMs through structured reasoning by (1) hierarchically decomposing subjects into (type, style) -> attribute -> feature decision tree, and (2) prompting for concrete transformations rather than abstract similarity scores. This decomposition grounds VLM analysis in verifiable visual evidence, reducing hallucinations and improving consistency. We validate our framework across four state-of-the-art generative models, demonstrating strong alignment with human judgments in measuring identity consistency. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark specifically designed to stress-test generative models. It comprises 1,078 image-prompt pairs spanning diverse subject types, including underrepresented categories such as anthropomorphic and animated characters, and captures an average of six to seven transformation axes per prompt.

*Wassim Kabbani,Kiran Raja,Raghavendra Ramachandra,Christoph Busch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StableMorph is a novel diffusion-based method that generates highly realistic, artifact-free morphed face images to improve morphing attack detection (MAD) system evaluation and development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing morph generation methods produce blurry, artifact-ridden images that are easy to detect and don't represent real-world attack challenges, limiting effective MAD system development.

Method: Uses modern diffusion-based image synthesis to generate full-head morphed face images with sharp details, avoiding common visual flaws while offering control over visual attributes.

Result: StableMorph images rival or exceed genuine face image quality, maintain strong ability to fool face recognition systems, and pose greater challenges to existing MAD solutions.

Conclusion: StableMorph sets a new standard for morph quality, improves biometric security evaluation by creating more realistic attacks, and supports development of more robust detection systems.

Abstract: Face morphing attacks threaten the integrity of biometric identity systems by enabling multiple individuals to share a single identity. To develop and evaluate effective morphing attack detection (MAD) systems, we need access to high-quality, realistic morphed images that reflect the challenges posed in real-world scenarios. However, existing morph generation methods often produce images that are blurry, riddled with artifacts, or poorly constructed making them easy to detect and not representative of the most dangerous attacks. In this work, we introduce StableMorph, a novel approach that generates highly realistic, artifact-free morphed face images using modern diffusion-based image synthesis. Unlike prior methods, StableMorph produces full-head images with sharp details, avoids common visual flaws, and offers unmatched control over visual attributes. Through extensive evaluation, we show that StableMorph images not only rival or exceed the quality of genuine face images but also maintain a strong ability to fool face recognition systems posing a greater challenge to existing MAD solutions and setting a new standard for morph quality in research and operational testing. StableMorph improves the evaluation of biometric security by creating more realistic and effective attacks and supports the development of more robust detection systems.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new dataset for face recognition security testing using Nylon Face Masks (NFMs) - realistic 3D spoofing instruments that closely mimic facial geometry. The dataset contains 3,760 genuine samples and 51,281 NFM attack samples collected via iPhone 11 Pro, evaluated with five state-of-the-art PAD methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face recognition systems are vulnerable to presentation attacks (PAs), particularly from advanced 3D spoofing methods like Nylon Face Masks which can closely mimic victims' facial geometry due to their elastic structure and photorealistic appearance.

Method: Created a novel dataset using iPhone 11 Pro capturing 3,760 bona fide samples from 100 subjects and 51,281 NFM attack samples across four presentation scenarios (humans and mannequins). Benchmarking was performed using five state-of-the-art Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) methods.

Result: The evaluation revealed significant performance variability across different PAD methods when tested against NFM attacks, demonstrating the challenges posed by this novel spoofing technique.

Conclusion: NFMs present a serious threat to face recognition security, highlighting the need for developing PAD techniques that can effectively generalize to emerging and unseen spoofing threats.

Abstract: Face recognition systems are increasingly deployed across a wide range of applications, including smartphone authentication, access control, and border security. However, these systems remain vulnerable to presentation attacks (PAs), which can significantly compromise their reliability. In this work, we introduce a new dataset focused on a novel and realistic presentation attack instrument called Nylon Face Masks (NFMs), designed to simulate advanced 3D spoofing scenarios. NFMs are particularly concerning due to their elastic structure and photorealistic appearance, which enable them to closely mimic the victim's facial geometry when worn by an attacker. To reflect real-world smartphone-based usage conditions, we collected the dataset using an iPhone 11 Pro, capturing 3,760 bona fide samples from 100 subjects and 51,281 NFM attack samples across four distinct presentation scenarios involving both humans and mannequins. We benchmark the dataset using five state-of-the-art PAD methods to evaluate their robustness under unseen attack conditions. The results demonstrate significant performance variability across methods, highlighting the challenges posed by NFMs and underscoring the importance of developing PAD techniques that generalise effectively to emerging spoofing threats.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Federated Learning framework combined with SAM2 for automatic foam segmentation in wastewater treatment plants, addressing data scarcity and privacy concerns while improving training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foam formation in WTPs reduces treatment efficiency and increases costs, but standard ML models require large labeled datasets which are scarce and heterogeneous. Different WTPs don't share data due to privacy concerns, hindering system development.

Method: Combines Federated Learning with Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), using FL for collaborative training across multiple WTPs without centralizing sensitive data. Fine-tunes SAM2 on distributed clients using Flower framework, with a central Fog server aggregating model weights without accessing private data.

Result: The framework accelerates training convergence and improves segmentation performance even with limited local datasets by leveraging SAM2's pre-trained weights. Validated using real-world WTP images from Granada, synthetic foam datasets, and public datasets for generalization.

Conclusion: Provides a practical, scalable, and privacy-aware solution for automatic foam tracking in WTPs, demonstrating significant potential of integrating large-scale foundational models into FL systems for industrial challenges with distributed sensitive data.

Abstract: Foam formation in Wastewater Treatment Plants (WTPs) is a major challenge that can reduce treatment efficiency and increase costs. The ability to automatically examine changes in real-time with respect to the percentage of foam can be of great benefit to the plant. However, large amounts of labeled data are required to train standard Machine Learning (ML) models. The development of these systems is slow due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of labeled data. Additionally, the development is often hindered by the fact that different WTPs do not share their data due to privacy concerns. This paper proposes a new framework to address these challenges by combining Federated Learning (FL) with the state-of-the-art base model for image segmentation, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). The FL paradigm enables collaborative model training across multiple WTPs without centralizing sensitive operational data, thereby ensuring privacy. The framework accelerates training convergence and improves segmentation performance even with limited local datasets by leveraging SAM2's strong pre-trained weights for initialization. The methodology involves fine-tuning SAM2 on distributed clients (edge nodes) using the Flower framework, where a central Fog server orchestrates the process by aggregating model weights without accessing private data. The model was trained and validated using various data collections, including real-world images captured at a WTPs in Granada, Spain, a synthetically generated foam dataset, and images from publicly available datasets to improve generalization. This research offers a practical, scalable, and privacy-aware solution for automatic foam tracking in WTPs. The findings highlight the significant potential of integrating large-scale foundational models into FL systems to solve real-world industrial challenges characterized by distributed and sensitive data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OTSNet is a neurocognitive-inspired three-stage network for Scene Text Recognition that addresses cross-modal misalignment through an Observation-Thinking-Spelling pipeline, achieving state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing STR frameworks suffer from decoupled visual-linguistic optimization that amplifies error propagation through cross-modal misalignment. Visual encoders have attention bias toward background distractors, while decoders suffer from spatial misalignment when parsing deformed text.

Method: Three-stage architecture: (1) Dual Attention Macaron Encoder (DAME) refines visual features with differential attention maps; (2) Position-Aware Module (PAM) and Semantic Quantizer (SQ) integrate spatial context with glyph-level semantic abstraction; (3) Multi-Modal Collaborative Verifier (MMCV) enforces self-correction through cross-modal fusion.

Result: Achieves 83.5% average accuracy on Union14M-L benchmark and 79.1% on heavily occluded OST dataset, establishing new records across 9 out of 14 evaluation scenarios.

Conclusion: OTSNet's neurocognitive-inspired hierarchical pipeline effectively addresses cross-modal misalignment in STR, demonstrating superior performance for irregular text patterns and establishing new state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Scene Text Recognition (STR) remains challenging due to real-world complexities, where decoupled visual-linguistic optimization in existing frameworks amplifies error propagation through cross-modal misalignment. Visual encoders exhibit attention bias toward background distractors, while decoders suffer from spatial misalignment when parsing geometrically deformed text-collectively degrading recognition accuracy for irregular patterns. Inspired by the hierarchical cognitive processes in human visual perception, we propose OTSNet, a novel three-stage network embodying a neurocognitive-inspired Observation-Thinking-Spelling pipeline for unified STR modeling. The architecture comprises three core components: (1) a Dual Attention Macaron Encoder (DAME) that refines visual features through differential attention maps to suppress irrelevant regions and enhance discriminative focus; (2) a Position-Aware Module (PAM) and Semantic Quantizer (SQ) that jointly integrate spatial context with glyph-level semantic abstraction via adaptive sampling; and (3) a Multi-Modal Collaborative Verifier (MMCV) that enforces self-correction through cross-modal fusion of visual, semantic, and character-level features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OTSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 83.5% average accuracy on the challenging Union14M-L benchmark and 79.1% on the heavily occluded OST dataset-establishing new records across 9 out of 14 evaluation scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Event-RGB datasets have sparse coverage of extreme conditions and low spatial resolution (<=640x480), preventing comprehensive evaluation of detectors under challenging scenarios.

Method: Proposed PEOD dataset with pixel-aligned Event-RGB data, benchmarked 14 methods across three input configurations: Event-based, RGB-based, and Event-RGB fusion.

Result: Fusion-based models achieve excellent performance on full test set and normal subset, but in illumination challenge subset, top event-based model outperforms all fusion models, while fusion models still outperform RGB-based counterparts.

Conclusion: PEOD establishes a realistic, high-quality benchmark for multimodal perception and reveals limitations of existing fusion methods when frame modality is severely degraded.

Abstract: Robust object detection for challenging scenarios increasingly relies on event cameras, yet existing Event-RGB datasets remain constrained by sparse coverage of extreme conditions and low spatial resolution (<= 640 x 480), which prevents comprehensive evaluation of detectors under challenging scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose PEOD, the first large-scale, pixel-aligned and high-resolution (1280 x 720) Event-RGB dataset for object detection under challenge conditions. PEOD contains 130+ spatiotemporal-aligned sequences and 340k manual bounding boxes, with 57% of data captured under low-light, overexposure, and high-speed motion. Furthermore, we benchmark 14 methods across three input configurations (Event-based, RGB-based, and Event-RGB fusion) on PEOD. On the full test set and normal subset, fusion-based models achieve the excellent performance. However, in illumination challenge subset, the top event-based model outperforms all fusion models, while fusion models still outperform their RGB-based counterparts, indicating limits of existing fusion methods when the frame modality is severely degraded. PEOD establishes a realistic, high-quality benchmark for multimodal perception and facilitates future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of expensive manual annotation in multimodal learning and the scarcity of annotated data, particularly the under-explored area of multimodal domain adaptation where different modalities experience varying domain shifts.

Method: Uses information bottleneck to learn modality representations independently, matches source and target domains with correlation alignment, formulates as multi-objective optimization for Pareto optimal solution, simplified to quadratic programming with closed-form solution.

Result: Extensive empirical results show Boomda outperforms competing schemes, demonstrating effectiveness in multimodal domain adaptation.

Conclusion: Boomda provides an efficient modality-balanced multimodal domain adaptation algorithm that successfully addresses the challenge of varying domain shifts across different modalities.

Abstract: Multimodal learning, while contributing to numerous success stories across various fields, faces the challenge of prohibitively expensive manual annotation. To address the scarcity of annotated data, a popular solution is unsupervised domain adaptation, which has been extensively studied in unimodal settings yet remains less explored in multimodal settings. In this paper, we investigate heterogeneous multimodal domain adaptation, where the primary challenge is the varying domain shifts of different modalities from the source to the target domain. We first introduce the information bottleneck method to learn representations for each modality independently, and then match the source and target domains in the representation space with correlation alignment. To balance the domain alignment of all modalities, we formulate the problem as a multi-objective task, aiming for a Pareto optimal solution. By exploiting the properties specific to our model, the problem can be simplified to a quadratic programming problem. Further approximation yields a closed-form solution, leading to an efficient modality-balanced multimodal domain adaptation algorithm. The proposed method features \textbf{B}alanced multi-\textbf{o}bjective \textbf{o}ptimization for \textbf{m}ultimodal \textbf{d}omain \textbf{a}daptation, termed \textbf{Boomda}. Extensive empirical results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approach and demonstrate that Boomda outperforms the competing schemes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a Non-Aligned Reference (NAR-IQA) framework for evaluating Novel View Synthesis image quality when reference views share content but lack pixel alignment, using contrastive learning with synthetic distortions to achieve robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Full-Reference IQA methods fail with misaligned references, while No-Reference methods struggle with generalization for Novel View Synthesis quality assessment.

Method: Built a large-scale dataset with synthetic distortions targeting Temporal Regions of Interest, trained a contrastive learning model using LoRA-enhanced DINOv2 embeddings supervised by existing IQA methods, avoiding overfitting to specific real NVS samples.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art FR-IQA, NR-IQA, and NAR-IQA methods on both aligned and non-aligned references, with strong correlation to human preferences in user studies.

Conclusion: The proposed NAR-IQA framework effectively addresses the challenge of quality assessment for Novel View Synthesis with non-aligned references, demonstrating superior generalization and correlation with human perception.

Abstract: Evaluating the perceptual quality of Novel View Synthesis (NVS) images remains a key challenge, particularly in the absence of pixel-aligned ground truth references. Full-Reference Image Quality Assessment (FR-IQA) methods fail under misalignment, while No-Reference (NR-IQA) methods struggle with generalization. In this work, we introduce a Non-Aligned Reference (NAR-IQA) framework tailored for NVS, where it is assumed that the reference view shares partial scene content but lacks pixel-level alignment. We constructed a large-scale image dataset containing synthetic distortions targeting Temporal Regions of Interest (TROI) to train our NAR-IQA model. Our model is built on a contrastive learning framework that incorporates LoRA-enhanced DINOv2 embeddings and is guided by supervision from existing IQA methods. We train exclusively on synthetically generated distortions, deliberately avoiding overfitting to specific real NVS samples and thereby enhancing the model's generalization capability. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art FR-IQA, NR-IQA, and NAR-IQA methods, achieving robust performance on both aligned and non-aligned references. We also conducted a novel user study to gather data on human preferences when viewing non-aligned references in NVS. We find strong correlation between our proposed quality prediction model and the collected subjective ratings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LandSegmenter is a Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) foundation model framework that addresses data scarcity in remote sensing through weak supervision, cross-modal feature extraction, and zero-shot transfer learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LULC models are limited by modality-specific designs and fixed taxonomies, while foundation models require costly labeled data that's impractical in remote sensing.

Method: Uses LAS dataset with weak labels from existing LULC products, integrates RS-specific adapter for cross-modal features and text encoder for semantics, and employs class-wise confidence-guided fusion for zero-shot performance.

Result: Achieves competitive or superior performance on six LULC datasets, particularly excelling in zero-shot transfer to unseen datasets.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates efficacy of weak supervision for building task-specific foundation models and enables scalable LULC mapping across diverse domains.

Abstract: Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) mapping is a fundamental task in Earth Observation (EO). However, current LULC models are typically developed for a specific modality and a fixed class taxonomy, limiting their generability and broader applicability. Recent advances in foundation models (FMs) offer promising opportunities for building universal models. Yet, task-agnostic FMs often require fine-tuning for downstream applications, whereas task-specific FMs rely on massive amounts of labeled data for training, which is costly and impractical in the remote sensing (RS) domain. To address these challenges, we propose LandSegmenter, an LULC FM framework that resolves three-stage challenges at the input, model, and output levels. From the input side, to alleviate the heavy demand on labeled data for FM training, we introduce LAnd Segment (LAS), a large-scale, multi-modal, multi-source dataset built primarily with globally sampled weak labels from existing LULC products. LAS provides a scalable, cost-effective alternative to manual annotation, enabling large-scale FM training across diverse LULC domains. For model architecture, LandSegmenter integrates an RS-specific adapter for cross-modal feature extraction and a text encoder for semantic awareness enhancement. At the output stage, we introduce a class-wise confidence-guided fusion strategy to mitigate semantic omissions and further improve LandSegmenter's zero-shot performance. We evaluate LandSegmenter on six precisely annotated LULC datasets spanning diverse modalities and class taxonomies. Extensive transfer learning and zero-shot experiments demonstrate that LandSegmenter achieves competitive or superior performance, particularly in zero-shot settings when transferred to unseen datasets. These results highlight the efficacy of our proposed framework and the utility of weak supervision for building task-specific FMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ZSL methods overlook intrinsic interactions between local region features, which could improve transferable and explicit visual feature acquisition for better unseen class recognition.

Method: Uses multi-granularity feature extraction to learn region-level discriminative features through decoupled region feature mining, and cross-granularity feature fusion to strengthen interactions between region features of varying granularities.

Result: Extensive experiments on three popular ZSL benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority and competitiveness of the proposed Mg-MRN method.

Conclusion: The Mg-MRN network effectively refines discriminative and transferable visual features through multi-granularity learning and cross-granularity interactions, improving ZSL recognition performance.

Abstract: Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize unseen classes with zero samples by transferring semantic knowledge from seen classes. Current approaches typically correlate global visual features with semantic information (i.e., attributes) or align local visual region features with corresponding attributes to enhance visual-semantic interactions. Although effective, these methods often overlook the intrinsic interactions between local region features, which can further improve the acquisition of transferable and explicit visual features. In this paper, we propose a network named Multi-Granularity Mutual Refinement Network (Mg-MRN), which refine discriminative and transferable visual features by learning decoupled multi-granularity features and cross-granularity feature interactions. Specifically, we design a multi-granularity feature extraction module to learn region-level discriminative features through decoupled region feature mining. Then, a cross-granularity feature fusion module strengthens the inherent interactions between region features of varying granularities. This module enhances the discriminability of representations at each granularity level by integrating region representations from adjacent hierarchies, further improving ZSL recognition performance. Extensive experiments on three popular ZSL benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority and competitiveness of our proposed Mg-MRN method.

TL;DR: Proposes a shadow generation framework using Keypoints Linear Model (KPLM) and Shadow Triangle Algorithm (STA) to create realistic shadows in image composition, addressing limitations of existing diffusion-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based methods like IC-Light fail to produce shadows with both high appearance realism and geometric precision in composite images, especially for articulated human bodies.

Method: Uses KPLM to model articulated human bodies with 9 keypoints and 1 bounding block for physically plausible shadow projection, and STA for geometric accuracy through explicit formulations of shadow angles, lengths, and positions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on shadow realism benchmarks, particularly for complex human poses, and generalizes well to multi-directional relighting scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the challenge of generating realistic and geometrically accurate shadows in image composition, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly integrate a foreground object into a background, where generating realistic and geometrically accurate shadows remains a persistent challenge. While recent diffusion-based methods have outperformed GAN-based approaches, existing techniques, such as the diffusion-based relighting framework IC-Light, still fall short in producing shadows with both high appearance realism and geometric precision, especially in composite images. To address these limitations, we propose a novel shadow generation framework based on a Keypoints Linear Model (KPLM) and a Shadow Triangle Algorithm (STA). KPLM models articulated human bodies using nine keypoints and one bounding block, enabling physically plausible shadow projection and dynamic shading across joints, thereby enhancing visual realism. STA further improves geometric accuracy by computing shadow angles, lengths, and spatial positions through explicit geometric formulations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on shadow realism benchmarks, particularly under complex human poses, and generalizes effectively to multi-directional relighting scenarios such as those supported by IC-Light.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Distributed Zero-Shot Learning (DistZSL) framework that can fully exploit decentralized data to learn an effective model for unseen classes. Considering the data heterogeneity issues across distributed nodes, we introduce two key components to ensure the effective learning of DistZSL: a cross-node attribute regularizer and a global attribute-to-visual consensus. Our proposed cross-node attribute regularizer enforces the distances between attribute features to be similar across different nodes. In this manner, the overall attribute feature space would be stable during learning, and thus facilitate the establishment of visual-to-attribute(V2A) relationships. Then, we introduce the global attribute-tovisual consensus to mitigate biased V2A mappings learned from individual nodes. Specifically, we enforce the bilateral mapping between the attribute and visual feature distributions to be consistent across different nodes. Thus, the learned consistent V2A mapping can significantly enhance zero-shot learning across different nodes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DistZSL achieves superior performance to the state-of-the-art in learning from distributed data.

*Samet Hicsonmez,Abd El Rahman Shabayek,Djamila Aouada*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMDiff is a novel unsupervised multi-class visual anomaly detection framework that combines Latent Diffusion Models with Vision-Language Models to improve anomaly localization and detection without requiring per-class training or manual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based anomaly detection methods rely on synthetic noise generation and require per-class model training, which limits their generalization and scalability for multi-class real-world image analysis.

Method: Integrates pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) - VLM extracts detailed image descriptions using simple prompts, which serve as conditioning for LDM training to learn robust normal image feature representations for multi-class anomaly detection.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with significant improvements: increases pixel-level Per-Region-Overlap (PRO) metric by up to 25 points on Real-IAD dataset and 8 points on COCO-AD dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art diffusion-based approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed VLMDiff framework effectively combines VLM and LDM for unsupervised multi-class visual anomaly detection, demonstrating superior performance and scalability compared to existing diffusion-based methods.

Abstract: Detecting visual anomalies in diverse, multi-class real-world images is a significant challenge. We introduce \ours, a novel unsupervised multi-class visual anomaly detection framework. It integrates a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) with a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for enhanced anomaly localization and detection. Specifically, a pre-trained VLM with a simple prompt extracts detailed image descriptions, serving as additional conditioning for LDM training. Current diffusion-based methods rely on synthetic noise generation, limiting their generalization and requiring per-class model training, which hinders scalability. \ours, however, leverages VLMs to obtain normal captions without manual annotations or additional training. These descriptions condition the diffusion model, learning a robust normal image feature representation for multi-class anomaly detection. Our method achieves competitive performance, improving the pixel-level Per-Region-Overlap (PRO) metric by up to 25 points on the Real-IAD dataset and 8 points on the COCO-AD dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art diffusion-based approaches.

*Kaitao Huang,Yan Yan,Jing-Hao Xue,Hanzi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WarpGAN introduces a warping-and-inpainting strategy to improve 3D GAN inversion for single-shot novel view synthesis, addressing poor quality in occluded regions by incorporating image inpainting with symmetry and multi-view consistency priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D GAN inversion methods focus on visible region reconstruction but generate poor quality occluded regions due to information loss from low bit-rate latent codes, limiting realistic novel view synthesis.

Method: Uses 3D GAN inversion encoder to get latent code, warps to novel view using generated depth map, then employs SVINet with symmetry prior and multi-view correspondence to inpaint occluded regions in warped images.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative experiments show WarpGAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in novel view synthesis quality.

Conclusion: The warping-and-inpainting strategy effectively addresses occluded region quality issues in 3D GAN inversion, enabling more realistic and consistent single-shot novel view synthesis.

Abstract: 3D GAN inversion projects a single image into the latent space of a pre-trained 3D GAN to achieve single-shot novel view synthesis, which requires visible regions with high fidelity and occluded regions with realism and multi-view consistency. However, existing methods focus on the reconstruction of visible regions, while the generation of occluded regions relies only on the generative prior of 3D GAN. As a result, the generated occluded regions often exhibit poor quality due to the information loss caused by the low bit-rate latent code. To address this, we introduce the warping-and-inpainting strategy to incorporate image inpainting into 3D GAN inversion and propose a novel 3D GAN inversion method, WarpGAN. Specifically, we first employ a 3D GAN inversion encoder to project the single-view image into a latent code that serves as the input to 3D GAN. Then, we perform warping to a novel view using the depth map generated by 3D GAN. Finally, we develop a novel SVINet, which leverages the symmetry prior and multi-view image correspondence w.r.t. the same latent code to perform inpainting of occluded regions in the warped image. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.

### [75] [Pixel-level Quality Assessment for Oriented Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08186)
*Yunhui Zhu,Buliao Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Pixel-level Quality Assessment (PQA) to replace box-level IoU prediction in oriented object detection, addressing structural coupling issues by measuring pixel-level spatial consistency between predicted and ground-truth boxes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing box-level IoU prediction suffers from structural coupling where predicted IoU can be overestimated for poorly localized boxes, since the predicted box is derived from the detector's internal GT estimation.

Method: PQA framework measures pixel-level spatial consistency by comparing each pixel's relative position to predicted vs GT boxes, avoiding direct box comparison. Introduces integration metric to aggregate pixel-level consistency into unified quality score.

Result: Extensive experiments on HRSC2016 and DOTA show PQA improves performance when integrated into various oriented object detectors (+5.96% AP50:95 on Rotated RetinaNet, +2.32% on STD).

Conclusion: PQA provides more accurate localization quality assessment by eliminating similarity bias in box-level IoU prediction through pixel-level spatial consistency measurement.

Abstract: Modern oriented object detectors typically predict a set of bounding boxes and select the top-ranked ones based on estimated localization quality. Achieving high detection performance requires that the estimated quality closely aligns with the actual localization accuracy. To this end, existing approaches predict the Intersection over Union (IoU) between the predicted and ground-truth (GT) boxes as a proxy for localization quality. However, box-level IoU prediction suffers from a structural coupling issue: since the predicted box is derived from the detector's internal estimation of the GT box, the predicted IoU--based on their similarity--can be overestimated for poorly localized boxes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Pixel-level Quality Assessment (PQA) framework, which replaces box-level IoU prediction with the integration of pixel-level spatial consistency. PQA measures the alignment between each pixel's relative position to the predicted box and its corresponding position to the GT box. By operating at the pixel level, PQA avoids directly comparing the predicted box with the estimated GT box, thereby eliminating the inherent similarity bias in box-level IoU prediction. Furthermore, we introduce a new integration metric that aggregates pixel-level spatial consistency into a unified quality score, yielding a more accurate approximation of the actual localization quality. Extensive experiments on HRSC2016 and DOTA demonstrate that PQA can be seamlessly integrated into various oriented object detectors, consistently improving performance (e.g., +5.96% AP$_{50:95}$ on Rotated RetinaNet and +2.32% on STD).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UI2Code^N is a visual language model that introduces an interactive UI-to-code paradigm with multimodal coding capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance comparable to leading closed-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UI programming is complex, and existing visual language models have underdeveloped multimodal coding capabilities and limited use of iterative visual feedback, failing to reflect real-world workflows.

Method: UI2Code^N uses staged pretraining, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning to unify three capabilities: UI-to-code generation, UI editing, and UI polishing. It employs test-time scaling for interactive generation with multi-turn feedback.

Result: UI2Code^N establishes new state-of-the-art performance on UI-to-code and UI polishing benchmarks among open-source models, achieving performance comparable to leading closed-source models like Claude-4-Sonnet and GPT-5.

Conclusion: The interactive UI-to-code paradigm with UI2Code^N demonstrates foundational improvements in multimodal coding and enables systematic use of multi-turn feedback, better reflecting real-world development workflows.

Abstract: User interface (UI) programming is a core yet highly complex part of modern software development. Recent advances in visual language models (VLMs) highlight the potential of automatic UI coding, but current approaches face two key limitations: multimodal coding capabilities remain underdeveloped, and single-turn paradigms make little use of iterative visual feedback. We address these challenges with an interactive UI-to-code paradigm that better reflects real-world workflows and raises the upper bound of achievable performance. Under this paradigm, we present UI2Code$^\text{N}$, a visual language model trained through staged pretraining, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning to achieve foundational improvements in multimodal coding. The model unifies three key capabilities: UI-to-code generation, UI editing, and UI polishing. We further explore test-time scaling for interactive generation, enabling systematic use of multi-turn feedback. Experiments on UI-to-code and UI polishing benchmarks show that UI2Code$^\text{N}$ establishes a new state of the art among open-source models and achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models such as Claude-4-Sonnet and GPT-5.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel loss function for open-set recognition in medical imaging that uses auxiliary datasets to penalize open space regions, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple medical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical AI faces challenges with limited data due to ethical/legal restrictions and high annotation costs, especially for rare diseases. Open-set recognition is crucial to identify unknown classes not seen during training.

Method: Introduces a loss function that leverages features clustering around class means arranged as simplex vertices, and uses auxiliary datasets to penalize open space regions for effective rejection of unknown samples.

Result: Achieves significant performance gains across four MedMNIST datasets (BloodMNIST, OCTMNIST, DermaMNIST, TissueMNIST) and a public skin dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses open-set recognition challenges in medical imaging by leveraging auxiliary data and geometric properties of feature representations, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Driven by advancements in deep learning, computer-aided diagnoses have made remarkable progress. However, outside controlled laboratory settings, algorithms may encounter several challenges. In the medical domain, these difficulties often stem from limited data availability due to ethical and legal restrictions, as well as the high cost and time required for expert annotations-especially in the face of emerging or rare diseases. In this context, open-set recognition plays a vital role by identifying whether a sample belongs to one of the known classes seen during training or should be rejected as an unknown. Recent studies have shown that features learned in the later stages of deep neural networks are observed to cluster around their class means, which themselves are arranged as individual vertices of a regular simplex [32]. The proposed method introduces a loss function designed to reject samples of unknown classes effectively by penalizing open space regions using auxiliary datasets. This approach achieves significant performance gain across four MedMNIST datasets-BloodMNIST, OCTMNIST, DermaMNIST, TissueMNIST and a publicly available skin dataset [29] outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

TL;DR: Large image-to-3D generative models have strong canonical view bias, struggling with rotated inputs. A lightweight CNN can detect and correct orientation to restore performance without modifying the main model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and address the opacity in inductive biases of large-scale image-to-3D generative models, specifically their strong canonical view bias that limits generalization across viewpoints.

Method: Used controlled experiments with simple 2D rotations on Hunyuan3D 2.0 model, then implemented a lightweight CNN to detect and correct input orientation without modifying the generative backbone.

Result: State-of-the-art models show degraded performance under rotated inputs, but this can be mitigated by the orientation-correction CNN, restoring model performance.

Conclusion: Scale alone may not be sufficient for robust 3D generation; modular, symmetry-aware designs should be pursued to address fundamental biases in current models.

Abstract: Despite their impressive results, large-scale image-to-3D generative models remain opaque in their inductive biases. We identify a significant limitation in image-conditioned 3D generative models: a strong canonical view bias. Through controlled experiments using simple 2D rotations, we show that the state-of-the-art Hunyuan3D 2.0 model can struggle to generalize across viewpoints, with performance degrading under rotated inputs. We show that this failure can be mitigated by a lightweight CNN that detects and corrects input orientation, restoring model performance without modifying the generative backbone. Our findings raise an important open question: Is scale enough, or should we pursue modular, symmetry-aware designs?

*Rizal Khoirul Anam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a comparative evaluation of a multimodal pipeline for food recognition, combining EfficientNet-B4 for visual classification with Google's Gemini LLM for generative output (nutritional data and recipes). The study analyzes trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency, and output quality, and introduces the concept of Semantic Error Propagation to examine how visual classification errors affect downstream generative results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of digital food applications requires robust automated nutritional analysis and culinary guidance methods. The paper aims to address cultural bias in existing datasets and evaluate the trade-offs between visual classification accuracy, model efficiency, and generative output quality in multimodal food recognition systems.

Method: The authors developed a decoupled multimodal pipeline integrating a visual backbone (EfficientNet-B4) with a generative LLM (Google's Gemini). They benchmarked this against alternative vision models (VGG-16, ResNet-50, YOLOv8) and a lightweight LLM (Gemma). They introduced the concept of Semantic Error Propagation (SEP) to analyze error cascading and used a new Custom Chinese Food Dataset (CCFD) to address cultural bias.

Result: EfficientNet-B4 achieved 89.0% Top-1 accuracy with the best balance of accuracy and efficiency, while Gemini achieved 9.2/10 factual accuracy for superior generative quality. However, the system's overall utility was bottlenecked by the visual front-end's perceptive accuracy. High semantic similarity between food classes was identified as the most critical failure mode.

Conclusion: While the multimodal pipeline shows promise, its effectiveness is fundamentally limited by the accuracy of the visual classification component. The study highlights that semantic similarity between food classes poses significant challenges, and improvements in visual perception are crucial for enhancing the overall system performance in food recognition applications.

Abstract: The proliferation of digital food applications necessitates robust methods for automated nutritional analysis and culinary guidance. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative evaluation of a decoupled, multimodal pipeline for food recognition. We evaluate a system integrating a specialized visual backbone (EfficientNet-B4) with a powerful generative large language model (Google's Gemini LLM). The core objective is to evaluate the trade-offs between visual classification accuracy, model efficiency, and the quality of generative output (nutritional data and recipes). We benchmark this pipeline against alternative vision backbones (VGG-16, ResNet-50, YOLOv8) and a lightweight LLM (Gemma). We introduce a formalization for "Semantic Error Propagation" (SEP) to analyze how classification inaccuracies from the visual module cascade into the generative output. Our analysis is grounded in a new Custom Chinese Food Dataset (CCFD) developed to address cultural bias in public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that while EfficientNet-B4 (89.0\% Top-1 Acc.) provides the best balance of accuracy and efficiency, and Gemini (9.2/10 Factual Accuracy) provides superior generative quality, the system's overall utility is fundamentally bottlenecked by the visual front-end's perceptive accuracy. We conduct a detailed per-class analysis, identifying high semantic similarity as the most critical failure mode.

Conclusion: The geometry-guided pipeline provides a simple, practical solution for real-world 3D super-resolution, particularly valuable when high-resolution RGB data is inaccessible, with both high-accuracy and high-efficiency implementation options available.

Abstract: We introduce 2Dto3D-SR, a versatile framework for real-time single-view 3D super-resolution that eliminates the need for high-resolution RGB guidance. Our framework encodes 3D data from a single viewpoint into a structured 2D representation, enabling the direct application of existing 2D image super-resolution architectures. We utilize the Projected Normalized Coordinate Code (PNCC) to represent 3D geometry from a visible surface as a regular image, thereby circumventing the complexities of 3D point-based or RGB-guided methods. This design supports lightweight and fast models adaptable to various deployment environments. We evaluate 2Dto3D-SR with two implementations: one using Swin Transformers for high accuracy, and another using Vision Mamba for high efficiency. Experiments show the Swin Transformer model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on standard benchmarks, while the Vision Mamba model delivers competitive results at real-time speeds.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes adaptive local region placement for point cloud surface reconstruction that modulates spacing and size based on curvature to improve accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods use uniform local regions with fixed sizes, limiting adaptability to geometric complexity variations in point cloud surface reconstruction.

Method: Adaptively modulates spacing and size of local regions based on input point cloud curvature rather than using uniform placement.

Result: Improves reconstruction accuracy and efficiency compared to fixed-size uniform region approaches.

Conclusion: Adaptive local region placement based on curvature enhances point cloud surface reconstruction performance.

Abstract: Point cloud surface reconstruction has improved in accuracy with advances in deep learning, enabling applications such as infrastructure inspection. Recent approaches that reconstruct from small local regions rather than entire point clouds have attracted attention for their strong generalization capability. However, prior work typically places local regions uniformly and keeps their size fixed, limiting adaptability to variations in geometric complexity. In this study, we propose a method that improves reconstruction accuracy and efficiency by adaptively modulating the spacing and size of local regions based on the curvature of the input point cloud.

TL;DR: A method that improves multimodal alignment by leveraging semantic relationships in vision-language fine-tuning, outperforming existing approaches on VQA and image captioning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language fine-tuning methods overlook semantic relationships within images that are highlighted in textual context, leading to suboptimal multimodal alignment performance.

Method: Extract multilevel semantic features from vision encoders, project vision features to group related semantics, and fuse visual-textual features using inheritable cross-attention that discards low-correlation feature pairs.

Result: The method was evaluated on eight foundation models and two downstream tasks (visual question answering and image captioning), outperforming all existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively improves multimodal alignment and fusion by incorporating both semantics and relationships, demonstrating superior performance across multiple foundation models and tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language fine-tuning has emerged as an efficient paradigm for constructing multimodal foundation models. While textual context often highlights semantic relationships within an image, existing fine-tuning methods typically overlook this information when aligning vision and language, thus leading to suboptimal performance. Toward solving this problem, we propose a method that can improve multimodal alignment and fusion based on both semantics and relationships.Specifically, we first extract multilevel semantic features from different vision encoder to capture more visual cues of the relationships. Then, we learn to project the vision features to group related semantics, among which are more likely to have relationships. Finally, we fuse the visual features with the textual by using inheritable cross-attention, where we globally remove the redundant visual relationships by discarding visual-language feature pairs with low correlation. We evaluate our proposed method on eight foundation models and two downstream tasks, visual question answering and image captioning, and show that it outperforms all existing methods.

TL;DR: DiPVNet is a novel point cloud processing method that addresses rotational variations through direction-perceptive vector networks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on classification and segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arbitrary rotations in point clouds disrupt intrinsic directional characteristics, and existing methods fail to fully exploit multiscale directional nature for enhanced feature representations.

Method: Proposes Direction-Perceptive Vector Network (DiPVNet) with atomic dot-product operator for directional selectivity and rotation invariance. Uses Learnable Local Dot-Product (L2DP) for local structures and direction-aware spherical Fourier transform (DASFT) for global directional modeling.

Result: Extensive experiments show DiPVNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on point cloud classification and segmentation, especially in challenging scenarios with noise and large-angle rotations.

Conclusion: DiPVNet effectively models rotational symmetry while maintaining adaptive directional perception, providing a robust solution for rotation-invariant point cloud processing.

Abstract: Point cloud processing has become a cornerstone technology in many 3D vision tasks. However, arbitrary rotations introduce variations in point cloud orientations, posing a long-standing challenge for effective representation learning. The core of this issue is the disruption of the point cloud's intrinsic directional characteristics caused by rotational perturbations. Recent methods attempt to implicitly model rotational equivariance and invariance, preserving directional information and propagating it into deep semantic spaces. Yet, they often fall short of fully exploiting the multiscale directional nature of point clouds to enhance feature representations. To address this, we propose the Direction-Perceptive Vector Network (DiPVNet). At its core is an atomic dot-product operator that simultaneously encodes directional selectivity and rotation invariance--endowing the network with both rotational symmetry modeling and adaptive directional perception. At the local level, we introduce a Learnable Local Dot-Product (L2DP) Operator, which enables interactions between a center point and its neighbors to adaptively capture the non-uniform local structures of point clouds. At the global level, we leverage generalized harmonic analysis to prove that the dot-product between point clouds and spherical sampling vectors is equivalent to a direction-aware spherical Fourier transform (DASFT). This leads to the construction of a global directional response spectrum for modeling holistic directional structures. We rigorously prove the rotation invariance of both operators. Extensive experiments on challenging scenarios involving noise and large-angle rotations demonstrate that DiPVNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on point cloud classification and segmentation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NERVE is a training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation method that integrates global and local information using stable diffusion self-attention, employs stochastic random walks for affinity refinement, and uses entropy-based uncertainty to select relevant attention maps without requiring conventional post-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training-free OVSS methods have limitations including expensive affinity refinement, ineffective fusion of transformer attention maps with equal weighting, and reliance on fixed-size Gaussian kernels that enforce isotropic neighborhoods.

Method: Integrates global and local information from stable diffusion self-attention layers, uses stochastic random walks for affinity refinement instead of fixed kernels, and employs entropy-based uncertainty to select the most relevant transformer attention maps.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot segmentation performance on 7 popular semantic segmentation benchmarks without requiring conventional post-processing techniques like CRF or PAMR.

Conclusion: NERVE provides an effective approach to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation by effectively delineating objects with arbitrary shapes through its novel integration of neighborhood structure and entropy-guided attention selection.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS), existing training-free methods face several limitations: use of computationally expensive affinity refinement strategies, ineffective fusion of transformer attention maps due to equal weighting or reliance on fixed-size Gaussian kernels to reinforce local spatial smoothness, enforcing isotropic neighborhoods. We propose a strong baseline for training-free OVSS termed as NERVE (Neighbourhood \& Entropy-guided Random-walk for open-Vocabulary sEgmentation), which uniquely integrates global and fine-grained local information, exploiting the neighbourhood structure from the self-attention layer of a stable diffusion model. We also introduce a stochastic random walk for refining the affinity rather than relying on fixed-size Gaussian kernels for local context. This spatial diffusion process encourages propagation across connected and semantically related areas, enabling it to effectively delineate objects with arbitrary shapes. Whereas most existing approaches treat self-attention maps from different transformer heads or layers equally, our method uses entropy-based uncertainty to select the most relevant maps. Notably, our method does not require any conventional post-processing techniques like Conditional Random Fields (CRF) or Pixel-Adaptive Mask Refinement (PAMR). Experiments are performed on 7 popular semantic segmentation benchmarks, yielding an overall state-of-the-art zero-shot segmentation performance, providing an effective approach to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-object image editing methods follow localize-editing paradigm but neglect critical inter-object interactions, leading to attention entanglements in conflict regions that cause either inter-object editing leakage or intra-object editing constraints.

Method: Proposes a "decompose-editing-fusion" framework with three modules: (1) Conflict-aware Layer Decomposition using attention-aware IoU and time-dependent region removing, (2) Object-layered Editing with coordinated intra-layer text guidance and cross-layer geometric mapping, (3) Transparency-guided Layer Fusion with structure-coherent fusion through transparency guidance learning.

Result: Extensive experiments show superiority over existing methods, demonstrating unprecedented intra-object controllability and inter-object coherence in complex multi-object scenarios.

Conclusion: LayerEdit successfully enables conflict-free multi-object image editing through precise object-layered decomposition and coherent fusion, addressing the limitations of existing methods that neglect inter-object interactions.

Abstract: Text-driven multi-object image editing which aims to precisely modify multiple objects within an image based on text descriptions, has recently attracted considerable interest. Existing works primarily follow the localize-editing paradigm, focusing on independent object localization and editing while neglecting critical inter-object interactions. However, this work points out that the neglected attention entanglements in inter-object conflict regions, inherently hinder disentangled multi-object editing, leading to either inter-object editing leakage or intra-object editing constraints. We thereby propose a novel multi-layer disentangled editing framework LayerEdit, a training-free method which, for the first time, through precise object-layered decomposition and coherent fusion, enables conflict-free object-layered editing. Specifically, LayerEdit introduces a novel "decompose-editingfusion" framework, consisting of: (1) Conflict-aware Layer Decomposition module, which utilizes an attention-aware IoU scheme and time-dependent region removing, to enhance conflict awareness and suppression for layer decomposition. (2) Object-layered Editing module, to establish coordinated intra-layer text guidance and cross-layer geometric mapping, achieving disentangled semantic and structural modifications. (3) Transparency-guided Layer Fusion module, to facilitate structure-coherent inter-object layer fusion through precise transparency guidance learning. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of LayerEdit over existing methods, showing unprecedented intra-object controllability and inter-object coherence in complex multi-object scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating ground-level images from aerial views is challenging due to extreme viewpoint disparity, occlusions, and limited field of view. Existing methods often rely on intermediate representations, which can be limiting.

Method: Uses diffusion-based approach conditioned on joint representation of VAE-encoded spatial features (from aerial RGB images and estimated height maps) and CLIP-based semantic embeddings, avoiding intermediate representations like depth maps or 3D voxels.

Result: Achieves 7.3% average improvement in SSIM across CVUSA, CVACT, and Auto Arborist datasets, demonstrating robust handling of both wide and narrow fields of view with strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: Top2Ground effectively generates photorealistic ground-view images directly from aerial inputs by combining geometric constraints from 3D structure with semantic consistency, showing superior performance and generalization across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Generating ground-level images from aerial views is a challenging task due to extreme viewpoint disparity, occlusions, and a limited field of view. We introduce Top2Ground, a novel diffusion-based method that directly generates photorealistic ground-view images from aerial input images without relying on intermediate representations such as depth maps or 3D voxels. Specifically, we condition the denoising process on a joint representation of VAE-encoded spatial features (derived from aerial RGB images and an estimated height map) and CLIP-based semantic embeddings. This design ensures the generation is both geometrically constrained by the scene's 3D structure and semantically consistent with its content. We evaluate Top2Ground on three diverse datasets: CVUSA, CVACT, and the Auto Arborist. Our approach shows 7.3% average improvement in SSIM across three benchmark datasets, showing Top2Ground can robustly handle both wide and narrow fields of view, highlighting its strong generalization capabilities.

*Yue Min,Shaobo Wang,Jiaze Li,Tianle Niu,Junxin Fan,Yongliang Miao,Lijin Yang,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImageBindDC is a novel multimodal data condensation framework that uses ImageBind's unified feature space and Characteristic Function loss to preserve inter-modal dependencies through uni-modal, cross-modal, and joint-modal alignment, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal condensed data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data condensation methods work well for unimodal data but fail in multimodal scenarios where preserving complex inter-modal dependencies is crucial for maintaining semantic relationships across different data types.

Method: The framework operates in ImageBind's unified feature space and employs Characteristic Function loss in the Fourier domain for precise statistical alignment. It enforces three levels of distributional consistency: uni-modal alignment (within each modality), cross-modal alignment (pairwise semantics), and joint-modal alignment (complete multivariate structure).

Result: On NYU-v2 dataset, models trained on just 5 condensed datapoints per class achieved lossless performance comparable to full dataset training, with 8.2% absolute improvement over previous best methods and over 4x faster condensation time.

Conclusion: ImageBindDC successfully addresses multimodal data condensation by preserving intricate inter-modal dependencies through comprehensive statistical alignment, enabling efficient model training with minimal condensed data while maintaining full dataset performance.

Abstract: Data condensation techniques aim to synthesize a compact dataset from a larger one to enable efficient model training, yet while successful in unimodal settings, they often fail in multimodal scenarios where preserving intricate inter-modal dependencies is crucial. To address this, we introduce ImageBindDC, a novel data condensation framework operating within the unified feature space of ImageBind. Our approach moves beyond conventional distribution-matching by employing a powerful Characteristic Function (CF) loss, which operates in the Fourier domain to facilitate a more precise statistical alignment via exact infinite moment matching. We design our objective to enforce three critical levels of distributional consistency: (i) uni-modal alignment, which matches the statistical properties of synthetic and real data within each modality; (ii) cross-modal alignment, which preserves pairwise semantics by matching the distributions of hybrid real-synthetic data pairs; and (iii) joint-modal alignment, which captures the complete multivariate data structure by aligning the joint distribution of real data pairs with their synthetic counterparts. Extensive experiments highlight the effectiveness of ImageBindDC: on the NYU-v2 dataset, a model trained on just 5 condensed datapoints per class achieves lossless performance comparable to one trained on the full dataset, achieving a new state-of-the-art with an 8.2\% absolute improvement over the previous best method and more than 4$\times$ less condensation time.

*Nan Bao,Yifan Zhao,Lin Zhu,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ESC framework for semantic segmentation in extreme conditions by unifying event and RGB modalities through edge-aware latent re-coding and uncertainty optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic segmentation methods fail in extreme conditions (low light, camera motion) due to RGB information loss, while event-RGB fusion suffers from feature heterogeneity and mismatch.

Method: Edge-awareness Semantic Concordance framework with: 1) Edge-awareness Latent Re-coding to align event-RGB features using edge dictionary clues, 2) Re-coded Consolidation and Uncertainty Optimization for heterogeneous fusion.

Result: Outperforms SOTA by 2.55% mIoU on DERS-XS dataset, shows superior resilience under spatial occlusion, with publicly available code and datasets.

Conclusion: ESC framework effectively addresses event-RGB heterogeneity in extreme conditions through edge-aware feature alignment and uncertainty optimization, achieving robust semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation has achieved great success in ideal conditions. However, when facing extreme conditions (e.g., insufficient light, fierce camera motion), most existing methods suffer from significant information loss of RGB, severely damaging segmentation results. Several researches exploit the high-speed and high-dynamic event modality as a complement, but event and RGB are naturally heterogeneous, which leads to feature-level mismatch and inferior optimization of existing multi-modality methods. Different from these researches, we delve into the edge secret of both modalities for resilient fusion and propose a novel Edge-awareness Semantic Concordance framework to unify the multi-modality heterogeneous features with latent edge cues. In this framework, we first propose Edge-awareness Latent Re-coding, which obtains uncertainty indicators while realigning event-RGB features into unified semantic space guided by re-coded distribution, and transfers event-RGB distributions into re-coded features by utilizing a pre-established edge dictionary as clues. We then propose Re-coded Consolidation and Uncertainty Optimization, which utilize re-coded edge features and uncertainty indicators to solve the heterogeneous event-RGB fusion issues under extreme conditions. We establish two synthetic and one real-world event-RGB semantic segmentation datasets for extreme scenario comparisons. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art by a 2.55% mIoU on our proposed DERS-XS, and possesses superior resilience under spatial occlusion. Our code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/iCVTEAM/ESC.

Conclusion: SWAN can accelerate image annotation while maintaining quality, offering a scalable and user-friendly alternative to conventional workflows, with particular appreciation for mobile device compatibility.

Abstract: The annotation of large scale histopathology image datasets remains a major bottleneck in developing robust deep learning models for clinically relevant tasks, such as mitotic figure classification. Folder-based annotation workflows are usually slow, fatiguing, and difficult to scale. To address these challenges, we introduce SWipeable ANnotations (SWAN), an open-source, MIT-licensed web application that enables intuitive image patch classification using a swiping gesture. SWAN supports both desktop and mobile platforms, offers real-time metadata capture, and allows flexible mapping of swipe gestures to class labels. In a pilot study with four pathologists annotating 600 mitotic figure image patches, we compared SWAN against a traditional folder-sorting workflow. SWAN enabled rapid annotations with pairwise percent agreement ranging from 86.52% to 93.68% (Cohen's Kappa = 0.61-0.80), while for the folder-based method, the pairwise percent agreement ranged from 86.98% to 91.32% (Cohen's Kappa = 0.63-0.75) for the task of classifying atypical versus normal mitotic figures, demonstrating high consistency between annotators and comparable performance. Participants rated the tool as highly usable and appreciated the ability to annotate on mobile devices. These results suggest that SWAN can accelerate image annotation while maintaining annotation quality, offering a scalable and user-friendly alternative to conventional workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAUGIF is an unsupervised general image fusion method that classifies fusion tasks into additive and multiplicative types, uses dual cross-image autoencoders to capture shared content and modality-specific details, and employs mechanism-aware decoders for selective feature injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fusion methods are either too task-specific or apply uniform strategies across diverse tasks, ignoring their distinct fusion mechanisms. This paper addresses the need for a general framework that adapts to different fusion mechanisms.

Method: Proposes dual cross-image autoencoders with shared latent space, dual encoders for common content and modality-specific details, and mechanism-aware decoders that selectively reintegrate unique characteristics during fusion process.

Result: Extensive experiments validate the method's effectiveness and generalization ability across diverse fusion tasks, with improved performance and interpretability.

Conclusion: MAUGIF provides a mechanism-aware approach to general image fusion that adapts to different fusion mechanisms (additive/multiplicative), achieving better performance and interpretability than uniform strategies.

Abstract: Image fusion aims to integrate structural and complementary information from multi-source images. However, existing fusion methods are often either highly task-specific, or general frameworks that apply uniform strategies across diverse tasks, ignoring their distinct fusion mechanisms. To address this issue, we propose a mechanism-aware unsupervised general image fusion (MAUGIF) method based on dual cross-image autoencoders. Initially, we introduce a classification of additive and multiplicative fusion according to the inherent mechanisms of different fusion tasks. Then, dual encoders map source images into a shared latent space, capturing common content while isolating modality-specific details. During the decoding phase, dual decoders act as feature injectors, selectively reintegrating the unique characteristics of each modality into the shared content for reconstruction. The modality-specific features are injected into the source image in the fusion process, generating the fused image that integrates information from both modalities. The architecture of decoders varies according to their fusion mechanisms, enhancing both performance and interpretability. Extensive experiments are conducted on diverse fusion tasks to validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our method. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MAUGIF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current weather data approaches are limited to single-variable, single-region tasks using deterministic modeling, which restricts unified synthesis across variables/regions, overlooks cross-variable complementarity, and causes over-smoothed results.

Method: Created SynWeather dataset covering four regions (Continental US, Europe, East Asia, Tropical Cyclones) with high-resolution observations of key variables. Developed SynWeatherDiff, a probabilistic weather synthesis model based on Diffusion Transformer framework.

Result: Experiments on SynWeather dataset show the model's effectiveness compared to both task-specific and general models.

Conclusion: The proposed SynWeather dataset and SynWeatherDiff model successfully address limitations of current approaches by enabling unified multi-region, multi-variable weather data synthesis with improved quality.

Abstract: With the advancement of meteorological instruments, abundant data has become available. Current approaches are typically focus on single-variable, single-region tasks and primarily rely on deterministic modeling. This limits unified synthesis across variables and regions, overlooks cross-variable complementarity and often leads to over-smoothed results. To address above challenges, we introduce SynWeather, the first dataset designed for Unified Multi-region and Multi-variable Weather Observation Data Synthesis. SynWeather covers four representative regions: the Continental United States, Europe, East Asia, and Tropical Cyclone regions, as well as provides high-resolution observations of key weather variables, including Composite Radar Reflectivity, Hourly Precipitation, Visible Light, and Microwave Brightness Temperature. In addition, we introduce SynWeatherDiff, a general and probabilistic weather synthesis model built upon the Diffusion Transformer framework to address the over-smoothed problem. Experiments on the SynWeather dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our network compared with both task-specific and general models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SkelSplat is a novel framework for multi-view 3D human pose estimation using differentiable Gaussian rendering that models human pose as a skeleton of 3D Gaussians, enabling view fusion without 3D ground-truth supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art multi-view methods rely on large annotated datasets and suffer from poor generalization when test scenarios differ from training data, limiting their practical applicability.

Method: Models human pose as a skeleton of 3D Gaussians (one per joint) with a novel one-hot encoding scheme, optimized via differentiable rendering to fuse arbitrary camera views without requiring 3D ground-truth supervision.

Result: Outperforms approaches without 3D ground truth in Human3.6M and CMU datasets, reduces cross-dataset error by up to 47.8% compared to learning-based methods, and demonstrates robustness to occlusions without scenario-specific fine-tuning.

Conclusion: SkelSplat provides an effective framework for multi-view 3D human pose estimation that generalizes well across datasets and scenarios while being robust to occlusions, without requiring 3D ground-truth annotations.

Abstract: Accurate 3D human pose estimation is fundamental for applications such as augmented reality and human-robot interaction. State-of-the-art multi-view methods learn to fuse predictions across views by training on large annotated datasets, leading to poor generalization when the test scenario differs. To overcome these limitations, we propose SkelSplat, a novel framework for multi-view 3D human pose estimation based on differentiable Gaussian rendering. Human pose is modeled as a skeleton of 3D Gaussians, one per joint, optimized via differentiable rendering to enable seamless fusion of arbitrary camera views without 3D ground-truth supervision. Since Gaussian Splatting was originally designed for dense scene reconstruction, we propose a novel one-hot encoding scheme that enables independent optimization of human joints. SkelSplat outperforms approaches that do not rely on 3D ground truth in Human3.6M and CMU, while reducing the cross-dataset error up to 47.8% compared to learning-based methods. Experiments on Human3.6M-Occ and Occlusion-Person demonstrate robustness to occlusions, without scenario-specific fine-tuning. Our project page is available here: https://skelsplat.github.io.

TL;DR: NeuSpring is a neural spring field method that improves physical digital twins of deformable objects by modeling intrinsic physical properties, achieving better reconstruction and simulation for both current state and future prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for physical digital twins of deformable objects focus on current state modeling but generalize poorly to future prediction because they ignore intrinsic physical properties, limiting physical learning.

Method: NeuSpring uses a neural spring field with two innovations: 1) piecewise topology solution for multi-region spring connections using zero-order optimization to handle material heterogeneity, and 2) neural spring field that represents spring properties across frames using a canonical coordinate-based neural network to leverage spatial associativity.

Result: Experiments show NeuSpring achieves superior reconstruction and simulation performance, with Chamfer distance improved by 20% for current state modeling and 25% for future prediction compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: NeuSpring effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by incorporating intrinsic physical properties through neural spring fields, enabling better physical learning for both current state modeling and future prediction of deformable objects.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to create physical digital twins of deformable objects under interaction. Existing methods focus more on the physical learning of current state modeling, but generalize worse to future prediction. This is because existing methods ignore the intrinsic physical properties of deformable objects, resulting in the limited physical learning in the current state modeling. To address this, we present NeuSpring, a neural spring field for the reconstruction and simulation of deformable objects from videos. Built upon spring-mass models for realistic physical simulation, our method consists of two major innovations: 1) a piecewise topology solution that efficiently models multi-region spring connection topologies using zero-order optimization, which considers the material heterogeneity of real-world objects. 2) a neural spring field that represents spring physical properties across different frames using a canonical coordinate-based neural network, which effectively leverages the spatial associativity of springs for physical learning. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our NeuSping achieves superior reconstruction and simulation performance for current state modeling and future prediction, with Chamfer distance improved by 20% and 25%, respectively.

*Simone Ricci,Niccolò Biondi,Federico Pernici,Alberto Del Bimbo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a method to reduce negative flips (misclassifications by updated models on previously correct samples) in image classification by preserving original model margins while learning new classes, using margin-calibration and double-source focal distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Minimizing inconsistencies across successive AI versions is crucial. In image classification, adding new classes reduces class margins and introduces conflicting patterns, causing negative flips where updated models misclassify previously correct samples.

Method: Preserves original model margins while learning improved model. Uses explicit margin-calibration term on logits to encourage larger relative margin between old and new classes. Integrates double-source focal distillation loss with previous model and new independently trained model to learn appropriate decision margins.

Result: Extensive experiments on image classification benchmarks show consistent reduction in negative flip rate while maintaining high overall accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively mitigates negative flips in model updates by balancing margin preservation and new class learning through margin-calibration and double-source distillation, achieving better consistency without sacrificing overall performance.

Abstract: Minimizing inconsistencies across successive versions of an AI system is as crucial as reducing the overall error. In image classification, such inconsistencies manifest as negative flips, where an updated model misclassifies test samples that were previously classified correctly. This issue becomes increasingly pronounced as the number of training classes grows over time, since adding new categories reduces the margin of each class and may introduce conflicting patterns that undermine their learning process, thereby degrading performance on the original subset. To mitigate negative flips, we propose a novel approach that preserves the margins of the original model while learning an improved one. Our method encourages a larger relative margin between the previously learned and newly introduced classes by introducing an explicit margin-calibration term on the logits. However, overly constraining the logit margin for the new classes can significantly degrade their accuracy compared to a new independently trained model. To address this, we integrate a double-source focal distillation loss with the previous model and a new independently trained model, learning an appropriate decision margin from both old and new data, even under a logit margin calibration. Extensive experiments on image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces the negative flip rate with high overall accuracy.

TL;DR: Image-based registration outperforms feature-based and implicit alignment methods for longitudinal mammogram analysis, improving breast cancer risk prediction accuracy and deformation field quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized mammography screening requires accurate spatial alignment of longitudinal mammograms, as misalignment can obscure tissue changes and degrade deep learning model performance for breast cancer risk prediction.

Method: Evaluated multiple alignment strategies: image-based registration, feature-level alignment with/without regularization, and implicit alignment methods using two large-scale mammography datasets.

Result: Image-based registration consistently outperformed other approaches across all metrics (predictive accuracy, precision, recall, deformation field quality), with applying image-based deformation fields in feature space yielding the best risk prediction performance.

Conclusion: Image-based deformation fields are crucial for spatial alignment in longitudinal risk modeling, offering improved prediction accuracy and robustness for personalized breast cancer screening interventions.

Abstract: Regular mammography screening is crucial for early breast cancer detection. By leveraging deep learning-based risk models, screening intervals can be personalized, especially for high-risk individuals. While recent methods increasingly incorporate longitudinal information from prior mammograms, accurate spatial alignment across time points remains a key challenge. Misalignment can obscure meaningful tissue changes and degrade model performance. In this study, we provide insights into various alignment strategies, image-based registration, feature-level (representation space) alignment with and without regularization, and implicit alignment methods, for their effectiveness in longitudinal deep learning-based risk modeling. Using two large-scale mammography datasets, we assess each method across key metrics, including predictive accuracy, precision, recall, and deformation field quality.
  Our results show that image-based registration consistently outperforms the more recently favored feature-based and implicit approaches across all metrics, enabling more accurate, temporally consistent predictions and generating smooth, anatomically plausible deformation fields. Although regularizing the deformation field improves deformation quality, it reduces the risk prediction performance of feature-level alignment. Applying image-based deformation fields within the feature space yields the best risk prediction performance.
  These findings underscore the importance of image-based deformation fields for spatial alignment in longitudinal risk modeling, offering improved prediction accuracy and robustness. This approach has strong potential to enhance personalized screening and enable earlier interventions for high-risk individuals. The code is available at https://github.com/sot176/Mammogram_Alignment_Study_Risk_Prediction.git, allowing full reproducibility of the results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: sEMG-based gesture recognition systems suffer from limited training data, leading to overfitting and poor generalization in deep learning models. Data augmentation can help but faces challenges in balancing faithfulness and diversity.

Method: Proposed SASG-DA with three key components: 1) Semantic Representation Guidance (SRG) for faithful generation, 2) Gaussian Modeling Semantic Modeling (GMSS) for flexible diversity, and 3) Sparse-Aware Semantic Sampling to explore underrepresented regions.

Result: Extensive experiments on Ninapro DB2, DB4, and DB7 datasets show SASG-DA significantly outperforms existing augmentation methods, effectively mitigating overfitting and improving recognition performance and generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed data augmentation approach successfully addresses sEMG data scarcity by generating both faithful and diverse samples, enhancing model performance and generalization in gesture recognition tasks.

Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG)-based gesture recognition plays a critical role in human-machine interaction (HMI), particularly for rehabilitation and prosthetic control. However, sEMG-based systems often suffer from the scarcity of informative training data, leading to overfitting and poor generalization in deep learning models. Data augmentation offers a promising approach to increasing the size and diversity of training data, where faithfulness and diversity are two critical factors to effectiveness. However, promoting untargeted diversity can result in redundant samples with limited utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel diffusion-based data augmentation approach, Sparse-Aware Semantic-Guided Diffusion Augmentation (SASG-DA). To enhance generation faithfulness, we introduce the Semantic Representation Guidance (SRG) mechanism by leveraging fine-grained, task-aware semantic representations as generation conditions. To enable flexible and diverse sample generation, we propose a Gaussian Modeling Semantic Modeling (GMSS) strategy, which models the semantic representation distribution and allows stochastic sampling to produce both faithful and diverse samples. To enhance targeted diversity, we further introduce a Sparse-Aware Semantic Sampling strategy to explicitly explore underrepresented regions, improving distribution coverage and sample utility. Extensive experiments on benchmark sEMG datasets, Ninapro DB2, DB4, and DB7, demonstrate that SASG-DA significantly outperforms existing augmentation methods. Overall, our proposed data augmentation approach effectively mitigates overfitting and improves recognition performance and generalization by offering both faithful and diverse samples.

Conclusion: VideoChain effectively generates coherent, contextually grounded, and reasoning-intensive questions across multiple video segments, addressing the gap in multi-hop video question generation.

Abstract: Multi-hop Question Generation (QG) effectively evaluates reasoning but remains confined to text; Video Question Generation (VideoQG) is limited to zero-hop questions over single segments.

TL;DR: SLOPE is a unified framework that effectively combines structured sparsity and low-bit quantization to reduce DNN model size while maintaining accuracy, achieving ~20× size reduction with ~99% original accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are too large and computationally expensive for resource-constrained devices. While weight quantization and structured sparsity individually help reduce model size, their combination typically harms accuracy significantly.

Method: Proposes SLOPE framework with training-time regularization that minimizes discrepancy between full-precision weights and sparse, quantized counterparts by promoting angular alignment rather than direct matching.

Result: Achieves ~20× model size reduction on ResNet-18 while retaining ~99% of original accuracy. Consistently outperforms state-of-the-art quantization and structured sparsity methods across classification, detection, and segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: SLOPE provides a principled way to combine structured sparsity and quantization, overcoming their compounded negative impact and enabling efficient DNN deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are used in many applications, but their large size and high computational cost make them hard to run on devices with limited resources. Two widely used techniques to address this challenge are weight quantization, which lowers the precision of all weights, and structured sparsity, which removes unimportant weights while retaining the important ones at full precision. Although both are effective individually, they are typically studied in isolation due to their compounded negative impact on model accuracy when combined. In this work, we introduce SLOPE Structured Sparsity at Low Precision), a unified framework, to effectively combine structured sparsity and low-bit quantization in a principled way. We show that naively combining sparsity and quantization severely harms performance due to the compounded impact of both techniques. To address this, we propose a training-time regularization strategy that minimizes the discrepancy between full-precision weights and their sparse, quantized counterparts by promoting angular alignment rather than direct matching. On ResNet-18, SLOPE achieves $\sim20\times$ model size reduction while retaining $\sim$99% of the original accuracy. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art quantization and structured sparsity methods across classification, detection, and segmentation tasks on models such as ResNet-18, ViT-Small, and Mask R-CNN.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MRI motion correction methods struggle to generalize across different motion types and body regions, with ML-based approaches often being tailored to specific applications and datasets. The authors hypothesize that motion artifacts share underlying patterns that can be disentangled and exploited.

Method: A hierarchical vector-quantized (VQ) variational auto-encoder that learns disentangled embeddings of motion-to-clean image features, using a codebook to capture finite motion patterns at multiple resolutions for coarse-to-fine correction. An auto-regressive model learns the prior distribution of motion-free images to guide the correction process.

Result: The method demonstrates robust correction across varying motion severity on simulated whole-body motion artifacts, effectively disentangling physical motion from simulated motion-effective scans and improving generalizability of ML-based MRI motion correction.

Conclusion: The approach shows potential for application across different anatomical regions and motion types by effectively disentangling motion features, offering a more generalizable solution compared to conventional artifact-specific methods.

Abstract: Physiological motion can affect the diagnostic quality of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While various retrospective motion correction methods exist, many struggle to generalize across different motion types and body regions. In particular, machine learning (ML)-based corrections are often tailored to specific applications and datasets. We hypothesize that motion artifacts, though diverse, share underlying patterns that can be disentangled and exploited. To address this, we propose a hierarchical vector-quantized (VQ) variational auto-encoder that learns a disentangled embedding of motion-to-clean image features. A codebook is deployed to capture finite collection of motion patterns at multiple resolutions, enabling coarse-to-fine correction. An auto-regressive model is trained to learn the prior distribution of motion-free images and is used at inference to guide the correction process. Unlike conventional approaches, our method does not require artifact-specific training and can generalize to unseen motion patterns. We demonstrate the approach on simulated whole-body motion artifacts and observe robust correction across varying motion severity. Our results suggest that the model effectively disentangled physical motion of the simulated motion-effective scans, therefore, improving the generalizability of the ML-based MRI motion correction. Our work of disentangling the motion features shed a light on its potential application across anatomical regions and motion types.

### [101] [A Circular Argument : Does RoPE need to be Equivariant for Vision?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08368)
*Chase van de Geijn,Timo Lüddecke,Polina Turishcheva,Alexander S. Ecker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper questions the importance of strict positional equivariance in RoPE, proposes Spherical RoPE with non-commutative generators, and finds it performs as well or better than equivariant versions, suggesting relative positional embeddings may not be crucial in computer vision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the conventional belief that Rotary Positional Encodings' success is due to positional equivariance, and to explore whether strict equivariance is necessary for good performance in higher-dimensional data like images.

Method: Mathematically analyzed RoPE as a general solution for equivariant positional embedding, then proposed Spherical RoPE which uses non-commutative generators instead of the commutative generators required for strict equivariance.

Result: Empirical evaluation showed Spherical RoPE has equivalent or better learning behavior compared to equivariant analogues like Mixed RoPE, suggesting relative positional embeddings may not be as important as believed in computer vision.

Conclusion: The findings challenge the necessity of relative positional embeddings in vision tasks, potentially enabling faster and better-generalizing positional encoding methods by removing the constraint of strict equivariance.

Abstract: Rotary Positional Encodings (RoPE) have emerged as a highly effective technique for one-dimensional sequences in Natural Language Processing spurring recent progress towards generalizing RoPE to higher-dimensional data such as images and videos. The success of RoPE has been thought to be due to its positional equivariance, i.e. its status as a relative positional encoding. In this paper, we mathematically show RoPE to be one of the most general solutions for equivariant positional embedding in one-dimensional data. Moreover, we show Mixed RoPE to be the analogously general solution for M-dimensional data, if we require commutative generators -- a property necessary for RoPE's equivariance. However, we question whether strict equivariance plays a large role in RoPE's performance. We propose Spherical RoPE, a method analogous to Mixed RoPE, but assumes non-commutative generators. Empirically, we find Spherical RoPE to have the equivalent or better learning behavior compared to its equivariant analogues. This suggests that relative positional embeddings are not as important as is commonly believed, at least within computer vision. We expect this discovery to facilitate future work in positional encodings for vision that can be faster and generalize better by removing the preconception that they must be relative.

TL;DR: Introduces Text-based Aerial-Ground Person Retrieval (TAG-PR) that retrieves person images from both aerial and ground views using text descriptions, addressing viewpoint discrepancy challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Text-based Person Retrieval focuses only on ground-view images, but real-world applications require retrieving persons across heterogeneous aerial and ground views with large viewpoint differences.

Method: Proposes TAG-CLIP framework with hierarchically-routed mixture of experts for view-specific/agnostic features and viewpoint decoupling strategy for better cross-modal alignment, plus TAG-PEDES dataset with diversified text generation.

Result: Developed TAG-PEDES dataset and TAG-CLIP framework that effectively handles view heterogeneity in aerial-ground person retrieval.

Conclusion: TAG-PR addresses practical challenges in cross-view person retrieval and provides both dataset and framework for future research in this domain.

Abstract: This work introduces Text-based Aerial-Ground Person Retrieval (TAG-PR), which aims to retrieve person images from heterogeneous aerial and ground views with textual descriptions. Unlike traditional Text-based Person Retrieval (T-PR), which focuses solely on ground-view images, TAG-PR introduces greater practical significance and presents unique challenges due to the large viewpoint discrepancy across images. To support this task, we contribute: (1) TAG-PEDES dataset, constructed from public benchmarks with automatically generated textual descriptions, enhanced by a diversified text generation paradigm to ensure robustness under view heterogeneity; and (2) TAG-CLIP, a novel retrieval framework that addresses view heterogeneity through a hierarchically-routed mixture of experts module to learn view-specific and view-agnostic features and a viewpoint decoupling strategy to decouple view-specific features for better cross-modal alignment. We evaluate the effectiveness of TAG-CLIP on both the proposed TAG-PEDES dataset and existing T-PR benchmarks. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/Flame-Chasers/TAG-PR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAPTR is a radar-based indoor 3D human pose estimation method that uses only weak supervision with 3D bounding boxes and 2D keypoints, avoiding expensive 3D keypoint annotations through a two-stage transformer architecture with pseudo-3D deformable attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional radar-based 3D pose estimation requires costly fine-grained 3D keypoint labels that are difficult to obtain in complex indoor environments with clutter, occlusions, or multiple people.

Method: Two-stage transformer architecture with pseudo-3D deformable attention: pose decoder estimates initial 3D poses using 3D template loss with BBox labels, and joint decoder refines poses using 2D keypoint labels and 3D gravity loss.

Result: Outperforms existing methods, reducing joint position error by 34.3% on HIBER dataset and 76.9% on MMVR dataset.

Conclusion: RAPTR demonstrates effective 3D human pose estimation from radar using only weak supervision, making the approach more scalable and practical for real-world indoor applications.

Abstract: Radar-based indoor 3D human pose estimation typically relied on fine-grained 3D keypoint labels, which are costly to obtain especially in complex indoor settings involving clutter, occlusions, or multiple people. In this paper, we propose \textbf{RAPTR} (RAdar Pose esTimation using tRansformer) under weak supervision, using only 3D BBox and 2D keypoint labels which are considerably easier and more scalable to collect. Our RAPTR is characterized by a two-stage pose decoder architecture with a pseudo-3D deformable attention to enhance (pose/joint) queries with multi-view radar features: a pose decoder estimates initial 3D poses with a 3D template loss designed to utilize the 3D BBox labels and mitigate depth ambiguities; and a joint decoder refines the initial poses with 2D keypoint labels and a 3D gravity loss. Evaluated on two indoor radar datasets, RAPTR outperforms existing methods, reducing joint position error by $34.3\%$ on HIBER and $76.9\%$ on MMVR.

TL;DR: Anatomy-VLM is a fine-grained vision-language model that incorporates multi-scale anatomical information and structured knowledge to achieve expert-level disease interpretation from radiology images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models treat images holistically and overlook fine-grained details crucial for medical diagnosis, while clinicians analyze specific anatomical structures as regions of interest using medical knowledge.

Method: 1) Localize key anatomical features from medical images, 2) Enrich regions with structured knowledge for contextual interpretation, 3) Align multi-scale medical information to generate clinically-interpretable disease predictions.

Result: Outstanding performance on both in- and out-of-distribution datasets, validated on downstream segmentation tasks, with zero-shot anatomy-wise interpretation capabilities demonstrating expert-level clinical interpretation.

Conclusion: Anatomy-VLM's fine-grained alignment effectively captures anatomical and pathology-related knowledge, providing strong clinical interpretation capabilities comparable to expert clinicians.

Abstract: Accurate disease interpretation from radiology remains challenging due to imaging heterogeneity. Achieving expert-level diagnostic decisions requires integration of subtle image features with clinical knowledge. Yet major vision-language models (VLMs) treat images as holistic entities and overlook fine-grained image details that are vital for disease diagnosis. Clinicians analyze images by utilizing their prior medical knowledge and identify anatomical structures as important region of interests (ROIs). Inspired from this human-centric workflow, we introduce Anatomy-VLM, a fine-grained, vision-language model that incorporates multi-scale information. First, we design a model encoder to localize key anatomical features from entire medical images. Second, these regions are enriched with structured knowledge for contextually-aware interpretation. Finally, the model encoder aligns multi-scale medical information to generate clinically-interpretable disease prediction. Anatomy-VLM achieves outstanding performance on both in- and out-of-distribution datasets. We also validate the performance of Anatomy-VLM on downstream image segmentation tasks, suggesting that its fine-grained alignment captures anatomical and pathology-related knowledge. Furthermore, the Anatomy-VLM's encoder facilitates zero-shot anatomy-wise interpretation, providing its strong expert-level clinical interpretation capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniAID is a novel AIGI detection framework that uses a decoupled Mixture-of-Experts architecture to separate content-specific flaws from universal artifacts, achieving superior generalization across diverse generative models and semantic content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AIGI detectors learn entangled forgery representations that conflate content-dependent flaws with content-agnostic artifacts, and are limited by outdated benchmarks, failing to generalize across diverse generative models and semantic content.

Method: Proposes OmniAID with a hybrid expert system: Routable Specialized Semantic Experts for distinct content domains (e.g., human, animal) plus a Fixed Universal Artifact Expert, trained using a two-stage strategy with domain-specific hard-sampling and lightweight gating network for input routing.

Result: Extensive experiments on traditional benchmarks and the new Mirage dataset show OmniAID surpasses existing monolithic detectors, establishing a new robust standard for AIGI authentication against modern threats.

Conclusion: By explicitly decoupling content-specific flaws from universal artifacts, OmniAID achieves robust generalization and sets a new standard for universal AIGI detection in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: A truly universal AI-Generated Image (AIGI) detector must simultaneously generalize across diverse generative models and varied semantic content. Current state-of-the-art methods learn a single, entangled forgery representation--conflating content-dependent flaws with content-agnostic artifacts--and are further constrained by outdated benchmarks. To overcome these limitations, we propose OmniAID, a novel framework centered on a decoupled Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. The core of our method is a hybrid expert system engineered to decouple: (1) semantic flaws across distinct content domains, and (2) these content-dependent flaws from content-agnostic universal artifacts. This system employs a set of Routable Specialized Semantic Experts, each for a distinct domain (e.g., human, animal), complemented by a Fixed Universal Artifact Expert. This architecture is trained using a bespoke two-stage strategy: we first train the experts independently with domain-specific hard-sampling to ensure specialization, and subsequently train a lightweight gating network for effective input routing. By explicitly decoupling "what is generated" (content-specific flaws) from "how it is generated" (universal artifacts), OmniAID achieves robust generalization. To address outdated benchmarks and validate real-world applicability, we introduce Mirage, a new large-scale, contemporary dataset. Extensive experiments, using both traditional benchmarks and our Mirage dataset, demonstrate our model surpasses existing monolithic detectors, establishing a new, robust standard for AIGI authentication against modern, in-the-wild threats.

TL;DR: Proposes DBPNet with Cross-Pyramid Consistency Regularization for semi-supervised medical image segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance by combining consistency learning and uncertainty minimization across dual decoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To effectively exploit unlabeled data for semi-supervised medical image segmentation by leveraging consistency regularization between multiple decoders at different pyramid levels.

Method: Hybrid Dual Branch Pyramid Network (DBPNet) with encoder and two slightly different decoders producing pyramid predictions, combined with Cross-Pyramid Consistency Regularization that extends soft-labeling to pyramid predictions across decoders.

Result: DBPNet with CPCR outperforms five state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods and shows comparable performance with recent methods on public benchmark dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid consistency learning approach with cross-pyramid regularization effectively leverages unlabeled data and achieves competitive performance in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) enables training of powerful models with the assumption of limited, carefully labelled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to support the learning. In this paper, we propose a hybrid consistency learning approach to effectively exploit unlabeled data for semi-supervised medical image segmentation by leveraging Cross-Pyramid Consistency Regularization (CPCR) between two decoders. First, we design a hybrid Dual Branch Pyramid Network (DBPNet), consisting of an encoder and two decoders that differ slightly, each producing a pyramid of perturbed auxiliary predictions across multiple resolution scales. Second, we present a learning strategy for this network named CPCR that combines existing consistency learning and uncertainty minimization approaches on the main output predictions of decoders with our novel regularization term. More specifically, in this term, we extend the soft-labeling setting to pyramid predictions across decoders to support knowledge distillation in deep hierarchical features. Experimental results show that DBPNet with CPCR outperforms five state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods and has comparable performance with recent ones on a public benchmark dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Contrastive Integrated Gradients (CIG) is a novel attribution method for Whole Slide Image analysis that enhances interpretability by computing contrastive gradients in logit space, providing sharper differentiation between tumor subtypes and satisfying theoretical axioms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attribution methods like Integrated Gradients capture model decision patterns but may overlook class-discriminative signals crucial for distinguishing tumor subtypes in computational pathology, limiting trust in AI-assisted diagnostics.

Method: CIG computes contrastive gradients in logit space by comparing feature importance relative to a reference class, highlights class-discriminative regions, satisfies integrated attribution axioms, and introduces MIL-AIC and MIL-SIC metrics for attribution quality evaluation.

Result: CIG demonstrated superior performance across three cancer datasets (CAMELYON16, TCGA-RCC, TCGA-Lung), yielding more informative attributions both quantitatively (using MIL-AIC/MIL-SIC metrics) and qualitatively with visualizations closely aligned with ground truth tumor regions.

Conclusion: CIG provides enhanced interpretability for WSI-based diagnostics, offering sharper tumor differentiation, theoretical soundness, and improved trustworthiness in AI-assisted pathology analysis.

Abstract: Interpretability is essential in Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis for computational pathology, where understanding model predictions helps build trust in AI-assisted diagnostics. While Integrated Gradients (IG) and related attribution methods have shown promise, applying them directly to WSIs introduces challenges due to their high-resolution nature. These methods capture model decision patterns but may overlook class-discriminative signals that are crucial for distinguishing between tumor subtypes. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Integrated Gradients (CIG), a novel attribution method that enhances interpretability by computing contrastive gradients in logit space. First, CIG highlights class-discriminative regions by comparing feature importance relative to a reference class, offering sharper differentiation between tumor and non-tumor areas. Second, CIG satisfies the axioms of integrated attribution, ensuring consistency and theoretical soundness. Third, we propose two attribution quality metrics, MIL-AIC and MIL-SIC, which measure how predictive information and model confidence evolve with access to salient regions, particularly under weak supervision. We validate CIG across three datasets spanning distinct cancer types: CAMELYON16 (breast cancer metastasis in lymph nodes), TCGA-RCC (renal cell carcinoma), and TCGA-Lung (lung cancer). Experimental results demonstrate that CIG yields more informative attributions both quantitatively, using MIL-AIC and MIL-SIC, and qualitatively, through visualizations that align closely with ground truth tumor regions, underscoring its potential for interpretable and trustworthy WSI-based diagnostics

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive methodology and comparative performance analysis for the automated classification and object detection of peripheral blood cells (PBCs) in microscopic images. Addressing the critical challenge of data scarcity and heterogeneity, robust data pipeline was first developed to standardize and merge four public datasets (PBC, BCCD, Chula, Sickle Cell) into a unified resource. Then employed a state-of-the-art Faster R-CNN object detection framework, leveraging a ResNet-50-FPN backbone. Comparative training rigorously evaluated a randomly initialized baseline model (Regimen 1) against a Transfer Learning Regimen (Regimen 2), initialized with weights pre-trained on the Microsoft COCO dataset. The results demonstrate that the Transfer Learning approach achieved significantly faster convergence and superior stability, culminating in a final validation loss of 0.08666, a substantial improvement over the baseline. This validated methodology establishes a robust foundation for building high-accuracy, deployable systems for automated hematological diagnosis.

Motivation: Vision-language models need embeddings that preserve semantic content while being discriminative for downstream tasks. The authors argue that comprehensive understanding and discriminative features can be decoupled and optimized separately.

Method: Proposes CoMa, a compressed pre-training phase that serves as a warm-up stage for contrastive learning, enabling transformation of VLMs into embedding models with minimal pre-training data.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art results among VLMs of comparable size on MMEB benchmark, demonstrating optimization in both efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: CoMa successfully decouples comprehensive understanding from discriminative feature learning, enabling efficient transformation of VLMs into competitive embedding models through minimal pre-training.

Abstract: Vision-language models advance multimodal representation learning by acquiring transferable semantic embeddings, thereby substantially enhancing performance across a range of vision-language tasks, including cross-modal retrieval, clustering, and classification. An effective embedding is expected to comprehensively preserve the semantic content of the input while simultaneously emphasizing features that are discriminative for downstream tasks. Recent approaches demonstrate that VLMs can be adapted into competitive embedding models via large-scale contrastive learning, enabling the simultaneous optimization of two complementary objectives. We argue that the two aforementioned objectives can be decoupled: a comprehensive understanding of the input facilitates the embedding model in achieving superior performance in downstream tasks via contrastive learning. In this paper, we propose CoMa, a compressed pre-training phase, which serves as a warm-up stage for contrastive learning. Experiments demonstrate that with only a small amount of pre-training data, we can transform a VLM into a competitive embedding model. CoMa achieves new state-of-the-art results among VLMs of comparable size on the MMEB, realizing optimization in both efficiency and effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning for 3D medical image segmentation is computationally expensive, and existing classifiers face trade-offs between speed and accuracy.

Method: Uses hierarchical sparse sampling to reduce computation while preserving hierarchical context, combined with Residual Transformer architecture to efficiently extract and combine multi-level information from sparse descriptors.

Result: Improved qualitative and quantitative segmentation performance compared to current fast organ classifiers on internal dataset (10,253 CT images) and TotalSegmentator dataset, achieving ~2.24 seconds on CPU.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates potential for real-time fine organ segmentation with fast speed and maintained accuracy.

Abstract: Multi-organ segmentation of 3D medical images is fundamental with meaningful applications in various clinical automation pipelines. Although deep learning has achieved superior performance, the time and memory consumption of segmenting the entire 3D volume voxel by voxel using neural networks can be huge. Classifiers have been developed as an alternative in cases with certain points of interest, but the trade-off between speed and accuracy remains an issue. Thus, we propose a novel fast multi-organ segmentation framework with the usage of hierarchical sparse sampling and a Residual Transformer. Compared with whole-volume analysis, the hierarchical sparse sampling strategy could successfully reduce computation time while preserving a meaningful hierarchical context utilizing multiple resolution levels. The architecture of the Residual Transformer segmentation network could extract and combine information from different levels of information in the sparse descriptor while maintaining a low computational cost. In an internal data set containing 10,253 CT images and the public dataset TotalSegmentator, the proposed method successfully improved qualitative and quantitative segmentation performance compared to the current fast organ classifier, with fast speed at the level of ~2.24 seconds on CPU hardware. The potential of achieving real-time fine organ segmentation is suggested.

Motivation: Real-world video applications require complex, iterative workflows that combine multiple AI capabilities, but current specialized models only handle isolated tasks, creating a gap in unified video processing.

Method: Uses Plan-and-Act dual-agent architecture: planner agent interprets user intentions and decomposes tasks, while executor agents execute through modular MCP-based tool servers. Features hierarchical multi-level memory for long-horizon reasoning and contextual continuity.

Result: Enables iterative any-conditioned video workflows (text/image/video-conditioned generation → editing → segmentation → synthesis) and introduces UniVA-Bench benchmark for evaluating agentic video systems.

Conclusion: UniVA and UniVA-Bench are open-sourced to advance research on interactive, agentic, and general-purpose video intelligence for next-generation multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: While specialized AI models excel at isolated video tasks like generation or understanding, real-world applications demand complex, iterative workflows that combine these capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce UniVA, an open-source, omni-capable multi-agent framework for next-generation video generalists that unifies video understanding, segmentation, editing, and generation into cohesive workflows. UniVA employs a Plan-and-Act dual-agent architecture that drives a highly automated and proactive workflow: a planner agent interprets user intentions and decomposes them into structured video-processing steps, while executor agents execute these through modular, MCP-based tool servers (for analysis, generation, editing, tracking, etc.). Through a hierarchical multi-level memory (global knowledge, task context, and user-specific preferences), UniVA sustains long-horizon reasoning, contextual continuity, and inter-agent communication, enabling interactive and self-reflective video creation with full traceability. This design enables iterative and any-conditioned video workflows (e.g., text/image/video-conditioned generation $\rightarrow$ multi-round editing $\rightarrow$ object segmentation $\rightarrow$ compositional synthesis) that were previously cumbersome to achieve with single-purpose models or monolithic video-language models. We also introduce UniVA-Bench, a benchmark suite of multi-step video tasks spanning understanding, editing, segmentation, and generation, to rigorously evaluate such agentic video systems. Both UniVA and UniVA-Bench are fully open-sourced, aiming to catalyze research on interactive, agentic, and general-purpose video intelligence for the next generation of multimodal AI systems.

Motivation: To improve digital communication accessibility for hearing-impaired individuals by leveraging 3D sign language data instead of 2D video, and to expand LLM capabilities beyond text-based inputs to understand embodied multimodal languages.

Method: Uses Large Language Models as backbone with 3D sign language data, exploring both direct translation from 3D gesture features to text and instruction-guided translation modulated by external prompts.

Result: Enables more accurate and resilient ASL translation by capturing rich spatial, gestural, and depth information in 3D scenes, offering flexible translation capabilities.

Conclusion: Provides a foundational step toward inclusive, multimodal intelligent systems capable of understanding diverse forms of language beyond purely text-based communication.

Abstract: We present Large Sign Language Models (LSLM), a novel framework for translating 3D American Sign Language (ASL) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as the backbone, which can benefit hearing-impaired individuals' virtual communication. Unlike existing sign language recognition methods that rely on 2D video, our approach directly utilizes 3D sign language data to capture rich spatial, gestural, and depth information in 3D scenes. This enables more accurate and resilient translation, enhancing digital communication accessibility for the hearing-impaired community. Beyond the task of ASL translation, our work explores the integration of complex, embodied multimodal languages into the processing capabilities of LLMs, moving beyond purely text-based inputs to broaden their understanding of human communication. We investigate both direct translation from 3D gesture features to text and an instruction-guided setting where translations can be modulated by external prompts, offering greater flexibility. This work provides a foundational step toward inclusive, multimodal intelligent systems capable of understanding diverse forms of language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for integrating histopathology and spatial transcriptomics data either overemphasize spatial transcriptomics (losing structural information) or overemphasize histopathology (losing functional information), leading to loss of essential features in tumor substructure identification.

Method: Proposed SENCA-st (Shared Encoder with Neighborhood Cross Attention) architecture that uses cross-attention to emphasize regions that are structurally similar in histopathology but functionally different in spatial transcriptomics, preserving features from both modalities.

Result: The model demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in detecting tumor heterogeneity and tumor micro-environment regions, which are clinically crucial aspects.

Conclusion: SENCA-st effectively integrates structural and functional information from histopathology and spatial transcriptomics, providing better tumor region segmentation by preserving essential features from both modalities through cross-attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics is an emerging field that enables the identification of functional regions based on the spatial distribution of gene expression. Integrating this functional information present in transcriptomic data with structural data from histopathology images is an active research area with applications in identifying tumor substructures associated with cancer drug resistance. Current histopathology-spatial-transcriptomic region segmentation methods suffer due to either making spatial transcriptomics prominent by using histopathology features just to assist processing spatial transcriptomics data or using vanilla contrastive learning that make histopathology images prominent due to only promoting common features losing functional information. In both extremes, the model gets either lost in the noise of spatial transcriptomics or overly smoothed, losing essential information. Thus, we propose our novel architecture SENCA-st (Shared Encoder with Neighborhood Cross Attention) that preserves the features of both modalities. More importantly, it emphasizes regions that are structurally similar in histopathology but functionally different on spatial transcriptomics using cross-attention. We demonstrate the superior performance of our model that surpasses state-of-the-art methods in detecting tumor heterogeneity and tumor micro-environment regions, a clinically crucial aspect.

*Sriram Srinivasan,Gautam Ramachandra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for robust 3D mesh reconstruction from multi-view images with noisy camera poses, jointly refining poses while learning implicit scene representations to produce editable meshes compatible with standard 3D tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 3D reconstruction is essential for robotics but existing NeRF-based methods rely heavily on precise camera poses and use implicit representations incompatible with standard 3D software, limiting practical applications.

Method: Jointly refines camera poses while learning an implicit scene representation that captures geometric detail and photorealistic appearance, producing editable 3D meshes.

Result: Achieves accurate and robust 3D reconstruction under pose uncertainty on standard benchmarks, producing meshes compatible with common 3D graphics and robotics tools.

Conclusion: Bridges the gap between neural implicit representations and practical robotic applications by enabling robust mesh reconstruction from noisy camera poses.

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction from multi-view images is essential for downstream robotic tasks such as navigation, manipulation, and environment understanding. However, obtaining precise camera poses in real-world settings remains challenging, even when calibration parameters are known. This limits the practicality of existing NeRF-based methods that rely heavily on accurate extrinsic estimates. Furthermore, their implicit volumetric representations differ significantly from the widely adopted polygonal meshes, making rendering and manipulation inefficient in standard 3D software. In this work, we propose a robust framework that reconstructs high-quality, editable 3D meshes directly from multi-view images with noisy extrinsic parameters. Our approach jointly refines camera poses while learning an implicit scene representation that captures fine geometric detail and photorealistic appearance. The resulting meshes are compatible with common 3D graphics and robotics tools, enabling efficient downstream use. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves accurate and robust 3D reconstruction under pose uncertainty, bridging the gap between neural implicit representations and practical robotic applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An attention-based Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture for UE positioning using Angle Delay Profile from CSI matrix, achieving significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DL-based positioning models have limitations: they apply equal attention to entire inputs and are not well-suited for non-sequential data like instantaneous CSI, which affects positioning accuracy.

Method: Proposed an attention-based Vision Transformer architecture that focuses on Angle Delay Profile (ADP) extracted from CSI matrix, enabling selective attention to relevant features for positioning.

Result: Achieved RMSE of 0.55m indoors and 13.59m outdoors on DeepMIMO dataset, and 3.45m on ViWi's outdoor blockage scenario. Outperformed state-of-the-art by ~38% and showed better error distance distribution.

Conclusion: The attention-based ViT approach effectively addresses limitations of conventional DL models for UE positioning, demonstrating superior performance with selective attention to ADP features from CSI data.

Abstract: Recently, Deep Learning (DL) techniques have been used for User Equipment (UE) positioning. However, the key shortcomings of such models is that: i) they weigh the same attention to the entire input; ii) they are not well suited for the non-sequential data e.g., when only instantaneous Channel State Information (CSI) is available. In this context, we propose an attention-based Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture that focuses on the Angle Delay Profile (ADP) from CSI matrix. Our approach, validated on the `DeepMIMO' and `ViWi' ray-tracing datasets, achieves an Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.55m indoors, 13.59m outdoors in DeepMIMO, and 3.45m in ViWi's outdoor blockage scenario. The proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art schemes by $\sim$ 38\%. It also performs substantially better than other approaches that we have considered in terms of the distribution of error distance.

### [118] [Analysing Environmental Efficiency in AI for X-Ray Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07436)
*Liam Kearns*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper compares LLMs and smaller discriminative models for COVID-19 detection in chest X-rays, finding that while LLMs can reduce carbon footprint, smaller specialized models like Covid-Net achieve higher accuracy with significantly lower environmental impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overuse of large language models for medical classification tasks when smaller, custom models could be more efficient and environmentally friendly, particularly for COVID-19 detection in chest X-rays.

Method: Integrated LLMs and small discriminative models into a Mendix application, testing 14 different model configurations. Used discriminative models as knowledge bases for LLMs to improve accuracy, and benchmarked performance based on accuracy and environmental impact.

Result: Smaller models reduced carbon footprint but showed bias towards positive diagnoses with low confidence probabilities. LLMs performed poorly when restricted to probabilistic output. Covid-Net achieved 95.5% accuracy with 99.9% lower carbon footprint than GPT-4.5-Preview, making it the most efficient solution.

Conclusion: Using LLMs as universal AI solutions for classification tasks poses environmental risks, and smaller specialized discriminative models like Covid-Net provide better accuracy with significantly lower environmental impact for medical diagnosis tasks.

Abstract: The integration of AI tools into medical applications has aimed to improve the efficiency of diagnosis. The emergence of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Claude, has expanded this integration even further. Because of LLM versatility and ease of use through APIs, these larger models are often utilised even though smaller, custom models can be used instead. In this paper, LLMs and small discriminative models are integrated into a Mendix application to detect Covid-19 in chest X-rays. These discriminative models are also used to provide knowledge bases for LLMs to improve accuracy. This provides a benchmark study of 14 different model configurations for comparison of accuracy and environmental impact. The findings indicated that while smaller models reduced the carbon footprint of the application, the output was biased towards a positive diagnosis and the output probabilities were lacking confidence. Meanwhile, restricting LLMs to only give probabilistic output caused poor performance in both accuracy and carbon footprint, demonstrating the risk of using LLMs as a universal AI solution. While using the smaller LLM GPT-4.1-Nano reduced the carbon footprint by 94.2% compared to the larger models, this was still disproportionate to the discriminative models; the most efficient solution was the Covid-Net model. Although it had a larger carbon footprint than other small models, its carbon footprint was 99.9% less than when using GPT-4.5-Preview, whilst achieving an accuracy of 95.5%, the highest of all models examined. This paper contributes to knowledge by comparing generative and discriminative models in Covid-19 detection as well as highlighting the environmental risk of using generative tools for classification tasks.

### [120] [Beyond Correctness: Confidence-Aware Reward Modeling for Enhancing Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07483)
*Qianxi He,Qingyu Ren,Shanzhe Lei,Xuhong Wang,Yingchun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a confidence-based reward model for STEM reasoning that penalizes low-confidence correct answers to improve reasoning quality in small LLMs during RL training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule-based RL rewards often lead to poor reasoning chains and inconsistencies in smaller models, limiting their potential for organizations with limited resources.

Method: Developed a confidence-based reward model that penalizes both incorrect answers and low-confidence correct responses, validated through static evaluations, Best-of-N inference, and PPO-based RL training.

Result: Outperformed several state-of-the-art open-source reward models across diverse STEM benchmarks.

Conclusion: The confidence-based reward model effectively enhances STEM reasoning capabilities by promoting more robust and logically consistent reasoning in smaller language models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shifted the post-training paradigm from traditional instruction tuning and human preference alignment toward reinforcement learning (RL) focused on reasoning capabilities. However, numerous technical reports indicate that purely rule-based reward RL frequently results in poor-quality reasoning chains or inconsistencies between reasoning processes and final answers, particularly when the base model is of smaller scale. During the RL exploration process, models might employ low-quality reasoning chains due to the lack of knowledge, occasionally producing correct answers randomly and receiving rewards based on established rule-based judges. This constrains the potential for resource-limited organizations to conduct direct reinforcement learning training on smaller-scale models. We propose a novel confidence-based reward model tailored for enhancing STEM reasoning capabilities. Unlike conventional approaches, our model penalizes not only incorrect answers but also low-confidence correct responses, thereby promoting more robust and logically consistent reasoning. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through static evaluations, Best-of-N inference tests, and PPO-based RL training. Our method outperforms several state-of-the-art open-source reward models across diverse STEM benchmarks. We release our codes and model in https://github.com/qianxiHe147/C2RM.

### [121] [Procedural Knowledge Improves Agentic LLM Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07568)
*Vincent Hsiao,Mark Roberts,Leslie Smith*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Using hierarchical task networks (HTNs) as procedural knowledge dramatically improves LLM performance on agentic tasks, enabling smaller models (20b/70b) to outperform larger baseline models (120b).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with agentic tasks without substantial tool support, prompt engineering, or fine-tuning, while research shows domain-dependent procedural knowledge can increase planning efficiency.

Method: Formalized and implemented an agentic LLM workflow that leverages procedural knowledge in the form of hierarchical task networks (HTNs), using both hand-coded and LLM-created HTNs.

Result: Hand-coded HTNs dramatically improved LLM performance on agentic tasks, boosting smaller models (20b/70b) to outperform larger baseline (120b). LLM-created HTNs also improved performance but less effectively.

Conclusion: Leveraging expertise—from humans, documents, or LLMs—to curate procedural knowledge will become an important tool for improving LLM workflows.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle when performing agentic tasks without substantial tool support, prom-pt engineering, or fine tuning. Despite research showing that domain-dependent, procedural knowledge can dramatically increase planning efficiency, little work evaluates its potential for improving LLM performance on agentic tasks that may require implicit planning. We formalize, implement, and evaluate an agentic LLM workflow that leverages procedural knowledge in the form of a hierarchical task network (HTN). Empirical results of our implementation show that hand-coded HTNs can dramatically improve LLM performance on agentic tasks, and using HTNs can boost a 20b or 70b parameter LLM to outperform a much larger 120b parameter LLM baseline. Furthermore, LLM-created HTNs improve overall performance, though less so. The results suggest that leveraging expertise--from humans, documents, or LLMs--to curate procedural knowledge will become another important tool for improving LLM workflows.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Orion is a training framework that enables compact models (350M-1.2B parameters) to perform iterative retrieval through learned search strategies, outperforming much larger retrievers on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches fall short: neural retrievers lack reasoning, LLMs are too expensive, and query rewriting limits improvement to static transformations. Existing methods fail to capture iterative dynamics of exploration, feedback, and revision needed for complex queries.

Method: Orion combines: (1) synthetic trajectory generation and supervised fine-tuning for diverse exploration patterns, (2) reinforcement learning that rewards effective query refinement and backtracking, and (3) inference-time beam search algorithms exploiting learned self-reflection capabilities.

Result: The 1.2B model achieves 77.6% success on SciFact (vs. 72.6% prior), 25.2% on BRIGHT (vs. 22.1%), 63.2% on NFCorpus (vs. 57.8%), and remains competitive on other benchmarks. It outperforms retrievers up to 200-400x larger on five of six benchmarks using only 3% of training data.

Conclusion: Retrieval performance can emerge from learned strategies, not just model scale, when models are trained to search, reflect, and revise.

Abstract: Effective information retrieval requires reasoning over partial evidence and refining strategies as information emerges. Yet current approaches fall short: neural retrievers lack reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) provide semantic depth but at prohibitive cost, and query rewriting or decomposition limits improvement to static transformations. As a result, existing methods fail to capture the iterative dynamics of exploration, feedback, and revision that complex user queries demand. We introduce Orion, a training framework that enables compact models (350M-1.2B parameters) to perform iterative retrieval through learned search strategies. Orion combines: (1) synthetic trajectory generation and supervised fine-tuning to encourage diverse exploration patterns in models, (2) reinforcement learning (RL) that rewards effective query refinement and backtracking behaviors, and (3) inference-time beam search algorithms that exploit the self-reflection capabilities learned during RL. Despite using only 3% of the training data available, our 1.2B model achieves 77.6% success on SciFact (vs. 72.6% for prior retrievers), 25.2% on BRIGHT (vs. 22.1%), 63.2% on NFCorpus (vs. 57.8%), and remains competitive on FEVER, HotpotQA, and MSMarco. It outperforms retrievers up to 200-400x larger on five of six benchmarks. These findings suggest that retrieval performance can emerge from learned strategies, not just model scale, when models are trained to search, reflect, and revise.

*Shreyas Rajesh,Pavan Holur,Chenda Duan,David Chong,Vwani Roychowdhury*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GSW is a neuro-inspired generative memory framework that enables LLMs to reason over evolving situations by building structured, interpretable representations of episodic events, outperforming RAG baselines by up to 20% on long-context tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current memory frameworks for LLMs are designed for fact-based retrieval but fail to build narrative representations needed for tracking entities through episodic events, limiting long-context reasoning capabilities.

Method: GSW comprises an Operator that maps observations to semantic structures and a Reconciler that integrates these into a persistent workspace enforcing temporal, spatial, and logical coherence.

Result: On Episodic Memory Benchmark (100k-1M tokens), GSW outperforms RAG baselines by up to 20% and reduces query-time context tokens by 51% compared to the next most token-efficient baseline.

Conclusion: GSW provides a blueprint for endowing LLMs with human-like episodic memory, enabling more capable agents that can reason over long horizons.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face fundamental challenges in long-context reasoning: many documents exceed their finite context windows, while performance on texts that do fit degrades with sequence length, necessitating their augmentation with external memory frameworks. Current solutions, which have evolved from retrieval using semantic embeddings to more sophisticated structured knowledge graphs representations for improved sense-making and associativity, are tailored for fact-based retrieval and fail to build the space-time-anchored narrative representations required for tracking entities through episodic events. To bridge this gap, we propose the \textbf{Generative Semantic Workspace} (GSW), a neuro-inspired generative memory framework that builds structured, interpretable representations of evolving situations, enabling LLMs to reason over evolving roles, actions, and spatiotemporal contexts. Our framework comprises an \textit{Operator}, which maps incoming observations to intermediate semantic structures, and a \textit{Reconciler}, which integrates these into a persistent workspace that enforces temporal, spatial, and logical coherence. On the Episodic Memory Benchmark (EpBench) \cite{huet_episodic_2025} comprising corpora ranging from 100k to 1M tokens in length, GSW outperforms existing RAG based baselines by up to \textbf{20\%}. Furthermore, GSW is highly efficient, reducing query-time context tokens by \textbf{51\%} compared to the next most token-efficient baseline, reducing inference time costs considerably. More broadly, GSW offers a concrete blueprint for endowing LLMs with human-like episodic memory, paving the way for more capable agents that can reason over long horizons.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address persistent challenges in fair team contribution assessment where conflict and workload disparity lead to unfair evaluations requiring costly manual intervention.

Method: Framework organizing heterogeneous artifacts into three dimensions (Contribution, Interaction, Role) with nine benchmarks, using normalized objective measures, inequality indices, and LLM architecture for contextual analysis.

Result: Designs a system that surfaces conflict markers through inequality measures and generates interpretable advisory judgments using validated LLM analysis over multi-dimensional data.

Conclusion: Argues for feasibility under current policies and outlines practical analytics, bias safeguards, and implementation challenges for AI-enhanced team assessment tools.

Abstract: The equitable assessment of individual contribution in teams remains a persistent challenge, where conflict and disparity in workload can result in unfair performance evaluation, often requiring manual intervention - a costly and challenging process. We survey existing tool features and identify a gap in conflict resolution methods and AI integration. To address this, we propose a framework and implementation design for a novel AI-enhanced tool that assists in dispute investigation. The framework organises heterogeneous artefacts - submissions (code, text, media), communications (chat, email), coordination records (meeting logs, tasks), peer assessments, and contextual information - into three dimensions with nine benchmarks: Contribution, Interaction, and Role. Objective measures are normalised, aggregated per dimension, and paired with inequality measures (Gini index) to surface conflict markers. A Large Language Model (LLM) architecture performs validated and contextual analysis over these measures to generate interpretable and transparent advisory judgments. We argue for feasibility under current statutory and institutional policy, and outline practical analytics (sentimental, task fidelity, word/line count, etc.), bias safeguards, limitations, and practical challenges.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for achieving human-AI cognitive partnership in high-stakes strategic decisions, addressing LLM limitations in uncertain domains through a 7-stage calibration sequence within a 5-layer protection architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs excel in verifiable domains but prove unreliable for high-stakes strategic decisions with uncertain outcomes, creating defensibility and sustainability issues due to mutually reinforcing cognitive biases in humans and AI systems.

Method: Systematic qualitative assessment across 7 frontier-grade LLMs and 3 market-facing venture vignettes under time pressure, using detailed prompting and a 7-stage calibration sequence within a 5-layer protection architecture for bias monitoring and partnership maintenance.

Result: Partnership state is achievable through ordered calibration but requires emergent maintenance protocols; reliability degrades with architectural drift and context exhaustion; dissolution discipline prevents costly wrong directions. Cross-model validation revealed systematic performance differences across LLM architectures.

Conclusion: Human-AI teams can achieve cognitive partnership capable of preventing avoidable regret in high-stakes decisions, supporting consequential decision-making without introducing preventable cognitive traps when verification arrives too late.

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) excel in verifiable domains where outputs can be checked before action but prove less reliable for high-stakes strategic decisions with uncertain outcomes. This gap, driven by mutually reinforcing cognitive biases in both humans and artificial intelligence (AI) systems, threatens the defensibility of valuations and sustainability of investments in the sector.
  This report describes a framework emerging from systematic qualitative assessment across 7 frontier-grade LLMs and 3 market-facing venture vignettes under time pressure. Detailed prompting specifying decision partnership and explicitly instructing avoidance of sycophancy, confabulation, solution drift, and nihilism achieved initial partnership state but failed to maintain it under operational pressure. Sustaining protective partnership state required an emergent 7-stage calibration sequence, built upon a 4-stage initialization process, within a 5-layer protection architecture enabling bias self-monitoring, human-AI adversarial challenge, partnership state verification, performance degradation detection, and stakeholder protection.
  Three discoveries resulted: partnership state is achievable through ordered calibration but requires emergent maintenance protocols; reliability degrades when architectural drift and context exhaustion align; and dissolution discipline prevents costly pursuit of fundamentally wrong directions. Cross-model validation revealed systematic performance differences across LLM architectures.
  This approach demonstrates that human-AI teams can achieve cognitive partnership capable of preventing avoidable regret in high-stakes decisions, addressing return-on-investment expectations that depend on AI systems supporting consequential decision-making without introducing preventable cognitive traps when verification arrives too late.

Motivation: To develop an AI system capable of expert-level forecasting at scale using unstructured data, addressing the limitations of prior LLM baselines in judgmental forecasting.

Method: Combines three core elements: agentic search over high-quality news sources, supervisor agent for reconciling disparate forecasts, and statistical calibration techniques to counter behavioral biases in LLMs.

Result: Achieves performance equal to human superforecasters on ForecastBench benchmark and provides additive information when combined with market consensus on more challenging prediction market benchmarks.

Conclusion: Establishes new state-of-the-art in AI forecasting and provides practical recommendations for future research, representing the first work to verifiably achieve expert-level forecasting at scale.

Abstract: This technical report describes the AIA Forecaster, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based system for judgmental forecasting using unstructured data. The AIA Forecaster approach combines three core elements: agentic search over high-quality news sources, a supervisor agent that reconciles disparate forecasts for the same event, and a set of statistical calibration techniques to counter behavioral biases in large language models. On the ForecastBench benchmark (Karger et al., 2024), the AIA Forecaster achieves performance equal to human superforecasters, surpassing prior LLM baselines. In addition to reporting on ForecastBench, we also introduce a more challenging forecasting benchmark sourced from liquid prediction markets. While the AIA Forecaster underperforms market consensus on this benchmark, an ensemble combining AIA Forecaster with market consensus outperforms consensus alone, demonstrating that our forecaster provides additive information. Our work establishes a new state of the art in AI forecasting and provides practical, transferable recommendations for future research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that verifiably achieves expert-level forecasting at scale.

TL;DR: ResearchRubrics is a standardized benchmark for evaluating Deep Research (DR) agents, featuring 2,500+ expert-written rubrics across 2,800+ human hours, addressing challenges in assessing long-form, evidence-backed responses to open-ended queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of Deep Research agents is challenging due to lengthy, diverse responses with multiple valid solutions and reliance on dynamic information sources, necessitating robust assessment methods.

Method: Developed ResearchRubrics benchmark with realistic domain-diverse prompts and fine-grained rubrics, plus a complexity framework with three axes (conceptual breadth, logical nesting, exploration), and created human/model evaluation protocols.

Result: Leading DR agents like Gemini's DR and OpenAI's DR achieved under 68% average compliance with rubrics, primarily failing on implicit context understanding and reasoning about retrieved information.

Conclusion: There is significant need for improved DR agent capabilities, particularly in contextual understanding and reasoning, and ResearchRubrics provides a foundation for advancing well-justified research assistants.

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) is an emerging agent application that leverages large language models (LLMs) to address open-ended queries. It requires the integration of several capabilities, including multi-step reasoning, cross-document synthesis, and the generation of evidence-backed, long-form answers. Evaluating DR remains challenging because responses are lengthy and diverse, admit many valid solutions, and often depend on dynamic information sources. We introduce ResearchRubrics, a standardized benchmark for DR built with over 2,800+ hours of human labor that pairs realistic, domain-diverse prompts with 2,500+ expert-written, fine-grained rubrics to assess factual grounding, reasoning soundness, and clarity. We also propose a new complexity framework for categorizing DR tasks along three axes: conceptual breadth, logical nesting, and exploration. In addition, we develop human and model-based evaluation protocols that measure rubric adherence for DR agents. We evaluate several state-of-the-art DR systems and find that even leading agents like Gemini's DR and OpenAI's DR achieve under 68% average compliance with our rubrics, primarily due to missed implicit context and inadequate reasoning about retrieved information. Our results highlight the need for robust, scalable assessment of deep research capabilities, to which end we release ResearchRubrics(including all prompts, rubrics, and evaluation code) to facilitate progress toward well-justified research assistants.

Motivation: Traditional scenario generation for military training is labor-intensive, and pre-LLM AI tools failed to produce sufficiently complex or adaptable scenarios.

Result: Proof-of-concept successfully generates scheme of maneuver and movement section of OPORDs while estimating map positions and movements, demonstrating feasibility and accuracy.

Conclusion: LLM-driven multi-agent systems can generate coherent, nuanced documents and adapt dynamically, advancing automation in military training scenario generation.

Abstract: Achieving expert-level performance in simulation-based training relies on the creation of complex, adaptable scenarios, a traditionally laborious and resource intensive process. Although prior research explored scenario generation for military training, pre-LLM AI tools struggled to generate sufficiently complex or adaptable scenarios. This paper introduces a multi-agent, multi-modal reasoning framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate critical training artifacts, such as Operations Orders (OPORDs). We structure our framework by decomposing scenario generation into a hierarchy of subproblems, and for each one, defining the role of the AI tool: (1) generating options for a human author to select from, (2) producing a candidate product for human approval or modification, or (3) generating textual artifacts fully automatically. Our framework employs specialized LLM-based agents to address distinct subproblems. Each agent receives input from preceding subproblem agents, integrating both text-based scenario details and visual information (e.g., map features, unit positions and applies specialized reasoning to produce appropriate outputs. Subsequent agents process these outputs sequentially, preserving logical consistency and ensuring accurate document generation. This multi-agent strategy overcomes the limitations of basic prompting or single-agent approaches when tackling such highly complex tasks. We validate our framework through a proof-of-concept that generates the scheme of maneuver and movement section of an OPORD while estimating map positions and movements as a precursor demonstrating its feasibility and accuracy. Our results demonstrate the potential of LLM-driven multi-agent systems to generate coherent, nuanced documents and adapt dynamically to changing conditions, advancing automation in scenario generation for military training.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a machine learning system for automated methane plume detection that was deployed operationally in the UN's Methane Alert and Response System, reducing false detections by over 74% through model ensembling and facilitating the verification of 1,351 methane leaks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current satellite-based methane detection methods using matched filters produce high false detection rates requiring manual verification, which is labor-intensive and inefficient for global monitoring.

Method: Developed deep learning models trained on the largest global dataset of annotated methane plumes from three imaging spectrometer missions, using model ensembling to reduce false detections, and evaluated performance on full granule scale rather than small tiles.

Result: The system reduced false detections by over 74% and during 7 months of operational deployment facilitated verification of 1,351 distinct methane leaks, resulting in 479 stakeholder notifications. Demonstrated utility in case studies across multiple countries.

Conclusion: This work represents a critical advancement toward a global AI-assisted methane leak detection system capable of handling the dramatically higher data volumes expected from current and future imaging spectrometers.

Abstract: Mitigating anthropogenic methane sources is one the most cost-effective levers to slow down global warming. While satellite-based imaging spectrometers, such as EMIT, PRISMA, and EnMAP, can detect these point sources, current methane retrieval methods based on matched filters still produce a high number of false detections requiring laborious manual verification. This paper describes the operational deployment of a machine learning system for detecting methane emissions within the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) of the United Nations Environment Programme's International Methane Emissions Observatory. We created the largest and most diverse global dataset of annotated methane plumes from three imaging spectrometer missions and quantitatively compared different deep learning model configurations. Focusing on the requirements for operational deployment, we extended prior evaluation methodologies from small tiled datasets to full granule evaluation. This revealed that deep learning models still produce a large number of false detections, a problem we address with model ensembling, which reduced false detections by over 74%. Deployed in the MARS pipeline, our system processes scenes and proposes plumes to analysts, accelerating the detection and analysis process. During seven months of operational deployment, it facilitated the verification of 1,351 distinct methane leaks, resulting in 479 stakeholder notifications. We further demonstrate the model's utility in verifying mitigation success through case studies in Libya, Argentina, Oman, and Azerbaijan. Our work represents a critical step towards a global AI-assisted methane leak detection system, which is required to process the dramatically higher data volumes expected from new and current imaging spectrometers.

### [130] [Alignment-Aware Quantization for LLM Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07842)
*Sunghyun Wee,Suyoung Kim,Hyeonjin Kim,Kyomin Hwang,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AAQ is a novel quantization method that preserves safety alignment in LLMs by using contrastive loss to maintain alignment with safe models while diverging from unaligned ones, enabling efficient 4-bit quantization without sacrificing safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional post-training quantization focuses only on minimizing perplexity, which can degrade model safety alignment despite maintaining low perplexity, creating a conflict between efficiency and safety objectives.

Method: Alignment-Aware Quantization (AAQ) integrates Alignment-Preserving Contrastive (APC) loss into PTQ pipeline, encouraging quantized models to mimic safe instruction-tuned versions while diverging from unaligned pre-trained counterparts, without requiring specialized safety datasets.

Result: AAQ enables robust 4-bit (W4A4) quantization across LLaMA, Qwen, and Mistral model families while maintaining safety where previous methods fail, resolving the efficiency-safety trade-off.

Conclusion: The work provides a practical solution for deploying both efficient and trustworthy LLMs by addressing the fundamental flaw in conventional quantization paradigms that prioritize perplexity over safety alignment.

Abstract: Safety and efficiency are both important factors when deploying large language models(LLMs). LLMs are trained to follow human alignment for safety, and post training quantization(PTQ) is applied afterward for efficiency. However, these two objectives are often in conflict, revealing a fundamental flaw in the conventional PTQ paradigm: quantization can turn into a safety vulnerability if it only aims to achieve low perplexity. Models can demonstrate low perplexity yet exhibit significant degradation in alignment with the safety policy, highlighting that perplexity alone is an insufficient and often misleading proxy for model safety. To address this, we propose Alignment-Aware Quantization(AAQ), a novel approach that integrates Alignment-Preserving Contrastive(APC) loss into the PTQ pipeline. Compared to simple reconstruction loss, ours explicitly preserves alignment by encouraging the quantized model to mimic its safe, instruction-tuned model while diverging from the unaligned, pre-trained counterpart. Our method achieves this robust safety alignment without resorting to specialized safety-focused calibration datasets, highlighting its practical utility and broad applicability. AAQ is compatible with standard PTQ techniques and enables robust 4-bit (W4A4) quantization across diverse model families such as LLaMA, Qwen, and Mistral while maintaining safety where previous methods fail. Our work resolves the critical trade-off between efficiency and safety, paving the way toward LLMs that are both efficient and trustworthy.

*Xiangling Chen,Yi Mei,Mengjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GAMA is a neural neighborhood search method for Vehicle Routing Problems that uses graph-aware multi-modal attention to better capture structural and semantic context, outperforming recent neural baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural approaches for VRPs rely on simplistic state representations and naive information fusion, limiting their ability to capture rich structural and semantic context.

Method: GAMA encodes problem instances and evolving solutions as distinct modalities using graph neural networks, models their interactions through stacked self- and cross-attention layers, and uses gated fusion to integrate multi-modal representations.

Result: Extensive experiments show GAMA significantly outperforms recent neural baselines across various synthetic and benchmark instances.

Conclusion: The multi-modal attention mechanism and gated fusion design are key to achieving performance gains in neural neighborhood search for VRPs.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural neighborhood search methods have shown potential in tackling Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). However, most existing approaches rely on simplistic state representations and fuse heterogeneous information via naive concatenation, limiting their ability to capture rich structural and semantic context. To address these limitations, we propose GAMA, a neural neighborhood search method with Graph-aware Multi-modal Attention model in VRP. GAMA encodes the problem instance and its evolving solution as distinct modalities using graph neural networks, and models their intra- and inter-modal interactions through stacked self- and cross-attention layers. A gated fusion mechanism further integrates the multi-modal representations into a structured state, enabling the policy to make informed and generalizable operator selection decisions. Extensive experiments conducted across various synthetic and benchmark instances demonstrate that the proposed algorithm GAMA significantly outperforms the recent neural baselines. Further ablation studies confirm that both the multi-modal attention mechanism and the gated fusion design play a key role in achieving the observed performance gains.

### [132] [WaterMod: Modular Token-Rank Partitioning for Probability-Balanced LLM Watermarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07863)
*Shinwoo Park,Hyejin Park,Hyeseon Ahn,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WaterMod is a novel watermarking method for LLMs that uses probability-aware modular partitioning to embed imperceptible marks while maintaining generation quality, supporting both binary attribution and multi-bit payloads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between watermark detectability and generation quality in existing logit-based watermarks, which can exclude high-probability tokens and degrade fluency.

Method: Sorts vocabulary by model probability, partitions tokens using residue rank mod k to distribute semantically similar tokens across classes, then applies small bias to selected class. Uses entropy-adaptive gate for zero-bit setting and payload-based selection for multi-bit regime.

Result: WaterMod achieves strong watermark detection performance while maintaining generation quality across natural language generation, mathematical reasoning, and code synthesis tasks.

Conclusion: The modular arithmetic approach supports both binary attribution and rich payloads, providing a robust solution for provenance tracing in LLM-generated content while preserving fluency.

Abstract: Large language models now draft news, legal analyses, and software code with human-level fluency. At the same time, regulations such as the EU AI Act mandate that each synthetic passage carry an imperceptible, machine-verifiable mark for provenance. Conventional logit-based watermarks satisfy this requirement by selecting a pseudorandom green vocabulary at every decoding step and boosting its logits, yet the random split can exclude the highest-probability token and thus erode fluency. WaterMod mitigates this limitation through a probability-aware modular rule. The vocabulary is first sorted in descending model probability; the resulting ranks are then partitioned by the residue rank mod k, which distributes adjacent-and therefore semantically similar-tokens across different classes. A fixed bias of small magnitude is applied to one selected class. In the zero-bit setting (k=2), an entropy-adaptive gate selects either the even or the odd parity as the green list. Because the top two ranks fall into different parities, this choice embeds a detectable signal while guaranteeing that at least one high-probability token remains available for sampling. In the multi-bit regime (k>2), the current payload digit d selects the color class whose ranks satisfy rank mod k = d. Biasing the logits of that class embeds exactly one base-k digit per decoding step, thereby enabling fine-grained provenance tracing. The same modular arithmetic therefore supports both binary attribution and rich payloads. Experimental results demonstrate that WaterMod consistently attains strong watermark detection performance while maintaining generation quality in both zero-bit and multi-bit settings. This robustness holds across a range of tasks, including natural language generation, mathematical reasoning, and code synthesis. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Shinwoo-Park/WaterMod.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create non-invasive brain-computer interfaces that decode spoken commands from EEG signals that are both accurate and trustworthy for real-world deployment.

Method: Deep ensembles of compact, speech-oriented convolutional networks with post-hoc calibration and selective classification, using ensemble-based predictive entropy, top-two margin, and mutual information for uncertainty quantification with an abstain option.

Result: More reliable probability estimates, improved selective performance across operating points, and balanced per-class acceptance compared to widely used baselines.

Conclusion: Confidence-aware neural decoding can provide robust, deployment-oriented behavior for real-world brain-computer interface communication systems.

Abstract: Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces that decode spoken commands from electroencephalogram must be both accurate and trustworthy. We present a confidence-aware decoding framework that couples deep ensembles of compact, speech-oriented convolutional networks with post-hoc calibration and selective classification. Uncertainty is quantified using ensemble-based predictive entropy, top-two margin, and mutual information, and decisions are made with an abstain option governed by an accuracy-coverage operating point. The approach is evaluated on a multi-class overt speech dataset using a leakage-safe, block-stratified split that respects temporal contiguity. Compared with widely used baselines, the proposed method yields more reliable probability estimates, improved selective performance across operating points, and balanced per-class acceptance. These results suggest that confidence-aware neural decoding can provide robust, deployment-oriented behavior for real-world brain-computer interface communication systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EEG-based communication system for aphasia patients using multitask learning with delta feature focus achieves 58.6% accuracy for correct speech and 45.5% for misarticulated trials, outperforming baseline by 45%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in EEG-based communication support systems for aphasic patients who experience frequent misarticulations during speech attempts.

Method: Recorded EEG signals during Korean speech tasks, used spectral analysis to identify neural patterns, and developed soft multitask learning with maximum mean discrepancy regularization focusing on delta features.

Result: Distinct neural patterns found: misarticulated trials showed excessive delta power across channels and increased theta-alpha activity in frontal regions. Model achieved 58.6% accuracy for correct trials and 45.5% for misarticulated trials.

Conclusion: EEG-based assistive systems are feasible for supporting real-world, imperfect speech conditions in aphasia patients through robust intention decoding even under articulation errors.

Abstract: Aphasia severely limits verbal communication due to impaired language production, often leading to frequent misarticulations during speech attempts. Despite growing interest in brain-computer interface technologies, relatively little attention has been paid to developing EEG-based communication support systems tailored for aphasic patients. To address this gap, we recruited a single participant with expressive aphasia and conducted an Korean-based automatic speech task. EEG signals were recorded during task performance, and each trial was labeled as either correct or incorrect depending on whether the intended word was successfully spoken. Spectral analysis revealed distinct neural activation patterns between the two trial types: misarticulated trials exhibited excessive delta power across widespread channels and increased theta-alpha activity in frontal regions. Building upon these findings, we developed a soft multitask learning framework with maximum mean discrepancy regularization that focus on delta features to jointly optimize class discrimination while aligning the EEG feature distributions of correct and misarticulated trials. The proposed model achieved 58.6 % accuracy for correct and 45.5 % for misarticulated trials-outperforming the baseline by over 45 % on the latter-demonstrating robust intention decoding even under articulation errors. These results highlight the feasibility of EEG-based assistive systems capable of supporting real-world, imperfect speech conditions in aphasia patients.

*Dengcan Liu,Jiahao Li,Zheren Fu,Yi Tu,Jiajun Li,Zhendong Mao,Yongdong Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SparseRM is a lightweight reward model that uses Sparse Autoencoders to extract preference-relevant features from LLM representations, achieving superior performance with less than 1% trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training reliable reward models under limited resources is challenging due to the need for large-scale preference annotations and high fine-tuning costs of LLMs.

Method: Uses Sparse Autoencoder to decompose LLM representations into interpretable preference-relevant directions, projects representations onto these directions to compute alignment scores, and aggregates them with a simple reward head.

Result: Achieves superior performance over most mainstream reward models on three preference modeling tasks while using less than 1% of trainable parameters.

Conclusion: SparseRM provides an efficient and interpretable approach for reward modeling that integrates well into downstream alignment pipelines, offering significant parameter efficiency.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are a core component in the post-training of large language models (LLMs), serving as proxies for human preference evaluation and guiding model alignment. However, training reliable RMs under limited resources remains challenging due to the reliance on large-scale preference annotations and the high cost of fine-tuning LLMs. To address this, we propose SparseRM, which leverages Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to extract preference-relevant information encoded in model representations, enabling the construction of a lightweight and interpretable reward model. SparseRM first employs SAE to decompose LLM representations into interpretable directions that capture preference-relevant features. The representations are then projected onto these directions to compute alignment scores, which quantify the strength of each preference feature in the representations. A simple reward head aggregates these scores to predict preference scores. Experiments on three preference modeling tasks show that SparseRM achieves superior performance over most mainstream RMs while using less than 1% of trainable parameters. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly into downstream alignment pipelines, highlighting its potential for efficient alignment.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach to explain data using textual descriptions generated by large language models, incorporating external knowledge and influence estimation to select informative descriptions, with evaluation through cross-modal transfer classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand deep learning model behaviors by explaining data through human-readable language rather than just interpreting model predictions, addressing the black-box nature of deep learning.

Method: A pipeline that generates textual descriptions using large language models with external knowledge bases, then applies influence estimation and CLIP score to select the most informative descriptions, evaluated through cross-modal transfer classification.

Result: In zero-shot settings, the generated textual descriptions outperform baseline descriptions and boost performance of image-only trained models across nine image classification datasets, with GPT-4o evaluation confirming effectiveness.

Conclusion: The approach provides insights into model interpretability and demonstrates that textual data descriptions can effectively explain data and improve model performance through cross-modal transfer.

Abstract: Deep learning models have been successful in many areas but understanding their behaviors still remains a black-box. Most prior explainable AI (XAI) approaches have focused on interpreting and explaining how models make predictions. In contrast, we would like to understand how data can be explained with deep learning model training and propose a novel approach to understand the data via one of the most common media - language - so that humans can easily understand. Our approach proposes a pipeline to generate textual descriptions that can explain the data with large language models by incorporating external knowledge bases. However, generated data descriptions may still include irrelevant information, so we introduce to exploit influence estimation to choose the most informative textual descriptions, along with the CLIP score. Furthermore, based on the phenomenon of cross-modal transferability, we propose a novel benchmark task named cross-modal transfer classification to examine the effectiveness of our textual descriptions. In the experiment of zero-shot setting, we show that our textual descriptions are more effective than other baseline descriptions, and furthermore, we successfully boost the performance of the model trained only on images across all nine image classification datasets. These results are further supported by evaluation using GPT-4o. Through our approach, we may gain insights into the inherent interpretability of the decision-making process of the model.

Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing negative sampling strategies like vulnerability to false negatives, limited generalization, and lack of control over sample hardness in knowledge graph representation learning.

Method: Three components: Difficulty Assessment Module (integrates semantic/structural features), Adaptive Negative Sampling Module (conditional diffusion model with difficulty-aware noise scheduling), and Dynamic Training Mechanism (adjusts hardness distribution throughout training).

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results on all three evaluation metrics for UMLS and YAGO3-10 datasets, demonstrating effectiveness and generalization across six benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: DANS-KGC provides an effective solution for adaptive negative sampling in knowledge graph completion, enabling curriculum-style learning from easy to hard examples through diffusion-based generation.

Abstract: Negative sampling (NS) strategies play a crucial role in knowledge graph representation. In order to overcome the limitations of existing negative sampling strategies, such as vulnerability to false negatives, limited generalization, and lack of control over sample hardness, we propose DANS-KGC (Diffusion-based Adaptive Negative Sampling for Knowledge Graph Completion). DANS-KGC comprises three key components: the Difficulty Assessment Module (DAM), the Adaptive Negative Sampling Module (ANS), and the Dynamic Training Mechanism (DTM). DAM evaluates the learning difficulty of entities by integrating semantic and structural features. Based on this assessment, ANS employs a conditional diffusion model with difficulty-aware noise scheduling, leveraging semantic and neighborhood information during the denoising phase to generate negative samples of diverse hardness. DTM further enhances learning by dynamically adjusting the hardness distribution of negative samples throughout training, enabling a curriculum-style progression from easy to hard examples. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of DANS-KGC, with the method achieving state-of-the-art results on all three evaluation metrics for the UMLS and YAGO3-10 datasets.

The multimodal LLM only exhibited short-term feedback-driven adjustments without hierarchical rule abstraction.

Conclusion: The findings identify specific neural signatures of human adaptive reasoning and highlight the need for brain-inspired AI that incorporates oscillatory feedback coordination for true context-sensitive adaptation.

Abstract: Adaptive reasoning enables humans to flexibly adjust inference strategies when environmental rules or contexts change, yet its underlying neural dynamics remain unclear. This study investigated the neurophysiological mechanisms of adaptive reasoning using a card-sorting paradigm combined with electroencephalography and compared human performance with that of a multimodal large language model. Stimulus- and feedback-locked analyses revealed coordinated delta-theta-alpha dynamics: early delta-theta activity reflected exploratory monitoring and rule inference, whereas occipital alpha engagement indicated confirmatory stabilization of attention after successful rule identification. In contrast, the multimodal large language model exhibited only short-term feedback-driven adjustments without hierarchical rule abstraction or genuine adaptive reasoning. These findings identify the neural signatures of human adaptive reasoning and highlight the need for brain-inspired artificial intelligence that incorporates oscillatory feedback coordination for true context-sensitive adaptation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Thinker is a hierarchical thinking model that enables LLMs to perform deep search through multi-turn interactions by decomposing complex problems into sub-problems with dual representations (natural language and logical functions), while determining knowledge boundaries to avoid unnecessary external searches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches using end-to-end reinforcement learning for training LLMs to leverage external retrievers neglect supervision over reasoning processes, making it difficult to guarantee logical coherence and rigor in problem-solving.

Method: Decomposes complex problems into independently solvable sub-problems with dual representations (natural language + logical functions), passes dependencies between sub-problems via logical functions, and performs knowledge boundary determination to check if sub-problems are within LLM's intrinsic knowledge.

Result: With only several hundred training samples, Thinker performs competitively with established baselines. When scaled to full training set, it significantly outperforms these methods across various datasets and model sizes.

Conclusion: Thinker provides a supervisable and verifiable reasoning process through hierarchical thinking and multi-turn interactions, achieving strong performance with minimal training data while ensuring logical coherence in problem-solving.

Abstract: Efficient retrieval of external knowledge bases and web pages is crucial for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs. Previous works on training LLMs to leverage external retrievers for solving complex problems have predominantly employed end-to-end reinforcement learning. However, these approaches neglect supervision over the reasoning process, making it difficult to guarantee logical coherence and rigor. To address these limitations, we propose Thinker, a hierarchical thinking model for deep search through multi-turn interaction, making the reasoning process supervisable and verifiable. It decomposes complex problems into independently solvable sub-problems, each dually represented in both natural language and an equivalent logical function to support knowledge base and web searches. Concurrently, dependencies between sub-problems are passed as parameters via these logical functions, enhancing the logical coherence of the problem-solving process. To avoid unnecessary external searches, we perform knowledge boundary determination to check if a sub-problem is within the LLM's intrinsic knowledge, allowing it to answer directly. Experimental results indicate that with as few as several hundred training samples, the performance of Thinker is competitive with established baselines. Furthermore, when scaled to the full training set, Thinker significantly outperforms these methods across various datasets and model sizes.

### [143] [TimeFlow: Towards Stochastic-Aware and Efficient Time Series Generation via Flow Matching Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07968)
*He Panjing,Cheng Mingyue,Li Li,Zhang XiaoHan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TimeFlow is a novel SDE-based flow matching framework for time series generation that addresses computational inefficiency in diffusion models and limited stochasticity capture in ODE-based flow matching, achieving superior performance in quality, diversity, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the computational inefficiency of diffusion models (requiring hundreds to thousands of function evaluations) and the limited stochasticity capture in conventional ODE-based flow matching, while leveraging SDE's natural suitability for modeling randomness and uncertainty in temporal dynamics.

Method: Proposes TimeFlow - an SDE-based flow matching framework with encoder-only architecture, featuring component-wise decomposed velocity field to capture multi-faceted time series structure and augmented flow-matching optimization with additional stochastic term for enhanced expressiveness.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that TimeFlow consistently outperforms strong baselines in generation quality, diversity, and efficiency, supporting both unconditional and conditional generation tasks within a unified framework.

Conclusion: TimeFlow provides a flexible and general SDE-based flow matching solution that effectively addresses stochasticity modeling in time series generation while maintaining computational efficiency and high fidelity.

Abstract: Generating high-quality time series data has emerged as a critical research topic due to its broad utility in supporting downstream time series mining tasks. A major challenge lies in modeling the intrinsic stochasticity of temporal dynamics, as real-world sequences often exhibit random fluctuations and localized variations. While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, their generation process is computationally inefficient, often requiring hundreds to thousands of expensive function evaluations per sample. Flow matching has emerged as a more efficient paradigm, yet its conventional ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based formulation fails to explicitly capture stochasticity, thereby limiting the fidelity of generated sequences. By contrast, stochastic differential equation (SDE) are naturally suited for modeling randomness and uncertainty. Motivated by these insights, we propose TimeFlow, a novel SDE-based flow matching framework that integrates a encoder-only architecture. Specifically, we design a component-wise decomposed velocity field to capture the multi-faceted structure of time series and augment the vanilla flow-matching optimization with an additional stochastic term to enhance representational expressiveness. TimeFlow is flexible and general, supporting both unconditional and conditional generation tasks within a unified framework. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms strong baselines in generation quality, diversity, and efficiency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VARS is a graph-based ECG diagnosis method that handles diverse signal configurations and improves risk signal detection through denoising reconstruction and contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in current ECG deep learning methods: lack of versatility for diverse signal configurations and inadequate detection of risk signals due to sample imbalances.

Method: Transforms ECG signals into versatile graph structures that capture diagnostic features regardless of lead count, sampling frequency, and duration. Uses denoising reconstruction with contrastive learning to preserve raw information while highlighting pathological patterns.

Result: Consistently surpasses state-of-the-art models across three distinct ECG datasets, with substantial improvement in identifying risk signals. Provides interpretability by pinpointing exact waveforms that lead to specific outputs.

Conclusion: VARS emerges as an invaluable tool for comprehensive cardiac health assessment, offering both superior performance and clinical interpretability.

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements of electrocardiogram (ECG) signal diagnosis and analysis methods through deep learning, two major hurdles still limit their clinical adoption: the lack of versatility in processing ECG signals with diverse configurations, and the inadequate detection of risk signals due to sample imbalances. Addressing these challenges, we introduce VersAtile and Risk-Sensitive cardiac diagnosis (VARS), an innovative approach that employs a graph-based representation to uniformly model heterogeneous ECG signals. VARS stands out by transforming ECG signals into versatile graph structures that capture critical diagnostic features, irrespective of signal diversity in the lead count, sampling frequency, and duration. This graph-centric formulation also enhances diagnostic sensitivity, enabling precise localization and identification of abnormal ECG patterns that often elude standard analysis methods. To facilitate representation transformation, our approach integrates denoising reconstruction with contrastive learning to preserve raw ECG information while highlighting pathognomonic patterns. We rigorously evaluate the efficacy of VARS on three distinct ECG datasets, encompassing a range of structural variations. The results demonstrate that VARS not only consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art models across all these datasets but also exhibits substantial improvement in identifying risk signals. Additionally, VARS offers interpretability by pinpointing the exact waveforms that lead to specific model outputs, thereby assisting clinicians in making informed decisions. These findings suggest that our VARS will likely emerge as an invaluable tool for comprehensive cardiac health assessment.

*Lintong Zhang,Kang Yin,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a fine-grained counterfactual explanation framework that generates object-level and part-level interpretability to identify which fine-grained features contribute to model misclassification and where dominant local features influence counterfactual adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attribution-based explanation techniques lack sufficient granularity for insight in fine-grained tasks, especially in cases of model misclassification where explanations may be insufficiently detailed.

Method: Generates explainable counterfactuals non-generatively by quantifying similarity and weighting component contributions within regions of interest between correctly classified and misclassified samples. Introduces a saliency partition module based on Shapley value contributions to isolate features with region-specific relevance.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the approach's superiority in capturing more granular, intuitively meaningful regions compared to existing fine-grained methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the limitations of attribution-based explanations by providing fine-grained counterfactual explanations that identify specific features contributing to model misclassification.

Abstract: Attribution-based explanation techniques capture key patterns to enhance visual interpretability; however, these patterns often lack the granularity needed for insight in fine-grained tasks, particularly in cases of model misclassification, where explanations may be insufficiently detailed. To address this limitation, we propose a fine-grained counterfactual explanation framework that generates both object-level and part-level interpretability, addressing two fundamental questions: (1) which fine-grained features contribute to model misclassification, and (2) where dominant local features influence counterfactual adjustments. Our approach yields explainable counterfactuals in a non-generative manner by quantifying similarity and weighting component contributions within regions of interest between correctly classified and misclassified samples. Furthermore, we introduce a saliency partition module grounded in Shapley value contributions, isolating features with region-specific relevance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach in capturing more granular, intuitively meaningful regions, surpassing fine-grained methods.

Method: Created MSLR dataset using IRAC framework from real judicial documents, developed scalable Human-LLM collaborative annotation pipeline for step-level reasoning annotations.

Result: LLMs show only moderate performance on MSLR, but Self-Initiated Chain-of-Thought prompts outperform human-designed prompts in improving reasoning coherence and quality.

Conclusion: MSLR advances LLM reasoning and Chain-of-Thought strategies, providing open resources for future legal reasoning research in Chinese context.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities across specialized domains, motivating research into their application to legal reasoning. However, existing legal benchmarks often conflate factual recall with genuine inference, fragment the reasoning process, and overlook the quality of reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce MSLR, the first Chinese multi-step legal reasoning dataset grounded in real-world judicial decision making. MSLR adopts the IRAC framework (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) to model structured expert reasoning from official legal documents. In addition, we design a scalable Human-LLM collaborative annotation pipeline that efficiently produces fine-grained step-level reasoning annotations and provides a reusable methodological framework for multi-step reasoning datasets. Evaluation of multiple LLMs on MSLR shows only moderate performance, highlighting the challenges of adapting to complex legal reasoning. Further experiments demonstrate that Self-Initiated Chain-of-Thought prompts generated by models autonomously improve reasoning coherence and quality, outperforming human-designed prompts. MSLR contributes to advancing LLM reasoning and Chain-of-Thought strategies and offers open resources for future research.

*Zheng Chenghong,Zongyin Deng,Liu Cheng,Xiong Simin,Di Deshi,Li Guanyao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ST-SAM is a spatial-temporal self-attention model that captures joint spatial-temporal dependencies for traffic forecasting, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing traffic forecasting methods treat spatial and temporal dependencies separately, failing to capture their joint effect, which limits prediction accuracy.

Method: Uses region embedding to learn time-specific embeddings and a spatial-temporal self-attention module to capture joint dependencies for both nearby and faraway regions.

Result: Achieved average improvements of 15% on RMSE, 17% on MAPE, and 32x faster training time compared to state-of-the-art approaches on two real-world datasets.

Conclusion: ST-SAM demonstrates that relying entirely on self-attention to capture spatial-temporal correlations is both effective and efficient for traffic forecasting.

Abstract: We study the problem of traffic forecasting, aiming to predict the inflow and outflow of a region in the subsequent time slot. The problem is complex due to the intricate spatial and temporal interdependence among regions. Prior works study the spatial and temporal dependency in a decouple manner, failing to capture their joint effect. In this work, we propose ST-SAM, a novel and efficient Spatial-Temporal Self-Attention Model for traffic forecasting. ST-SAM uses a region embedding layer to learn time-specific embedding from traffic data for regions. Then, it employs a spatial-temporal dependency learning module based on self-attention mechanism to capture the joint spatial-temporal dependency for both nearby and faraway regions. ST-SAM entirely relies on self-attention to capture both local and global spatial-temporal correlations, which make it effective and efficient. Extensive experiments on two real world datasets show that ST-SAM is substantially more accurate and efficient than the state-of-the-art approaches (with an average improvement of up to 15% on RMSE, 17% on MAPE, and 32 times on training time in our experiments).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes VSPO, a novel approach using fine-tuned LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to generate competency questions (CQs) that validate semantic pitfalls in ontology design, achieving 26% higher precision and 28.2% higher recall than GPT-4.1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CQ generation methods evaluate based on similarity to existing datasets but fail to detect semantic pitfalls like 'Misusing allValuesFrom', which cannot be reliably detected through rule-based methods, creating a gap in ontology validation.

Method: Fine-tuned LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to generate CQs that validate semantic discrepancies between natural language definitions and ontology axioms, using LLMs to introduce misalignments by removing axioms or altering logical operators.

Result: The fine-tuned model outperforms baselines with 26% higher precision and 28.2% higher recall than GPT-4.1, generating CQs that detect a broader range of modeling errors compared to existing datasets.

Conclusion: This research enables automatic generation of TBox-validating CQs using LLMs, significantly reducing manual effort while improving semantic alignment between ontologies and expert knowledge, representing the first study targeting semantic pitfall validation in CQ generation.

Abstract: Competency Questions (CQs) play a crucial role in validating ontology design. While manually crafting CQs can be highly time-consuming and costly for ontology engineers, recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate this process. However, prior approaches have largely evaluated generated CQs based on their similarity to existing datasets, which often fail to verify semantic pitfalls such as "Misusing allValuesFrom". Since such pitfalls cannot be reliably detected through rule-based methods, we propose a novel dataset and model of Validating Semantic Pitfalls in Ontology (VSPO) for CQ generation specifically designed to verify the semantic pitfalls. To simulate missing and misused axioms, we use LLMs to generate natural language definitions of classes and properties and introduce misalignments between the definitions and the ontology by removing axioms or altering logical operators (e.g., substituting union with intersection). We then fine-tune LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to generate CQs that validate these semantic discrepancies between the provided definitions and the corresponding axioms. The resulting CQs can detect a broader range of modeling errors compared to existing public datasets. Our fine-tuned model demonstrates superior performance over baselines, showing 26% higher precision and 28.2% higher recall than GPT-4.1 in generating CQs for pitfall validation. This research enables automatic generation of TBox-validating CQs using LLMs, significantly reducing manual effort while improving semantic alignment between ontologies and expert knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to target semantic pitfall validation in CQ generation using LLMs.

TL;DR: PN-GNN enhances GNNs' logical expressive power for knowledge graph reasoning by aggregating node-neighbor embeddings on reasoning paths, showing superior expressiveness over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN studies focus mainly on simple single-relation graphs, with insufficient discussion on GNNs' ability to express logical rules in knowledge graphs. Enhancing GNNs' logical expressive power remains a key challenge.

Method: Proposed Path-Neighbor enhanced GNN (PN-GNN) that aggregates node-neighbor embeddings on reasoning paths. Theoretically analyzed logical expressive power and compared with existing methods like C-GNN.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows PN-GNN has strictly stronger expressive power than C-GNN, with (k+1)-hop expressiveness superior to k-hop. Experiments on 6 synthetic and 2 real-world datasets confirm enhanced logical rule expressiveness without compromising generalization.

Conclusion: PN-GNN successfully enhances GNNs' logical expressive power for knowledge graph reasoning, achieving competitive performance while maintaining generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) can effectively model structural information of graphs, making them widely used in knowledge graph (KG) reasoning. However, existing studies on the expressive power of GNNs mainly focuses on simple single-relation graphs, and there is still insufficient discussion on the power of GNN to express logical rules in KGs. How to enhance the logical expressive power of GNNs is still a key issue. Motivated by this, we propose Path-Neighbor enhanced GNN (PN-GNN), a method to enhance the logical expressive power of GNN by aggregating node-neighbor embeddings on the reasoning path. First, we analyze the logical expressive power of existing GNN-based methods and point out the shortcomings of the expressive power of these methods. Then, we theoretically investigate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN, showing that it not only has strictly stronger expressive power than C-GNN but also that its $(k+1)$-hop logical expressiveness is strictly superior to that of $k$-hop. Finally, we evaluate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN on six synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments confirm that PN-GNN enhances the expressive power of logical rules without compromising generalization, as evidenced by its competitive performance in KG reasoning tasks.

*Zhiqi Chen,Yuzhou Liu,Jiarui Liu,Wanfu Gao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel multi-view multi-label feature selection method that combines LLM semantic reasoning with GNN structural modeling to jointly leverage semantic and statistical information for improved feature selection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MVMLFS methods mainly focus on statistical information but neglect semantic information, which is crucial for understanding complex relationships in heterogeneous multi-view multi-label data.

Method: Three components: (1) LLM as evaluation agent to assess semantic relevance among features, views, and labels; (2) Semantic-aware heterogeneous graph with semantic and statistical relations; (3) Lightweight GAT to learn feature saliency scores for ranking and selection.

Result: Superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines on multiple benchmark datasets, effective on small-scale datasets, demonstrating robustness, flexibility, and generalization ability.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-GNN integration effectively combines semantic and statistical information for MVMLFS, providing a powerful and generalizable approach for feature selection in complex multi-view multi-label scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-view multi-label feature selection aims to identify informative features from heterogeneous views, where each sample is associated with multiple interdependent labels. This problem is particularly important in machine learning involving high-dimensional, multimodal data such as social media, bioinformatics or recommendation systems. Existing Multi-View Multi-Label Feature Selection (MVMLFS) methods mainly focus on analyzing statistical information of data, but seldom consider semantic information. In this paper, we aim to use these two types of information jointly and propose a method that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) semantic reasoning with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) structural modeling for MVMLFS. Specifically, the method consists of three main components. (1) LLM is first used as an evaluation agent to assess the latent semantic relevance among feature, view, and label descriptions. (2) A semantic-aware heterogeneous graph with two levels is designed to represent relations among features, views and labels: one is a semantic graph representing semantic relations, and the other is a statistical graph. (3) A lightweight Graph Attention Network (GAT) is applied to learn node embedding in the heterogeneous graph as feature saliency scores for ranking and selection. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines, and it is still effective when applied to small-scale datasets, showcasing its robustness, flexibility, and generalization ability.

*Zhishen Sun,Guang Dai,Ivor Tsang,Haishan Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A perturbation framework reveals LLMs' mathematical reasoning limitations - performance drops significantly when faced with numerical perturbations, showing reliance on pattern matching rather than true logical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs truly possess mathematical understanding ability or just pattern recognition, by testing their robustness in complex environments with semantic perturbations.

Method: Proposed a perturbation framework injecting semantically irrelevant sentences with varying intensity, including numerical perturbations and core questioning instruction missing, to evaluate LLMs' reasoning stability.

Result: LLMs show stable performance with non-numerical perturbations but have robustness boundaries. Performance drops significantly with numerical perturbations (up to 51.55% for smaller models, 3-10% for advanced models). Models maintain 20-40% accuracy even without core questioning instructions.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have significant limitations in mathematical reasoning, relying more on memory templates and pattern matching than logical reasoning, especially vulnerable to numerical perturbations.

Abstract: LLMs have made significant progress in the field of mathematical reasoning, but whether they have true the mathematical understanding ability is still controversial. To explore this issue, we propose a new perturbation framework to evaluate LLMs' reasoning ability in complex environments by injecting additional semantically irrelevant perturbation sentences and gradually increasing the perturbation intensity. At the same time, we use an additional perturbation method: core questioning instruction missing, to further analyze the LLMs' problem-solving mechanism. The experimental results show that LLMs perform stably when facing perturbation sentences without numbers, but there is also a robustness boundary. As the perturbation intensity increases, the performance exhibits varying degrees of decline; when facing perturbation sentences with numbers, the performance decreases more significantly, most open source models with smaller parameters decrease by nearly or even more than 10%, and further increasing with the enhancement of perturbation intensity, with the maximum decrease reaching 51.55%. Even the most advanced commercial LLMs have seen a 3%-10% performance drop. By analyzing the reasoning process of LLMs in detail, We find that models are more sensitive to perturbations with numerical information and are more likely to give incorrect answers when disturbed by irrelevant numerical information. The higher the perturbation intensity, the more obvious these defects are. At the same time, in the absence of core questioning instruction, models can still maintain an accuracy of 20%-40%, indicating that LLMs may rely on memory templates or pattern matching to complete the task, rather than logical reasoning. In general, our work reveals the shortcomings and limitations of current LLMs in their reasoning capabilities, which is of great significance for the further development of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address logical inconsistencies and lack of domain knowledge grounding in LLMs for biomolecular reasoning, where existing approaches often deviate from biological facts or fail to capture long mechanistic dependencies.

Method: Integrates LLMs with knowledge graph-based multi-hop reasoning chains through guided traversal and pruning, incorporates chains into supervised fine-tuning for factual grounding, and refines with reinforcement learning for reasoning reliability.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-hop tasks requiring structured biological knowledge traversal, with clear advantages as reasoning depth increases compared to larger closed-source models.

Conclusion: Combining structured knowledge with advanced reasoning strategies enables reliable and interpretable biomolecular reasoning, demonstrating effectiveness particularly for complex multi-hop tasks.

Abstract: Understanding complex biomolecular mechanisms requires multi-step reasoning across molecular interactions, signaling cascades, and metabolic pathways. While large language models(LLMs) show promise in such tasks, their application to biomolecular problems is hindered by logical inconsistencies and the lack of grounding in domain knowledge. Existing approaches often exacerbate these issues: reasoning steps may deviate from biological facts or fail to capture long mechanistic dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose a Knowledge-Augmented Long-CoT Reasoning framework that integrates LLMs with knowledge graph-based multi-hop reasoning chains. The framework constructs mechanistic chains via guided multi-hop traversal and pruning on the knowledge graph; these chains are then incorporated into supervised fine-tuning to improve factual grounding and further refined with reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning reliability and consistency. Furthermore, to overcome the shortcomings of existing benchmarks, which are often restricted in scale and scope and lack annotations for deep reasoning chains, we introduce PrimeKGQA, a comprehensive benchmark for biomolecular question answering. Experimental results on both PrimeKGQA and existing datasets demonstrate that although larger closed-source models still perform well on relatively simple tasks, our method demonstrates clear advantages as reasoning depth increases, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-hop tasks that demand traversal of structured biological knowledge. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining structured knowledge with advanced reasoning strategies for reliable and interpretable biomolecular reasoning.

Result: Traditional benchmark rankings poorly predict practical agentic performance, with newer generation models not always outperforming older variants on enterprise tasks. Also revealed cost-performance tradeoffs, behavioral patterns, and reasoning impact on token efficiency.

Conclusion: KAMI v0.1 provides critical insights for enterprise deployment decisions by offering contamination-resistant evaluation of agentic capabilities that better reflects real-world performance than traditional benchmarks.

Abstract: Enterprise adoption of agentic AI systems requires reliable evaluation methods that reflect real-world deployment scenarios. Traditional LLM benchmarks suffer from training data contamination and fail to measure agentic capabilities such as multi-step tool use and decision-making under uncertainty. We present the Kamiwaza Agentic Merit Index (KAMI) v0.1, an enterprise-focused benchmark that addresses both contamination resistance and agentic evaluation. Through 170,000 LLM test items processing over 5.5 billion tokens across 35 model configurations, we demonstrate that traditional benchmark rankings poorly predict practical agentic performance. Notably, newer generation models like Llama 4 or Qwen 3 do not always outperform their older generation variants on enterprise-relevant tasks, contradicting traditional benchmark trends. We also present insights on cost-performance tradeoffs, model-specific behavioral patterns, and the impact of reasoning capabilities on token efficiency -- findings critical for enterprises making deployment decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs lack in-depth exploration of System 2 reasoning processes, and there's a need to identify reasoning steps that balance complexity with computational efficiency for optimal problem-solving.

Method: A novel Scaffold Reasoning framework with three streams: Scaffold Stream (constructs reference code), Analytic Stream (analyzes buggy code), and Integration Stream (combines both streams' outputs).

Result: Achieved 88.91% pass rate and average 5.36 seconds inference time per problem on DebugBench, outperforming other reasoning approaches in both accuracy and efficiency across various LLMs.

Conclusion: The framework aligns with human cognitive processes and demonstrates advantages across different problem difficulties and bug types, though limitations exist in certain cognitive pathways.

Abstract: Recent LLMs have demonstrated sophisticated problem-solving capabilities on various benchmarks through advanced reasoning algorithms. However, the key research question of identifying reasoning steps that balance complexity and computational efficiency remains unsolved. Recent research has increasingly drawn upon psychological theories to explore strategies for optimizing cognitive pathways. The LLM's final outputs and intermediate steps are regarded as System 1 and System 2, respectively. However, an in-depth exploration of the System 2 reasoning is still lacking. Therefore, we propose a novel psychologically backed Scaffold Reasoning framework for code debugging, which encompasses the Scaffold Stream, Analytic Stream, and Integration Stream. The construction of reference code within the Scaffold Stream is integrated with the buggy code analysis results produced by the Analytic Stream through the Integration Stream. Our framework achieves an 88.91% pass rate and an average inference time of 5.36 seconds per-problem on DebugBench, outperforming other reasoning approaches across various LLMs in both reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Further analyses elucidate the advantages and limitations of various cognitive pathways across varying problem difficulties and bug types. Our findings also corroborate the alignment of the proposed Scaffold Reasoning framework with human cognitive processes.

Motivation: LLMs show human-level performance in mathematical reasoning but their robustness under minor input perturbations lacks systematic investigation, with existing methods having scalability, semantic preservation, and cost limitations.

Method: Proposes MSCR method combining cosine similarity in LLM embedding space, WordNet dictionary, and masked language model predictions to generate semantically similar word candidates, which are filtered and substituted one by one for attacks.

Result: Single-word perturbations significantly reduced accuracy (max drop: 49.89% on GSM8K, 35.40% on MATH500) while maintaining semantic consistency, and increased response length leading to redundant reasoning paths and higher computational costs.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have significant robustness deficiencies and efficiency bottlenecks in mathematical reasoning tasks, as minor perturbations can cause substantial performance degradation and computational inefficiency.

Abstract: LLMs demonstrate performance comparable to human abilities in complex tasks such as mathematical reasoning, but their robustness in mathematical reasoning under minor input perturbations still lacks systematic investigation. Existing methods generally suffer from limited scalability, weak semantic preservation, and high costs. Therefore, we propose MSCR, an automated adversarial attack method based on multi-source candidate replacement. By combining three information sources including cosine similarity in the embedding space of LLMs, the WordNet dictionary, and contextual predictions from a masked language model, we generate for each word in the input question a set of semantically similar candidates, which are then filtered and substituted one by one to carry out the attack. We conduct large-scale experiments on LLMs using the GSM8K and MATH500 benchmarks. The results show that even a slight perturbation involving only a single word can significantly reduce the accuracy of all models, with the maximum drop reaching 49.89% on GSM8K and 35.40% on MATH500, while preserving the high semantic consistency of the perturbed questions. Further analysis reveals that perturbations not only lead to incorrect outputs but also substantially increase the average response length, which results in more redundant reasoning paths and higher computational resource consumption. These findings highlight the robustness deficiencies and efficiency bottlenecks of current LLMs in mathematical reasoning tasks.

### [158] [Information Capacity: Evaluating the Efficiency of Large Language Models via Text Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08066)
*Cheng Yuan,Jiawei Shao,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'information capacity' as a unified metric for LLM efficiency, measuring text compression performance relative to computational complexity, enabling fair comparisons across different model sizes and architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of LLMs and test-time scaling has created tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the need for a unified efficiency metric that works across different model sizes and architectures.

Method: Proposes information capacity based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity, evaluating 49 models on 5 heterogeneous datasets while considering tokenizer efficiency, pretraining data, and mixture-of-experts architecture.

Result: Models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity, enabling fair efficiency comparisons across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. The metric successfully incorporates tokenizer efficiency and shows consistent results across different architectures.

Conclusion: Information capacity provides a unified and fair efficiency metric for LLMs that accounts for computational complexity, compression performance, and tokenizer efficiency, addressing the gap in current evaluation methods.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid advancements of large language models (LLMs) and their expanding applications, leading to soaring demands for computational resources. The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further aggravates the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across different model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. Larger models can predict the next token more accurately, achieving greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. This metric enables a fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. A distinctive feature of information capacity is that it incorporates tokenizer efficiency, which affects both input and output token counts but is often neglected in LLM evaluations. We assess the information capacity of 49 models on 5 heterogeneous datasets and observe consistent results on the influences of tokenizer efficiency, pretraining data, and the mixture-of-experts architecture.

*Jinbo Li,Hesam Izakian,Witold Pedrycz,Iqbal Jamal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A clustering-based approach for multivariate time series anomaly detection using extended fuzzy clustering and reconstruction criteria to identify anomalies in amplitude and shape patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection in multivariate time series is challenging due to the need to simultaneously consider temporal and variable relationships, with applications in healthcare, weather analysis, finance, and disease outbreak detection.

Method: Uses sliding window to generate multivariate subsequences, applies extended fuzzy clustering to reveal structure, employs reconstruction criterion with cluster centers and partition matrix, and uses Particle Swarm Optimization for optimization.

Result: Experimental studies on synthetic and real-world datasets show the method can effectively detect anomalies in multivariate time series.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully detects anomalies in multivariate time series and is suitable for identifying anomalous amplitude and shape patterns across various application domains.

Abstract: Multivariate time series data come as a collection of time series describing different aspects of a certain temporal phenomenon. Anomaly detection in this type of data constitutes a challenging problem yet with numerous applications in science and engineering because anomaly scores come from the simultaneous consideration of the temporal and variable relationships. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based approach to detect anomalies concerning the amplitude and the shape of multivariate time series. First, we use a sliding window to generate a set of multivariate subsequences and thereafter apply an extended fuzzy clustering to reveal a structure present within the generated multivariate subsequences. Finally, a reconstruction criterion is employed to reconstruct the multivariate subsequences with the optimal cluster centers and the partition matrix. We construct a confidence index to quantify a level of anomaly detected in the series and apply Particle Swarm Optimization as an optimization vehicle for the problem of anomaly detection. Experimental studies completed on several synthetic and six real-world datasets suggest that the proposed methods can detect the anomalies in multivariate time series. With the help of available clusters revealed by the extended fuzzy clustering, the proposed framework can detect anomalies in the multivariate time series and is suitable for identifying anomalous amplitude and shape patterns in various application domains such as health care, weather data analysis, finance, and disease outbreak detection.

Motivation: To address the need for reliable AI in reinsurance by translating existing supervisory expectations from Solvency II, SR 11-7, and regulatory guidance into measurable lifecycle controls for LLMs.

Method: Developed a five-pillar architecture framework and implemented it through the Reinsurance AI Reliability and Assurance Benchmark (RAIRAB), evaluating governance-embedded LLMs across six task families with retrieval-grounded configurations.

Result: Retrieval-grounded configurations achieved 0.90 grounding accuracy, reduced hallucination and interpretive drift by approximately 40%, and nearly doubled transparency compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: Existing prudential doctrines can accommodate reliable AI when governance is explicit, data are traceable, and assurance is verifiable, thereby lowering informational frictions in risk transfer and capital allocation.

Abstract: This paper develops a prudential framework for assessing the reliability of large language models (LLMs) in reinsurance. A five-pillar architecture--governance, data lineage, assurance, resilience, and regulatory alignment--translates supervisory expectations from Solvency II, SR 11-7, and guidance from EIOPA (2025), NAIC (2023), and IAIS (2024) into measurable lifecycle controls. The framework is implemented through the Reinsurance AI Reliability and Assurance Benchmark (RAIRAB), which evaluates whether governance-embedded LLMs meet prudential standards for grounding, transparency, and accountability. Across six task families, retrieval-grounded configurations achieved higher grounding accuracy (0.90), reduced hallucination and interpretive drift by roughly 40%, and nearly doubled transparency. These mechanisms lower informational frictions in risk transfer and capital allocation, showing that existing prudential doctrines already accommodate reliable AI when governance is explicit, data are traceable, and assurance is verifiable.

Motivation: Pearl's Causal Hierarchy satisfiability is computationally intractable in classical settings, motivating the search for tractable cases through parameterized complexity analysis.

Method: Uses parameterized complexity approach with parameters like primal treewidth and number of variables, departing from traditional dynamic programming to exploit structural characterizations of causal models.

Result: Provides first fixed-parameter and XP algorithms for satisfiability in key probabilistic and counterfactual fragments, with matching hardness results establishing tractability boundaries.

Conclusion: Identifies first tractable gateways for PCH satisfiability through parameterized complexity, offering new algorithmic toolkit for causal reasoning beyond traditional approaches.

Abstract: Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH) is a central framework for reasoning about probabilistic, interventional, and counterfactual statements, yet the satisfiability problem for PCH formulas is computationally intractable in almost all classical settings. We revisit this challenge through the lens of parameterized complexity and identify the first gateways to tractability. Our results include fixed-parameter and XP-algorithms for satisfiability in key probabilistic and counterfactual fragments, using parameters such as primal treewidth and the number of variables, together with matching hardness results that map the limits of tractability. Technically, we depart from the dynamic programming paradigm typically employed for treewidth-based algorithms and instead exploit structural characterizations of well-formed causal models, providing a new algorithmic toolkit for causal reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models lack interpretability and industrial machines often have limited sensor technology, making data acquisition challenging. XAI can provide insights into model decisions and identify relevant features.

Method: Applied SHAP, Grad-CAM, and LIME to analyze feature importance in an LSTM model trained on real production data. Reduced original 19 input features to 9 and 6 features to evaluate trade-offs between accuracy, inference speed, and interpretability.

Result: Feature reduction improved generalization while maintaining high classification performance, with a small increase in inference speed.

Conclusion: This approach enhances feasibility of AI-driven quality control for industrial settings with limited sensor capabilities, enabling more efficient and interpretable machine learning in manufacturing.

Abstract: Machine learning is an essential tool for optimizing industrial quality control processes. However, the complexity of machine learning models often limits their practical applicability due to a lack of interpretability. Additionally, many industrial machines lack comprehensive sensor technology, making data acquisition incomplete and challenging. Explainable Artificial Intelligence offers a solution by providing insights into model decision-making and identifying the most relevant features for classification. In this paper, we investigate the impact of feature reduction using XAI techniques on the quality classification of injection-molded parts. We apply SHAP, Grad-CAM, and LIME to analyze feature importance in a Long Short-Term Memory model trained on real production data. By reducing the original 19 input features to 9 and 6, we evaluate the trade-off between model accuracy, inference speed, and interpretability. Our results show that reducing features can improve generalization while maintaining high classification performance, with an small increase in inference speed. This approach enhances the feasibility of AI-driven quality control, particularly for industrial settings with limited sensor capabilities, and paves the way for more efficient and interpretable machine learning applications in manufacturing.

Abstract: Machine learning has significant potential for optimizing various industrial processes. However, data acquisition remains a major challenge as it is both time-consuming and costly. Synthetic data offers a promising solution to augment insufficient data sets and improve the robustness of machine learning models. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of incorporating synthetic data into the training process of the injection molding process using an existing Long Short-Term Memory architecture. Our approach is to generate synthetic data by simulating production cycles and incorporating them into the training data set. Through iterative experimentation with different proportions of synthetic data, we attempt to find an optimal balance that maximizes the benefits of synthetic data while preserving the authenticity and relevance of real data. Our results suggest that the inclusion of synthetic data improves the model's ability to handle different scenarios, with potential practical industrial applications to reduce manual labor, machine use, and material waste. This approach provides a valuable alternative for situations where extensive data collection and maintenance has been impractical or costly and thus could contribute to more efficient manufacturing processes in the future.

TL;DR: SpeechCARE is a multimodal speech processing pipeline that uses transformer models to detect Alzheimer's disease and related dementias through acoustic and linguistic speech analysis, achieving strong performance with AUC=0.88 for classification and AUC=0.90 for MCI detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Over 50% of individuals with cognitive decline remain undiagnosed, and conventional speech-processing methods have limited performance and generalizability for early ADRD detection.

Method: Uses pretrained multilingual acoustic and linguistic transformers with dynamic fusion architecture inspired by Mixture of Experts, incorporating robust preprocessing (automatic transcription, LLM-based anomaly detection), SHAP explainability, and LLM reasoning.

Result: Achieved AUC=0.88 and F1=0.72 for classifying cognitively healthy, MCI, and AD individuals; AUC=0.90 and F1=0.62 for MCI detection; minimal bias disparities except for adults over 80.

Conclusion: SpeechCARE shows promise for early ADRD detection and will be deployed in real-world care settings with EHR-integrated explainability for underrepresented populations.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect one in five adults over 60, yet more than half of individuals with cognitive decline remain undiagnosed. Speech-based assessments show promise for early detection, as phonetic motor planning deficits alter acoustic features (e.g., pitch, tone), while memory and language impairments lead to syntactic and semantic errors. However, conventional speech-processing pipelines with hand-crafted features or general-purpose audio classifiers often exhibit limited performance and generalizability. To address these limitations, we introduce SpeechCARE, a multimodal speech processing pipeline that leverages pretrained, multilingual acoustic and linguistic transformer models to capture subtle speech-related cues associated with cognitive impairment. Inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm, SpeechCARE employs a dynamic fusion architecture that weights transformer-based acoustic, linguistic, and demographic inputs, allowing integration of additional modalities (e.g., social factors, imaging) and enhancing robustness across diverse tasks. Its robust preprocessing includes automatic transcription, large language model (LLM)-based anomaly detection, and task identification. A SHAP-based explainability module and LLM reasoning highlight each modality's contribution to decision-making. SpeechCARE achieved AUC = 0.88 and F1 = 0.72 for classifying cognitively healthy, MCI, and AD individuals, with AUC = 0.90 and F1 = 0.62 for MCI detection. Bias analysis showed minimal disparities, except for adults over 80. Mitigation techniques included oversampling and weighted loss. Future work includes deployment in real-world care settings (e.g., VNS Health, Columbia ADRC) and EHR-integrated explainability for underrepresented populations in New York City.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns in machine learning where user data is collected without consent by creating data instances that prevent effective model learning.

Method: Optimization-based approach using projected gradient ascent to maximize Bayes error, providing formal guarantees and efficient solution.

Result: Experimental results across multiple datasets and model architectures show the method effectively restricts data learnability and remains functional when mixed with clean samples.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a theoretically-grounded method for creating unlearnable examples that maintains effectiveness in practical scenarios with mixed data.

Abstract: The recent success of machine learning models, especially large-scale classifiers and language models, relies heavily on training with massive data. These data are often collected from online sources. This raises serious concerns about the protection of user data, as individuals may not have given consent for their data to be used in training. To address this concern, recent studies introduce the concept of unlearnable examples, i.e., data instances that appear natural but are intentionally altered to prevent models from effectively learning from them. While existing methods demonstrate empirical effectiveness, they typically rely on heuristic trials and lack formal guarantees. Besides, when unlearnable examples are mixed with clean data, as is often the case in practice, their unlearnability disappears. In this work, we propose a novel approach to constructing unlearnable examples by systematically maximising the Bayes error, a measurement of irreducible classification error. We develop an optimisation-based approach and provide an efficient solution using projected gradient ascent. Our method provably increases the Bayes error and remains effective when the unlearning examples are mixed with clean samples. Experimental results across multiple datasets and model architectures are consistent with our theoretical analysis and show that our approach can restrict data learnability, effectively in practice.

*Zhihao Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GAC is a novel action generation method that uses spherical distributions for continuous control, addressing the geometric mismatch of Gaussian policies while being computationally simpler than von Mises-Fisher distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaussian policies have a fundamental mismatch with bounded action spaces requiring ad-hoc squashing functions, while existing spherical alternatives like vMF distributions are computationally complex due to Bessel functions and rejection sampling.

Method: GAC decomposes action generation into a direction vector and learnable concentration parameter, enabling efficient interpolation between deterministic actions and uniform spherical noise. It reduces parameters from 2d to d+1 and avoids O(dk) complexity of vMF rejection sampling.

Result: GAC consistently matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods across six MuJoCo benchmarks, achieving 37.6% improvement over SAC on Ant-v4 and best results on 4 out of 6 tasks.

Conclusion: Robust and efficient continuous control doesn't require complex distributions but principled respect for action space geometry, with both spherical normalization and adaptive concentration control being essential to GAC's success.

Abstract: Gaussian policies have dominated continuous control in deep reinforcement learning (RL), yet they suffer from a fundamental mismatch: their unbounded support requires ad-hoc squashing functions that distort the geometry of bounded action spaces. While von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions offer a theoretically grounded alternative on the sphere, their reliance on Bessel functions and rejection sampling hinders practical adoption. We propose \textbf{Geometric Action Control (GAC)}, a novel action generation paradigm that preserves the geometric benefits of spherical distributions while \textit{simplifying computation}. GAC decomposes action generation into a direction vector and a learnable concentration parameter, enabling efficient interpolation between deterministic actions and uniform spherical noise. This design reduces parameter count from \(2d\) to \(d+1\), and avoids the \(O(dk)\) complexity of vMF rejection sampling, achieving simple \(O(d)\) operations. Empirically, GAC consistently matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods across six MuJoCo benchmarks, achieving 37.6\% improvement over SAC on Ant-v4 and the best results on 4 out of 6 tasks. Our ablation studies reveal that both \textbf{spherical normalization} and \textbf{adaptive concentration control} are essential to GAC's success. These findings suggest that robust and efficient continuous control does not require complex distributions, but a principled respect for the geometry of action spaces.

*Waseem AlShikh,Muayad Sayed Ali,Brian Kennedy,Dmytro Mozolevskyi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework of 11 outcome-based metrics for evaluating AI agents beyond traditional infrastructural metrics, focusing on decision quality, autonomy, and business value.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agent evaluation relies on infrastructural metrics like latency and throughput, which fail to capture decision quality, operational autonomy, or business value.

Method: Developed 11 task-agnostic performance metrics and conducted large-scale simulated experiments with four agent architectures across five domains.

Result: Hybrid Agent performed best across most metrics, achieving 88.8% Goal Completion Rate and highest ROI, revealing significant performance trade-offs between designs.

Conclusion: Provides a standardized methodology for holistic AI agent evaluation, enabling more effective development, deployment, and governance.

Abstract: As AI agents proliferate across industries and applications, evaluating their performance based solely on infrastructural metrics such as latency, time-to-first-token, or token throughput is proving insufficient. These metrics fail to capture the quality of an agent's decisions, its operational autonomy, or its ultimate business value. This white paper proposes a novel, comprehensive framework of eleven outcome-based, task-agnostic performance metrics for AI agents that transcend domain boundaries. These metrics are designed to enable organizations to evaluate agents based on the quality of their decisions, their degree of autonomy, their adaptability to new challenges, and the tangible business value they deliver, regardless of the underlying model architecture or specific use case. We introduce metrics such as Goal Completion Rate (GCR), Autonomy Index (AIx), Multi-Step Task Resilience (MTR), and Business Impact Efficiency (BIE). Through a large-scale simulated experiment involving four distinct agent architectures (ReAct, Chain-of-Thought, Tool-Augmented, Hybrid) across five diverse domains (Healthcare, Finance, Marketing, Legal, and Customer Service), we demonstrate the framework's efficacy. Our results reveal significant performance trade-offs between different agent designs, highlighting the Hybrid Agent as the most consistently high-performing model across the majority of our proposed metrics, achieving an average Goal Completion Rate of 88.8\% and the highest Return on Investment (ROI). This work provides a robust, standardized methodology for the holistic evaluation of AI agents, paving the way for more effective development, deployment, and governance.

*Ziyu Ma,Chenhui Gou,Yiming Hu,Yong Wang,Xiangxiang Chu,Bohan Zhuang,Jianfei Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STV is a sensitivity-aware task vector insertion framework that determines optimal locations and values for inserting compact representations of many-shot in-context demonstrations into multimodal models, addressing context length and inference cost limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Multimodal Models face challenges scaling to many-shot in-context learning due to limited context length and high inference costs, while existing task-vector methods struggle with determining optimal insertion locations and values.

Method: Proposes STV framework that identifies sensitive locations using consistent structural patterns in activation deltas, constructs pre-clustered activation banks for each location, and uses reinforcement learning to select optimal insertion values.

Result: STV demonstrates effectiveness across various multimodal models (Qwen-VL, Idefics-2) and tasks (VizWiz, OK-VQA), showing consistent improvements over previous task-vector methods with strong generalization.

Conclusion: The STV framework successfully addresses the challenges of many-shot in-context learning by providing a systematic approach to determine where and what to insert task vectors, enabling better scaling of multimodal models.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown promising in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, but scaling to many-shot settings remains difficult due to limited context length and high inference cost. To address these challenges, task-vector-based methods have been explored by inserting compact representations of many-shot in-context demonstrations into model activations. However, existing task-vector-based methods either overlook the importance of where to insert task vectors or struggle to determine suitable values for each location. To this end, we propose a novel Sensitivity-aware Task Vector insertion framework (STV) to figure out where and what to insert. Our key insight is that activation deltas across query-context pairs exhibit consistent structural patterns, providing a reliable cue for insertion. Based on the identified sensitive-aware locations, we construct a pre-clustered activation bank for each location by clustering the activation values, and then apply reinforcement learning to choose the most suitable one to insert. We evaluate STV across a range of multimodal models (e.g., Qwen-VL, Idefics-2) and tasks (e.g., VizWiz, OK-VQA), demonstrating its effectiveness and showing consistent improvements over previous task-vector-based methods with strong generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Multi-Agent GraphRAG, a modular LLM agentic system for text-to-Cypher query generation that leverages Labeled Property Graph databases as scalable reasoning engines, addressing the gap in current GraphRAG research focused primarily on RDF knowledge graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GraphRAG methods mainly use RDF knowledge graphs with triple representations and SPARQL queries, leaving the potential of Cypher and Labeled Property Graph databases underexplored as scalable reasoning engines for GraphRAG pipelines.

Method: Developed a modular LLM agentic system with automated Cypher query generation and execution using Memgraph as backend, featuring iterative content-aware correction and normalization with aggregated feedback loops for semantic and syntactic refinement.

Result: Evaluated on CypherBench dataset across multiple domains and demonstrated on IFC-based property graph representing building digital twins, showing the system's ability to bridge AI with real-world industrial applications.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enables scalable industrial digital automation by providing natural language interfaces to LPG-based graph data, highlighting the practical value of Cypher-based GraphRAG systems for real-world applications.

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods commonly draw information from unstructured documents, the emerging paradigm of GraphRAG aims to leverage structured data such as knowledge graphs. Most existing GraphRAG efforts focus on Resource Description Framework (RDF) knowledge graphs, relying on triple representations and SPARQL queries. However, the potential of Cypher and Labeled Property Graph (LPG) databases to serve as scalable and effective reasoning engines within GraphRAG pipelines remains underexplored in current research literature. To fill this gap, we propose Multi-Agent GraphRAG, a modular LLM agentic system for text-to-Cypher query generation serving as a natural language interface to LPG-based graph data. Our proof-of-concept system features an LLM-based workflow for automated Cypher queries generation and execution, using Memgraph as the graph database backend. Iterative content-aware correction and normalization, reinforced by an aggregated feedback loop, ensures both semantic and syntactic refinement of generated queries. We evaluate our system on the CypherBench graph dataset covering several general domains with diverse types of queries. In addition, we demonstrate performance of the proposed workflow on a property graph derived from the IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) data, representing a digital twin of a building. This highlights how such an approach can bridge AI with real-world applications at scale, enabling industrial digital automation use cases.

Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used for learning but most tools are text-only, limiting usefulness in visualization-dependent domains like mathematics. While LLMs can generate code for educational figures, scalable evaluation of these diagrams remains a major bottleneck.

Method: Proposes DiagramIR pipeline that uses intermediate representations (IRs) of LaTeX TikZ code for automatic and scalable evaluation of geometric figures generated by LLMs.

Result: DiagramIR achieves higher agreement with human raters compared to LLM-as-a-Judge baselines. Enables smaller models like GPT-4.1-Mini to perform comparably to larger models like GPT-5 at 10x lower inference cost.

Conclusion: The approach provides an important foundation for deploying accessible and scalable education technologies by enabling cost-effective, automated evaluation of visual educational content generated by LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted as tools for learning; however, most tools remain text-only, limiting their usefulness for domains where visualizations are essential, such as mathematics. Recent work shows that LLMs are capable of generating code that compiles to educational figures, but a major bottleneck remains: scalable evaluation of these diagrams. We address this by proposing DiagramIR: an automatic and scalable evaluation pipeline for geometric figures. Our method relies on intermediate representations (IRs) of LaTeX TikZ code. We compare our pipeline to other evaluation baselines such as LLM-as-a-Judge, showing that our approach has higher agreement with human raters. This evaluation approach also enables smaller models like GPT-4.1-Mini to perform comparably to larger models such as GPT-5 at a 10x lower inference cost, which is important for deploying accessible and scalable education technologies.

TL;DR: Spark is a shared agentic memory architecture that enables AI coding agents to collectively learn and share knowledge, improving code generation quality and matching larger models' performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional developer knowledge sharing platforms are declining while AI agents generate significant code without access to shared learning repositories, creating a gap in collective intelligence for AI coding agents.

Method: Introduces Spark - a shared agentic memory architecture that allows AI coding agents to contribute to and draw from a persistent experiential memory for collective continual learning.

Result: Spark recommendations improved code quality across various model sizes, enabling a 30B parameter model to match larger state-of-the-art models. Achieved 98.2% helpfulness in top qualitative bands.

Conclusion: Spark effectively addresses the knowledge sharing gap for AI coding agents, enabling collective intelligence and improving code generation quality while reducing reliance on larger models.

Abstract: The transition from human-centric to agent-centric software development practices is disrupting existing knowledge sharing environments for software developers. Traditional peer-to-peer repositories and developer communities for shared technical knowledge and best practice have witnessed dramatic drops in participation in a short period of time. At the same time, agentic functional equivalents are yet to emerge leaving AI agents, which already generate a significant proportion of all new software code produced, without access to repositories of valuable shared learning.
  In this paper, we introduce Spark, a novel shared agentic memory architecture which is designed to emulate the collective intelligence and know-how of human developer communities. Spark enables AI coding agents to both contribute to and draw from a persistent and continuously evolving experiential memory. Agents operating in the same general problem space use the Spark shared memory as a repository of new knowledge to achieve collective continual learning. We evaluate Spark as a coach for AI coding agents performing software development tasks. We demonstrate that recommendations made by Spark improve the quality of code generated by generic code generation models at varying sizes and capability tiers. Boosted by Spark, a small open-weights model with 30 billion parameters was able to match the code quality afforded by a much larger state-of-the-art model. Separately, we measure the intrinsic quality of recommendations generated by Spark against a wide range of criteria inspired by software development best practice, and achieve helpfulness levels of up to 98.2% in the top two (out of five) qualitative helpfulness bands.

Result: Successfully processed datasets up to 100,000 rows in real-time, scaled to handle multiple simultaneous users, and demonstrated automated analysis with high-quality visual outputs.

Conclusion: The cloud-based platform significantly reduces manual inputs in data analysis while maintaining high-quality visual outputs and user experiences.

Abstract: An AI-powered data visualization platform that automates the entire data analysis process, from uploading a dataset to generating an interactive visualization. Advanced machine learning algorithms are employed to clean and preprocess the data, analyse its features, and automatically select appropriate visualizations. The system establishes the process of automating AI-based analysis and visualization from the context of data-driven environments, and eliminates the challenge of time-consuming manual data analysis. The combination of a Python Flask backend to access the dataset, paired with a React frontend, provides a robust platform that automatically interacts with Firebase Cloud Storage for numerous data processing and data analysis solutions and real-time sources. Key contributions include automatic and intelligent data cleaning, with imputation for missing values, and detection of outliers, via analysis of the data set. AI solutions to intelligently select features, using four different algorithms, and intelligent title generation and visualization are determined by the attributes of the dataset. These contributions were evaluated using two separate datasets to assess the platform's performance. In the process evaluation, the initial analysis was performed in real-time on datasets as large as 100000 rows, while the cloud-based demand platform scales to meet requests from multiple users and processes them simultaneously. In conclusion, the cloud-based data visualization application allowed for a significant reduction of manual inputs to the data analysis process while maintaining a high quality, impactful visual outputs, and user experiences

*Giorgio Piras,Raffaele Mura,Fabio Brau,Luca Oneto,Fabio Roli,Battista Biggio*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes using Self-Organizing Maps to extract multiple refusal directions from LLMs, showing this approach outperforms single-direction methods and jailbreak algorithms in suppressing refusal behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods encode refusal behavior as a single direction, but evidence suggests concepts in LLMs are encoded as low-dimensional manifolds, requiring more sophisticated extraction methods.

Method: Use Self-Organizing Maps trained on harmful prompt representations to identify multiple neurons, then subtract harmless centroid from each neuron to derive multiple refusal directions.

Result: Ablating multiple directions outperforms single-direction baseline and specialized jailbreak algorithms, effectively suppressing refusal behavior.

Conclusion: Multiple refusal directions better capture the complex nature of refusal behavior in LLMs, with important mechanistic implications for model interpretability.

Abstract: Refusal refers to the functional behavior enabling safety-aligned language models to reject harmful or unethical prompts. Following the growing scientific interest in mechanistic interpretability, recent work encoded refusal behavior as a single direction in the model's latent space; e.g., computed as the difference between the centroids of harmful and harmless prompt representations. However, emerging evidence suggests that concepts in LLMs often appear to be encoded as a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the high-dimensional latent space. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel method leveraging Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to extract multiple refusal directions. To this end, we first prove that SOMs generalize the prior work's difference-in-means technique. We then train SOMs on harmful prompt representations to identify multiple neurons. By subtracting the centroid of harmless representations from each neuron, we derive a set of multiple directions expressing the refusal concept. We validate our method on an extensive experimental setup, demonstrating that ablating multiple directions from models' internals outperforms not only the single-direction baseline but also specialized jailbreak algorithms, leading to an effective suppression of refusal. Finally, we conclude by analyzing the mechanistic implications of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address persistent unfaithfulness in LLMs where reasoning chains diverge from perceptual evidence or final conclusions, distinguishing between behavioral and perceptual faithfulness.

Method: Introduce FaithEval for quantifying step-level and chain-level faithfulness by evaluating visual support, and propose FaithAct framework that enforces evidential grounding at every reasoning step.

Result: FaithAct improves perceptual faithfulness by up to 26% without degrading task accuracy compared to prompt-based and tool-augmented baselines, leading to more stable reasoning trajectories.

Conclusion: Treating faithfulness as a guiding principle mitigates hallucination and establishes a unified framework for evaluating and enforcing faithfulness in multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Unfaithfulness remains a persistent challenge for large language models (LLMs), which often produce plausible yet ungrounded reasoning chains that diverge from perceptual evidence or final conclusions. We distinguish between behavioral faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and output) and perceptual faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and input), and introduce FaithEval for quantifying step-level and chain-level faithfulness by evaluating whether each claimed object is visually supported by the image. Building on these insights, we propose FaithAct, a faithfulness-first planning and acting framework that enforces evidential grounding at every reasoning step. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FaithAct improves perceptual faithfulness by up to 26% without degrading task accuracy compared to prompt-based and tool-augmented baselines. Our analysis shows that treating faithfulness as a guiding principle not only mitigates hallucination but also leads to more stable reasoning trajectories. This work thereby establishes a unified framework for both evaluating and enforcing faithfulness in multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: Proposes patching LLMs like software versions using lightweight prefix patches to address safety vulnerabilities without full model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Major LLM releases are costly, infrequent, and hard to customize, leaving models with known safety gaps that need rapid remediation.

Method: Prepends a compact, learnable prefix (0.003% additional parameters) to existing models to steer behavior toward safer reference models.

Result: Achieves safety improvements comparable to next-generation safety-aligned models across toxicity mitigation, bias reduction, and harmfulness refusal while preserving fluency.

Conclusion: LLMs can be patched like software, offering vendors a practical mechanism for scalable, efficient, and composable safety updates between major releases.

Abstract: We propose patching for large language models (LLMs) like software versions, a lightweight and modular approach for addressing safety vulnerabilities. While vendors release improved LLM versions, major releases are costly, infrequent, and difficult to tailor to customer needs, leaving released models with known safety gaps. Unlike full-model fine-tuning or major version updates, our method enables rapid remediation by prepending a compact, learnable prefix to an existing model. This "patch" introduces only 0.003% additional parameters, yet reliably steers model behavior toward that of a safer reference model. Across three critical domains (toxicity mitigation, bias reduction, and harmfulness refusal) policy patches achieve safety improvements comparable to next-generation safety-aligned models while preserving fluency. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can be "patched" much like software, offering vendors and practitioners a practical mechanism for distributing scalable, efficient, and composable safety updates between major model releases.

TL;DR: LLMs broadly agree with human notions of mathematical interestingness but fail to capture the full distribution of human judgments and show weak alignment with human rationales for why problems are interesting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems increasingly participate in mathematics with humans, it's important to understand how well their judgments about mathematical interestingness and difficulty align with human ones.

Method: Two empirical studies comparing human and LLM assessments of mathematical interestingness and difficulty, involving participants from crowdsourcing platforms and International Math Olympiad competitors.

Result: LLMs broadly agree with human notions of interestingness but don't capture the full distribution of human judgments and show weak correlation with human-selected interestingness rationales.

Conclusion: Current LLMs show both promises and limitations in capturing human interestingness judgments for mathematical AI thought partnerships.

Abstract: The evolution of mathematics has been guided in part by interestingness. From researchers choosing which problems to tackle next, to students deciding which ones to engage with, people's choices are often guided by judgments about how interesting or challenging problems are likely to be. As AI systems, such as LLMs, increasingly participate in mathematics with people -- whether for advanced research or education -- it becomes important to understand how well their judgments align with human ones. Our work examines this alignment through two empirical studies of human and LLM assessment of mathematical interestingness and difficulty, spanning a range of mathematical experience. We study two groups: participants from a crowdsourcing platform and International Math Olympiad competitors. We show that while many LLMs appear to broadly agree with human notions of interestingness, they mostly do not capture the distribution observed in human judgments. Moreover, most LLMs only somewhat align with why humans find certain math problems interesting, showing weak correlation with human-selected interestingness rationales. Together, our findings highlight both the promises and limitations of current LLMs in capturing human interestingness judgments for mathematical AI thought partnerships.

Conclusion: The SNN-HDC decoding method represents a compelling alternative to both rate and latency decoding due to its numerous benefits.

Abstract: This work presents a novel spiking neural network (SNN) decoding method, combining SNNs with Hyperdimensional computing (HDC). The goal is to create a decoding method with high accuracy, high noise robustness, low latency and low energy usage. Compared to analogous architectures decoded with existing approaches, the presented SNN-HDC model attains generally better classification accuracy, lower classification latency and lower estimated energy consumption on multiple test cases from literature. The SNN-HDC achieved estimated energy consumption reductions ranging from 1.24x to 3.67x on the DvsGesture dataset and from 1.38x to 2.27x on the SL-Animals-DVS dataset. The presented decoding method can also efficiently identify unknown classes it has not been trained on. In the DvsGesture dataset the SNN-HDC model can identify 100% of samples from an unseen/untrained class. Given the numerous benefits shown and discussed in this paper, this decoding method represents a very compelling alternative to both rate and latency decoding.

Motivation: Neurosymbolic AI combines neural and symbolic reasoning but faces scalability limitations that restrict practical usability of these models.

Method: Parameterizes derivation steps with neural networks, establishes formal mapping between resolution process and Markov Decision Processes, enabling dynamic programming and reinforcement learning for efficient inference.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art NeSy systems on standard benchmarks and knowledge graph reasoning, achieving better scalability for larger and more complex settings.

Conclusion: DPrL successfully addresses scalability limitations in neurosymbolic AI through neural-guided stochastic logic programs and MDP-based inference, enabling practical application to complex problems.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) AI aims to combine the strengths of neural architectures and symbolic reasoning to improve the accuracy, interpretability, and generalization capability of AI models. While logic inference on top of subsymbolic modules has been shown to effectively guarantee these properties, this often comes at the cost of reduced scalability, which can severely limit the usability of NeSy models. This paper introduces DeepProofLog (DPrL), a novel NeSy system based on stochastic logic programs, which addresses the scalability limitations of previous methods. DPrL parameterizes all derivation steps with neural networks, allowing efficient neural guidance over the proving system. Additionally, we establish a formal mapping between the resolution process of our deep stochastic logic programs and Markov Decision Processes, enabling the application of dynamic programming and reinforcement learning techniques for efficient inference and learning. This theoretical connection improves scalability for complex proof spaces and large knowledge bases. Our experiments on standard NeSy benchmarks and knowledge graph reasoning tasks demonstrate that DPrL outperforms existing state-of-the-art NeSy systems, advancing scalability to larger and more complex settings than previously possible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift from generating visually appealing videos to building interactive virtual environments that maintain physical plausibility points toward video foundation models functioning as implicit world models.

Method: Systematic survey approach analyzing video generation evolution through four generations, defining core characteristics and examining representative works across domains like robotics and gaming.

Result: Identifies progression culminating in world models with intrinsic physical plausibility, real-time multimodal interaction, and multi-scale planning capabilities.

Conclusion: Discusses open challenges and design principles for next-generation world models, emphasizing the role of agent intelligence in shaping and evaluating these systems.

Abstract: The landscape of video generation is shifting, from a focus on generating visually appealing clips to building virtual environments that support interaction and maintain physical plausibility. These developments point toward the emergence of video foundation models that function not only as visual generators but also as implicit world models, models that simulate the physical dynamics, agent-environment interactions, and task planning that govern real or imagined worlds. This survey provides a systematic overview of this evolution, conceptualizing modern video foundation models as the combination of two core components: an implicit world model and a video renderer. The world model encodes structured knowledge about the world, including physical laws, interaction dynamics, and agent behavior. It serves as a latent simulation engine that enables coherent visual reasoning, long-term temporal consistency, and goal-driven planning. The video renderer transforms this latent simulation into realistic visual observations, effectively producing videos as a "window" into the simulated world. We trace the progression of video generation through four generations, in which the core capabilities advance step by step, ultimately culminating in a world model, built upon a video generation model, that embodies intrinsic physical plausibility, real-time multimodal interaction, and planning capabilities spanning multiple spatiotemporal scales. For each generation, we define its core characteristics, highlight representative works, and examine their application domains such as robotics, autonomous driving, and interactive gaming. Finally, we discuss open challenges and design principles for next-generation world models, including the role of agent intelligence in shaping and evaluating these systems.

### [187] [CAVER: Curious Audiovisual Exploring Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07619)

TL;DR: CAVER is a robot system that builds audiovisual representations of objects through active interaction, using a novel end-effector to excite audio responses, combined multimodal representations, and curiosity-driven exploration for efficient learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robots to learn correlations between visual appearance and sound through active sensorimotor experience, unlocking multimodal potential for tasks like material classification and audio-only demonstration imitation.

Method: Three novel components: 1) 3D printed end-effector for exciting audio responses, 2) audiovisual representation combining local/global appearance with sound features, 3) curiosity-driven exploration algorithm that prioritizes high-uncertainty objects.

Result: CAVER builds rich representations more efficiently than baselines, and the learned audiovisual representation significantly improves material classification and imitation of audio-only human demonstrations.

Conclusion: The system successfully demonstrates that active multimodal learning through curiosity-driven exploration enables robots to build rich audiovisual knowledge for practical applications.

Abstract: Multimodal audiovisual perception can enable new avenues for robotic manipulation, from better material classification to the imitation of demonstrations for which only audio signals are available (e.g., playing a tune by ear). However, to unlock such multimodal potential, robots need to learn the correlations between an object's visual appearance and the sound it generates when they interact with it. Such an active sensorimotor experience requires new interaction capabilities, representations, and exploration methods to guide the robot in efficiently building increasingly rich audiovisual knowledge. In this work, we present CAVER, a novel robot that builds and utilizes rich audiovisual representations of objects. CAVER includes three novel contributions: 1) a novel 3D printed end-effector, attachable to parallel grippers, that excites objects' audio responses, 2) an audiovisual representation that combines local and global appearance information with sound features, and 3) an exploration algorithm that uses and builds the audiovisual representation in a curiosity-driven manner that prioritizes interacting with high uncertainty objects to obtain good coverage of surprising audio with fewer interactions. We demonstrate that CAVER builds rich representations in different scenarios more efficiently than several exploration baselines, and that the learned audiovisual representation leads to significant improvements in material classification and the imitation of audio-only human demonstrations. https://caver-bot.github.io/

### [188] [Time-Aware Policy Learning for Adaptive and Punctual Robot Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07654)
*Yinsen Jia,Boyuan Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Time-aware policy learning enables robots to explicitly perceive and reason with time as a first-class variable, allowing adaptive behavior modulation from rapid to cautious execution without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most robot learning algorithms remain blind to time, despite temporal awareness being fundamental to intelligent behavior in animals and humans for sequencing actions and adapting to changing goals.

Method: Augments conventional reinforcement policies with two temporal signals (remaining time and time ratio) to enable continuous behavior modulation, jointly optimizing punctuality and stability.

Result: Outperforms standard RL baselines by up to 48% in efficiency, 8x more robust in sim-to-real transfer, 90% in acoustic quietness while maintaining near-perfect success rates across diverse manipulation domains.

Conclusion: By treating time as a controllable dimension rather than a constraint, time-aware policy learning provides a unified foundation for efficient, robust, resilient, and human-aligned robot autonomy.

Abstract: Temporal awareness underlies intelligent behavior in both animals and humans, guiding how actions are sequenced, paced, and adapted to changing goals and environments. Yet most robot learning algorithms remain blind to time. We introduce time-aware policy learning, a reinforcement learning framework that enables robots to explicitly perceive and reason with time as a first-class variable. The framework augments conventional reinforcement policies with two complementary temporal signals, the remaining time and a time ratio, which allow a single policy to modulate its behavior continuously from rapid and dynamic to cautious and precise execution. By jointly optimizing punctuality and stability, the robot learns to balance efficiency, robustness, resiliency, and punctuality without re-training or reward adjustment. Across diverse manipulation domains from long-horizon pick and place, to granular-media pouring, articulated-object handling, and multi-agent object delivery, the time-aware policy produces adaptive behaviors that outperform standard reinforcement learning baselines by up to 48% in efficiency, 8 times more robust in sim-to-real transfer, and 90% in acoustic quietness while maintaining near-perfect success rates. Explicit temporal reasoning further enables real-time human-in-the-loop control and multi-agent coordination, allowing robots to recover from disturbances, re-synchronize after delays, and align motion tempo with human intent. By treating time not as a constraint but as a controllable dimension of behavior, time-aware policy learning provides a unified foundation for efficient, robust, resilient, and human-aligned robot autonomy.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates using HoloOcean 2.0 simulator with ROS 2 interface for Hardware-in-the-Loop and Software-in-the-Loop testing of torpedo AUVs, comparing simulated results with real-world field trials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Testing marine robotics systems in controlled environments is challenging due to space constraints in indoor tanks and pools, and acoustic-based sensors only function properly underwater.

Method: Used HoloOcean 2.0 simulator with improved dynamics for torpedo AUVs and new ROS 2 interface to create HIL and SIL setups, where simulated sensor data is sent to the CougUV AUV and control commands are sent back to simulation.

Result: Successfully demonstrated HIL and SIL setup for testing CougUV torpedo AUV, with simulations running in HoloOcean using ROS 2 bridge to exchange sensor data and control commands.

Conclusion: High-fidelity underwater simulation tools like HoloOcean 2.0 with ROS 2 interface provide effective solutions for testing marine robotics systems before field deployment, overcoming space constraints and underwater testing limitations.

Abstract: Testing marine robotics systems in controlled environments before field tests is challenging, especially when acoustic-based sensors and control surfaces only function properly underwater. Deploying robots in indoor tanks and pools often faces space constraints that complicate testing of control, navigation, and perception algorithms at scale. Recent developments of high-fidelity underwater simulation tools have the potential to address these problems. We demonstrate the utility of the recently released HoloOcean 2.0 simulator with improved dynamics for torpedo AUV vehicles and a new ROS 2 interface. We have successfully demonstrated a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) and Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) setup for testing and evaluating a CougUV torpedo autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) that was built and developed in our lab. With this HIL and SIL setup, simulations are run in HoloOcean using a ROS 2 bridge such that simulated sensor data is sent to the CougUV (mimicking sensor drivers) and control surface commands are sent back to the simulation, where vehicle dynamics and sensor data are calculated. We compare our simulated results to real-world field trial results.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboTAG is a novel method for robot pose estimation that incorporates 3D priors through a dual-branch architecture, enabling unsupervised learning from unlabeled in-the-wild images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monocular robot pose estimation methods heavily rely on labeled data and reduce 3D problems to 2D domain, causing sim-to-real gaps and neglecting 3D priors.

Method: Proposes Robot Topological Alignment Graph (RoboTAG) with 3D and 2D branches where nodes represent camera/robot states and edges capture dependencies/alignments, using closed loops for consistency supervision across branches.

Result: Experimental results show the method is effective across different robot types and can alleviate the data bottleneck in robotics.

Conclusion: RoboTAG successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by incorporating 3D priors and enabling unsupervised learning from unlabeled data.

Abstract: Estimating robot pose from a monocular RGB image is a challenge in robotics and computer vision. Existing methods typically build networks on top of 2D visual backbones and depend heavily on labeled data for training, which is often scarce in real-world scenarios, causing a sim-to-real gap. Moreover, these approaches reduce the 3D-based problem to 2D domain, neglecting the 3D priors. To address these, we propose Robot Topological Alignment Graph (RoboTAG), which incorporates a 3D branch to inject 3D priors while enabling co-evolution of the 2D and 3D representations, alleviating the reliance on labels. Specifically, the RoboTAG consists of a 3D branch and a 2D branch, where nodes represent the states of the camera and robot system, and edges capture the dependencies between these variables or denote alignments between them. Closed loops are then defined in the graph, on which a consistency supervision across branches can be applied. This design allows us to utilize in-the-wild images as training data without annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is effective across robot types, highlighting its potential to alleviate the data bottleneck in robotics.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper develops a teleoperation pipeline for robot manipulation tasks that works with various teleoperation devices and controllers, featuring a novel optimal QP controller with dynamic nullspace and impedance tracking for compliant pose tracking and singularity avoidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve human brain-like intelligence in robots through learning, high-quality data is crucial. The study investigates data collection for manipulation tasks using teleoperation devices, as different devices and controller strategies yield varying data quality effects.

Method: Developed a teleoperation pipeline compatible with different devices and manipulator controllers. Created an optimal QP formulation with dynamic nullspace and impedance tracking as a novel controller that adaptively adjusts weights based on joint manipulability for compliant pose tracking and singularity avoidance.

Result: Experimental analysis shows the quality of teleoperated trajectory data varies with different combinations of teleoperation interfaces and motion controllers, measured by tracking error, singularity occurrence, and joint trajectory smoothness.

Conclusion: The proposed teleoperation pipeline with the novel optimal controller effectively enables compliant pose tracking and singularity avoidance, providing high-quality data for robot learning applications.

Abstract: Robot learning empowers the robot system with human brain-like intelligence to autonomously acquire and adapt skills through experience, enhancing flexibility and adaptability in various environments. Aimed at achieving a similar level of capability in large language models (LLMs) for embodied intelligence, data quality plays a crucial role in training a foundational model with diverse robot skills. In this study, we investigate the collection of data for manipulation tasks using teleoperation devices. Different devices yield varying effects when paired with corresponding controller strategies, including position-based inverse kinematics (IK) control, torque-based inverse dynamics (ID) control, and optimization-based compliance control. In this paper, we develop a teleoperation pipeline that is compatible with different teleoperation devices and manipulator controllers. Within the pipeline, we construct the optimal QP formulation with the dynamic nullspace and the impedance tracking as the novel optimal controller to achieve compliant pose tracking and singularity avoidance. Regarding the optimal controller, it adaptively adjusts the weights assignment depending on the robot joint manipulability that reflects the state of joint configuration for the pose tracking in the form of impedance control and singularity avoidance with nullspace tracking. Analysis of quantitative experimental results suggests the quality of the teleoperated trajectory data, including tracking error, occurrence of singularity, and the smoothness of the joints' trajectory, with different combinations of teleoperation interface and the motion controller.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a TAMP framework for mobile manipulation tasks that uses LLMs for common sense knowledge and computer vision for base positioning, achieving 84.4% success in real-world object rearrangement trials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address mobile manipulation tasks with underspecified goals like 'set up dinner table' by integrating task planning and motion planning while leveraging common sense knowledge about object organization.

Method: Uses large language models (LLMs) for common sense knowledge about object arrangements, computer vision for base position selection, and a principled TAMP framework that interleaves task and motion planning for mobile manipulation.

Result: Achieved 84.4% success rate in real-world object rearrangement trials, though subjective human evaluations showed robot performance is still lower than experienced human waiters.

Conclusion: The proposed TAMP framework effectively handles mobile manipulation tasks with underspecified goals by combining LLM common sense knowledge with motion planning, but there's still room for improvement to match human-level performance.

Abstract: Task planning and motion planning are two of the most important problems in robotics, where task planning methods help robots achieve high-level goals and motion planning methods maintain low-level feasibility. Task and motion planning (TAMP) methods interleave the two processes of task planning and motion planning to ensure goal achievement and motion feasibility. Within the TAMP context, we are concerned with the mobile manipulation (MoMa) of multiple objects, where it is necessary to interleave actions for navigation and manipulation.
  In particular, we aim to compute where and how each object should be placed given underspecified goals, such as ``set up dinner table with a fork, knife and plate.'' We leverage the rich common sense knowledge from large language models (LLMs), e.g., about how tableware is organized, to facilitate both task-level and motion-level planning. In addition, we use computer vision methods to learn a strategy for selecting base positions to facilitate MoMa behaviors, where the base position corresponds to the robot's ``footprint'' and orientation in its operating space. Altogether, this article provides a principled TAMP framework for MoMa tasks that accounts for common sense about object rearrangement and is adaptive to novel situations that include many objects that need to be moved. We performed quantitative experiments in both real-world settings and simulated environments. We evaluated the success rate and efficiency in completing long-horizon object rearrangement tasks. While the robot completed 84.4\% real-world object rearrangement trials, subjective human evaluations indicated that the robot's performance is still lower than experienced human waiters.

*Sandeep Routray,Hengkai Pan,Unnat Jain,Shikhar Bahl,Deepak Pathak*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ViPRA is a pretraining-finetuning framework that learns robot control from actionless videos by predicting future observations and motion-centric latent actions, then mapping these to robot-specific actions using minimal demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Videos capture rich physical interactions but lack labeled actions, limiting their use in robot learning. The goal is to leverage unlabeled video data to learn robot policies without expensive action annotation.

Method: Train video-language model to predict future visual observations and motion-centric latent actions using perceptual losses and optical flow consistency. For downstream control, use chunked flow matching decoder to map latent actions to robot-specific continuous actions with only 100-200 demonstrations.

Result: Achieves 16% gain on SIMPLER benchmark and 13% improvement across real-world manipulation tasks. Enables smooth, high-frequency continuous control at 22 Hz via chunked action decoding.

Conclusion: ViPRA successfully turns video prediction models into robot policies by learning physically grounded latent actions from unlabeled videos, supporting generalization across embodiments and avoiding expensive action annotation.

Abstract: Can we turn a video prediction model into a robot policy? Videos, including those of humans or teleoperated robots, capture rich physical interactions. However, most of them lack labeled actions, which limits their use in robot learning. We present Video Prediction for Robot Actions (ViPRA), a simple pretraining-finetuning framework that learns continuous robot control from these actionless videos. Instead of directly predicting actions, we train a video-language model to predict both future visual observations and motion-centric latent actions, which serve as intermediate representations of scene dynamics. We train these latent actions using perceptual losses and optical flow consistency to ensure they reflect physically grounded behavior. For downstream control, we introduce a chunked flow matching decoder that maps latent actions to robot-specific continuous action sequences, using only 100 to 200 teleoperated demonstrations. This approach avoids expensive action annotation, supports generalization across embodiments, and enables smooth, high-frequency continuous control upto 22 Hz via chunked action decoding. Unlike prior latent action works that treat pretraining as autoregressive policy learning, explicitly models both what changes and how. Our method outperforms strong baselines, with a 16% gain on the SIMPLER benchmark and a 13% improvement across real world manipulation tasks. We will release models and code at https://vipra-project.github.io

*Myles Pasetsky,Jiawei Lin,Bradley Guo,Sarah Dean*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces First-Order Model Predictive Control (FOMPC) for high-altitude balloon station-keeping, which outperforms RL methods by 24% in time-within-radius without offline training, though with higher online computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that model-based control is impractical for HAB station-keeping due to nonlinear dynamics and uncertain wind forecasts, and to provide a more effective alternative to model-free RL methods.

Method: Developed FOMPC by implementing wind and balloon dynamics as differentiable functions in JAX, enabling gradient-based trajectory optimization for online planning.

Result: FOMPC achieved 24% improvement in time-within-radius (TWR) compared to state-of-the-art RL policy, with effectiveness demonstrated across various configurations including simplified models.

Conclusion: Model-based control with online planning is effective for HAB station-keeping, challenging prior assumptions about the impracticality of such approaches despite higher computational costs.

Abstract: High-altitude balloons (HABs) are common in scientific research due to their wide range of applications and low cost. Because of their nonlinear, underactuated dynamics and the partial observability of wind fields, prior work has largely relied on model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods to design near-optimal control schemes for station-keeping. These methods often compare only against hand-crafted heuristics, dismissing model-based approaches as impractical given the system complexity and uncertain wind forecasts. We revisit this assumption about the efficacy of model-based control for station-keeping by developing First-Order Model Predictive Control (FOMPC). By implementing the wind and balloon dynamics as differentiable functions in JAX, we enable gradient-based trajectory optimization for online planning. FOMPC outperforms a state-of-the-art RL policy, achieving a 24% improvement in time-within-radius (TWR) without requiring offline training, though at the cost of greater online computation per control step. Through systematic ablations of modeling assumptions and control factors, we show that online planning is effective across many configurations, including under simplified wind and dynamics models.

*Benjamin Davis,Hannah Stuart*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper compares silicone and polyurethane gels for vision-based tactile sensors, proposing standardized benchmarks for resilience and sensitivity testing, with polyurethane showing better durability in practical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing silicone-based VBTS gels provide high sensitivity but deteriorate easily from loading and wear, while polyurethane rubber used in high-load applications may offer better physical resilience.

Method: Developed standard evaluation protocols including resilience tests (normal loading, shear loading, abrasion) and model-free sensitivity assessments (force and spatial sensitivity), plus a practical bottle cap manipulation demonstration.

Result: Polyurethane gels demonstrated improved physical resilience compared to silicone gels, potentially at the cost of some sensitivity, and showed advantages in real-world applications like bottle cap manipulation.

Conclusion: Polyurethane rubber is a viable alternative to silicone for VBTS gels, offering superior durability for applications requiring physical resilience, though with potential trade-offs in sensitivity that should be considered based on application requirements.

Abstract: Vision-based tactile sensors (VBTSs) are a promising technology for robots, providing them with dense signals that can be translated into an understanding of normal and shear load, contact region, texture classification, and more. However, existing VBTS tactile surfaces make use of silicone gels, which provide high sensitivity but easily deteriorate from loading and surface wear. We propose that polyurethane rubber, used for high-load applications like shoe soles, rubber wheels, and industrial gaskets, may provide improved physical gel resilience, potentially at the cost of sensitivity. To compare the resilience and sensitivity of silicone and polyurethane VBTS gels, we propose a series of standard evaluation benchmarking protocols. Our resilience tests assess sensor durability across normal loading, shear loading, and abrasion. For sensitivity, we introduce model-free assessments of force and spatial sensitivity to directly measure the physical capabilities of each gel without effects introduced from data and model quality. Finally, we include a bottle cap loosening and tightening demonstration as an example where polyurethane gels provide an advantage over their silicone counterparts.

TL;DR: Hybrid multi-robot coordination framework combining decentralized path planning with centralized conflict resolution using virtual traffic light approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of traditional centralized planning methods by allowing robots autonomy while preventing deadlocks through conflict resolution.

Method: Each robot autonomously plans its path and shares with centralized node, which detects conflicts and issues stop commands (like virtual traffic lights) to prevent deadlocks.

Result: Increased success rate of robots reaching goals while reducing deadlocks in simulations, validated with real-world quadruped robots and wheeled Duckiebots.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively combines robot autonomy with centralized conflict resolution, proving successful in both simulation and real-world experiments.

Abstract: We present a hybrid multi-robot coordination framework that combines decentralized path planning with centralized conflict resolution. In our approach, each robot autonomously plans its path and shares this information with a centralized node. The centralized system detects potential conflicts and allows only one of the conflicting robots to proceed at a time, instructing others to stop outside the conflicting area to avoid deadlocks. Unlike traditional centralized planning methods, our system does not dictate robot paths but instead provides stop commands, functioning as a virtual traffic light. In simulation experiments with multiple robots, our approach increased the success rate of robots reaching their goals while reducing deadlocks. Furthermore, we successfully validated the system in real-world experiments with two quadruped robots and separately with wheeled Duckiebots.

TL;DR: Scaling up model capacity, data, and compute for humanoid control through motion tracking yields a generalist controller capable of natural and robust whole-body movements, with practical applications in real-time planning and multi-modal input interfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural controllers for humanoids are limited in size, behavior scope, and training resources, failing to achieve the scaling benefits seen in other foundation models. The goal is to demonstrate that scaling can produce a generalist humanoid controller with natural movement capabilities.

Method: Use motion tracking as a scalable task with dense supervision from diverse motion-capture data (100M frames, 700 hours). Scale along three axes: network size (1.2M to 42M parameters), dataset volume, and compute (9k GPU hours). Implement real-time kinematic planner and unified token space for various motion inputs.

Result: The scaled model shows steady performance improvement with increased compute and data diversity. Learned representations generalize to unseen motions. The model serves as a practical foundation with real-time planning capabilities and supports multiple input interfaces (VR, videos, VLA models).

Conclusion: Motion tracking at scale provides a practical foundation for humanoid control, exhibiting favorable scaling properties and enabling natural, robust movements with generalization capabilities and multi-modal control interfaces.

Abstract: Despite the rise of billion-parameter foundation models trained across thousands of GPUs, similar scaling gains have not been shown for humanoid control. Current neural controllers for humanoids remain modest in size, target a limited behavior set, and are trained on a handful of GPUs over several days. We show that scaling up model capacity, data, and compute yields a generalist humanoid controller capable of creating natural and robust whole-body movements. Specifically, we posit motion tracking as a natural and scalable task for humanoid control, leverageing dense supervision from diverse motion-capture data to acquire human motion priors without manual reward engineering. We build a foundation model for motion tracking by scaling along three axes: network size (from 1.2M to 42M parameters), dataset volume (over 100M frames, 700 hours of high-quality motion data), and compute (9k GPU hours). Beyond demonstrating the benefits of scale, we show the practical utility of our model through two mechanisms: (1) a real-time universal kinematic planner that bridges motion tracking to downstream task execution, enabling natural and interactive control, and (2) a unified token space that supports various motion input interfaces, such as VR teleoperation devices, human videos, and vision-language-action (VLA) models, all using the same policy. Scaling motion tracking exhibits favorable properties: performance improves steadily with increased compute and data diversity, and learned representations generalize to unseen motions, establishing motion tracking at scale as a practical foundation for humanoid control.

*Collin Hague,Artur Wolek*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a UAV search strategy using probabilistic visibility volumes and iterative deepening A* to find moving POIs in urban environments with sensor occlusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to efficiently search for moving points of interest in urban environments where buildings can occlude UAV sensors, requiring sophisticated path planning that accounts for visibility constraints.

Method: Uses probabilistic visibility volumes (time-varying 3D representations of sensing constraints) with iterative deepening A* planning, max-pooling for variable-timestep planning to balance long/short-term planning.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods in cluttered environments, especially when UAV sensors have higher false alarm probabilities, as shown through Monte-Carlo simulations.

Conclusion: The probabilistic visibility volume approach with variable-timestep planning provides effective search strategies for UAVs in complex urban environments with sensor limitations.

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of searching for a point of interest (POI) moving along an urban road network with an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV). The UAV is modeled as a variable-speed Dubins vehicle with a line-of-sight sensor in an urban environment that may occlude the sensor's view of the POI. A search strategy is proposed that exploits a probabilistic visibility volume (VV) to plan its future motion with iterative deepening $A^\ast$. The probabilistic VV is a time-varying three-dimensional representation of the sensing constraints for a particular distribution of the POI's state. To find the path most likely to view the POI, the planner uses a heuristic to optimistically estimate the probability of viewing the POI over a time horizon. The probabilistic VV is max-pooled to create a variable-timestep planner that reduces the search space and balances long-term and short-term planning. The proposed path planning method is compared to prior work with a Monte-Carlo simulation and is shown to outperform the baseline methods in cluttered environments when the UAV's sensor has a higher false alarm probability.

Motivation: Inspired by natural organisms like Cephalopods and Pachyderms that use stiffness modulation for dexterity, the research aims to provide equivalent stiffness modulation capabilities for soft robots through mechanical layer jamming.

Method: The study uses two-layer multi-material structures with tooth-like protrusions, identifies key design parameters (mainly tooth geometry), and performs comprehensive bending and torsional load tests to understand parameter influence on jammed structure performance.

Result: The mechanical layer jamming structures achieved a peak stiffness change of 5 times in bending and 3.2 times in torsion, while also measuring the force required to separate jammed layers - a previously overlooked parameter.

Conclusion: This research provides principled design guidelines for mechanical layer jammed systems and helps researchers select appropriate designs for specific application domains in soft robotics.

Abstract: Organisms in nature, such as Cephalopods and Pachyderms, exploit stiffness modulation to achieve amazing dexterity in the control of their appendages. In this paper, we explore the phenomenon of layer jamming, which is a popular stiffness modulation mechanism that provides an equivalent capability for soft robots. More specifically, we focus on mechanical layer jamming, which we realise through two-layer multi material structure with tooth-like protrusions. We identify key design parameters for mechanical layer jamming systems, including the ability to modulate stiffness, and perform a variety of comprehensive tests placing the specimens under bending and torsional loads to understand the influence of our selected design parameters (mainly tooth geometry) on the performance of the jammed structures. We note the ability of these structures to produce a peak change in stiffness of 5 times in bending and 3.2 times in torsion. We also measure the force required to separate the two jammed layers, an often ignored parameter in the study of jamming-induced stiffness change. This study aims to shed light on the principled design of mechanical layer jammed systems and guide researchers in the selection of appropriate designs for their specific application domains.

Result: The approach was validated through simulations and real-world experiments on a bionic robotic leg, demonstrating equivalence and effectiveness. EquiMus also proved useful for downstream tasks like controller design and learning-based control strategies.

Conclusion: EquiMus provides an effective solution for accurate dynamic modeling and simulation of complex musculoskeletal rigid-soft hybrid robots, enabling better control and learning-based applications.

Abstract: Dynamic modeling and control are critical for unleashing soft robots' potential, yet remain challenging due to their complex constitutive behaviors and real-world operating conditions. Bio-inspired musculoskeletal robots, which integrate rigid skeletons with soft actuators, combine high load-bearing capacity with inherent flexibility. Although actuation dynamics have been studied through experimental methods and surrogate models, accurate and effective modeling and simulation remain a significant challenge, especially for large-scale hybrid rigid--soft robots with continuously distributed mass, kinematic loops, and diverse motion modes. To address these challenges, we propose EquiMus, an energy-equivalent dynamic modeling framework and MuJoCo-based simulation for musculoskeletal rigid--soft hybrid robots with linear elastic actuators. The equivalence and effectiveness of the proposed approach are validated and examined through both simulations and real-world experiments on a bionic robotic leg. EquiMus further demonstrates its utility for downstream tasks, including controller design and learning-based control strategies.

### [202] [Dual-MPC Footstep Planning for Robust Quadruped Locomotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07921)
*Byeong-Il Ham,Hyun-Bin Kim,Jeonguk Kang,Keun Ha Choi,Kyung-Soo Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A footstep planning strategy using model predictive control (MPC) that coordinates footstep placement and ground reaction forces to robustly regulate body orientation against undesired rotations in quadruped robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model-based locomotion approaches typically exclude angular velocity in footstep planning, handling angular momentum only through ground reaction forces, which limits tracking performance and robustness.

Method: Proposes a dual-input MPC approach that coordinates both footstep placement and ground reaction forces through a mutual-feedback loop, with each component iteratively updating using the other's solution to account for angular velocity.

Result: The method reduces body oscillation, enables extended stance and swing phases, and demonstrates robust locomotion across various terrains on a quadruped robot.

Conclusion: Coordinating footstep placement with ground reaction forces through MPC improves angular momentum control and tracking performance, leading to more stable and robust locomotion in legged robots.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a footstep planning strategy based on model predictive control (MPC) that enables robust regulation of body orientation against undesired body rotations by optimizing footstep placement. Model-based locomotion approaches typically adopt heuristic methods or planning based on the linear inverted pendulum model. These methods account for linear velocity in footstep planning, while excluding angular velocity, which leads to angular momentum being handled exclusively via ground reaction force (GRF). Footstep planning based on MPC that takes angular velocity into account recasts the angular momentum control problem as a dual-input approach that coordinates GRFs and footstep placement, instead of optimizing GRFs alone, thereby improving tracking performance. A mutual-feedback loop couples the footstep planner and the GRF MPC, with each using the other's solution to iteratively update footsteps and GRFs. The use of optimal solutions reduces body oscillation and enables extended stance and swing phases. The method is validated on a quadruped robot, demonstrating robust locomotion with reduced oscillations, longer stance and swing phases across various terrains.

*Okan Arif Guvenkaya,Selim Ahmet Iz,Mustafa Unel*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Novel local path planning algorithm combining tangent-based planning and extrapolation for UGVs in dynamic environments with polynomial-trajectory obstacles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UGVs need effective obstacle avoidance and path planning in densely populated dynamic environments where global paths exist but local collision avoidance is crucial.

Method: Combines tangent-based path planning with extrapolation methods to create decision-making algorithm for local path planning, assuming polynomial trajectories for dynamic obstacles.

Result: Simulation results show effectiveness in generating collision-free paths that allow safe navigation between initial and target locations in scenarios with randomly moving dynamic obstacles.

Conclusion: The proposed local path planning strategy successfully enables UGVs to navigate safely through dynamic environments by gradually generating collision-free paths.

Abstract: Obstacle avoidance and path planning are essential for guiding unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) through environments that are densely populated with dynamic obstacles. This paper develops a novel approach that combines tangentbased path planning and extrapolation methods to create a new decision-making algorithm for local path planning. In the assumed scenario, a UGV has a prior knowledge of its initial and target points within the dynamic environment. A global path has already been computed, and the robot is provided with waypoints along this path. As the UGV travels between these waypoints, the algorithm aims to avoid collisions with dynamic obstacles. These obstacles follow polynomial trajectories, with their initial positions randomized in the local map and velocities randomized between O and the allowable physical velocity limit of the robot, along with some random accelerations. The developed algorithm is tested in several scenarios where many dynamic obstacles move randomly in the environment. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed local path planning strategy by gradually generating a collision free path which allows the robot to navigate safely between initial and the target locations.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates and improves an existing USV obstacle detection system by testing it on marine datasets, integrating it into ROS for real-time performance, and proposing a hybrid sensor fusion approach that combines camera and LiDAR data for better obstacle mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing robust obstacle detection and tracking for Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) in marine environments is challenging due to complex environmental conditions. The authors aim to build upon previous work from GRAAL lab to create a more effective system.

Method: The authors first evaluated the existing system on published marine datasets, then integrated the system components into ROS for real-time testing with synchronized LiDAR and camera data from MIT marine datasets. They compared two approaches: sensor fusion (camera + LiDAR) and LiDAR-only detection/tracking, ultimately proposing a hybrid approach.

Result: The experimental analysis showed performance of both sensor fusion and LiDAR-only approaches. The hybrid approach successfully merged advantages from both methods to create an informative obstacle map of the USV's surrounding environment.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid approach combining camera and LiDAR data provides an effective solution for building comprehensive obstacle maps for USVs in marine environments, leveraging the strengths of both sensor modalities.

Abstract: Developing a robust and effective obstacle detection and tracking system for Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) at marine environments is a challenging task. Research efforts have been made in this area during the past years by GRAAL lab at the university of Genova that resulted in a methodology for detecting and tracking obstacles on the image plane and, then, locating them in the 3D LiDAR point cloud. In this work, we continue on the developed system by, firstly, evaluating its performance on recently published marine datasets. Then, we integrate the different blocks of the system on ROS platform where we could test it in real-time on synchronized LiDAR and camera data collected in various marine conditions available in the MIT marine datasets. We present a thorough experimental analysis of the results obtained using two approaches; one that uses sensor fusion between the camera and LiDAR to detect and track the obstacles and the other uses only the LiDAR point cloud for the detection and tracking. In the end, we propose a hybrid approach that merges the advantages of both approaches to build an informative obstacles map of the surrounding environment to the USV.

TL;DR: GTNS is a scalable game-theoretic approach that computes Nash Equilibria for multi-agent interactions without explicit communication, using nested search to efficiently find solutions while avoiding local minima and trajectory enumeration issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing game-theoretic methods for multi-agent robot interactions have limitations: optimization-based approaches require simplified dynamics and get stuck in local minima, while payoff matrix methods suffer from poor scalability due to explicit trajectory enumeration.

Method: Game-Theoretic Nested Search (GTNS) efficiently searches action spaces while discarding trajectories violating Nash Equilibrium constraints through inner search over lower-dimensional spaces, enabling explicit equilibrium selection via user-specified global objectives.

Result: GTNS achieves Nash Equilibrium solutions in autonomous driving and racing scenarios within seconds on commodity hardware, demonstrating scalability and efficiency in realistic interaction settings.

Conclusion: GTNS provides a scalable, provably correct approach for computing Nash Equilibria in general dynamical systems, overcoming limitations of existing methods and enabling rich multi-agent interactions without explicit communication.

Abstract: To facilitate effective, safe deployment in the real world, individual robots must reason about interactions with other agents, which often occur without explicit communication. Recent work has identified game theory, particularly the concept of Nash Equilibrium (NE), as a key enabler for behavior-aware decision-making. Yet, existing work falls short of fully unleashing the power of game-theoretic reasoning. Specifically, popular optimization-based methods require simplified robot dynamics and tend to get trapped in local minima due to convexification. Other works that rely on payoff matrices suffer from poor scalability due to the explicit enumeration of all possible trajectories. To bridge this gap, we introduce Game-Theoretic Nested Search (GTNS), a novel, scalable, and provably correct approach for computing NEs in general dynamical systems. GTNS efficiently searches the action space of all agents involved, while discarding trajectories that violate the NE constraint (no unilateral deviation) through an inner search over a lower-dimensional space. Our algorithm enables explicit selection among equilibria by utilizing a user-specified global objective, thereby capturing a rich set of realistic interactions. We demonstrate the approach on a variety of autonomous driving and racing scenarios where we achieve solutions in mere seconds on commodity hardware.

TL;DR: A two-layer electrostatic film actuator with integrated brake achieves 90.5% higher actuation stress than conventional three-phase actuators and enables load retention through electrostatic adhesion braking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional motor-driven robotic systems face challenges with large mass, complex control, and need for separate braking mechanisms, limiting lightweight applications. Electrostatic film actuators offer advantages but need improved actuation stress.

Method: Developed a two-layer electrostatic film actuator with alternately distributed electrodes on both top and bottom layers to achieve smaller effective electrode pitch under same fabrication constraints, with integrated electrostatic adhesion braking mechanism.

Result: Achieved actuation stress of approximately 241 N/m², representing 90.5% improvement over previous three-phase actuators in air. Demonstrated capabilities through tug-of-war tests, payload operations, robotic arm, and dual-mode gripper.

Conclusion: The two-layer electrostatic film actuator with integrated brake successfully enhances output performance while providing both actuation and braking capabilities, making it suitable for lightweight robotic applications.

Abstract: Robotic systems driven by conventional motors often suffer from challenges such as large mass, complex control algorithms, and the need for additional braking mechanisms, which limit their applications in lightweight and compact robotic platforms. Electrostatic film actuators offer several advantages, including thinness, flexibility, lightweight construction, and high open-loop positioning accuracy. However, the actuation stress exhibited by conventional actuators in air still needs improvement, particularly for the widely used three-phase electrode design. To enhance the output performance of actuators, this paper presents a two-layer electrostatic film actuator with an integrated brake. By alternately distributing electrodes on both the top and bottom layers, a smaller effective electrode pitch is achieved under the same fabrication constraints, resulting in an actuation stress of approximately 241~N/m$^2$, representing a 90.5\% improvement over previous three-phase actuators operating in air. Furthermore, its integrated electrostatic adhesion mechanism enables load retention under braking mode. Several demonstrations, including a tug-of-war between a conventional single-layer actuator and the proposed two-layer actuator, a payload operation, a one-degree-of-freedom robotic arm, and a dual-mode gripper, were conducted to validate the actuator's advantageous capabilities in both actuation and braking modes.

Motivation: Address the unaddressed problem of jackknifing and mutual collisions in elongated, articulated vehicles for real-world applications like logistics automation, mining, and agriculture, where existing swarm robotics research doesn't cover complex vehicle kinematics.

Method: A purely reaction-based, decentralized swarm intelligence strategy specifically designed for elongated articulated vehicles, focusing on jackknifing avoidance and mutual collision prevention.

Result: Single HAV experiments: 99.8% jackknifing avoidance, 86.7% reach first goal, 83.4% reach second goal. Two HAV interactions: 98.9% jackknifing avoidance, 79.4% reach first goal, 65.1% reach second goal, with 99.7% mutual collision avoidance.

Conclusion: The proposed decentralized swarm intelligence approach effectively addresses jackknifing and mutual collision problems in Heavy Articulated Vehicles, demonstrating high success rates in simulation and providing a foundation for real-world applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to avoiding jackknifing and mutual collisions in Heavy Articulated Vehicles (HAVs) by leveraging decentralized swarm intelligence. In contrast to typical swarm robotics research, our robots are elongated and exhibit complex kinematics, introducing unique challenges. Despite its relevance to real-world applications such as logistics automation, remote mining, airport baggage transport, and agricultural operations, this problem has not been addressed in the existing literature.
  To tackle this new class of swarm robotics problems, we propose a purely reaction-based, decentralized swarm intelligence strategy tailored to automate elongated, articulated vehicles. The method presented in this paper prioritizes jackknifing avoidance and establishes a foundation for mutual collision avoidance. We validate our approach through extensive simulation experiments and provide a comprehensive analysis of its performance. For the experiments with a single HAV, we observe that for 99.8% jackknifing was successfully avoided and that 86.7% and 83.4% reach their first and second goals, respectively. With two HAVs interacting, we observe 98.9%, 79.4%, and 65.1%, respectively, while 99.7% of the HAVs do not experience mutual collisions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional numerical optimization methods for MPC become intractable for nonlinear or non-differentiable systems common in robotics, creating a need for alternative approaches that can handle arbitrary cost functions and dynamics.

Conclusion: Probabilistic inference-based MPC offers a systematic framework that can handle complex robotic systems, and this tutorial serves as a guide for researchers and practitioners to understand, implement, and extend these methods.

Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a fundamental framework for optimizing robot behavior over a finite future horizon. While conventional numerical optimization methods can efficiently handle simple dynamics and cost structures, they often become intractable for the nonlinear or non-differentiable systems commonly encountered in robotics. This article provides a tutorial on probabilistic inference-based MPC, presenting a unified theoretical foundation and a comprehensive overview of representative methods. Probabilistic inference-based MPC approaches, such as Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control, have gained significant attention by reinterpreting optimal control as a problem of probabilistic inference. Rather than relying on gradient-based numerical optimization, these methods estimate optimal control distributions through sampling-based techniques, accommodating arbitrary cost functions and dynamics. We first derive the optimal control distribution from the standard optimal control problem, elucidating its probabilistic interpretation and key characteristics. The widely used MPPI algorithm is then derived as a practical example, followed by discussions on prior and variational distribution design, tuning principles, and theoretical aspects. This article aims to serve as a systematic guide for researchers and practitioners seeking to understand, implement, and extend these methods in robotics and beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM training lacks robust perspective-taking capabilities needed for effective multi-agent interaction, particularly in understanding physical and epistemic viewpoints of other agents.

Method: Extended the classic Director task with active visual exploration across seven scenarios of increasing complexity, using ReAct framework that combines reasoning and acting, with varying state representations and prompting strategies.

Result: Explicit perspective cues combined with active exploration strategies significantly improved the model's interpretative accuracy and collaborative effectiveness.

Conclusion: Integrating active perception with perspective-taking mechanisms shows promise for advancing LLMs in robotics and multi-agent systems, laying groundwork for adaptive, context-aware AI.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal foundation models have significantly broadened their application in robotics and collaborative systems. However, effective multi-agent interaction necessitates robust perspective-taking capabilities, enabling models to interpret both physical and epistemic viewpoints. Current training paradigms often neglect these interactive contexts, resulting in challenges when models must reason about the subjectivity of individual perspectives or navigate environments with multiple observers. This study evaluates whether explicitly incorporating diverse points of view using the ReAct framework, an approach that integrates reasoning and acting, can enhance an LLM's ability to understand and ground the demands of other agents. We extend the classic Director task by introducing active visual exploration across a suite of seven scenarios of increasing perspective-taking complexity. These scenarios are designed to challenge the agent's capacity to resolve referential ambiguity based on visual access and interaction, under varying state representations and prompting strategies, including ReAct-style reasoning. Our results demonstrate that explicit perspective cues, combined with active exploration strategies, significantly improve the model's interpretative accuracy and collaborative effectiveness. These findings highlight the potential of integrating active perception with perspective-taking mechanisms in advancing LLMs' application in robotics and multi-agent systems, setting a foundation for future research into adaptive and context-aware AI systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PGS is a perception-guided self-supervision framework that addresses causal confusion in autonomous driving by using perception outputs as supervisory signals instead of noisy expert trajectories, achieving state-of-the-art performance on closed-loop benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end autonomous driving systems trained via imitation learning suffer from causal confusion and performance degradation in closed-loop scenarios due to overreliance on noisy expert trajectories that interfere with modeling causal relationships between environmental contexts and driving actions.

Method: Proposes Perception-Guided Self-Supervision (PGS) that uses perception outputs (lane centerlines, predicted motions of surrounding agents) as primary supervisory signals, aligning decision-making inputs and outputs with perception results through positive and negative self-supervision for ego trajectory.

Result: Achieves Driving Score of 78.08 and mean success rate of 48.64% on Bench2Drive benchmark, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods including those with more complex architectures and inference pipelines.

Conclusion: PGS effectively mitigates causal confusion and enhances real-world generalization in autonomous driving, demonstrating the promise of perception-driven supervision over traditional imitation learning approaches.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems, predominantly trained through imitation learning, have demonstrated considerable effectiveness in leveraging large-scale expert driving data. Despite their success in open-loop evaluations, these systems often exhibit significant performance degradation in closed-loop scenarios due to causal confusion. This confusion is fundamentally exacerbated by the overreliance of the imitation learning paradigm on expert trajectories, which often contain unattributable noise and interfere with the modeling of causal relationships between environmental contexts and appropriate driving actions.
  To address this fundamental limitation, we propose Perception-Guided Self-Supervision (PGS) - a simple yet effective training paradigm that leverages perception outputs as the primary supervisory signals, explicitly modeling causal relationships in decision-making. The proposed framework aligns both the inputs and outputs of the decision-making module with perception results, such as lane centerlines and the predicted motions of surrounding agents, by introducing positive and negative self-supervision for the ego trajectory. This alignment is specifically designed to mitigate causal confusion arising from the inherent noise in expert trajectories.
  Equipped with perception-driven supervision, our method, built on a standard end-to-end architecture, achieves a Driving Score of 78.08 and a mean success rate of 48.64% on the challenging closed-loop Bench2Drive benchmark, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods, including those employing more complex network architectures and inference pipelines. These results underscore the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed PGS framework and point to a promising direction for addressing causal confusion and enhancing real-world generalization in autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for reliable uncertainty margins in data-driven state estimation models, especially for safety-critical applications, by solving model-mismatch issues in robotic systems.

Method: Uses MFR-PINP to learn residuals between low-fidelity predictions and high-fidelity ground-truth dynamics, incorporates split conformal prediction for uncertainty guarantees, and implements hybrid online learning for real-time applications.

Result: Experimental comparison with state-of-the-art Kalman filter variants (unscented Kalman filter and deep Kalman filter) showed promising performance in real-time estimation scenarios.

Conclusion: MFR-PINP model is a viable option for real-time state estimation tasks, providing reliable uncertainty quantification while addressing model-mismatch issues in robotic systems.

Abstract: Various neural network architectures are used in many of the state-of-the-art approaches for real-time nonlinear state estimation. With the ever-increasing incorporation of these data-driven models into the estimation domain, model predictions with reliable margins of error are a requirement -- especially for safety-critical applications. This paper discusses the application of a novel real-time, data-driven estimation approach based on the multi-fidelity residual physics-informed neural process (MFR-PINP) toward the real-time state estimation of a robotic system. Specifically, we address the model-mismatch issue of selecting an accurate kinematic model by tasking the MFR-PINP to also learn the residuals between simple, low-fidelity predictions and complex, high-fidelity ground-truth dynamics. To account for model uncertainty present in a physical implementation, robust uncertainty guarantees from the split conformal (SC) prediction framework are modeled in the training and inference paradigms. We provide implementation details of our MFR-PINP-based estimator for a hybrid online learning setting to validate our model's usage in real-time applications. Experimental results of our approach's performance in comparison to the state-of-the-art variants of the Kalman filter (i.e. unscented Kalman filter and deep Kalman filter) in estimation scenarios showed promising results for the MFR-PINP model as a viable option in real-time estimation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based inertial odometry methods work well for pedestrians but degrade severely on quadruped robots due to their distinct and highly dynamic motion patterns, requiring a cross-platform solution.

Method: Uses rule-based expert selection to classify motion platforms and route IMU sequences to platform-specific expert networks, with dual-stage attention architecture for displacement prediction and uncertainty estimation, fused through Extended Kalman Filter.

Conclusion: X-IONet effectively advances accurate and robust inertial navigation across both human and legged robot platforms, demonstrating superior cross-platform performance.

Abstract: Learning-based inertial odometry has achieved remarkable progress in pedestrian navigation. However, extending these methods to quadruped robots remains challenging due to their distinct and highly dynamic motion patterns. Models that perform well on pedestrian data often experience severe degradation when deployed on legged platforms. To tackle this challenge, we introduce X-IONet, a cross-platform inertial odometry framework that operates solely using a single Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). X-IONet incorporates a rule-based expert selection module to classify motion platforms and route IMU sequences to platform-specific expert networks. The displacement prediction network features a dual-stage attention architecture that jointly models long-range temporal dependencies and inter-axis correlations, enabling accurate motion representation. It outputs both displacement and associated uncertainty, which are further fused through an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for robust state estimation. Extensive experiments on public pedestrian datasets and a self-collected quadruped robot dataset demonstrate that X-IONet achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by 14.3% and Relative Trajectory Error (RTE) by 11.4% on pedestrian data, and by 52.8% and 41.3% on quadruped robot data. These results highlight the effectiveness of X-IONet in advancing accurate and robust inertial navigation across both human and legged robot platforms.

TL;DR: A learning framework for salamander-like quadruped robots that enables acquisition of diverse omnidirectional gaits without predefined patterns, using phase variables and morphological symmetry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing controllers for salamander-like robots rely on predefined gait patterns, limiting locomotion diversity and real-world applicability.

Method: Phase variables for body part control with forward/backward evolution, phase coverage reward for leg phase space exploration, and morphological symmetry via data augmentation.

Result: Robot successfully acquired 22 omnidirectional gaits exhibiting dynamic and symmetric movements.

Conclusion: The proposed learning framework effectively enables diverse and flexible locomotion in salamander-like quadruped robots.

Abstract: Salamander-like quadruped robots are designed inspired by the skeletal structure of their biological counterparts. However, existing controllers cannot fully exploit these morphological features and largely rely on predefined gait patterns or joint trajectories, which prevents the generation of diverse and flexible locomotion and limits their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a learning framework that enables the robot to acquire a diverse repertoire of omnidirectional gaits without reference motions. Each body part is controlled by a phase variable capable of forward and backward evolution, with a phase coverage reward to promote the exploration of the leg phase space. Additionally, morphological symmetry of the robot is incorporated via data augmentation, improving sample efficiency and enforcing both motion-level and task-level symmetry in learned behaviors. Extensive experiments show that the robot successfully acquires 22 omnidirectional gaits exhibiting both dynamic and symmetric movements, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed learning framework.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kubernetes' assumptions of stable networks, homogeneous resources, and ample compute capacity don't fully apply to mobile, resource-constrained robotic environments in smart manufacturing.

Method: Case study on smart-manufacturing AMRs with initial comparison between CODECO orchestration and standard Kubernetes using controlled KinD environment, measuring pod deployment/deletion times, CPU/memory usage, and inter-pod data rates.

Abstract: Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) increasingly adopt containerized micro-services across the Edge-Cloud continuum. While Kubernetes is the de-facto orchestrator for such systems, its assumptions of stable networks, homogeneous resources, and ample compute capacity do not fully hold in mobile, resource-constrained robotic environments.
  This paper describes a case study on smart-manufacturing AMRs and performs an initial comparison between CODECO orchestration and standard Kubernetes using a controlled KinD environment. Metrics include pod deployment and deletion times, CPU and memory usage, and inter-pod data rates. The observed results indicate that CODECO offers reduced CPU consumption and more stable communication patterns, at the cost of modest memory overhead (10-15%) and slightly increased pod lifecycle latency due to secure overlay initialization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current intent inference methods in teleoperation often ignore subtle motion cues that indicate sudden intent changes, limiting their ability to detect goal transitions and adapt to unstructured scenarios.

Method: Uses jump-drift-diffusion stochastic differential equations to model discontinuous and continuous dynamics, Kramers-Moyal coefficients for jump detection, outlier detection for goal transitions, and SINDy modeling with goal transitions as control inputs.

Result: Demonstrated through retrospective study of 600 operator trajectories, showing ability to produce probabilistic reachability sets and perform early detection of existing goals while discovering undefined goals in unstructured scenarios.

Conclusion: Psychic framework effectively infers operator intent by incorporating both discontinuous jumps and continuous dynamics, enabling improved goal transition detection and motion behavior inference in teleoperation tasks.

Abstract: Intent inferencing in teleoperation has been instrumental in aligning operator goals and coordinating actions with robotic partners. However, current intent inference methods often ignore subtle motion that can be strong indicators for a sudden change in intent. Specifically, we aim to tackle 1) if we can detect sudden jumps in operator trajectories, 2) how we appropriately use these sudden jump motions to infer an operator's goal state, and 3) how to incorporate these discontinuous and continuous dynamics to infer operator motion. Our framework, called Psychic, models these small indicative motions through a jump-drift-diffusion stochastic differential equation to cover discontinuous and continuous dynamics. Kramers-Moyal (KM) coefficients allow us to detect jumps with a trajectory which we pair with a statistical outlier detection algorithm to nominate goal transitions. Through identifying jumps, we can perform early detection of existing goals and discover undefined goals in unstructured scenarios. Our framework then applies a Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) model using KM coefficients with the goal transitions as a control input to infer an operator's motion behavior in unstructured scenarios. We demonstrate Psychic can produce probabilistic reachability sets and compare our strategy to a negative log-likelihood model fit.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of integrating augmented commands with multiple degrees of freedom in BCIs without disrupting natural movement, by leveraging sensory afferents through tactile stimulation.

Method: Used a tactile-evoked P300 paradigm in a multi-day experiment with single motor recognition and dual task paradigms to assess BCI performance and its influence on natural movement.

Result: Achieved real-time decoding of four supernumerary degrees of freedom with significant performance improvements after three days of training. Natural movement remained unimpaired during concurrent supernumerary control, and the interface successfully commanded two supernumerary robotic arms for functional assistance.

Conclusion: Establishes a new neural interface paradigm for movement augmentation through sensory afferent stimulation, enabling expanded motor degrees of freedom without impairing natural movement.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) promise to extend human movement capabilities by enabling direct neural control of supernumerary effectors, yet integrating augmented commands with multiple degrees of freedom without disrupting natural movement remains a key challenge. Here, we propose a tactile-encoded BCI that leverages sensory afferents through a novel tactile-evoked P300 paradigm, allowing intuitive and reliable decoding of supernumerary motor intentions even when superimposed with voluntary actions. The interface was evaluated in a multi-day experiment comprising of a single motor recognition task to validate baseline BCI performance and a dual task paradigm to assess the potential influence between the BCI and natural human movement. The brain interface achieved real-time and reliable decoding of four supernumerary degrees of freedom, with significant performance improvements after only three days of training. Importantly, after training, performance did not differ significantly between the single- and dual-BCI task conditions, and natural movement remained unimpaired during concurrent supernumerary control. Lastly, the interface was deployed in a movement augmentation task, demonstrating its ability to command two supernumerary robotic arms for functional assistance during bimanual tasks. These results establish a new neural interface paradigm for movement augmentation through stimulation of sensory afferents, expanding motor degrees of freedom without impairing natural movement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable minimally invasive prostate procedures through natural orifices using dexterous concentric tube robots, advancing toward fully automated prostate enucleation.

Method: Coordinated approach with model-based resection planner generating tool trajectories from CT volumes, and PushCVAE learning-based retraction network trained on surgeon demonstrations, executed under Level-3 supervised autonomy on hydrogel phantoms.

Result: Achieved 97.1% resection of targeted median lobe volume in prostate phantom studies, demonstrating feasibility of the combined autonomous system.

Conclusion: Establishes foundation for image-guided autonomy in transurethral robotic surgery and represents first step toward fully automated minimally-invasive prostate enucleation.

Abstract: Concentric tube robots (CTRs) offer dexterous motion at millimeter scales, enabling minimally invasive procedures through natural orifices. This work presents a coordinated model-based resection planner and learning-based retraction network that work together to enable semi-autonomous tissue resection using a dual-arm transurethral concentric tube robot (the Virtuoso). The resection planner operates directly on segmented CT volumes of prostate phantoms, automatically generating tool trajectories for a three-phase median lobe resection workflow: left/median trough resection, right/median trough resection, and median blunt dissection. The retraction network, PushCVAE, trained on surgeon demonstrations, generates retractions according to the procedural phase. The procedure is executed under Level-3 (supervised) autonomy on a prostate phantom composed of hydrogel materials that replicate the mechanical and cutting properties of tissue. As a feasibility study, we demonstrate that our combined autonomous system achieves a 97.1% resection of the targeted volume of the median lobe. Our study establishes a foundation for image-guided autonomy in transurethral robotic surgery and represents a first step toward fully automated minimally-invasive prostate enucleation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for learning from human feedback (comparisons, rankings, demonstrations) often fail to guarantee safety in safety-critical domains, creating a need for provably safe learning approaches.

Method: Propose using Weighted Signal Temporal Logic (WSTL) with structural pruning and log-transform procedures to reduce problem size and recast as Mixed-Integer Linear Program while maintaining safety guarantees.

Result: Method effectively captures nuanced preferences and models complex task objectives in experiments on robotic navigation and real-world Formula 1 data.

Conclusion: The approach provides safety-guaranteed, optimal, and efficient learning from preferences, rankings, or demonstrations while handling complex task objectives.

Abstract: Autonomous systems increasingly rely on human feedback to align their behavior, expressed as pairwise comparisons, rankings, or demonstrations. While existing methods can adapt behaviors, they often fail to guarantee safety in safety-critical domains. We propose a safety-guaranteed, optimal, and efficient approach to solve the learning problem from preferences, rankings, or demonstrations using Weighted Signal Temporal Logic (WSTL). WSTL learning problems, when implemented naively, lead to multi-linear constraints in the weights to be learned. By introducing structural pruning and log-transform procedures, we reduce the problem size and recast the problem as a Mixed-Integer Linear Program while preserving safety guarantees. Experiments on robotic navigation and real-world Formula 1 data demonstrate that the method effectively captures nuanced preferences and models complex task objectives.

*Rong Xue,Jiageng Mao,Mingtong Zhang,Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SeFA is a visuomotor policy learning framework that uses selective flow alignment to correct generated actions using expert demonstrations, ensuring observation consistency while maintaining efficiency and multimodality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current rectified flow approaches in visuomotor policy learning suffer from accumulated error as generated actions deviate from ground-truth actions corresponding to visual observations, leading to unstable task execution.

Method: Selective Flow Alignment (SeFA) uses a selective flow alignment strategy that leverages expert demonstrations to selectively correct generated actions and restore consistency with observations while preserving multimodality, enabling efficient one-step flow inference.

Result: SeFA Policy surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and flow-based policies in both simulated and real-world manipulation tasks, achieving superior accuracy and robustness while reducing inference latency by over 98%.

Conclusion: SeFA provides a scalable and dependable solution for real-time visuomotor policy learning by unifying rectified flow efficiency with observation-consistent action generation.

Abstract: Developing efficient and accurate visuomotor policies poses a central challenge in robotic imitation learning. While recent rectified flow approaches have advanced visuomotor policy learning, they suffer from a key limitation: After iterative distillation, generated actions may deviate from the ground-truth actions corresponding to the current visual observation, leading to accumulated error as the reflow process repeats and unstable task execution. We present Selective Flow Alignment (SeFA), an efficient and accurate visuomotor policy learning framework. SeFA resolves this challenge by a selective flow alignment strategy, which leverages expert demonstrations to selectively correct generated actions and restore consistency with observations, while preserving multimodality. This design introduces a consistency correction mechanism that ensures generated actions remain observation-aligned without sacrificing the efficiency of one-step flow inference. Extensive experiments across both simulated and real-world manipulation tasks show that SeFA Policy surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and flow-based policies, achieving superior accuracy and robustness while reducing inference latency by over 98%. By unifying rectified flow efficiency with observation-consistent action generation, SeFA provides a scalable and dependable solution for real-time visuomotor policy learning.
