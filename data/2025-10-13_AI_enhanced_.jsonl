To address this\nproblem, we propose a novel graph-guided Mamba framework, named Hamba, which\nbridges graph learning and state space modeling. Our core idea is to\nreformulate Mamba's scanning into graph-guided bidirectional scanning for 3D\nreconstruction using a few effective tokens.

This paper\naims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by\ntackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and\nlabor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of\neffective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to\nindividual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that\nintegrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware\nmodeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden\nthe all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using\na task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video\nscenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising\napproximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While\nspecialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for\nevaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by\nmanually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive\ntraining with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the\npotential knowledge conflict. Accordingly, we introduce SpaceVista-7B, a\nspatial reasoning model that accepts dense inputs beyond semantics and uses\nscale as an anchor for scale-aware experts and progressive rewards.

By integrating action modules into these\npretrained models, VLA methods exhibit improved generalization. However,\ntraining them from scratch is costly. In this work, we propose a simple yet\neffective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution\ncapability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our\narchitecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token\nand a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action\nknowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform\nlightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the\nsmall action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder\nand avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the\nlanguage model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to\nintegrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation. Specifically, the\naction token provides the VLM with a direct handle for predicting future\nactions, while the state encoder allows the model to incorporate robot dynamics\nnot captured by vision alone.
