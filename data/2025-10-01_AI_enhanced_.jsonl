Prior work has applied data-driven AD to time series data in\nspecific robotic tasks, but its transferability across control strategies and\ntask types has not been shown. Leveraging time series data, such as\nforce/torque signals, allows to directly capture robot-environment\ninteractions, crucial for manipulation and online failure detection. Their\nbroad availability, high sampling rates, and low dimensionality enable high\ntemporal resolution and efficient processing. As robotic tasks can have widely\nsignal characteristics and requirements, AD methods which can be applied in the\nsame way to a wide range of tasks is needed, ideally with good data efficiency.\nWe examine three industrial robotic tasks, each presenting several anomalies.\nTest scenarios in robotic cabling, screwing, and sanding are built, and\nmultimodal time series data is gathered. Several autoencoder-based methods are\ncompared, evaluating generalization across tasks and control methods (diffusion\npolicy, position, and impedance control). This allows us to validate the\nintegration of AD in complex tasks involving tighter tolerances and variation\nfrom both the robot and its environment. Additionally, we evaluate data\nefficiency, detection latency, and task characteristics which support robust\ndetection. The results indicate reliable detection with AUROC exceeding 0.93 in\nfailures in the cabling and screwing task, such as incorrect or misaligned\nparts and obstructed targets. In the polishing task, only severe failures were\nreliably detected, while more subtle failure types remained undetected.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores autoencoder-based anomaly detection for robot manipulation tasks using force/torque time series data, demonstrating reliable detection in cabling and screwing tasks but limited performance for subtle failures in polishing.", "motivation": "Out-of-distribution states in robot manipulation lead to unpredictable behavior and task failures.
