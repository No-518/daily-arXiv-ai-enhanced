*Shahrzad Sayyafzadeh,Hongmei Chi,Shonda Bernadin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: End-to-end pipeline for generating and refining adversarial patches to evade facial biometric systems, with forensic analysis applications using diffusion models and ViT-GPT2 captioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a comprehensive framework for testing and analyzing vulnerabilities in facial biometric systems through adversarial attacks, supporting forensic analysis and security testing of identity verification systems.

Method: Uses FGSM to generate adversarial noise targeting identity classifiers, then refines patches with diffusion models (reverse diffusion, Gaussian smoothing, adaptive brightness correction) for imperceptibility. Applies patches to test evasion, uses ViT-GPT2 for semantic captioning, and evaluates with perceptual hashing and segmentation.

Result: Achieves high imperceptibility with SSIM of 0.95, demonstrates effective evasion of facial recognition systems while maintaining natural appearance, and provides semantic descriptions for forensic documentation of adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The pipeline successfully generates imperceptible adversarial patches that compromise facial biometric systems, offering tools for security testing and forensic analysis of identity evasion attacks with practical applications in evaluating system vulnerabilities.

Abstract: This work presents an end-to-end pipeline for generating, refining, and evaluating adversarial patches to compromise facial biometric systems, with applications in forensic analysis and security testing. We utilize FGSM to generate adversarial noise targeting an identity classifier and employ a diffusion model with reverse diffusion to enhance imperceptibility through Gaussian smoothing and adaptive brightness correction, thereby facilitating synthetic adversarial patch evasion. The refined patch is applied to facial images to test its ability to evade recognition systems while maintaining natural visual characteristics. A Vision Transformer (ViT)-GPT2 model generates captions to provide a semantic description of a person's identity for adversarial images, supporting forensic interpretation and documentation for identity evasion and recognition attacks. The pipeline evaluates changes in identity classification, captioning results, and vulnerabilities in facial identity verification and expression recognition under adversarial conditions. We further demonstrate effective detection and analysis of adversarial patches and adversarial samples using perceptual hashing and segmentation, achieving an SSIM of 0.95.

*Carlo Sgaravatti,Riccardo Pieroni,Matteo Corno,Sergio M. Savaresi,Luca Magri,Giacomo Boracchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LCF3D is a multimodal fusion framework for 3D object detection that combines 2D RGB and 3D LiDAR detectors using late fusion to reduce false positives and cascade fusion to recover missed objects, improving performance especially for challenging categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving, but effectively combining RGB cameras and LiDAR sensors remains challenging. The authors aim to compensate for inaccuracies in LiDAR-based detection by leveraging multimodal fusion principles.

Method: LCF3D combines two fusion principles: (1) Late fusion matches LiDAR 3D detections with RGB 2D detections to filter out unmatched LiDAR detections (reducing false positives), and (2) Cascade fusion generates new 3D frustum proposals for unmatched RGB detections to recover missed objects from LiDAR.

Result: LCF3D achieves significant improvements over LiDAR-based methods, particularly for challenging categories like pedestrians and cyclists in KITTI dataset, and motorcycles and bicycles in nuScenes. The framework also demonstrates benefits for domain generalization across different sensor configurations.

Conclusion: The proposed LCF3D framework effectively combines RGB and LiDAR modalities through late and cascade fusion, improving 3D object detection performance while enhancing domain generalization capabilities for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Accurately localizing 3D objects like pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles is essential in Autonomous Driving. To ensure high detection performance, Autonomous Vehicles complement RGB cameras with LiDAR sensors, but effectively combining these data sources for 3D object detection remains challenging. We propose LCF3D, a novel sensor fusion framework that combines a 2D object detector on RGB images with a 3D object detector on LiDAR point clouds. By leveraging multimodal fusion principles, we compensate for inaccuracies in the LiDAR object detection network. Our solution combines two key principles: (i) late fusion, to reduce LiDAR False Positives by matching LiDAR 3D detections with RGB 2D detections and filtering out unmatched LiDAR detections; and (ii) cascade fusion, to recover missed objects from LiDAR by generating new 3D frustum proposals corresponding to unmatched RGB detections. Experiments show that LCF3D is beneficial for domain generalization, as it turns out to be successful in handling different sensor configurations between training and testing domains. LCF3D achieves significant improvements over LiDAR-based methods, particularly for challenging categories like pedestrians and cyclists in the KITTI dataset, as well as motorcycles and bicycles in nuScenes.

*Subhajit Sanyal,Srinivas Soumitri Miriyala,Akshay Janardan Bankar,Sravanth Kodavanti,Harshit,Abhishek Ameta,Shreyas Pandith,Amit Satish Unde*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NanoSD is a family of lightweight diffusion models distilled from Stable Diffusion 1.5 for real-time image restoration on edge devices, achieving 20ms inference on mobile NPUs with 130M-315M parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent diffusion models like Stable Diffusion 1.5 have strong generative priors for image restoration but are too computationally heavy for edge devices. Existing lightweight variants disrupt the latent manifold and lack generalization across tasks.

Method: Full-pipeline co-design using network surgery, feature-wise generative distillation, and structured architectural scaling applied to both U-Net and VAE encoder-decoder. Preserves generative prior while optimizing for hardware efficiency.

Result: Achieves Pareto-optimal models with 130M-315M parameters, real-time inference down to 20ms on mobile NPUs. Outperforms prior lightweight diffusion models in perceptual quality and deployability across multiple restoration tasks.

Conclusion: NanoSD establishes a general-purpose diffusion foundation model family suitable for real-time visual generation and restoration on edge devices, showing that architectural balance and latent-space preservation are key to hardware efficiency.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 offer strong generative priors that are highly valuable for image restoration, yet their full pipelines remain too computationally heavy for deployment on edge devices. Existing lightweight variants predominantly compress the denoising U-Net or reduce the diffusion trajectory, which disrupts the underlying latent manifold and limits generalization beyond a single task. We introduce NanoSD, a family of Pareto-optimal diffusion foundation models distilled from Stable Diffusion 1.5 through network surgery, feature-wise generative distillation, and structured architectural scaling jointly applied to the U-Net and the VAE encoder-decoder. This full-pipeline co-design preserves the generative prior while producing models that occupy distinct operating points along the accuracy-latency-size frontier (e.g., 130M-315M parameters, achieving real-time inference down to 20ms on mobile-class NPUs). We show that parameter reduction alone does not correlate with hardware efficiency, and we provide an analysis revealing how architectural balance, feature routing, and latent-space preservation jointly shape true on-device latency. When used as a drop-in backbone, NanoSD enables state-of-the-art performance across image super-resolution, image deblurring, face restoration, and monocular depth estimation, outperforming prior lightweight diffusion models in both perceptual quality and practical deployability. NanoSD establishes a general-purpose diffusion foundation model family suitable for real-time visual generation and restoration on edge devices.

### [5] [UniHash: Unifying Pointwise and Pairwise Hashing Paradigms for Seen and Unseen Category Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09828)
*Xiaoxu Ma,Runhao Li,Hanwen Liu,Xiangbo Zhang,Zhenyu Weng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniHash is a dual-branch hashing framework that unifies pointwise and pairwise training paradigms to achieve balanced retrieval performance on both seen and unseen categories through bidirectional knowledge transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep hashing methods are limited to single training paradigms - pointwise methods excel on seen categories but pairwise methods generalize better to unseen ones. There's a need for a unified approach that balances performance across both seen and unseen categories for comprehensive image retrieval systems.

Method: Proposes Unified Hashing (UniHash) with two complementary branches: a center-based branch following pointwise paradigm and a pairwise branch following pairwise paradigm. Introduces bidirectional knowledge transfer with mutual learning loss to align hash representations and a Split-Merge Mixture of Hash Experts (SM-MoH) module to enhance cross-branch exchange of hash representations.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, MSCOCO, and ImageNet demonstrate that UniHash consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both seen and unseen image retrieval scenarios. Theoretical analysis substantiates the effectiveness of the approach.

Conclusion: UniHash successfully unifies pointwise and pairwise training paradigms through a dual-branch framework with bidirectional knowledge transfer, achieving balanced and superior retrieval performance across both seen and unseen categories, addressing a key limitation in existing deep hashing methods.

Abstract: Effective retrieval across both seen and unseen categories is crucial for modern image retrieval systems. Retrieval on seen categories ensures precise recognition of known classes, while retrieval on unseen categories promotes generalization to novel classes with limited supervision. However, most existing deep hashing methods are confined to a single training paradigm, either pointwise or pairwise, where the former excels on seen categories and the latter generalizes better to unseen ones. To overcome this limitation, we propose Unified Hashing (UniHash), a dual-branch framework that unifies the strengths of both paradigms to achieve balanced retrieval performance across seen and unseen categories. UniHash consists of two complementary branches: a center-based branch following the pointwise paradigm and a pairwise branch following the pairwise paradigm. A novel hash code learning method is introduced to enable bidirectional knowledge transfer between branches, improving hash code discriminability and generalization. It employs a mutual learning loss to align hash representations and introduces a Split-Merge Mixture of Hash Experts (SM-MoH) module to enhance cross-branch exchange of hash representations. Theoretical analysis substantiates the effectiveness of UniHash, and extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, MSCOCO, and ImageNet demonstrate that UniHash consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both seen and unseen image retrieval scenarios.

### [6] [ViSIL: Unified Evaluation of Information Loss in Multimodal Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09851)
*Po-han Li,Shenghui Chen,Ufuk Topcu,Sandeep Chinchali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ViSIL, an information-theoretic metric for evaluating multimodal video summaries by quantifying information loss across modalities using vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics like BLEU/ROUGE fail to measure information coverage across different modalities (text vs keyframes) in multimodal video summaries, creating a need for a unified evaluation framework.

Method: ViSIL (Video Summary Information Loss) score uses vision-language model inference to quantify video information not captured by summaries, enabling direct comparison across different summary formats despite structural differences.

Result: ViSIL shows statistically significant correlation with human and VLM performance on Video QA tasks, and enables summary selection that outperforms text summaries by 7% in VQA accuracy without increasing processing load.

Conclusion: ViSIL provides a unified information-theoretic framework for evaluating multimodal video summaries, addressing limitations of traditional metrics and enabling optimal trade-offs between information coverage and processing efficiency.

Abstract: Multimodal video captioning condenses dense footage into a structured format of keyframes and natural language. By creating a cohesive multimodal summary, this approach anchors generative AI in rich semantic evidence and serves as a lightweight proxy for high-efficiency retrieval. However, traditional metrics like BLEU or ROUGE fail to quantify information coverage across disparate modalities, such as comparing a paragraph of text to a sequence of keyframes. To address this, we propose the Video Summary Information Loss (ViSIL) score, an information-theoretic framework that quantifies the video information not captured by a summary via vision-language model (VLM) inference. By measuring the information loss, ViSIL is a unified metric that enables direct comparison across multimodal summary formats despite their structural discrepancies. Our results demonstrate that ViSIL scores show a statistically significant correlation with both human and VLM performance on Video Question Answering (VQA) tasks. ViSIL also enables summary selection to optimize the trade-off between information loss and processing speed, establishing a Pareto-optimal frontier that outperforms text summaries by $7\%$ in VQA accuracy without increasing processing load.

### [7] [Breaking the Limits of Open-Weight CLIP: An Optimization Framework for Self-supervised Fine-tuning of CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09859)
*Anant Mehta,Xiyuan Wei,Xingyu Chen,Tianbao Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TuneCLIP is a self-supervised fine-tuning framework that improves existing CLIP models without expensive retraining, achieving performance gains across various downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving CLIP performance typically requires expensive retraining on billions of samples, but the authors want to enhance existing open-weight CLIP models using only self-supervised datasets while avoiding the performance degradation that occurs with standard fine-tuning approaches.

Method: TuneCLIP has two key components: (1) a warm-up stage to recover optimization statistics and reduce cold-start bias, and (2) a fine-tuning stage optimizing a new contrastive loss to mitigate penalization on false negative pairs.

Result: TuneCLIP consistently improves performance across model architectures and scales, achieving gains up to +2.5% on ImageNet and related benchmarks, and +1.2% on the competitive DataComp benchmark, setting new baselines for efficient post-pretraining adaptation.

Conclusion: TuneCLIP successfully enables efficient improvement of existing CLIP models without costly retraining, overcoming performance degradation issues and establishing a strong framework for self-supervised fine-tuning of multimodal models.

Abstract: CLIP has become a cornerstone of multimodal representation learning, yet improving its performance typically requires a prohibitively costly process of training from scratch on billions of samples. We ask a different question: Can we improve the performance of open-weight CLIP models across various downstream tasks using only existing self-supervised datasets? Unlike supervised fine-tuning, which adapts a pretrained model to a single downstream task, our setting seeks to improve general performance across various tasks. However, as both our experiments and prior studies reveal, simply applying standard training protocols starting from an open-weight CLIP model often fails, leading to performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce TuneCLIP, a self-supervised fine-tuning framework that overcomes the performance degradation. TuneCLIP has two key components: (1) a warm-up stage of recovering optimization statistics to reduce cold-start bias, inspired by theoretical analysis, and (2) a fine-tuning stage of optimizing a new contrastive loss to mitigate the penalization on false negative pairs. Our extensive experiments show that TuneCLIP consistently improves performance across model architectures and scales. Notably, it elevates leading open-weight models like SigLIP (ViT-B/16), achieving gains of up to +2.5% on ImageNet and related out-of-distribution benchmarks, and +1.2% on the highly competitive DataComp benchmark, setting a new strong baseline for efficient post-pretraining adaptation.

*Kiarie Ndegwa,Andreas Gros,Tony Chang,David Diaz,Vincent A. Landau,Nathan E. Rutenbeck,Luke J. Zachmann,Guy Bayes,Scott Conway*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VibrantSR is a generative super-resolution framework that estimates 0.5m canopy height models from 10m Sentinel-2 imagery, enabling seasonal forest monitoring without costly aerial data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current canopy height monitoring relies on aerial imagery with infrequent and irregular acquisition schedules, limiting consistent forest monitoring and carbon accounting at continental scales.

Method: Generative super-resolution framework using Sentinel-2 seasonal composites to estimate high-resolution (0.5m) canopy height models from lower-resolution (10m) satellite imagery.

Result: Achieves 4.39m MAE for canopy heights ≥2m, outperforming Meta (4.83m), LANDFIRE (5.96m), and ETH (7.05m) benchmarks across 22 eco-regions in western US.

Conclusion: VibrantSR enables operational forest monitoring and carbon accounting at continental scales without reliance on costly aerial acquisitions, though aerial-based methods still have accuracy advantages.

Abstract: We present VibrantSR (Vibrant Super-Resolution), a generative super-resolution framework for estimating 0.5 meter canopy height models (CHMs) from 10 meter Sentinel-2 imagery. Unlike approaches based on aerial imagery that are constrained by infrequent and irregular acquisition schedules, VibrantSR leverages globally available Sentinel-2 seasonal composites, enabling consistent monitoring at a seasonal-to-annual cadence. Evaluated across 22 EPA Level 3 eco-regions in the western United States using spatially disjoint validation splits, VibrantSR achieves a Mean Absolute Error of 4.39 meters for canopy heights >= 2 m, outperforming Meta (4.83 m), LANDFIRE (5.96 m), and ETH (7.05 m) satellite-based benchmarks. While aerial-based VibrantVS (2.71 m MAE) retains an accuracy advantage, VibrantSR enables operational forest monitoring and carbon accounting at continental scales without reliance on costly and temporally infrequent aerial acquisitions.

*Yang Xing,Jiong Wu,Savas Ozdemir,Ying Zhang,Yang Yang,Wei Shao,Kuang Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedVL-SAM2 is a unified 3D medical vision-language model that combines report generation, visual question answering, and multi-paradigm segmentation (semantic, referring, interactive) in a single framework for 3D CT imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical VLMs excel at image-level tasks but struggle with fine-grained visual grounding and volumetric spatial reasoning in 3D medical imaging. There's a need for a unified framework that can handle both high-level reasoning and precise 3D localization.

Method: MedVL-SAM2 integrates image-level reasoning and pixel-level perception through a cohesive architecture with a SAM2-based volumetric segmentation module. It uses multi-stage training: pre-training on 3D CT image-text pairs for feature alignment, then joint optimization with language-understanding and segmentation objectives on comprehensive 3D CT segmentation data.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance across report generation, VQA, and multiple 3D segmentation tasks. It provides reliable 3D visual grounding, controllable interactive segmentation, and robust cross-modal reasoning.

Conclusion: High-level semantic reasoning and precise 3D localization can be jointly achieved within a unified 3D medical VLM, demonstrating that MedVL-SAM2 successfully unifies volumetric visual reasoning with spatially precise localization through flexible language, point, or box prompts.

Abstract: Recent progress in medical vision-language models (VLMs) has achieved strong performance on image-level text-centric tasks such as report generation and visual question answering (VQA). However, achieving fine-grained visual grounding and volumetric spatial reasoning in 3D medical VLMs remains challenging, particularly when aiming to unify these capabilities within a single, generalizable framework. To address this challenge, we proposed MedVL-SAM2, a unified 3D medical multimodal model that concurrently supports report generation, VQA, and multi-paradigm segmentation, including semantic, referring, and interactive segmentation. MedVL-SAM2 integrates image-level reasoning and pixel-level perception through a cohesive architecture tailored for 3D medical imaging, and incorporates a SAM2-based volumetric segmentation module to enable precise multi-granular spatial reasoning. The model is trained in a multi-stage pipeline: it is first pre-trained on a large-scale corpus of 3D CT image-text pairs to align volumetric visual features with radiology-language embeddings. It is then jointly optimized with both language-understanding and segmentation objectives using a comprehensive 3D CT segmentation dataset. This joint training enables flexible interaction via language, point, or box prompts, thereby unifying high-level visual reasoning with spatially precise localization. Our unified architecture delivers state-of-the-art performance across report generation, VQA, and multiple 3D segmentation tasks. Extensive analyses further show that the model provides reliable 3D visual grounding, controllable interactive segmentation, and robust cross-modal reasoning, demonstrating that high-level semantic reasoning and precise 3D localization can be jointly achieved within a unified 3D medical VLM.

*Weili Nie,Julius Berner,Nanye Ma,Chao Liu,Saining Xie,Arash Vahdat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TMD distills large video diffusion models into efficient few-step generators by matching multi-step denoising trajectories with lightweight conditional flow transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large video diffusion models produce high-quality videos but are inefficient for real-time applications due to their multi-step sampling process. There's a need to maintain visual quality while significantly improving generation speed.

Method: Transition Matching Distillation (TMD) decomposes diffusion backbones into: 1) main backbone for semantic representation extraction, and 2) flow head for multiple inner flow updates. It matches multi-step denoising trajectories with few-step probability transitions using conditional flow modeling and distribution matching distillation.

Result: TMD achieves superior trade-off between generation speed and visual quality, outperforming existing distilled models under comparable inference costs in terms of visual fidelity and prompt adherence, demonstrated on Wan2.1 1.3B and 14B text-to-video models.

Conclusion: TMD provides a flexible and effective framework for distilling large video diffusion models into efficient few-step generators, enabling real-time interactive applications while maintaining high visual quality.

Abstract: Large video diffusion and flow models have achieved remarkable success in high-quality video generation, but their use in real-time interactive applications remains limited due to their inefficient multi-step sampling process. In this work, we present Transition Matching Distillation (TMD), a novel framework for distilling video diffusion models into efficient few-step generators. The central idea of TMD is to match the multi-step denoising trajectory of a diffusion model with a few-step probability transition process, where each transition is modeled as a lightweight conditional flow. To enable efficient distillation, we decompose the original diffusion backbone into two components: (1) a main backbone, comprising the majority of early layers, that extracts semantic representations at each outer transition step; and (2) a flow head, consisting of the last few layers, that leverages these representations to perform multiple inner flow updates. Given a pretrained video diffusion model, we first introduce a flow head to the model, and adapt it into a conditional flow map. We then apply distribution matching distillation to the student model with flow head rollout in each transition step. Extensive experiments on distilling Wan2.1 1.3B and 14B text-to-video models demonstrate that TMD provides a flexible and strong trade-off between generation speed and visual quality. In particular, TMD outperforms existing distilled models under comparable inference costs in terms of visual fidelity and prompt adherence. Project page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/genair/tmd

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data-driven approaches for traversable area segmentation suffer from degraded performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, impairing downstream autonomous driving tasks.

Method: Proposes OT-Drive with two key components: 1) Scene Anchor Generator (SAG) that decomposes scene information into joint distribution of weather, time-of-day, and road type to create semantic anchors, and 2) Optimal Transport-based multi-modal fusion module that transports RGB and surface normal features onto the semantic anchor manifold.

Result: Achieves 95.16% mIoU on ORFD OOD scenarios (outperforming prior methods by 6.35%) and 89.79% mIoU on cross-dataset transfer tasks (surpassing baselines by 13.99%).

Conclusion: The proposed model achieves strong OOD generalization with limited training data, substantially enhancing practicality and efficiency for real-world autonomous driving deployment.

Abstract: Reliable traversable area segmentation in unstructured environments is critical for planning and decision-making in autonomous driving. However, existing data-driven approaches often suffer from degraded segmentation performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, consequently impairing downstream driving tasks. To address this issue, we propose OT-Drive, an Optimal Transport--driven multi-modal fusion framework. The proposed method formulates RGB and surface normal fusion as a distribution transport problem. Specifically, we design a novel Scene Anchor Generator (SAG) to decompose scene information into the joint distribution of weather, time-of-day, and road type, thereby constructing semantic anchors that can generalize to unseen scenarios. Subsequently, we design an innovative Optimal Transport-based multi-modal fusion module (OT Fusion) to transport RGB and surface normal features onto the manifold defined by the semantic anchors, enabling robust traversable area segmentation under OOD scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 95.16% mIoU on ORFD OOD scenarios, outperforming prior methods by 6.35%, and 89.79% mIoU on cross-dataset transfer tasks, surpassing baselines by 13.99%.These results indicate that the proposed model can attain strong OOD generalization with only limited training data, substantially enhancing its practicality and efficiency for real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs lack spatial reasoning due to CLIP-style encoders flattening 2D images; improving spatial awareness through alternative encoders and 2D positional encodings boosts spatial reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models (VLMs) built with CLIP-style image encoders flatten images into 1D patch sequences, discarding crucial 2D structure needed for spatial reasoning. This spatial awareness gap is a blindspot in VLM design and a bottleneck for applications like robotics and embodied AI that require spatial grounding.

Method: The paper investigates two architectural improvements: (i) image encoders trained with alternative objectives (beyond contrastive pretraining), and (ii) incorporation of 2D positional encodings to preserve spatial structure information.

Result: Experiments show that these architectural choices lead to improved spatial reasoning performance on several benchmarks, demonstrating that better spatial awareness can be achieved through encoder design modifications.

Conclusion: Spatial awareness is a missing dimension in current VLM design that can be addressed through architectural improvements like alternative training objectives and 2D positional encodings, potentially unlocking better performance for spatial reasoning tasks in robotics and embodied AI applications.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly, but their ability to capture spatial relationships remains a blindspot. Current VLMs are typically built with contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) style image encoders. The training recipe often flattens images into 1D patch sequences, discarding the 2D structure necessary for spatial reasoning. We argue that this lack of spatial awareness is a missing dimension in VLM design and a bottleneck for applications requiring spatial grounding, such as robotics and embodied AI. To address this, we investigate (i) image encoders trained with alternative objectives and (ii) 2D positional encodings. Our experiments show that these architectural choices can lead to improved spatial reasoning on several benchmarks.

*Yulin He,Wei Chen,Zhikang Jian,Tianhang Guo,Wenjuan Zhou,Minglong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DR²Seg: A self-rewarding framework that improves reasoning segmentation by decomposing it into multimodal reasoning and referring segmentation stages, reducing overthinking and enhancing segmentation accuracy without extra supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning segmentation methods suffer from overthinking - generating verbose reasoning chains that interfere with object localization in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). This reduces both reasoning efficiency and segmentation accuracy.

Method: DR²Seg uses a two-stage rollout strategy: (1) generate a self-contained description that explicitly specifies the target object, (2) replace the original complex query with this description to verify self-containment. The framework introduces two self-rewards to strengthen goal-oriented reasoning and suppress redundant thinking.

Result: Extensive experiments across MLLMs of varying scales and segmentation models demonstrate that DR²Seg consistently improves reasoning efficiency and overall segmentation performance.

Conclusion: DR²Seg effectively addresses the overthinking problem in reasoning segmentation by providing a self-rewarding framework that decomposes the task, improves reasoning efficiency, and enhances segmentation accuracy without requiring additional supervision.

Abstract: Reasoning segmentation is an emerging vision-language task that requires reasoning over intricate text queries to precisely segment objects. However, existing methods typically suffer from overthinking, generating verbose reasoning chains that interfere with object localization in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address this issue, we propose DR$^2$Seg, a self-rewarding framework that improves both reasoning efficiency and segmentation accuracy without requiring extra thinking supervision. DR$^2$Seg employs a two-stage rollout strategy that decomposes reasoning segmentation into multimodal reasoning and referring segmentation. In the first stage, the model generates a self-contained description that explicitly specifies the target object. In the second stage, this description replaces the original complex query to verify its self-containment. Based on this design, two self-rewards are introduced to strengthen goal-oriented reasoning and suppress redundant thinking. Extensive experiments across MLLMs of varying scales and segmentation models demonstrate that DR$^2$Seg consistently improves reasoning efficiency and overall segmentation performance.

TL;DR: DW-DGAT: A dynamically weighted dual graph attention network for early diagnosis of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases using multi-metric data fusion and class imbalance handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early diagnosis of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases is critical but challenging due to high-dimensional multi-metric data with diverse structural forms, heterogeneity of neuroimaging/phenotypic data, and class imbalance issues.

Method: Proposed DW-DGAT with: 1) general-purpose data fusion strategy for three structural forms of multi-metric data, 2) dual graph attention architecture based on brain regions and inter-sample relationships for micro/macro-level features, 3) class weight generation mechanism with two stable loss functions for imbalance handling.

Result: State-of-the-art performance demonstrated through rigorous experiments on PPMI and ADNI datasets for Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.

Conclusion: The proposed DW-DGAT effectively addresses key challenges in early neurodegenerative disease diagnosis through integrated data fusion, dual graph attention, and class imbalance mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the two most prevalent and incurable neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) worldwide, for which early diagnosis is critical to delay their progression. However, the high dimensionality of multi-metric data with diverse structural forms, the heterogeneity of neuroimaging and phenotypic data, and class imbalance collectively pose significant challenges to early ND diagnosis. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamically weighted dual graph attention network (DW-DGAT) that integrates: (1) a general-purpose data fusion strategy to merge three structural forms of multi-metric data; (2) a dual graph attention architecture based on brain regions and inter-sample relationships to extract both micro- and macro-level features; and (3) a class weight generation mechanism combined with two stable and effective loss functions to mitigate class imbalance. Rigorous experiments, based on the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) and Alzhermer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) studies, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our approach.

TL;DR: VERHallu benchmark reveals VideoLLMs struggle with event relation hallucinations; proposed KFP strategy mitigates this by reallocating frame-level attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VideoLLM hallucination research focuses on objects/scenes but neglects event relation hallucinations, which are crucial for understanding complex video narratives and causal/temporal relationships between events.

Method: 1) Created VERHallu benchmark with three tasks (relation classification, QA, counterfactual QA) focusing on causal/temporal/subevent relations; 2) Proposed Key-Frame Propagating (KFP) strategy that reallocates frame-level attention in intermediate layers to enhance multi-event understanding.

Result: Current VideoLLMs struggle with dense-event relation reasoning, rely on prior knowledge, overlook surrounding subevents; KFP effectively mitigates event relation hallucination without affecting inference speed.

Conclusion: Event relation hallucination is a critical but overlooked problem in VideoLLMs; the VERHallu benchmark enables systematic evaluation, and KFP provides an effective solution by improving frame-level attention allocation for better multi-event understanding.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) exhibit various types of hallucinations. Existing research has primarily focused on hallucinations involving the presence of events, objects, and scenes in videos, while largely neglecting event relation hallucination. In this paper, we introduce a novel benchmark for evaluating the Video Event Relation Hallucination, named VERHallu. This benchmark focuses on causal, temporal, and subevent relations between events, encompassing three types of tasks: relation classification, question answering, and counterfactual question answering, for a comprehensive evaluation of event relation hallucination. Additionally, it features counterintuitive video scenarios that deviate from typical pretraining distributions, with each sample accompanied by human-annotated candidates covering both vision-language and pure language biases. Our analysis reveals that current state-of-the-art VideoLLMs struggle with dense-event relation reasoning, often relying on prior knowledge due to insufficient use of frame-level cues. Although these models demonstrate strong grounding capabilities for key events, they often overlook the surrounding subevents, leading to an incomplete and inaccurate understanding of event relations. To tackle this, we propose a Key-Frame Propagating (KFP) strategy, which reallocates frame-level attention within intermediate layers to enhance multi-event understanding. Experiments show it effectively mitigates the event relation hallucination without affecting inference speed.

TL;DR: DiCo framework uses disentangled concept representation with slot-based anchors and concept blocks to bridge the modality gap between text and images for person re-identification, achieving competitive performance and improved interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TIReID faces challenges due to the substantial modality gap between visual appearances and textual descriptions, and the need to model fine-grained correspondences between similar individuals with attributes like clothing color, texture, or outfit style.

Method: Proposes DiCo (Disentangled Concept Representation) framework with shared slot-based representation where each slot acts as a part-level anchor across modalities, further decomposed into multiple concept blocks to disentangle complementary attributes while maintaining consistent part-level correspondence.

Result: Extensive experiments on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid demonstrate competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods, while enhancing interpretability through explicit slot- and block-level representations for more fine-grained retrieval results.

Conclusion: DiCo effectively addresses the modality gap in TIReID through hierarchical and disentangled cross-modal alignment, achieving strong performance while providing interpretable fine-grained retrieval capabilities.

Abstract: Text-to-image person re-identification (TIReID) aims to retrieve person images from a large gallery given free-form textual descriptions. TIReID is challenging due to the substantial modality gap between visual appearances and textual expressions, as well as the need to model fine-grained correspondences that distinguish individuals with similar attributes such as clothing color, texture, or outfit style. To address these issues, we propose DiCo (Disentangled Concept Representation), a novel framework that achieves hierarchical and disentangled cross-modal alignment. DiCo introduces a shared slot-based representation, where each slot acts as a part-level anchor across modalities and is further decomposed into multiple concept blocks. This design enables the disentanglement of complementary attributes (\textit{e.g.}, color, texture, shape) while maintaining consistent part-level correspondence between image and text. Extensive experiments on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid demonstrate that our framework achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods, while also enhancing interpretability through explicit slot- and block-level representations for more fine-grained retrieval results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater imaging faces challenges from wavelength-dependent attenuation, scattering, turbidity, and non-uniform illumination, making ground-truth motion nearly impossible to obtain. Event cameras offer microsecond resolution and high dynamic range but lack datasets pairing realistic underwater optics with accurate optical flow.

Method: Created synthetic underwater benchmark dataset using physically-based ray-traced RGBD sequences. Applied modern video-to-event pipeline to rendered underwater videos to produce realistic event data streams with dense ground-truth flow, depth, and camera motion.

Result: Produced first synthetic underwater benchmark dataset for event-based optical flow with dense ground truth. Benchmarked state-of-the-art learning-based and model-based optical flow methods to understand how underwater light transport affects event formation and motion estimation accuracy.

Conclusion: The dataset establishes a new baseline for future development and evaluation of underwater event-based perception algorithms. Source code and dataset are publicly available.

Abstract: Underwater imaging is fundamentally challenging due to wavelength-dependent light attenuation, strong scattering from suspended particles, turbidity-induced blur, and non-uniform illumination. These effects impair standard cameras and make ground-truth motion nearly impossible to obtain. On the other hand, event cameras offer microsecond resolution and high dynamic range. Nonetheless, progress on investigating event cameras for underwater environments has been limited due to the lack of datasets that pair realistic underwater optics with accurate optical flow. To address this problem, we introduce the first synthetic underwater benchmark dataset for event-based optical flow derived from physically-based ray-traced RGBD sequences. Using a modern video-to-event pipeline applied to rendered underwater videos, we produce realistic event data streams with dense ground-truth flow, depth, and camera motion. Moreover, we benchmark state-of-the-art learning-based and model-based optical flow prediction methods to understand how underwater light transport affects event formation and motion estimation accuracy. Our dataset establishes a new baseline for future development and evaluation of underwater event-based perception algorithms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoF-T2I integrates Chain-of-Frame reasoning into text-to-image generation using progressive visual refinement with intermediate frames as explicit reasoning steps, achieving state-of-the-art performance on image generation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video models have shown Chain-of-Frame reasoning capabilities for visual tasks, but their potential for enhancing text-to-image generation remains unexplored due to lack of defined visual reasoning starting points and interpretable intermediate states in T2I generation.

Method: Proposes CoF-T2I that integrates CoF reasoning into T2I via progressive visual refinement, where intermediate frames act as explicit reasoning steps. Creates CoF-Evol-Instruct dataset of CoF trajectories modeling generation from semantics to aesthetics. Implements independent frame encoding to avoid motion artifacts.

Result: CoF-T2I significantly outperforms base video model and achieves competitive performance: 0.86 on GenEval and 7.468 on Imagine-Bench benchmarks, demonstrating substantial promise of video models for advancing high-quality T2I generation.

Conclusion: The integration of Chain-of-Frame reasoning into text-to-image generation through progressive visual refinement shows significant potential for advancing high-quality image generation, with video models offering promising capabilities for this domain.

Abstract: Recent video generation models have revealed the emergence of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning, enabling frame-by-frame visual inference. With this capability, video models have been successfully applied to various visual tasks (e.g., maze solving, visual puzzles). However, their potential to enhance text-to-image (T2I) generation remains largely unexplored due to the absence of a clearly defined visual reasoning starting point and interpretable intermediate states in the T2I generation process. To bridge this gap, we propose CoF-T2I, a model that integrates CoF reasoning into T2I generation via progressive visual refinement, where intermediate frames act as explicit reasoning steps and the final frame is taken as output. To establish such an explicit generation process, we curate CoF-Evol-Instruct, a dataset of CoF trajectories that model the generation process from semantics to aesthetics. To further improve quality and avoid motion artifacts, we enable independent encoding operation for each frame. Experiments show that CoF-T2I significantly outperforms the base video model and achieves competitive performance on challenging benchmarks, reaching 0.86 on GenEval and 7.468 on Imagine-Bench. These results indicate the substantial promise of video models for advancing high-quality text-to-image generation.

*Hyun Do Jung,Jungwon Choi,Hwiyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReaMIL adds a selection head to MIL for histopathology to produce compact evidence sets without sacrificing performance, using budgeted-sufficiency objective for sparse tile selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches for whole-slide histopathology lack interpretability and produce evidence sets that are too large and scattered, making it difficult to understand model decisions and identify clinically relevant regions.

Method: Adds a light selection head to MIL backbone that produces soft per-tile gates, trained with budgeted-sufficiency objective: hinge loss enforcing true-class probability ≥ τ using only kept evidence under sparsity budget on selected tiles.

Result: Matches or slightly improves baseline AUC across TCGA-NSCLC, TCGA-BRCA, and PANDA datasets; on NSCLC achieves AUC 0.983 with mean minimal sufficient K ≈ 8.2 tiles at τ=0.90 and AUKC ≈ 0.864; produces small, spatially compact evidence sets.

Conclusion: ReaMIL provides interpretable, evidence-efficient MIL for histopathology without extra supervision, integrates seamlessly with standard training, and offers quantitative diagnostics (MSK, AUKC, contiguity) for rigorous evaluation of model behavior on WSIs.

Abstract: We introduce ReaMIL (Reasoning- and Evidence-Aware MIL), a multiple instance learning approach for whole-slide histopathology that adds a light selection head to a strong MIL backbone. The head produces soft per-tile gates and is trained with a budgeted-sufficiency objective: a hinge loss that enforces the true-class probability to be $\geq τ$ using only the kept evidence, under a sparsity budget on the number of selected tiles. The budgeted-sufficiency objective yields small, spatially compact evidence sets without sacrificing baseline performance. Across TCGA-NSCLC (LUAD vs. LUSC), TCGA-BRCA (IDC vs. Others), and PANDA, ReaMIL matches or slightly improves baseline AUC and provides quantitative evidence-efficiency diagnostics. On NSCLC, it attains AUC 0.983 with a mean minimal sufficient K (MSK) $\approx 8.2$ tiles at $τ= 0.90$ and AUKC $\approx 0.864$, showing that class confidence rises sharply and stabilizes once a small set of tiles is kept. The method requires no extra supervision, integrates seamlessly with standard MIL training, and naturally yields slide-level overlays. We report accuracy alongside MSK, AUKC, and contiguity for rigorous evaluation of model behavior on WSIs.

### [20] [Thinking Like Van Gogh: Structure-Aware Style Transfer via Flow-Guided 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10075)
*Zhendong Wang,Lebin Zhou,Jingchuan Xiao,Rongduo Han,Nam Ling,Cihan Ruan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 3D style transfer method that uses flow-guided geometric advection to create Post-Impressionist stylization by deforming 3D Gaussian primitives according to artistic motion patterns from paintings, rather than just applying surface textures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D style transfer methods treat geometry as rigid substrate for texture projection, which contradicts the Post-Impressionist principle of amplifying structural form while suppressing photographic detail. To authentically reproduce Post-Impressionist stylization, geometric abstraction must be embraced as the primary vehicle of expression.

Method: Flow-guided geometric advection framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting that extracts directional flow fields from 2D paintings and back-propagates them into 3D space, rectifying Gaussian primitives to form flow-aligned brushstrokes. Uses luminance-structure decoupling to isolate geometric deformation from color optimization.

Result: Enables expressive structural deformation driven directly by painterly motion rather than photometric constraints, creating brushstroke-like geometry that conforms to scene topology without relying on explicit mesh priors.

Conclusion: Proposes a novel approach to 3D artistic stylization that prioritizes geometric abstraction over surface texture, introducing flow guidance, structure-color decoupling, and a VLM-based evaluation framework that addresses the subjective nature of artistic authenticity.

Abstract: In 1888, Vincent van Gogh wrote, "I am seeking exaggeration in the essential." This principle, amplifying structural form while suppressing photographic detail, lies at the core of Post-Impressionist art. However, most existing 3D style transfer methods invert this philosophy, treating geometry as a rigid substrate for surface-level texture projection. To authentically reproduce Post-Impressionist stylization, geometric abstraction must be embraced as the primary vehicle of expression.
  We propose a flow-guided geometric advection framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that operationalizes this principle in a mesh-free setting. Our method extracts directional flow fields from 2D paintings and back-propagates them into 3D space, rectifying Gaussian primitives to form flow-aligned brushstrokes that conform to scene topology without relying on explicit mesh priors. This enables expressive structural deformation driven directly by painterly motion rather than photometric constraints.
  Our contributions are threefold: (1) a projection-based, mesh-free flow guidance mechanism that transfers 2D artistic motion into 3D Gaussian geometry; (2) a luminance-structure decoupling strategy that isolates geometric deformation from color optimization, mitigating artifacts during aggressive structural abstraction; and (3) a VLM-as-a-Judge evaluation framework that assesses artistic authenticity through aesthetic judgment instead of conventional pixel-level metrics, explicitly addressing the subjective nature of artistic stylization.

TL;DR: RAG-3DSG improves open-vocabulary 3D scene graph generation by reducing aggregation noise through uncertainty estimation and using retrieval-augmented generation, while accelerating processing with dynamic downsample-mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-vocabulary 3D scene graph generation methods suffer from low object recognition accuracy and slow speed due to constrained viewpoints, occlusions, and redundant surface density, limiting their practical application in robotics tasks.

Method: Proposes RAG-3DSG with two key innovations: 1) re-shot guided uncertainty estimation to mitigate aggregation noise, 2) object-level retrieval-augmented generation using reliable low-uncertainty objects, and 3) dynamic downsample-mapping strategy for accelerated cross-image object aggregation with adaptive granularity.

Result: Experiments on Replica dataset show RAG-3DSG significantly improves node captioning accuracy in 3D scene graph generation while reducing mapping time by two-thirds compared to the vanilla version.

Conclusion: RAG-3DSG effectively addresses accuracy and speed limitations in open-vocabulary 3D scene graph generation, making it more practical for robotics applications like manipulation and navigation through improved structured semantic representations.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D Scene Graph (3DSG) generation can enhance various downstream tasks in robotics, such as manipulation and navigation, by leveraging structured semantic representations. A 3DSG is constructed from multiple images of a scene, where objects are represented as nodes and relationships as edges. However, existing works for open-vocabulary 3DSG generation suffer from both low object-level recognition accuracy and speed, mainly due to constrained viewpoints, occlusions, and redundant surface density. To address these challenges, we propose RAG-3DSG to mitigate aggregation noise through re-shot guided uncertainty estimation and support object-level Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) via reliable low-uncertainty objects. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic downsample-mapping strategy to accelerate cross-image object aggregation with adaptive granularity. Experiments on Replica dataset demonstrate that RAG-3DSG significantly improves node captioning accuracy in 3DSG generation while reducing the mapping time by two-thirds compared to the vanilla version.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dataset distillation methods focus on features from original datasets but overlook task-specific information, creating a target gap between distillation objectives and downstream tasks. This gap limits the effectiveness of distilled datasets for practical applications.

Method: Introduces difficulty-guided sampling (DGS) as a plug-in post-stage sampling module that selects final distilled datasets from image pools generated by existing methods, following specific target difficulty distributions. Also proposes difficulty-aware guidance (DAG) to explore difficulty effects during generation.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, showing improved performance in dataset distillation for image classification tasks.

Conclusion: DGS successfully bridges the target gap in dataset distillation by incorporating difficulty information, highlighting the broader potential of difficulty concepts for diverse downstream tasks beyond image classification.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose difficulty-guided sampling (DGS) to bridge the target gap between the distillation objective and the downstream task, therefore improving the performance of dataset distillation. Deep neural networks achieve remarkable performance but have time and storage-consuming training processes. Dataset distillation is proposed to generate compact, high-quality distilled datasets, enabling effective model training while maintaining downstream performance. Existing approaches typically focus on features extracted from the original dataset, overlooking task-specific information, which leads to a target gap between the distillation objective and the downstream task. We propose leveraging characteristics that benefit the downstream training into data distillation to bridge this gap. Focusing on the downstream task of image classification, we introduce the concept of difficulty and propose DGS as a plug-in post-stage sampling module. Following the specific target difficulty distribution, the final distilled dataset is sampled from image pools generated by existing methods. We also propose difficulty-aware guidance (DAG) to explore the effect of difficulty in the generation process. Extensive experiments across multiple settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. It also highlights the broader potential of difficulty for diverse downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPS (Stochastic-Patch-Selection) improves autonomous driving OOD robustness by randomly masking patch features during training, forcing policies to learn invariant representations rather than overfitting to redundant patch correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Patch-aligned features from foundation models contain redundant information due to self-attention mechanisms, leading policies to overfit spurious correlations and perform poorly on Out-of-Distribution scenarios.

Method: Stochastic-Patch-Selection (SPS) randomly masks a fraction of patch descriptors each frame while preserving spatial layout, providing different stochastic but complete views of scenes to train more invariant policies.

Result: SPS achieves 6.2% average improvement across OOD scenarios, up to 20.4% in closed-loop simulations, 2.4× faster inference, with 8 of 9 trained systems surpassing prior SOTA, and transfers to real-world cars without tuning.

Conclusion: Random patch masking during training creates more robust and generalizable autonomous driving policies by forcing invariant feature learning, addressing redundancy in foundation model features while improving efficiency and real-world transfer.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end autonomous driving show that policies trained on patch-aligned features extracted from foundation models generalize better to Out-of-Distribution (OOD). We hypothesize that due to the self-attention mechanism, each patch feature implicitly embeds/contains information from all other patches, represented in a different way and intensity, making these descriptors highly redundant. We quantify redundancy in such (BLIP2) features via PCA and cross-patch similarity: $90$% of variance is captured by $17/64$ principal components, and strong inter-token correlations are pervasive. Training on such overlapping information leads the policy to overfit spurious correlations, hurting OOD robustness. We present Stochastic-Patch-Selection (SPS), a simple yet effective approach for learning policies that are more robust, generalizable, and efficient. For every frame, SPS randomly masks a fraction of patch descriptors, not feeding them to the policy model, while preserving the spatial layout of the remaining patches. Thus, the policy is provided with different stochastic but complete views of the (same) scene: every random subset of patches acts like a different, yet still sensible, coherent projection of the world. The policy thus bases its decisions on features that are invariant to which specific tokens survive. Extensive experiments confirm that across all OOD scenarios, our method outperforms the state of the art (SOTA), achieving a $6.2$% average improvement and up to $20.4$% in closed-loop simulations, while being $2.4\times$ faster. We conduct ablations over masking rates and patch-feature reorganization, training and evaluating 9 systems, with 8 of them surpassing prior SOTA. Finally, we show that the same learned policy transfers to a physical, real-world car without any tuning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal learning approaches rely on expensive human-annotated datasets, creating a need for cost-effective self-improvement methods using unlabeled data.

Method: Establishes a co-evolutionary loop with Questioner and Solver roles; Questioner synthesizes challenging questions using dual-track reasoning reward, Solver uses pseudo-labels from majority voting; both trained iteratively via Group Relative Policy Optimization.

Result: Achieves consistent performance gains without human annotations: +1.7 improvement in visual mathematical reasoning and +2.6 improvement in general vision-centric tasks on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of self-improvement in multimodal systems using only unlabeled images, offering a cost-effective alternative to human-annotated datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal learning have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). However, state-of-the-art approaches rely heavily on large-scale human-annotated datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we introduce V-Zero, a general post-training framework that facilitates self-improvement using exclusively unlabeled images. V-Zero establishes a co-evolutionary loop by instantiating two distinct roles: a Questioner and a Solver. The Questioner learns to synthesize high-quality, challenging questions by leveraging a dual-track reasoning reward that contrasts intuitive guesses with reasoned results. The Solver is optimized using pseudo-labels derived from majority voting over its own sampled responses. Both roles are trained iteratively via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), driving a cycle of mutual enhancement. Remarkably, without a single human annotation, V-Zero achieves consistent performance gains on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, improving visual mathematical reasoning by +1.7 and general vision-centric by +2.6, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement in multimodal systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCD methods rely on pseudo-labeling or two-stage clustering without principled mechanisms to disentangle category-defining signals from instance-specific noise, limiting performance in real-world open-world applications.

Method: Re-frames GCD from information-theoretic perspective using Information Bottleneck principle. Introduces InfoSculpt with dual CMI objectives: Category-Level CMI on labeled data for compact discriminative representations of known classes, and Instance-Level CMI on all data to distill invariant features by compressing augmentation-induced noise.

Result: Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarks demonstrate InfoSculpt's effectiveness, validating the information-theoretic approach for GCD.

Conclusion: InfoSculpt provides a principled information-theoretic framework for GCD that systematically sculpts representation space by disentangling categorical information from instance-specific noise through synergistic dual-scale CMI objectives.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify instances from both known and novel categories within a large-scale unlabeled dataset, a critical yet challenging task for real-world, open-world applications. However, existing methods often rely on pseudo-labeling, or two-stage clustering, which lack a principled mechanism to explicitly disentangle essential, category-defining signals from instance-specific noise. In this paper, we address this fundamental limitation by re-framing GCD from an information-theoretic perspective, grounded in the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle. We introduce InfoSculpt, a novel framework that systematically sculpts the representation space by minimizing a dual Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) objective. InfoSculpt uniquely combines a Category-Level CMI on labeled data to learn compact and discriminative representations for known classes, and a complementary Instance-Level CMI on all data to distill invariant features by compressing augmentation-induced noise. These two objectives work synergistically at different scales to produce a disentangled and robust latent space where categorical information is preserved while noisy, instance-specific details are discarded. Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarks demonstrate that InfoSculpt validating the effectiveness of our information-theoretic approach.

Method: Built on MMDiT architecture with chunkwise diffusion forcing strategy (including novel self-forcing variant) to prevent error accumulation, plus efficient distillation and system-level optimizations.

Result: Achieves stable 25fps at 480p resolution with time-to-first-frame of ~1.5 seconds, provides holistic full-body control, and demonstrates exceptional behavioral vividness and perceptual realism.

Conclusion: FlowAct-R1 enables real-time interactive humanoid video generation with high fidelity and low latency, maintaining robust generalization across diverse character styles.

Abstract: Interactive humanoid video generation aims to synthesize lifelike visual agents that can engage with humans through continuous and responsive video. Despite recent advances in video synthesis, existing methods often grapple with the trade-off between high-fidelity synthesis and real-time interaction requirements. In this paper, we propose FlowAct-R1, a framework specifically designed for real-time interactive humanoid video generation. Built upon a MMDiT architecture, FlowAct-R1 enables the streaming synthesis of video with arbitrary durations while maintaining low-latency responsiveness. We introduce a chunkwise diffusion forcing strategy, complemented by a novel self-forcing variant, to alleviate error accumulation and ensure long-term temporal consistency during continuous interaction. By leveraging efficient distillation and system-level optimizations, our framework achieves a stable 25fps at 480p resolution with a time-to-first-frame (TTFF) of only around 1.5 seconds. The proposed method provides holistic and fine-grained full-body control, enabling the agent to transition naturally between diverse behavioral states in interactive scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowAct-R1 achieves exceptional behavioral vividness and perceptual realism, while maintaining robust generalization across diverse character styles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on clean documents or generic layout analysis, overlooking structural integrity of math problems and models' ability to reject incomplete inputs in real-world noisy exam papers.

Method: Created MathDoc benchmark with 3,609 curated questions from authentic high school math exams containing real-world artifacts, including unrecognizable samples to test refusal behavior. Proposed multi-dimensional evaluation framework covering stem accuracy, visual similarity, and refusal capability.

Result: SOTA MLLMs (Qwen3-VL, Gemini-2.5-Pro) achieve strong extraction performance but consistently fail to refuse illegible inputs, instead producing confident but invalid outputs, revealing a critical reliability gap.

Conclusion: MathDoc establishes a benchmark for assessing model reliability under degraded document conditions and highlights the need for MLLMs to develop active refusal capabilities for incomplete or illegible inputs.

Abstract: The automated extraction of structured questions from paper-based mathematics exams is fundamental to intelligent education, yet remains challenging in real-world settings due to severe visual noise. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on clean documents or generic layout analysis, overlooking both the structural integrity of mathematical problems and the ability of models to actively reject incomplete inputs. We introduce MathDoc, the first benchmark for document-level information extraction from authentic high school mathematics exam papers. MathDoc contains \textbf{3,609} carefully curated questions with real-world artifacts and explicitly includes unrecognizable samples to evaluate active refusal behavior. We propose a multi-dimensional evaluation framework covering stem accuracy, visual similarity, and refusal capability. Experiments on SOTA MLLMs, including Qwen3-VL and Gemini-2.5-Pro, show that although end-to-end models achieve strong extraction performance, they consistently fail to refuse illegible inputs, instead producing confident but invalid outputs. These results highlight a critical gap in current MLLMs and establish MathDoc as a benchmark for assessing model reliability under degraded document conditions.

### [28] [Enhancing Visual In-Context Learning by Multi-Faceted Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10107)
*Wenwen Liao,Jianbo Yu,Yuansong Wang,Qingchao Jiang,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel multi-combination collaborative fusion framework for Visual In-Context Learning that generates three contextual representation branches from different prompt combinations, enabling more robust predictions than single-prompt approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current "retrieve-then-prompt" VICL approaches discard valuable contextual information by selecting only the single best visual prompt or collapsing multiple prompts into one representation, limiting reasoning capability and failing to leverage diverse contextual signals effectively.

Method: Proposes a multi-combination collaborative fusion framework that generates three contextual representation branches, each integrating information from different combinations of top-quality prompts. These complementary signals feed into a MULTI-VQGAN architecture designed to jointly interpret and utilize collaborative information from multiple sources.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse tasks (foreground segmentation, single-object detection, image colorization) demonstrate strong cross-task generalization, effective contextual fusion, and ability to produce more robust and accurate predictions than existing methods.

Conclusion: Moving beyond single-prompt fusion to multi-combination collaborative fusion unlocks the full potential of diverse contextual information in Visual In-Context Learning, enabling more sophisticated reasoning and better performance across various visual tasks.

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm, enabling models to perform novel visual tasks by learning from in-context examples. The dominant "retrieve-then-prompt" approach typically relies on selecting the single best visual prompt, a practice that often discards valuable contextual information from other suitable candidates. While recent work has explored fusing the top-K prompts into a single, enhanced representation, this still simply collapses multiple rich signals into one, limiting the model's reasoning capability. We argue that a more multi-faceted, collaborative fusion is required to unlock the full potential of these diverse contexts. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework that moves beyond single-prompt fusion towards an multi-combination collaborative fusion. Instead of collapsing multiple prompts into one, our method generates three contextual representation branches, each formed by integrating information from different combinations of top-quality prompts. These complementary guidance signals are then fed into proposed MULTI-VQGAN architecture, which is designed to jointly interpret and utilize collaborative information from multiple sources. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks, including foreground segmentation, single-object detection, and image colorization, highlight its strong cross-task generalization, effective contextual fusion, and ability to produce more robust and accurate predictions than existing methods.

*Wenwen Liao,Jianbo Yu,Yuansong Wang,Shifu Yan,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Vision In-Context Learning framework that aggregates multiple prompts and uses arrangement-specific MLPs to improve visual task adaptation, with bidirectional fine-tuning for better collaboration between fusion and inpainting modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision In-Context Learning methods have two key limitations: (1) they only select the most similar prompt, discarding complementary information from other high-quality prompts, and (2) they fail to exploit the structured information implied by different prompt arrangements.

Method: Proposes an end-to-end VICL framework with: (1) an adaptive Fusion Module that aggregates critical patterns and annotations from multiple prompts, (2) arrangement-specific lightweight MLPs to decouple layout priors from the core model, and (3) a bidirectional fine-tuning mechanism that swaps query and prompt roles to enhance collaboration between fusion and inpainting modules.

Result: Experiments on foreground segmentation, single-object detection, and image colorization demonstrate superior results and strong cross-task generalization compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the limitations of existing VICL methods by better utilizing multiple prompts and their arrangements, leading to improved performance and generalization across diverse visual tasks.

Abstract: Vision In-Context Learning (VICL) enables inpainting models to quickly adapt to new visual tasks from only a few prompts. However, existing methods suffer from two key issues: (1) selecting only the most similar prompt discards complementary cues from other high-quality prompts; and (2) failing to exploit the structured information implied by different prompt arrangements.
  We propose an end-to-end VICL framework to overcome these limitations. Firstly, an adaptive Fusion Module aggregates critical patterns and annotations from multiple prompts to form more precise contextual prompts. Secondly, we introduce arrangement-specific lightweight MLPs to decouple layout priors from the core model, while minimally affecting the overall model. In addition, an bidirectional fine-tuning mechanism swaps the roles of query and prompt, encouraging the model to reconstruct the original prompt from fused context and thus enhancing collaboration between the fusion module and the inpainting model. Experiments on foreground segmentation, single-object detection, and image colorization demonstrate superior results and strong cross-task generalization of our method.

*Sicheng Yang,Zhaohu Xing,Lei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VQ-Seg introduces vector quantization for feature discretization and a controllable Quantized Perturbation Module to replace dropout in semi-supervised medical image segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing consistency learning methods in semi-supervised medical image segmentation rely on dropout perturbation, which requires careful manual tuning of dropout rates - a sensitive hyperparameter that's difficult to optimize and often leads to suboptimal regularization.

Method: Proposes VQ-Seg with: 1) Vector quantization to discretize feature space, 2) Quantized Perturbation Module (QPM) that shuffles spatial locations of codebook indices for controllable regularization, 3) Dual-branch architecture sharing post-quantization features for both reconstruction and segmentation, and 4) Post-VQ Feature Adapter to incorporate guidance from foundation models.

Result: Extensive experiments on a new large-scale Lung Cancer dataset (828 CT scans) and other public benchmarks demonstrate the method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Conclusion: VQ-Seg provides an effective alternative to dropout-based perturbation methods, offering controllable regularization through vector quantization and addressing information loss via dual-branch architecture and foundation model guidance, achieving superior performance in medical image segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Consistency learning with feature perturbation is a widely used strategy in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. However, many existing perturbation methods rely on dropout, and thus require a careful manual tuning of the dropout rate, which is a sensitive hyperparameter and often difficult to optimize and may lead to suboptimal regularization. To overcome this limitation, we propose VQ-Seg, the first approach to employ vector quantization (VQ) to discretize the feature space and introduce a novel and controllable Quantized Perturbation Module (QPM) that replaces dropout. Our QPM perturbs discrete representations by shuffling the spatial locations of codebook indices, enabling effective and controllable regularization. To mitigate potential information loss caused by quantization, we design a dual-branch architecture where the post-quantization feature space is shared by both image reconstruction and segmentation tasks. Moreover, we introduce a Post-VQ Feature Adapter (PFA) to incorporate guidance from a foundation model (FM), supplementing the high-level semantic information lost during quantization. Furthermore, we collect a large-scale Lung Cancer (LC) dataset comprising 828 CT scans annotated for central-type lung carcinoma. Extensive experiments on the LC dataset and other public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaViT addresses the perception gap in multimodal reasoning by aligning latent visual thoughts instead of static embeddings, forcing students to reconstruct teacher's visual semantics and attention before text generation, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal reasoning relies on external supervision and ignores intrinsic visual attention dynamics, leading to a perception gap where students mimic teacher's text output while attending to different visual regions, relying on language priors rather than grounded perception.

Method: LaViT framework aligns latent visual thoughts rather than static embeddings. It compels students to autoregressively reconstruct teacher's visual semantics and attention trajectories before text generation, using a curriculum sensory gating mechanism to prevent shortcut learning.

Result: LaViT significantly enhances visual grounding, achieving up to +16.9% gains on complex reasoning tasks. A compact 3B model outperforms larger open-source variants and proprietary models like GPT-4o.

Conclusion: Aligning latent visual thoughts rather than static embeddings effectively bridges the perception gap in multimodal reasoning, enabling more grounded perception and superior performance even with smaller models.

Abstract: Current multimodal latent reasoning often relies on external supervision (e.g., auxiliary images), ignoring intrinsic visual attention dynamics. In this work, we identify a critical Perception Gap in distillation: student models frequently mimic a teacher's textual output while attending to fundamentally divergent visual regions, effectively relying on language priors rather than grounded perception. To bridge this, we propose LaViT, a framework that aligns latent visual thoughts rather than static embeddings. LaViT compels the student to autoregressively reconstruct the teacher's visual semantics and attention trajectories prior to text generation, employing a curriculum sensory gating mechanism to prevent shortcut learning. Extensive experiments show that LaViT significantly enhances visual grounding, achieving up to +16.9% gains on complex reasoning tasks and enabling a compact 3B model to outperform larger open-source variants and proprietary models like GPT-4o.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR) task that elevates anomaly analysis from description to structured multi-stage reasoning, introduces large dataset with 8,641 videos and 50K+ samples, and develops Vad-R1-Plus model with adaptive hierarchical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM-based video anomaly detection methods are limited to localization or post-hoc description, lacking explicit reasoning processes, risk awareness, and decision-oriented interpretation. Need to move from descriptive understanding to structured reasoning.

Method: Defines VAR task requiring progressive reasoning over anomalies. Creates dataset with Perception-Cognition-Action Chain-of-Thought (PerCoAct-CoT) annotations. Proposes Anomaly-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization for weak supervision. Develops Vad-R1-Plus MLLM with adaptive hierarchical reasoning and risk-aware decision making.

Result: Extensive experiments show proposed benchmark and method advance MLLM reasoning capabilities on VAR tasks, outperforming both open-source and proprietary baselines.

Conclusion: VAR task elevates video anomaly analysis to structured multi-stage reasoning, enabling systematic evaluation of adaptive anomaly reasoning. The proposed framework effectively enhances MLLM reasoning reliability for complex video understanding.

Abstract: Recent progress in reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has highlighted their potential for performing complex video understanding tasks. However, in the domain of Video Anomaly Detection and Understanding (VAD&U), existing MLLM-based methods are largely limited to anomaly localization or post-hoc description, lacking explicit reasoning processes, risk awareness, and decision-oriented interpretation. To address this gap, we define a new task termed Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), which elevates video anomaly analysis from descriptive understanding to structured, multi-stage reasoning. VAR explicitly requires models to perform progressive reasoning over anomalous events before answering anomaly-related questions, encompassing visual perception, causal interpretation, and risk-aware decision making. To support this task, we present a new dataset with 8,641 videos, where each video is annotated with diverse question types corresponding to different reasoning depths, totaling more than 50,000 samples, making it one of the largest datasets for video anomaly. The annotations are based on a structured Perception-Cognition-Action Chain-of-Thought (PerCoAct-CoT), which formalizes domain-specific reasoning priors for video anomaly understanding. This design enables systematic evaluation of multi-stage and adaptive anomaly reasoning. In addition, we propose Anomaly-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization to further enhance reasoning reliability under weak supervision. Building upon the proposed task and dataset, we develop an end-to-end MLLM-based VAR model termed Vad-R1-Plus, which supports adaptive hierarchical reasoning and risk-aware decision making. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed benchmark and method effectively advance the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs on VAR tasks, outperforming both open-source and proprietary baselines.

*Hu Gao,Xiaoning Lei,Xichen Xu,Xingjian Wang,Lizhuang Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OPIR: A two-stage framework using predicted inverse degradation operators for efficient all-in-one image restoration, with uncertainty guidance and task-aware adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing all-in-one image restoration methods add complexity through prompt information or large models, hindering real-time applicability. Need for efficient, unified approach that handles multiple restoration tasks without excessive computational overhead.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Predict task-aware inverse degradation operator to produce initial restoration with uncertainty map highlighting difficult regions; 2) Refine restoration guided by uncertainty map. Uses same inverse operator prediction network in both stages with task-aware parameters for adaptation. Accelerates convolution operations for efficiency.

Result: Extensive validation shows superior all-in-one restoration performance while remaining highly competitive on task-aligned restoration. Achieves efficient restoration through tightly integrated architecture.

Conclusion: OPIR provides an efficient, reliable all-in-one image restoration solution by predicting inverse degradation operators with uncertainty guidance, avoiding complexity of existing methods while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: All-in-one image restoration aims to adaptively handle multiple restoration tasks with a single trained model. Although existing methods achieve promising results by introducing prompt information or leveraging large models, the added learning modules increase system complexity and hinder real-time applicability. In this paper, we adopt a physical degradation modeling perspective and predict a task-aware inverse degradation operator for efficient all-in-one image restoration. The framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, the predicted inverse operator produces an initial restored image together with an uncertainty perception map that highlights regions difficult to reconstruct, ensuring restoration reliability. In the second stage, the restoration is further refined under the guidance of this uncertainty map. The same inverse operator prediction network is used in both stages, with task-aware parameters introduced after operator prediction to adapt to different degradation tasks. Moreover, by accelerating the convolution of the inverse operator, the proposed method achieves efficient all-in-one image restoration. The resulting tightly integrated architecture, termed OPIR, is extensively validated through experiments, demonstrating superior all-in-one restoration performance while remaining highly competitive on task-aligned restoration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ELITE: Efficient Gaussian head avatar synthesis from monocular video using learned initialization and test-time generative adaptation, achieving high-fidelity results with 60x speedup over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods for monocular video avatar synthesis rely on either 3D data priors (poor in-the-wild generalization) or 2D generative priors (computationally heavy and prone to identity hallucination). There's a need for an efficient system that combines the strengths of both approaches.

Method: 1) Feed-forward Mesh2Gaussian Prior Model (MGPM) for fast Gaussian avatar initialization. 2) Test-time generative adaptation using both real and synthetic images. 3) Rendering-guided single-step diffusion enhancer (instead of full diffusion denoising) to restore missing visual details while avoiding hallucination.

Result: ELITE produces visually superior avatars compared to prior works, even for challenging expressions, while achieving 60x faster synthesis than 2D generative prior methods. The method shows strong in-the-wild generalization.

Conclusion: ELITE successfully combines 3D data priors and 2D generative priors in a complementary way, creating an efficient system for high-fidelity animatable avatar synthesis from monocular video with excellent generalization and significant speed improvements.

Abstract: We introduce ELITE, an Efficient Gaussian head avatar synthesis from a monocular video via Learned Initialization and TEst-time generative adaptation. Prior works rely either on a 3D data prior or a 2D generative prior to compensate for missing visual cues in monocular videos. However, 3D data prior methods often struggle to generalize in-the-wild, while 2D generative prior methods are computationally heavy and prone to identity hallucination. We identify a complementary synergy between these two priors and design an efficient system that achieves high-fidelity animatable avatar synthesis with strong in-the-wild generalization. Specifically, we introduce a feed-forward Mesh2Gaussian Prior Model (MGPM) that enables fast initialization of a Gaussian avatar. To further bridge the domain gap at test time, we design a test-time generative adaptation stage, leveraging both real and synthetic images as supervision. Unlike previous full diffusion denoising strategies that are slow and hallucination-prone, we propose a rendering-guided single-step diffusion enhancer that restores missing visual details, grounded on Gaussian avatar renderings. Our experiments demonstrate that ELITE produces visually superior avatars to prior works, even for challenging expressions, while achieving 60x faster synthesis than the 2D generative prior method.

TL;DR: DepthDirector: A video re-rendering framework that achieves precise camera control by using depth video from 3D representation as guidance, enabling faithful scene reproduction under novel camera trajectories while maintaining content consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing camera control methods for video generation often fail to fully leverage 3D priors of video diffusion models and suffer from the "Inpainting Trap," leading to subject inconsistency and degraded quality when altering camera trajectories.

Method: Proposes DepthDirector with View-Content Dual-Stream Condition mechanism that injects both source video and warped depth sequence from target viewpoint into pretrained video generation model. Uses lightweight LoRA-based video diffusion adapter for training and creates MultiCam-WarpData dataset with 8K videos across 1K dynamic scenes.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in both camera controllability and visual quality, enabling precise camera control while faithfully preserving video content under novel camera trajectories.

Conclusion: DepthDirector successfully addresses the camera control challenge by leveraging 3D geometric guidance to enable video diffusion models to comprehend camera movements while maintaining their 3D understanding capabilities, achieving superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Camera control has been extensively studied in conditioned video generation; however, performing precisely altering the camera trajectories while faithfully preserving the video content remains a challenging task. The mainstream approach to achieving precise camera control is warping a 3D representation according to the target trajectory. However, such methods fail to fully leverage the 3D priors of video diffusion models (VDMs) and often fall into the Inpainting Trap, resulting in subject inconsistency and degraded generation quality. To address this problem, we propose DepthDirector, a video re-rendering framework with precise camera controllability. By leveraging the depth video from explicit 3D representation as camera-control guidance, our method can faithfully reproduce the dynamic scene of an input video under novel camera trajectories. Specifically, we design a View-Content Dual-Stream Condition mechanism that injects both the source video and the warped depth sequence rendered under the target viewpoint into the pretrained video generation model. This geometric guidance signal enables VDMs to comprehend camera movements and leverage their 3D understanding capabilities, thereby facilitating precise camera control and consistent content generation. Next, we introduce a lightweight LoRA-based video diffusion adapter to train our framework, fully preserving the knowledge priors of VDMs. Additionally, we construct a large-scale multi-camera synchronized dataset named MultiCam-WarpData using Unreal Engine 5, containing 8K videos across 1K dynamic scenes. Extensive experiments show that DepthDirector outperforms existing methods in both camera controllability and visual quality. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the cognitive strain caused by trying to follow speakers while simultaneously scanning slides for relevant information, especially in fast-paced presentations like conference talks

Method: Analyzes spoken content and matches it with textual/graphical elements in slides to automatically identify and highlight the most relevant slide regions

Result: Developed a method that ensures better synchronization between what listeners hear and what they need to attend to, with exploration of different approaches and assessment of success/failure cases

Conclusion: Automated slide highlighting based on speaker narrative is crucial for reducing cognitive strain and improving comprehension in content-rich videos like educational videos and conference talks

Abstract: Imagine sitting in a presentation, trying to follow the speaker while simultaneously scanning the slides for relevant information. While the entire slide is visible, identifying the relevant regions can be challenging. As you focus on one part of the slide, the speaker moves on to a new sentence, leaving you scrambling to catch up visually. This constant back-and-forth creates a disconnect between what is being said and the most important visual elements, making it hard to absorb key details, especially in fast-paced or content-heavy presentations such as conference talks. This requires an understanding of slides, including text, graphics, and layout. We introduce a method that automatically identifies and highlights the most relevant slide regions based on the speaker's narrative. By analyzing spoken content and matching it with textual or graphical elements in the slides, our approach ensures better synchronization between what listeners hear and what they need to attend to. We explore different ways of solving this problem and assess their success and failure cases. Analyzing multimedia documents is emerging as a key requirement for seamless understanding of content-rich videos, such as educational videos and conference talks, by reducing cognitive strain and improving comprehension.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chinese vision-language pretraining lags behind English due to scarcity of high-quality Chinese image-text data, despite the success of English VLP models like CLIP and SigLIP.

Method: Developed comprehensive pipeline to construct high-quality Chinese cross-modal dataset from Common Crawl with rigorous selection process, focusing on recent 2024-2025 web data.

Result: DanQing consistently achieves superior performance across Chinese downstream tasks including zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and LMM-based evaluations when used for continual pre-training of SigLIP2.

Conclusion: DanQing addresses the Chinese VLP data gap with high-quality, recent data that captures evolving semantic trends, and will be open-sourced under CC-BY 4.0 license to advance Chinese vision-language research.

Abstract: Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models demonstrate strong performance across various downstream tasks by learning from large-scale image-text pairs through contrastive pretraining. The release of extensive English image-text datasets (e.g., COYO-700M and LAION-400M) has enabled widespread adoption of models such as CLIP and SigLIP in tasks including cross-modal retrieval and image captioning. However, the advancement of Chinese vision-language pretraining has substantially lagged behind, due to the scarcity of high-quality Chinese image-text data. To address this gap, we develop a comprehensive pipeline for constructing a high-quality Chinese cross-modal dataset. As a result, we propose DanQing, which contains 100 million image-text pairs collected from Common Crawl. Different from existing datasets, DanQing is curated through a more rigorous selection process, yielding superior data quality. Moreover, DanQing is primarily built from 2024-2025 web data, enabling models to better capture evolving semantic trends and thus offering greater practical utility. We compare DanQing with existing datasets by continual pre-training of the SigLIP2 model. Experimental results show that DanQing consistently achieves superior performance across a range of Chinese downstream tasks, including zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and LMM-based evaluations. To facilitate further research in Chinese vision-language pre-training, we will open-source the DanQing dataset under the Creative Common CC-BY 4.0 license.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attacks for VLP models are mostly sample-specific, causing substantial computational overhead when scaled to large datasets or new scenarios. There's a need for more efficient universal attack methods.

Method: Hierarchical Refinement Attack (HRA) refines UAPs at sample and optimization levels. For images: disentangles adversarial examples into clean images and perturbations, uses ScMix augmentation to diversify visual contexts. For text: identifies globally influential words using intra-sentence and inter-sentence importance measures. Also refines optimization path using temporal hierarchy of historical and estimated future gradients.

Result: Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks, VLP models, and datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed universal multimodal attacks compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: HRA provides an effective universal attack framework for VLP models that overcomes computational limitations of sample-specific attacks while maintaining strong adversarial performance across multiple modalities and tasks.

Abstract: Existing adversarial attacks for VLP models are mostly sample-specific, resulting in substantial computational overhead when scaled to large datasets or new scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Hierarchical Refinement Attack (HRA), a multimodal universal attack framework for VLP models. HRA refines universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) at both the sample level and the optimization level. For the image modality, we disentangle adversarial examples into clean images and perturbations, allowing each component to be handled independently for more effective disruption of cross-modal alignment. We further introduce a ScMix augmentation strategy that diversifies visual contexts and strengthens both global and local utility of UAPs, thereby reducing reliance on spurious features. In addition, we refine the optimization path by leveraging a temporal hierarchy of historical and estimated future gradients to avoid local minima and stabilize universal perturbation learning. For the text modality, HRA identifies globally influential words by combining intra-sentence and inter-sentence importance measures, and subsequently utilizes these words as universal text perturbations. Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks, VLP models, and datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed universal multimodal attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing streaming audio-video approaches suffer from disjointed capabilities - either incomplete modality support or lack of autonomous proactive monitoring, creating a need for unified real-time multimodal understanding.

Method: ROMA processes continuous inputs as synchronized multimodal units, aligning dense audio with discrete video frames. It uses a lightweight speak head that decouples response initiation from generation for precise triggering. Training involves curated streaming data and two-stage curriculum for streaming format adaptation and proactive responsiveness.

Result: Extensive experiments across 12 benchmarks show ROMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on proactive tasks (alert, narration) while remaining competitive in reactive settings (QA), demonstrating robust unified real-time omni-multimodal understanding.

Conclusion: ROMA successfully addresses the challenge of streaming audio-video understanding by providing a unified framework for both reactive and proactive interaction, with standardized evaluation demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Recent Omni-multimodal Large Language Models show promise in unified audio, vision, and text modeling. However, streaming audio-video understanding remains challenging, as existing approaches suffer from disjointed capabilities: they typically exhibit incomplete modality support or lack autonomous proactive monitoring. To address this, we present ROMA, a real-time omni-multimodal assistant for unified reactive and proactive interaction. ROMA processes continuous inputs as synchronized multimodal units, aligning dense audio with discrete video frames to handle granularity mismatches. For online decision-making, we introduce a lightweight speak head that decouples response initiation from generation to ensure precise triggering without task conflict. We train ROMA with a curated streaming dataset and a two-stage curriculum that progressively optimizes for streaming format adaptation and proactive responsiveness. To standardize the fragmented evaluation landscape, we reorganize diverse benchmarks into a unified suite covering both proactive (alert, narration) and reactive (QA) settings. Extensive experiments across 12 benchmarks demonstrate ROMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on proactive tasks while competitive in reactive settings, validating its robustness in unified real-time omni-multimodal understanding.

*Yiming Zhang,Weibo Qin,Yuntian Liu,Feng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes SRAW attack method for SAR-ATR that uses optimized spatial deformation with reweighted budgets across foreground/background regions to balance effectiveness and stealthiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR imagery has intrinsic sparsity, and DNN-based SAR-ATR systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks while over-relying on background regions. Existing attacks require visually perceptible distortions, needing a method that balances effectiveness and stealthiness.

Method: Space-Reweighted Adversarial Warping (SRAW) generates adversarial examples through optimized spatial deformation with reweighted budgets across foreground and background regions.

Result: SRAW significantly degrades performance of state-of-the-art SAR-ATR models and consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of imperceptibility and adversarial transferability.

Conclusion: SRAW provides an effective and stealthy adversarial attack method for SAR-ATR that addresses the limitations of existing approaches through spatial deformation with region-aware budget allocation.

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery exhibits intrinsic information sparsity due to its unique electromagnetic scattering mechanism. Despite the widespread adoption of deep neural network (DNN)-based SAR automatic target recognition (SAR-ATR) systems, they remain vulnerable to adversarial examples and tend to over-rely on background regions, leading to degraded adversarial robustness. Existing adversarial attacks for SAR-ATR often require visually perceptible distortions to achieve effective performance, thereby necessitating an attack method that balances effectiveness and stealthiness. In this paper, a novel attack method termed Space-Reweighted Adversarial Warping (SRAW) is proposed, which generates adversarial examples through optimized spatial deformation with reweighted budgets across foreground and background regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRAW significantly degrades the performance of state-of-the-art SAR-ATR models and consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of imperceptibility and adversarial transferability.

TL;DR: T2G paradigm enables LLM-based text encoders to reason about and rewrite user prompts before image generation, improving factual consistency and semantic alignment in text-to-image diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I diffusion models use LLMs merely as text encoders without leveraging their reasoning capabilities, leading to literal generation that lacks inference about what should be visually depicted from textual prompts.

Method: Proposes think-then-generate (T2G) paradigm: 1) Lightweight supervised fine-tuning to activate LLM's think-then-rewrite pattern, 2) Dual-GRPO co-optimization of LLM encoder and diffusion backbone using image-grounded rewards for faithful reasoning and accurate rendering.

Result: Substantial improvements in factual consistency, semantic alignment, and visual realism across reasoning-based image generation and editing benchmarks, achieving 0.79 on WISE score (nearly on par with GPT-4).

Conclusion: T2G represents a promising step toward next-generation unified models with reasoning, expression, and demonstration capacities, moving beyond literal text-pixel mapping to intelligent visual synthesis.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models (DMs) has enabled high-quality visual synthesis from diverse textual prompts. Yet, most existing T2I DMs, even those equipped with large language model (LLM)-based text encoders, remain text-pixel mappers -- they employ LLMs merely as text encoders, without leveraging their inherent reasoning capabilities to infer what should be visually depicted given the textual prompt. To move beyond such literal generation, we propose the think-then-generate (T2G) paradigm, where the LLM-based text encoder is encouraged to reason about and rewrite raw user prompts; the states of the rewritten prompts then serve as diffusion conditioning. To achieve this, we first activate the think-then-rewrite pattern of the LLM encoder with a lightweight supervised fine-tuning process. Subsequently, the LLM encoder and diffusion backbone are co-optimized to ensure faithful reasoning about the context and accurate rendering of the semantics via Dual-GRPO. In particular, the text encoder is reinforced using image-grounded rewards to infer and recall world knowledge, while the diffusion backbone is pushed to produce semantically consistent and visually coherent images. Experiments show substantial improvements in factual consistency, semantic alignment, and visual realism across reasoning-based image generation and editing benchmarks, achieving 0.79 on WISE score, nearly on par with GPT-4. Our results constitute a promising step toward next-generation unified models with reasoning, expression, and demonstration capacities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes supervised CNNs for imaging inverse problems through the lens of a constrained MMSE estimator that incorporates CNN inductive biases (translation equivariance and locality), deriving an interpretable LE-MMSE formula that matches neural network outputs in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the empirical success of supervised CNNs in solving imaging inverse problems, they are poorly understood theoretically and treated as black boxes. The paper aims to bridge this gap by providing theoretical analysis of trained neural networks.

Method: The authors analyze trained neural networks through the lens of the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimator, incorporating functional constraints that capture CNN inductive biases: translation equivariance and locality via finite receptive fields. They derive an analytic, interpretable, and tractable formula for this constrained variant called Local-Equivariant MMSE (LE-MMSE).

Result: Through extensive numerical experiments across various inverse problems (denoising, inpainting, deconvolution), datasets (FFHQ, CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST), and architectures (U-Net, ResNet, PatchMLP), the theory matches neural network outputs with PSNR ≥25dB. The analysis provides insights into physics-aware vs physics-agnostic estimators, impact of high-density regions in training distribution, and influence of factors like dataset size and patch size.

Conclusion: The paper successfully bridges the theory-practice gap by providing a theoretical framework that explains CNN performance in imaging inverse problems through constrained MMSE estimation, offering interpretable insights into how CNNs work and what factors influence their performance.

Abstract: Supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used to solve imaging inverse problems, achieving state-of-the-art performance in numerous applications. However, despite their empirical success, these methods are poorly understood from a theoretical perspective and often treated as black boxes. To bridge this gap, we analyze trained neural networks through the lens of the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimator, incorporating functional constraints that capture two fundamental inductive biases of CNNs: translation equivariance and locality via finite receptive fields. Under the empirical training distribution, we derive an analytic, interpretable, and tractable formula for this constrained variant, termed Local-Equivariant MMSE (LE-MMSE). Through extensive numerical experiments across various inverse problems (denoising, inpainting, deconvolution), datasets (FFHQ, CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST), and architectures (U-Net, ResNet, PatchMLP), we demonstrate that our theory matches the neural networks outputs (PSNR $\gtrsim25$dB). Furthermore, we provide insights into the differences between \emph{physics-aware} and \emph{physics-agnostic} estimators, the impact of high-density regions in the training (patch) distribution, and the influence of other factors (dataset size, patch size, etc).

Conclusion: HPE-Bench provides a specialized benchmark and unified evaluation framework that addresses limitations in current pose editing assessment, offering comprehensive insights into both authenticity and quality dimensions.

Abstract: Text-guided human pose editing has gained significant traction in AIGC applications. However,it remains plagued by structural anomalies and generative artifacts. Existing evaluation metrics often isolate authenticity detection from quality assessment, failing to provide fine-grained insights into pose-specific inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we introduce HPE-Bench, a specialized benchmark comprising 1,700 standardized samples from 17 state-of-the-art editing models, offering both authenticity labels and multi-dimensional quality scores. Furthermore, we propose a unified framework based on layer-selective multimodal large language models (MLLMs). By employing contrastive LoRA tuning and a novel layer sensitivity analysis (LSA) mechanism, we identify the optimal feature layer for pose evaluation. Our framework achieves superior performance in both authenticity detection and multi-dimensional quality regression, effectively bridging the gap between forensic detection and quality assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based image compression methods suffer from slow sampling and suboptimal bit allocation due to fragmented training paradigms, limiting their practical application despite enabling visually plausible compression at extremely low bit rates.

Method: Proposes DiffCR with Frequency-aware Skip Estimation (FaSE) module that refines ε-prediction prior from pre-trained latent diffusion model using Frequency Decoupling Attention (FDA) to align with compressed latents.

Result: Achieves 27.2% BD-rate savings (LPIPS) and 65.1% BD-rate (PSNR) improvements, with over 10× speed-up compared to SOTA diffusion-based compression baselines, without updating the backbone diffusion model.

Conclusion: DiffCR provides an efficient framework for high-fidelity image compression by refining diffusion priors and enabling fast decoding, addressing key limitations of existing diffusion-based compression methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based generative priors have enabled visually plausible image compression at extremely low bit rates. However, existing approaches suffer from slow sampling processes and suboptimal bit allocation due to fragmented training paradigms. In this work, we propose Accelerate \textbf{Diff}usion-based Image Compression via \textbf{C}onsistency Prior \textbf{R}efinement (DiffCR), a novel compression framework for efficient and high-fidelity image reconstruction. At the heart of DiffCR is a Frequency-aware Skip Estimation (FaSE) module that refines the $ε$-prediction prior from a pre-trained latent diffusion model and aligns it with compressed latents at different timesteps via Frequency Decoupling Attention (FDA). Furthermore, a lightweight consistency estimator enables fast \textbf{two-step decoding} by preserving the semantic trajectory of diffusion sampling. Without updating the backbone diffusion model, DiffCR achieves substantial bitrate savings (27.2\% BD-rate (LPIPS) and 65.1\% BD-rate (PSNR)) and over $10\times$ speed-up compared to SOTA diffusion-based compression baselines.

*Dian Jiao,Jiaxin Duan,Shuai Zhao,Jiabing Leng,Yiran Zhang,Feng Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VIST2: A Transformer that compresses text into visual tokens for faster generation, achieving 3× speedup and 77% memory reduction with 4× compression ratio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models compress text into images for prefilling but fail to save computation during token-by-token inference. Need global context compression that works at both prefilling and inference stages.

Method: VIST2 interleaves text chunks with their visual encoding, using only visual tokens in pre-context to predict next text tokens. Text chunks are rendered into sketch images, trained with curriculum-scheduled pretraining for optical language modeling followed by modal-interleaved instruction tuning.

Result: With 4× compression ratio, VIST2 achieves 3× speedup in first-token generation, 77% reduction in memory usage, and 74% reduction in FLOPS, outperforming baselines on long writing tasks across models scaled from 0.6B to 8B.

Conclusion: VIST2 demonstrates effective global context compression for text generation, significantly improving efficiency while maintaining performance, with potential for further research in visual-text compression methods.

Abstract: Recent achievements of vision-language models in end-to-end OCR point to a new avenue for low-loss compression of textual information. This motivates earlier works that render the Transformer's input into images for prefilling, which effectively reduces the number of tokens through visual encoding, thereby alleviating the quadratically increased Attention computations. However, this partial compression fails to save computational or memory costs at token-by-token inference. In this paper, we investigate global context compression, which saves tokens at both prefilling and inference stages. Consequently, we propose VIST2, a novel Transformer that interleaves input text chunks alongside their visual encoding, while depending exclusively on visual tokens in the pre-context to predict the next text token distribution. Around this idea, we render text chunks into sketch images and train VIST2 in multiple stages, starting from curriculum-scheduled pretraining for optical language modeling, followed by modal-interleaved instruction tuning. We conduct extensive experiments using VIST2 families scaled from 0.6B to 8B to explore the training recipe and hyperparameters. With a 4$\times$ compression ratio, the resulting models demonstrate significant superiority over baselines on long writing tasks, achieving, on average, a 3$\times$ speedup in first-token generation, 77% reduction in memory usage, and 74% reduction in FLOPS. Our codes and datasets will be public to support further studies.

TL;DR: A missing-aware multimodal survival framework for NSCLC that integrates CT, WSI, and clinical data using foundation models and intermediate fusion, achieving 73.30 C-index while handling missing modalities without patient exclusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate NSCLC survival prediction requires integrating heterogeneous clinical, radiological, and histopathological data, but current multimodal deep learning approaches are limited by small cohorts and missing modalities that force complete-case filtering or aggressive imputation.

Method: Uses foundation models for modality-specific feature extraction and a missing-aware encoding strategy for intermediate multimodal fusion of CT, WSI, and clinical variables, with architecture designed to be resilient to missing modalities without dropping patients.

Result: Intermediate fusion consistently outperforms unimodal baselines and early/late fusion strategies, with WSI+clinical fusion achieving best performance (73.30 C-index). The model adaptively down-weights less informative modalities like CT.

Conclusion: The proposed missing-aware multimodal survival framework enables robust survival prediction in NSCLC by effectively handling incomplete modality profiles without patient exclusion, demonstrating clinical applicability through adaptive modality weighting and superior performance.

Abstract: Accurate survival prediction in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) requires the integration of heterogeneous clinical, radiological, and histopathological information. While Multimodal Deep Learning (MDL) offers a promises for precision prognosis and survival prediction, its clinical applicability is severely limited by small cohort sizes and the presence of missing modalities, often forcing complete-case filtering or aggressive imputation. In this work, we present a missing-aware multimodal survival framework that integrates Computed Tomography (CT), Whole-Slide Histopathology (WSI) Images, and structured clinical variables for overall survival modeling in unresectable stage II-III NSCLC. By leveraging Foundation Models (FM) for modality-specific feature extraction and a missing-aware encoding strategy, the proposed approach enables intermediate multimodal fusion under naturally incomplete modality profiles. The proposed architecture is resilient to missing modalities by design, allowing the model to utilize all available data without being forced to drop patients during training or inference. Experimental results demonstrate that intermediate fusion consistently outperforms unimodal baselines as well as early and late fusion strategies, with the strongest performance achieved by the fusion of WSI and clinical modalities (73.30 C-index). Further analyses of modality importance reveal an adaptive behavior in which less informative modalities, i.e., CT modality, are automatically down-weighted and contribute less to the final survival prediction.

Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy is widely employed for the analysis of living biological samples; however, the utility of the resulting recordings is frequently constrained by noise, temporal variability, and inconsistent visualisation of signals that oscillate over time. We present a unique computational framework that integrates information from multiple time-resolved frames into a single high-quality image, while preserving the underlying biological content of the original video. We evaluate the proposed method through an extensive number of configurations (n = 111) and on a challenging dataset comprising dynamic, heterogeneous, and morphologically complex 2D monolayers of cardiac cells. Results show that our framework, which consists of a combination of explainable techniques from different computer vision application fields, is capable of generating composite images that preserve and enhance the quality and information of individual microscopy frames, yielding 44% average increase in cell count compared to previous methods.

Motivation: Existing lunar rendering pipelines use simplified or spatially uniform BRDF models that fail to capture local reflectance variations, limiting photometric realism for high-fidelity rendering and vision-based navigation.

Method: U-Net trained with differentiable rendering to predict spatially varying BRDF parameters directly from lunar DEMs, minimizing photometric discrepancies between real orbital images and physically based renderings under known viewing/illumination geometry.

Result: Reduces photometric error by 38% compared to state-of-the-art baseline, achieves higher PSNR and SSIM, and captures fine-scale reflectance variations absent from spatially uniform models on geographically held-out Tycho crater region.

Conclusion: First method to infer spatially varying reflectance model directly from terrain geometry, enabling realistic lunar surface rendering without requiring multi-view imagery or dedicated reflectance-capture hardware at inference time.

Abstract: We address the problem of estimating realistic, spatially varying reflectance for complex planetary surfaces such as the lunar regolith, which is critical for high-fidelity rendering and vision-based navigation. Existing lunar rendering pipelines rely on simplified or spatially uniform BRDF models whose parameters are difficult to estimate and fail to capture local reflectance variations, limiting photometric realism. We propose Lunar-G2R, a geometry-to-reflectance learning framework that predicts spatially varying BRDF parameters directly from a lunar digital elevation model (DEM), without requiring multi-view imagery, controlled illumination, or dedicated reflectance-capture hardware at inference time. The method leverages a U-Net trained with differentiable rendering to minimize photometric discrepancies between real orbital images and physically based renderings under known viewing and illumination geometry. Experiments on a geographically held-out region of the Tycho crater show that our approach reduces photometric error by 38 % compared to a state-of-the-art baseline, while achieving higher PSNR and SSIM and improved perceptual similarity, capturing fine-scale reflectance variations absent from spatially uniform models. To our knowledge, this is the first method to infer a spatially varying reflectance model directly from terrain geometry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current segmentation models work well for physical entities but struggle with socially-defined categories like schools and parks, which are crucial for urban applications.

Method: Proposes SocioReasoner framework that simulates human annotation process via cross-modal recognition and multi-stage reasoning, using reinforcement learning to optimize the non-differentiable reasoning process.

Result: Experiments show gains over state-of-the-art models and strong zero-shot generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enables socio-semantic segmentation of urban entities through vision-language reasoning, with a new dataset (SocioSeg) and code made publicly available.

Abstract: As hubs of human activity, urban surfaces consist of a wealth of semantic entities. Segmenting these various entities from satellite imagery is crucial for a range of downstream applications. Current advanced segmentation models can reliably segment entities defined by physical attributes (e.g., buildings, water bodies) but still struggle with socially defined categories (e.g., schools, parks). In this work, we achieve socio-semantic segmentation by vision-language model reasoning. To facilitate this, we introduce the Urban Socio-Semantic Segmentation dataset named SocioSeg, a new resource comprising satellite imagery, digital maps, and pixel-level labels of social semantic entities organized in a hierarchical structure. Additionally, we propose a novel vision-language reasoning framework called SocioReasoner that simulates the human process of identifying and annotating social semantic entities via cross-modal recognition and multi-stage reasoning. We employ reinforcement learning to optimize this non-differentiable process and elicit the reasoning capabilities of the vision-language model. Experiments demonstrate our approach's gains over state-of-the-art models and strong zero-shot generalization. Our dataset and code are available in https://github.com/AMAP-ML/SocioReasoner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning vision-language models like CLIP often causes catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge, and existing methods can't fully prevent this forgetting during adaptation.

Method: Proposes MERGETUNE, a model-agnostic CFT strategy guided by linear mode connectivity. It continues fine-tuning trainable parameters to find a continued model with low-loss paths to both zero-shot and fine-tuned solutions, using a second-order surrogate to avoid data replay.

Result: Improves harmonic mean of CoOp by +5.6% on base-novel generalization without adding parameters, achieves superior performance to CLIP on DTD and EuroSAT, and surpasses ensemble baselines with lower inference cost.

Conclusion: MERGETUNE effectively recovers pretrained knowledge after fine-tuning through continued fine-tuning with linear mode connectivity, offering a practical post-hoc solution that improves generalization and robustness without architectural changes.

Abstract: Fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP often leads to catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge. Prior work primarily aims to mitigate forgetting during adaptation; however, forgetting often remains inevitable during this process. We introduce a novel paradigm, \emph{continued fine-tuning (CFT)}, which seeks to recover pretrained knowledge after a zero-shot model has already been adapted. We propose a simple, model-agnostic CFT strategy (named MERGETUNE) guided by linear mode connectivity (LMC), which can be applied post hoc to existing fine-tuned models without requiring architectural changes. Given a fine-tuned model, we continue fine-tuning its trainable parameters (e.g., soft prompts or linear heads) to search for a continued model which has two low-loss paths to the zero-shot (e.g., CLIP) and the fine-tuned (e.g., CoOp) solutions. By exploiting the geometry of the loss landscape, the continued model implicitly merges the two solutions, restoring pretrained knowledge lost in the fine-tuned counterpart. A challenge is that the vanilla LMC constraint requires data replay from the pretraining task. We approximate this constraint for the zero-shot model via a second-order surrogate, eliminating the need for large-scale data replay. Experiments show that MERGETUNE improves the harmonic mean of CoOp by +5.6\% on base-novel generalisation without adding parameters. % We show \emph{the first time} superior performance than CLIP on both DTD and EuroSAT, on cross-dataset transfer. On robust fine-tuning evaluations, the LMC-merged model from MERGETUNE surpasses ensemble baselines with lower inference cost, achieving further gains and state-of-the-art results when ensembled with the zero-shot model.

Conclusion: Satellite map integration significantly improves HD map estimation by providing global BEV priors that mitigate depth ambiguity and occlusion, making it valuable for autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Online high-definition (HD) map construction is an essential part of a safe and robust end-to-end autonomous driving (AD) pipeline. Onboard camera-based approaches suffer from limited depth perception and degraded accuracy due to occlusion. In this work, we propose SatMap, an online vectorized HD map estimation method that integrates satellite maps with multi-view camera observations and directly predicts a vectorized HD map for downstream prediction and planning modules. Our method leverages lane-level semantics and texture from satellite imagery captured from a Bird's Eye View (BEV) perspective as a global prior, effectively mitigating depth ambiguity and occlusion. In our experiments on the nuScenes dataset, SatMap achieves 34.8% mAP performance improvement over the camera-only baseline and 8.5% mAP improvement over the camera-LiDAR fusion baseline.

Abstract: Anticipating the intentions of Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) is a critical challenge for safe autonomous driving (AD) and mobile robotics. While current research predominantly focuses on pedestrian crossing behaviors from a vehicle's perspective, interactions within dense shared spaces remain underexplored.

Result: SVII-3D significantly improves identification accuracy and minimizes localization errors, demonstrating effectiveness in infrastructure digitization from sparse imagery.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable, cost-effective solution for high-fidelity infrastructure digitization, bridging the gap between sparse perception and automated intelligent maintenance.

Abstract: The automated creation of digital twins and precise asset inventories is a critical task in smart city construction and facility lifecycle management. However, utilizing cost-effective sparse imagery remains challenging due to limited robustness, inaccurate localization, and a lack of fine-grained state understanding. To address these limitations, SVII-3D, a unified framework for holistic asset digitization, is proposed. First, LoRA fine-tuned open-set detection is fused with a spatial-attention matching network to robustly associate observations across sparse views. Second, a geometry-guided refinement mechanism is introduced to resolve structural errors, achieving precise decimeter-level 3D localization. Third, transcending static geometric mapping, a Vision-Language Model agent leveraging multi-modal prompting is incorporated to automatically diagnose fine-grained operational states. Experiments demonstrate that SVII-3D significantly improves identification accuracy and minimizes localization errors. Consequently, this framework offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for high-fidelity infrastructure digitization, effectively bridging the gap between sparse perception and automated intelligent maintenance.

TL;DR: Deep learning models (FFA-Net and AECR-Net) improve visibility of analog gauge images in smoky/hazy environments, enabling automatic gauge reading for emergency services.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Images captured in hazy/smoky environments have reduced visibility, hindering infrastructure monitoring and emergency services during critical situations. Accurate gauge interpretation is valuable for first responders.

Method: Used two deep learning architectures (FFA-Net and AECR-Net) to enhance gauge images corrupted with light to dense haze/smoke. Created synthetic dataset of 14,000+ images using Unreal Engine due to lack of benchmark datasets. Trained with 80/10/10 split for haze and smoke datasets.

Result: For synthetic haze dataset: SSIM ~0.98, PSNR ~43dB (comparable to state-of-the-art). AECR-Net performed more robustly than FFA-Net. Smoke dataset results were poorer due to smoke's inhomogeneity and high density, but still showed interesting results.

Conclusion: Deep learning architectures can significantly improve analog gauge image quality in smoke/haze scenes. Enhanced images can be successfully post-processed for automatic autonomous gauge reading, demonstrating practical value for emergency response applications.

Abstract: Images captured in hazy and smoky environments suffer from reduced visibility, posing a challenge when monitoring infrastructures and hindering emergency services during critical situations. The proposed work investigates the use of the deep learning models to enhance the automatic, machine-based readability of gauge in smoky environments, with accurate gauge data interpretation serving as a valuable tool for first responders. The study utilizes two deep learning architectures, FFA-Net and AECR-Net, to improve the visibility of gauge images, corrupted with light up to dense haze and smoke. Since benchmark datasets of analog gauge images are unavailable, a new synthetic dataset, containing over 14,000 images, was generated using the Unreal Engine. The models were trained with an 80\% train, 10\% validation, and 10\% test split for the haze and smoke dataset, respectively. For the synthetic haze dataset, the SSIM and PSNR metrics are about 0.98 and 43\,dB, respectively, comparing well to state-of-the art results. Additionally, more robust results are retrieved from the AECR-Net, when compared to the FFA-Net. Although the results from the synthetic smoke dataset are poorer, the trained models achieve interesting results. In general, imaging in the presence of smoke are more difficult to enhance given the inhomogeneity and high density. Secondly, FFA-Net and AECR-Net are implemented to dehaze and not to desmoke images. This work shows that use of deep learning architectures can improve the quality of analog gauge images captured in smoke and haze scenes immensely. Finally, the enhanced output images can be successfully post-processed for automatic autonomous reading of gauges

TL;DR: Domain-adapted framework transforms VLMs into specialized agents for urban infrastructure analysis using fine-tuning, knowledge-grounded reasoning, and dual-modality RAG to achieve 58.9 mAP detection and 95.5% attribute accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose vision models struggle with fine-grained urban infrastructure attributes and domain compliance, while VLMs fail to accurately interpret complex facility states according to engineering standards, limiting real-world reliability.

Method: Integrates data-efficient fine-tuning with knowledge-grounded reasoning: open-vocabulary fine-tuning on Grounding DINO for asset localization, LoRA-based adaptation on Qwen-VL for semantic attribute reasoning, and dual-modality RAG that retrieves industry standards and visual exemplars during inference.

Result: Achieves 58.9 mAP for detection and 95.5% accuracy for attribute recognition on comprehensive urban roadside dataset, demonstrating robust performance for intelligent infrastructure monitoring.

Conclusion: Proposed framework successfully transforms general VLMs into specialized agents for urban infrastructure analysis by combining fine-tuning with domain knowledge integration, providing a reliable solution for smart city management applications.

Abstract: Automated perception of urban roadside infrastructure is crucial for smart city management, yet general-purpose models often struggle to capture the necessary fine-grained attributes and domain rules. While Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) excel at open-world recognition, they often struggle to accurately interpret complex facility states in compliance with engineering standards, leading to unreliable performance in real-world applications. To address this, we propose a domain-adapted framework that transforms VLMs into specialized agents for intelligent infrastructure analysis. Our approach integrates a data-efficient fine-tuning strategy with a knowledge-grounded reasoning mechanism. Specifically, we leverage open-vocabulary fine-tuning on Grounding DINO to robustly localize diverse assets with minimal supervision, followed by LoRA-based adaptation on Qwen-VL for deep semantic attribute reasoning. To mitigate hallucinations and enforce professional compliance, we introduce a dual-modality Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that dynamically retrieves authoritative industry standards and visual exemplars during inference. Evaluated on a comprehensive new dataset of urban roadside scenes, our framework achieves a detection performance of 58.9 mAP and an attribute recognition accuracy of 95.5%, demonstrating a robust solution for intelligent infrastructure monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generative models often violate basic physics principles, limiting their utility. While some attribute this to insufficient pre-training physics understanding, the authors found suboptimal inference strategies also contribute to the problem.

Method: Introduces WMReward, treating physics plausibility improvement as an inference-time alignment problem. Uses a latent world model (VJEPA-2) as a physics reward to search and steer multiple candidate denoising trajectories, enabling scaling test-time compute for better performance.

Result: Substantially improves physics plausibility across image-conditioned, multiframe-conditioned, and text-conditioned generation settings. Achieved 62.64% final score in ICCV 2025 Perception Test PhysicsIQ Challenge, winning first place and outperforming previous SOTA by 7.42%.

Conclusion: Demonstrates viability of using latent world models to improve physics plausibility of video generation, beyond specific instantiations or parameterizations, showing inference-time alignment as an effective approach.

Abstract: State-of-the-art video generative models produce promising visual content yet often violate basic physics principles, limiting their utility. While some attribute this deficiency to insufficient physics understanding from pre-training, we find that the shortfall in physics plausibility also stems from suboptimal inference strategies. We therefore introduce WMReward and treat improving physics plausibility of video generation as an inference-time alignment problem. In particular, we leverage the strong physics prior of a latent world model (here, VJEPA-2) as a reward to search and steer multiple candidate denoising trajectories, enabling scaling test-time compute for better generation performance. Empirically, our approach substantially improves physics plausibility across image-conditioned, multiframe-conditioned, and text-conditioned generation settings, with validation from human preference study. Notably, in the ICCV 2025 Perception Test PhysicsIQ Challenge, we achieve a final score of 62.64%, winning first place and outperforming the previous state of the art by 7.42%. Our work demonstrates the viability of using latent world models to improve physics plausibility of video generation, beyond this specific instantiation or parameterization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving benchmarks lack dense traffic scenarios needed for robust prediction and planning systems to model complex interactions among road users.

Method: Collaborated with DeepScenario to create DeepUrban - a drone dataset with 3D traffic objects extracted from high-resolution images captured at ~100m altitude over urban intersections, enriched with comprehensive map and scene information.

Result: Adding DeepUrban to nuScenes boosts vehicle prediction and planning accuracy by up to 44.1% on ADE and 44.3% on FDE metrics, demonstrating improved generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: DeepUrban addresses the critical gap in dense urban traffic scenarios for autonomous driving benchmarks, significantly enhancing trajectory prediction and planning performance when combined with existing datasets.

Abstract: The efficacy of autonomous driving systems hinges critically on robust prediction and planning capabilities. However, current benchmarks are impeded by a notable scarcity of scenarios featuring dense traffic, which is essential for understanding and modeling complex interactions among road users. To address this gap, we collaborated with our industrial partner, DeepScenario, to develop DeepUrban-a new drone dataset designed to enhance trajectory prediction and planning benchmarks focusing on dense urban settings. DeepUrban provides a rich collection of 3D traffic objects, extracted from high-resolution images captured over urban intersections at approximately 100 meters altitude. The dataset is further enriched with comprehensive map and scene information to support advanced modeling and simulation tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) prediction and planning methods, and conducted experiments on generalization capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that adding DeepUrban to nuScenes can boost the accuracy of vehicle predictions and planning, achieving improvements up to 44.1 % / 44.3% on the ADE / FDE metrics.

*Serena Grazia De Benedictis,Amedeo Altavilla,Nicoletta Del Buono*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a topology-aware segmentation evaluation framework based on Jordan Curve Theorem and digital topology to assess structural coherence beyond conventional metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current segmentation evaluation metrics (pixel-wise, region-based, boundary-focused) fail to capture structural and topological coherence. Small inaccuracies can yield high scores while masks lack meaningful object shape or connectivity, especially problematic in medical imaging and object delineation.

Method: Introduces "Jordan-segmentatable mask" concept based on digital Jordan Curve Theorem. Uses digital topology and homology theory to extract 4-curve candidates from masks, verifies topological validity using Betti numbers (β₀=β₁=1). Mask is valid if complement splits into exactly two 8-connected components.

Result: Provides mathematically rigorous, unsupervised criterion for assessing structural coherence of segmentation masks. Framework combines digital Jordan theory with homological invariants for topological correctness evaluation.

Conclusion: Offers valuable alternative to standard evaluation metrics, particularly for applications requiring topological correctness preservation, addressing limitations of conventional metrics in capturing meaningful interior/exterior region partitioning.

Abstract: Image segmentation plays a central role in computer vision. However, widely used evaluation metrics, whether pixel-wise, region-based, or boundary-focused, often struggle to capture the structural and topological coherence of a segmentation. In many practical scenarios, such as medical imaging or object delineation, small inaccuracies in boundary, holes, or fragmented predictions can result in high metric scores, despite the fact that the resulting masks fail to preserve the object global shape or connectivity. This highlights a limitation of conventional metrics: they are unable to assess whether a predicted segmentation partitions the image into meaningful interior and exterior regions.
  In this work, we introduce a topology-aware notion of segmentation based on the Jordan Curve Theorem, and adapted for use in digital planes. We define the concept of a \emph{Jordan-segmentatable mask}, which is a binary segmentation whose structure ensures a topological separation of the image domain into two connected components. We analyze segmentation masks through the lens of digital topology and homology theory, extracting a $4$-curve candidate from the mask, verifying its topological validity using Betti numbers. A mask is considered Jordan-segmentatable when this candidate forms a digital 4-curve with $β_0 = β_1 = 1$, or equivalently when its complement splits into exactly two $8$-connected components.
  This framework provides a mathematically rigorous, unsupervised criterion with which to assess the structural coherence of segmentation masks. By combining digital Jordan theory and homological invariants, our approach provides a valuable alternative to standard evaluation metrics, especially in applications where topological correctness must be preserved.

*Frank Mollard,Marcus Becker,Florian Roehrbein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: White-box attack on CV models using SHAP values to generate adversarial examples that reduce model confidence or cause misclassifications while remaining imperceptible to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial attacks can compromise deep learning models by deceiving algorithms while eluding human perception. There's a need for robust attack methods that work even in gradient hiding scenarios where traditional attacks like FGSM may fail.

Method: Proposes a white-box attack leveraging SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to quantify input significance at inference stage. Uses SHAP values to generate adversarial examples that are imperceptible to humans but effective at compromising model performance.

Result: SHAP attacks are more robust than FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign Method) in generating misclassifications, particularly in gradient hiding scenarios where traditional gradient-based attacks may be less effective.

Conclusion: SHAP-based adversarial attacks represent a potent threat to computer vision models, demonstrating superior robustness compared to gradient-based methods like FGSM, especially in challenging scenarios where gradients are hidden or obfuscated.

Abstract: The paper introduces a white-box attack on computer vision models using SHAP values. It demonstrates how adversarial evasion attacks can compromise the performance of deep learning models by reducing output confidence or inducing misclassifications. Such attacks are particularly insidious as they can deceive the perception of an algorithm while eluding human perception due to their imperceptibility to the human eye. The proposed attack leverages SHAP values to quantify the significance of individual inputs to the output at the inference stage. A comparison is drawn between the SHAP attack and the well-known Fast Gradient Sign Method. We find evidence that SHAP attacks are more robust in generating misclassifications particularly in gradient hiding scenarios.

*Peng Chen,Xiaobao Wei,Yi Yang,Naiming Yao,Hui Chen,Feng Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSATalker is a 3D Gaussian Splatting-based framework for realistic, socially-aware talking head generation that supports multi-turn conversations by encoding social relationships into avatar interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing talking head generation methods have limitations: mesh-based 3D methods lack realistic textures, 2D large-model methods are computationally expensive, and current 3DGS methods only handle single speakers while ignoring social relationships in multi-person conversations.

Method: The framework first drives mesh-based 3D facial motion from speech, then binds 3D Gaussians to mesh facets for high-fidelity rendering. A socially-aware module encodes social relationships (blood/non-blood, equal/unequal) into embeddings via learnable queries. Uses a three-stage training paradigm with a custom dataset of speech-mesh-image triplets annotated with social relationships.

Result: Extensive experiments show RSATalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in both realism and social awareness for talking head generation in multi-turn conversations.

Conclusion: RSATalker successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by combining 3DGS efficiency with social relationship modeling, enabling realistic and socially-aware talking head generation for VR social scenarios with multi-turn conversations.

Abstract: Talking head generation is increasingly important in virtual reality (VR), especially for social scenarios involving multi-turn conversation. Existing approaches face notable limitations: mesh-based 3D methods can model dual-person dialogue but lack realistic textures, while large-model-based 2D methods produce natural appearances but incur prohibitive computational costs. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based methods achieve efficient and realistic rendering but remain speaker-only and ignore social relationships. We introduce RSATalker, the first framework that leverages 3DGS for realistic and socially-aware talking head generation with support for multi-turn conversation. Our method first drives mesh-based 3D facial motion from speech, then binds 3D Gaussians to mesh facets to render high-fidelity 2D avatar videos. To capture interpersonal dynamics, we propose a socially-aware module that encodes social relationships, including blood and non-blood as well as equal and unequal, into high-level embeddings through a learnable query mechanism. We design a three-stage training paradigm and construct the RSATalker dataset with speech-mesh-image triplets annotated with social relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSATalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in both realism and social awareness. The code and dataset will be released.

TL;DR: Molmo2 is a new open-source video-language model family that achieves state-of-the-art performance in video grounding tasks like pointing and tracking, using novel datasets collected without proprietary models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The open-source community lacks strong video-language models that don't rely on proprietary model distillation. Current models lack grounding capabilities (pointing/tracking) needed for many applications, and even proprietary models don't have these capabilities.

Method: Created 7 new video datasets and 2 multi-image datasets collected without closed VLMs. Used efficient packing and message-tree encoding, bi-directional attention on vision tokens, and novel token-weight strategy. Developed training recipe for this data.

Result: 8B model outperforms open-weight models on short videos, counting, and captioning; competitive on long videos. Significantly beats Qwen3-VL (35.5 vs 29.6 accuracy on video counting) and surpasses Gemini 3 Pro on some tasks (38.4 vs 20.0 F1 on video pointing, 56.2 vs 41.1 J&F on tracking).

Conclusion: Molmo2 provides open-source foundation for video-language modeling with exceptional grounding capabilities, advancing the field without relying on proprietary model distillation and enabling downstream applications requiring pixel-level grounding.

Abstract: Today's strongest video-language models (VLMs) remain proprietary. The strongest open-weight models either rely on synthetic data from proprietary VLMs, effectively distilling from them, or do not disclose their training data or recipe. As a result, the open-source community lacks the foundations needed to improve on the state-of-the-art video (and image) language models. Crucially, many downstream applications require more than just high-level video understanding; they require grounding -- either by pointing or by tracking in pixels. Even proprietary models lack this capability. We present Molmo2, a new family of VLMs that are state-of-the-art among open-source models and demonstrate exceptional new capabilities in point-driven grounding in single image, multi-image, and video tasks. Our key contribution is a collection of 7 new video datasets and 2 multi-image datasets, including a dataset of highly detailed video captions for pre-training, a free-form video Q&A dataset for fine-tuning, a new object tracking dataset with complex queries, and an innovative new video pointing dataset, all collected without the use of closed VLMs. We also present a training recipe for this data utilizing an efficient packing and message-tree encoding scheme, and show bi-directional attention on vision tokens and a novel token-weight strategy improves performance. Our best-in-class 8B model outperforms others in the class of open weight and data models on short videos, counting, and captioning, and is competitive on long-videos. On video-grounding Molmo2 significantly outperforms existing open-weight models like Qwen3-VL (35.5 vs 29.6 accuracy on video counting) and surpasses proprietary models like Gemini 3 Pro on some tasks (38.4 vs 20.0 F1 on video pointing and 56.2 vs 41.1 J&F on video tracking).

TL;DR: CoMoVi is a co-generative framework that synchronously generates 3D human motions and 2D videos using coupled video diffusion models within a single diffusion loop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies an intrinsic coupling between 3D human motion generation and 2D video generation - 3D motions provide structural prior for plausibility and consistency, while pre-trained video models offer strong generalization capabilities for motions.

Method: 1) Proposes an effective 2D human motion representation that inherits powerful priors from pre-trained VDMs; 2) Designs a dual-branch diffusion model with mutual feature interaction and 3D-2D cross attentions; 3) Curates CoMoVi Dataset with text and motion annotations for diverse human motions.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness in both 3D human motion and video generation tasks, showing successful synchronous generation of coupled 3D motions and 2D videos.

Conclusion: The intrinsic coupling between 3D motion and 2D video generation necessitates their joint generation, and CoMoVi successfully achieves this through a co-generative framework with coupled diffusion models.

Abstract: In this paper, we find that the generation of 3D human motions and 2D human videos is intrinsically coupled. 3D motions provide the structural prior for plausibility and consistency in videos, while pre-trained video models offer strong generalization capabilities for motions, which necessitate coupling their generation processes. Based on this, we present CoMoVi, a co-generative framework that couples two video diffusion models (VDMs) to generate 3D human motions and videos synchronously within a single diffusion denoising loop. To achieve this, we first propose an effective 2D human motion representation that can inherit the powerful prior of pre-trained VDMs. Then, we design a dual-branch diffusion model to couple human motion and video generation process with mutual feature interaction and 3D-2D cross attentions. Moreover, we curate CoMoVi Dataset, a large-scale real-world human video dataset with text and motion annotations, covering diverse and challenging human motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both 3D human motion and video generation tasks.

TL;DR: CURVE is a new multicultural, multilingual video reasoning benchmark with human-generated annotations across 18 global locales, revealing significant performance gaps in current Video-LLMs due to cultural perception challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video understanding benchmarks are biased toward western-centric data and English language, lacking proper evaluation of multicultural and multilingual reasoning capabilities in video models.

Method: Created CURVE benchmark with high-quality human-generated annotations from diverse cultural videos across 18 locales, including complex questions, answers, and multi-step reasoning in native languages. Also developed evidence-based graphs from reasoning traces and an iterative strategy for fine-grained error analysis.

Result: State-of-the-art Video-LLMs perform substantially below human-level accuracy on CURVE, with errors primarily stemming from visual perception of cultural elements rather than reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: CURVE addresses cultural bias in video evaluation and reveals critical limitations in current models' ability to understand visual cultural context, highlighting the need for more culturally-aware video understanding systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video models have shown tremendous progress, particularly in long video understanding. However, current benchmarks predominantly feature western-centric data and English as the dominant language, introducing significant biases in evaluation. To address this, we introduce CURVE (Cultural Understanding and Reasoning in Video Evaluation), a challenging benchmark for multicultural and multilingual video reasoning. CURVE comprises high-quality, entirely human-generated annotations from diverse, region-specific cultural videos across 18 global locales. Unlike prior work that relies on automatic translations, CURVE provides complex questions, answers, and multi-step reasoning steps, all crafted in native languages. Making progress on CURVE requires a deeply situated understanding of visual cultural context. Furthermore, we leverage CURVE's reasoning traces to construct evidence-based graphs and propose a novel iterative strategy using these graphs to identify fine-grained errors in reasoning. Our evaluations reveal that SoTA Video-LLMs struggle significantly, performing substantially below human-level accuracy, with errors primarily stemming from the visual perception of cultural elements. CURVE will be publicly available under https://github.com/google-deepmind/neptune?tab=readme-ov-file\#minerva-cultural

Result: Achieved sub-millimeter precision in digital trait extraction, establishing reliable foundation for automated trait extraction using AI and enabling broader research access to previously physical-only collections.

Conclusion: This work addresses invertebrate under-representation in trait databases and supports AI-driven tools for automated species identification and trait-based research, advancing biodiversity monitoring and conservation.

Abstract: Despite the ecological significance of invertebrates, global trait databases remain heavily biased toward vertebrates and plants, limiting comprehensive ecological analyses of high-diversity groups like ground beetles. Ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) serve as critical bioindicators of ecosystem health, providing valuable insights into biodiversity shifts driven by environmental changes. While the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) maintains an extensive collection of carabid specimens from across the United States, these primarily exist as physical collections, restricting widespread research access and large-scale analysis. To address these gaps, we present a multimodal dataset digitizing over 13,200 NEON carabids from 30 sites spanning the continental US and Hawaii through high-resolution imaging, enabling broader access and computational analysis. The dataset includes digitally measured elytra length and width of each specimen, establishing a foundation for automated trait extraction using AI. Validated against manual measurements, our digital trait extraction achieves sub-millimeter precision, ensuring reliability for ecological and computational studies. By addressing invertebrate under-representation in trait databases, this work supports AI-driven tools for automated species identification and trait-based research, fostering advancements in biodiversity monitoring and conservation.

TL;DR: CLI introduces a dynamic many-to-many bridge between vision and language models, replacing the static bottleneck in current VLMs with adaptive cross-layer injection for better multimodal understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs have a severe visual feature bottleneck with a crude, asymmetric connection that only links vision encoder output to LLM input, limiting comprehensive alignment with hierarchical visual knowledge and compromising integration of local details with global semantics.

Method: Cross-Layer Injection (CLI) framework with two components: Adaptive Multi-Projection (AMP) module harmonizes features from diverse vision layers, and Adaptive Gating Fusion (AGF) mechanism allows LLM to selectively inject relevant visual information based on real-time decoding context.

Result: Extensive experiments on 18 diverse benchmarks show significant performance improvements when CLI is integrated into LLaVA-OneVision and LLaVA-1.5, establishing CLI as a scalable paradigm for deeper multimodal understanding.

Conclusion: CLI unlocks deeper multimodal understanding by granting LLMs on-demand access to the full visual hierarchy through dynamic many-to-many bridging between vision and language modalities.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) create a severe visual feature bottleneck by using a crude, asymmetric connection that links only the output of the vision encoder to the input of the large language model (LLM). This static architecture fundamentally limits the ability of LLMs to achieve comprehensive alignment with hierarchical visual knowledge, compromising their capacity to accurately integrate local details with global semantics into coherent reasoning. To resolve this, we introduce Cross-Layer Injection (CLI), a novel and lightweight framework that forges a dynamic many-to-many bridge between the two modalities. CLI consists of two synergistic, parameter-efficient components: an Adaptive Multi-Projection (AMP) module that harmonizes features from diverse vision layers, and an Adaptive Gating Fusion (AGF) mechanism that empowers the LLM to selectively inject the most relevant visual information based on its real-time decoding context. We validate the effectiveness and versatility of CLI by integrating it into LLaVA-OneVision and LLaVA-1.5. Extensive experiments on 18 diverse benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements, establishing CLI as a scalable paradigm that unlocks deeper multimodal understanding by granting LLMs on-demand access to the full visual hierarchy.

### [68] [Alterbute: Editing Intrinsic Attributes of Objects in Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10714)
*Tal Reiss,Daniel Winter,Matan Cohen,Alex Rav-Acha,Yael Pritch,Ariel Shamir,Yedid Hoshen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Alterbute is a diffusion-based method for editing object intrinsic attributes (color, texture, material, shape) while preserving identity and scene context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either fail to preserve object identity or are too restrictive to allow meaningful intrinsic variations. There's a need for identity-preserving editing of object attributes.

Method: Uses: (1) relaxed training objective conditioning on identity reference, text prompt for target attributes, and background/mask; (2) Visual Named Entities (VNEs) - fine-grained identity categories extracted automatically using vision-language models from large datasets.

Result: Alterbute outperforms existing methods on identity-preserving object intrinsic attribute editing.

Conclusion: The method enables effective editing of object intrinsic attributes while preserving identity and scene context through a novel training approach and VNE-based supervision.

Abstract: We introduce Alterbute, a diffusion-based method for editing an object's intrinsic attributes in an image. We allow changing color, texture, material, and even the shape of an object, while preserving its perceived identity and scene context. Existing approaches either rely on unsupervised priors that often fail to preserve identity or use overly restrictive supervision that prevents meaningful intrinsic variations. Our method relies on: (i) a relaxed training objective that allows the model to change both intrinsic and extrinsic attributes conditioned on an identity reference image, a textual prompt describing the target intrinsic attributes, and a background image and object mask defining the extrinsic context. At inference, we restrict extrinsic changes by reusing the original background and object mask, thereby ensuring that only the desired intrinsic attributes are altered; (ii) Visual Named Entities (VNEs) - fine-grained visual identity categories (e.g., ''Porsche 911 Carrera'') that group objects sharing identity-defining features while allowing variation in intrinsic attributes. We use a vision-language model to automatically extract VNE labels and intrinsic attribute descriptions from a large public image dataset, enabling scalable, identity-preserving supervision. Alterbute outperforms existing methods on identity-preserving object intrinsic attribute editing.

*Xuweiyi Chen,Wentao Zhou,Zezhou Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WildRayZer is a self-supervised framework for novel view synthesis in dynamic scenes that uses analysis-by-synthesis to separate static background from moving objects, enabling better performance than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic environments with moving cameras and objects break multi-view consistency assumptions in static NVS models, causing ghosting artifacts, hallucinated geometry, and unstable pose estimation.

Method: Uses analysis-by-synthesis: camera-only static renderer explains rigid structure, residuals reveal transient regions. Constructs pseudo motion masks, distills motion estimator, masks input tokens and gates loss gradients to focus supervision on cross-view background completion.

Result: Outperforms optimization-based and feed-forward baselines in both transient-region removal and full-frame NVS quality with a single feed-forward pass. Also introduces Dynamic RealEstate10K dataset for training and evaluation.

Conclusion: WildRayZer effectively addresses dynamic NVS challenges through self-supervised motion estimation and selective supervision, achieving state-of-the-art performance on real-world dynamic scenes.

Abstract: We present WildRayZer, a self-supervised framework for novel view synthesis (NVS) in dynamic environments where both the camera and objects move. Dynamic content breaks the multi-view consistency that static NVS models rely on, leading to ghosting, hallucinated geometry, and unstable pose estimation. WildRayZer addresses this by performing an analysis-by-synthesis test: a camera-only static renderer explains rigid structure, and its residuals reveal transient regions. From these residuals, we construct pseudo motion masks, distill a motion estimator, and use it to mask input tokens and gate loss gradients so supervision focuses on cross-view background completion. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we curate Dynamic RealEstate10K (D-RE10K), a real-world dataset of 15K casually captured dynamic sequences, and D-RE10K-iPhone, a paired transient and clean benchmark for sparse-view transient-aware NVS. Experiments show that WildRayZer consistently outperforms optimization-based and feed-forward baselines in both transient-region removal and full-frame NVS quality with a single feed-forward pass.

### [70] [Formal Safety Guarantees for Autonomous Vehicles using Barrier Certificates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09740)
*Oumaima Barhoumi,Mohamed H Zaki,Sofiène Tahar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A formally verified safety framework for autonomous vehicles that combines Barrier Certificates with Time-to-Collision metrics, using SMT solvers for verification and adaptive control for real-time safety compliance, achieving up to 40% reduction in unsafe interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern AI-driven autonomous vehicles lack interpretability and rigorous safety guarantees, especially in dynamic mixed-traffic environments with human-driven vehicles that introduce uncertainty and safety challenges.

Method: Integrates Barrier Certificates with interpretable traffic conflict metrics (Time-to-Collision), uses Satisfiability Modulo Theories solvers for formal verification of safety conditions, and implements adaptive control mechanisms for real-time constraint compliance.

Result: Evaluation on real-world highway datasets shows significant safety improvements: up to 40% fewer events where TTC falls below 3 seconds threshold, and complete elimination of conflicts in some lanes.

Conclusion: The approach provides both interpretable and provable safety guarantees, demonstrating a practical and scalable strategy for safe autonomous driving that addresses the black-box nature of current AI systems.

Abstract: Modern AI technologies enable autonomous vehicles to perceive complex scenes, predict human behavior, and make real-time driving decisions. However, these data-driven components often operate as black boxes, lacking interpretability and rigorous safety guarantees. Autonomous vehicles operate in dynamic, mixed-traffic environments where interactions with human-driven vehicles introduce uncertainty and safety challenges. This work develops a formally verified safety framework for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) that integrates Barrier Certificates (BCs) with interpretable traffic conflict metrics, specifically Time-to-Collision (TTC) as a spatio-temporal safety metric. Safety conditions are verified using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers, and an adaptive control mechanism ensures vehicles comply with these constraints in real time. Evaluation on real-world highway datasets shows a significant reduction in unsafe interactions, with up to 40\% fewer events where TTC falls below a 3 seconds threshold, and complete elimination of conflicts in some lanes. This approach provides both interpretable and provable safety guarantees, demonstrating a practical and scalable strategy for safe autonomous driving.

This paper presents Mobirobot, a socially assistive robot developed to support mobilisation in children recovering from trauma, fractures, or depressive disorders through personalised exercise programmes.
  Methods: An agile, human-centred development approach guided the iterative design of Mobirobot. Multidisciplinary clinical teams and end users were involved throughout the co-development process, which focused on early integration into real-world paediatric surgical and psychiatric settings. The robot, based on the NAO platform, features a simple setup, adaptable exercise routines with interactive guidance, motivational dialogue, and a graphical user interface (GUI) for monitoring and no-code system feedback.
  Results: Deployment in hospital environments enabled the identification of key design requirements and usability constraints. Stakeholder feedback led to refinements in interaction design, movement capabilities, and technical configuration. A feasibility study is currently underway to assess acceptance, usability, and perceived therapeutic benefit, with data collection including questionnaires, behavioural observations, and staff-patient interviews.
  Discussion: Mobirobot demonstrates how multiprofessional, stakeholder-led development can yield a socially assistive system suited for dynamic inpatient settings. Early-stage findings underscore the importance of contextual integration, robustness, and minimal-intrusion design. While challenges such as sensor limitations and patient recruitment remain, the platform offers a promising foundation for further research and clinical application.

### [72] [How Human Motion Prediction Quality Shapes Social Robot Navigation Performance in Constrained Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09856)
*Andrew Stratton,Phani Teja Singamaneni,Pranav Goyal,Rachid Alami,Christoforos Mavrogiannis*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Study shows human motion prediction quality impacts robot navigation, but standard metrics like average displacement error don't reliably predict performance or human impressions in constrained environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable safer, more efficient robot navigation in dynamic human environments (warehouses, hospitals, homes) by understanding how human motion prediction affects robot performance and human experience.

Method: Designed scenario with robot navigating among two humans in constrained workspace; conducted user study (N=80) with two robot platforms across two sites in different world regions.

Result: 1) Average displacement error not reliable predictor; 2) Human cooperation assumption breaks down in constrained spaces; 3) Robot efficiency often reduces human efficiency and comfort.

Conclusion: Need better metrics beyond displacement error, reconsider human cooperation assumptions, and balance robot efficiency with human experience in constrained navigation scenarios.

Abstract: Motivated by the vision of integrating mobile robots closer to humans in warehouses, hospitals, manufacturing plants, and the home, we focus on robot navigation in dynamic and spatially constrained environments. Ensuring human safety, comfort, and efficiency in such settings requires that robots are endowed with a model of how humans move around them. Human motion prediction around robots is especially challenging due to the stochasticity of human behavior, differences in user preferences, and data scarcity. In this work, we perform a methodical investigation of the effects of human motion prediction quality on robot navigation performance, as well as human productivity and impressions. We design a scenario involving robot navigation among two human subjects in a constrained workspace and instantiate it in a user study ($N=80$) involving two different robot platforms, conducted across two sites from different world regions. Key findings include evidence that: 1) the widely adopted average displacement error is not a reliable predictor of robot navigation performance and human impressions; 2) the common assumption of human cooperation breaks down in constrained environments, with users often not reciprocating robot cooperation, and causing performance degradations; 3) more efficient robot navigation often comes at the expense of human efficiency and comfort.

Result: Experiments in dynamic and occluded scenes show that SyncTwin improves grasp accuracy and motion safety compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: SyncTwin demonstrates the effectiveness of digital-twin synchronization for real-world robotic execution, providing a robust framework for safe grasping in challenging environments.

Abstract: Accurate and safe grasping under dynamic and visually occluded conditions remains a core challenge in real-world robotic manipulation. We present SyncTwin, a digital twin framework that unifies fast 3D scene reconstruction and real-to-sim synchronization for robust and safety-aware grasping in such environments. In the offline stage, we employ VGGT to rapidly reconstruct object-level 3D assets from RGB images, forming a reusable geometry library for simulation. During execution, SyncTwin continuously synchronizes the digital twin by tracking real-world object states via point cloud segmentation updates and aligning them through colored-ICP registration. The updated twin enables motion planners to compute collision-free and dynamically feasible trajectories in simulation, which are safely executed on the real robot through a closed real-to-sim-to-real loop. Experiments in dynamic and occluded scenes show that SyncTwin improves grasp accuracy and motion safety, demonstrating the effectiveness of digital-twin synchronization for real-world robotic execution.

TL;DR: UMI-FT is a handheld data-collection platform with finger-mounted force/torque sensors that enables learning compliant manipulation policies from demonstrations, outperforming baselines on contact-rich tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Commercial force/torque sensors are expensive, bulky, and fragile, limiting large-scale force-aware policy learning for manipulation tasks that require careful force modulation.

Method: Developed UMI-FT platform with compact six-axis F/T sensors on each finger to collect multimodal data (wrench measurements, RGB, depth, pose), then trained adaptive compliance policies predicting position targets, grasp force, and stiffness for standard compliance controllers.

Result: UMI-FT policies reliably regulate external contact forces and internal grasp forces on three contact-rich tasks (whiteboard wiping, skewering zucchini, lightbulb insertion), outperforming baselines lacking compliance or force sensing.

Conclusion: UMI-FT provides a scalable path to learning compliant manipulation from in-the-wild demonstrations, with open-source hardware and software to facilitate broader adoption.

Abstract: Many manipulation tasks require careful force modulation. With insufficient force the task may fail, while excessive force could cause damage. The high cost, bulky size and fragility of commercial force/torque (F/T) sensors have limited large-scale, force-aware policy learning. We introduce UMI-FT, a handheld data-collection platform that mounts compact, six-axis force/torque sensors on each finger, enabling finger-level wrench measurements alongside RGB, depth, and pose. Using the multimodal data collected from this device, we train an adaptive compliance policy that predicts position targets, grasp force, and stiffness for execution on standard compliance controllers. In evaluations on three contact-rich, force-sensitive tasks (whiteboard wiping, skewering zucchini, and lightbulb insertion), UMI-FT enables policies that reliably regulate external contact forces and internal grasp forces, outperforming baselines that lack compliance or force sensing. UMI-FT offers a scalable path to learning compliant manipulation from in-the-wild demonstrations. We open-source the hardware and software to facilitate broader adoption at:https://umi-ft.github.io/.

*Xintong Zhang,Junfeng Chen,Yuxiao Zhu,Bing Luo,Meng Guo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CoCoPlan: A unified framework that co-optimizes collaborative task planning and team-wise intermittent communication for multi-robot systems operating with limited communication range.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-robot systems need coordination but face practical limitations where full-time communication is unavailable and interactions are constrained to close-range exchanges. Existing methods don't effectively adapt to dynamic spatio-temporal task distributions under limited communication, leading to suboptimal coordination.

Method: CoCoPlan integrates: 1) a branch-and-bound architecture jointly encoding task assignments and communication events, 2) an adaptive objective function balancing task efficiency against communication latency, and 3) a communication event optimization module that strategically determines when, where and how global connectivity should be re-established.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods with 22.4% higher task completion rate, 58.6% reduction in communication overhead, and improved scalability supporting up to 100 robots in dynamic environments. Validated in hardware experiments including complex 2D office environments and large-scale 3D disaster-response scenarios.

Conclusion: CoCoPlan provides an effective solution for multi-robot coordination under limited communication by jointly optimizing task planning and intermittent communication, addressing a critical gap in existing approaches for dynamic environments.

Abstract: Multi-robot systems can greatly enhance efficiency through coordination and collaboration, yet in practice, full-time communication is rarely available and interactions are constrained to close-range exchanges. Existing methods either maintain all-time connectivity, rely on fixed schedules, or adopt pairwise protocols, but none adapt effectively to dynamic spatio-temporal task distributions under limited communication, resulting in suboptimal coordination. To address this gap, we propose CoCoPlan, a unified framework that co-optimizes collaborative task planning and team-wise intermittent communication. Our approach integrates a branch-and-bound architecture that jointly encodes task assignments and communication events, an adaptive objective function that balances task efficiency against communication latency, and a communication event optimization module that strategically determines when, where and how the global connectivity should be re-established. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving a 22.4% higher task completion rate, reducing communication overhead by 58.6%, and improving the scalability by supporting up to 100 robots in dynamic environments.

Motivation: Mobile 3D printing on unstructured terrain faces conflict between platform mobility and deposition precision - gantry systems lack mobility while mobile platforms struggle with print quality on uneven ground.

Method: Framework integrates AI-driven disturbance prediction with multi-modal sensor fusion (IMU, vision, depth) and hierarchical hardware control (three-layer architecture: path planning, predictive chassis-manipulator coordination, precision hardware execution).

Result: Outdoor experiments on terrain with slopes and surface irregularities demonstrate sub-centimeter printing accuracy while maintaining full platform mobility.

Conclusion: AI-hardware integration establishes practical foundation for autonomous construction in unstructured environments through closed-loop perception-learning-actuation system.

Abstract: Mobile 3D printing on unstructured terrain remains challenging due to the conflict between platform mobility and deposition precision. Existing gantry-based systems achieve high accuracy but lack mobility, while mobile platforms struggle to maintain print quality on uneven ground. We present a framework that tightly integrates AI-driven disturbance prediction with multi-modal sensor fusion and hierarchical hardware control, forming a closed-loop perception-learning-actuation system. The AI module learns terrain-to-perturbation mappings from IMU, vision, and depth sensors, enabling proactive compensation rather than reactive correction. This intelligence is embedded into a three-layer control architecture: path planning, predictive chassis-manipulator coordination, and precision hardware execution. Through outdoor experiments on terrain with slopes and surface irregularities, we demonstrate sub-centimeter printing accuracy while maintaining full platform mobility. This AI-hardware integration establishes a practical foundation for autonomous construction in unstructured environments.

Result: Framework computes and visualizes deploy and fold motions across diverse rigid foldable structures while eliminating tedious and error-prone constraint calculations.

Conclusion: Automated approach provides unified kinematic analysis for arbitrary rigid foldable structures through systematic constraint matrix generation.

Abstract: Origami-inspired structures with rigid panels now span thick, kirigami, and multi-sheet realizations, making unified kinematic analysis essential. Yet a general method that consolidates their loop constraints has been lacking. We present an automated approach that generates the Pfaffian constraint matrix for arbitrary rigid foldable structures (RFS). From a minimally extended data schema, the tool constructs the facet-hinge graph, extracts a minimum cycle basis that captures all constraints, and assembles a velocity-level constraint matrix via screw theory that encodes coupled rotation and translation loop closure. The framework computes and visualizes deploy and fold motions across diverse RFS while eliminating tedious and error-prone constraint calculations.

Motivation: Reactive controllers like CBFs only use current obstacle states, risking future collisions in complex dynamic environments with moving obstacles.

Method: Use Gaussian processes to learn barrier functions online from neural network-generated multimodal motion predictions, then feed into quadratic programs with modulated CBFs (MCBFs) and autonomous parameter tuning.

Result: Outperforms baselines in simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating superior safety and efficiency in crowded dynamic environments.

Conclusion: Proposed framework successfully addresses safe navigation in dynamic environments through prediction-to-barrier online learning and adaptive MCBF parameter tuning.

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of safe and efficient mobile robot navigation in complex dynamic environments with concave moving obstacles. Reactive safe controllers like Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) design obstacle avoidance strategies based only on the current states of the obstacles, risking future collisions. To alleviate this problem, we use Gaussian processes to learn barrier functions online from multimodal motion predictions of obstacles generated by neural networks trained with energy-based learning. The learned barrier functions are then fed into quadratic programs using modulated CBFs (MCBFs), a local-minimum-free version of CBFs, to achieve safe and efficient navigation. The proposed framework makes two key contributions. First, it develops a prediction-to-barrier function online learning pipeline. Second, it introduces an autonomous parameter tuning algorithm that adapts MCBFs to deforming, prediction-based barrier functions. The framework is evaluated in both simulations and real-world experiments, consistently outperforming baselines and demonstrating superior safety and efficiency in crowded dynamic environments.

TL;DR: Simulation study evaluates 6 tactile sensor configurations on robotic hands for reinforcement learning performance, identifying one consistently best layout across different setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tactile sensors improve robotic hand grasp stability, but current designs use vastly different sensor densities and layouts without systematic evaluation of their impact on learning performance.

Method: Used simulations to evaluate 6 different tactile sensor configurations with varying densities and layouts. Employed a two-setup system for robust results independent of specific physics simulator, robotic hand model, or machine learning algorithm.

Result: Found both setup-specific and generalized effects across the 6 sensorized simulations. Identified one configuration that consistently yielded the best performance across both experimental setups.

Conclusion: The results provide guidance for future robotic hand designs, including prostheses, by identifying optimal tactile sensor configurations that improve reinforcement learning performance.

Abstract: Tactile sensors are breaking into the field of robotics to provide direct information related to contact surfaces, including contact events, slip events and even texture identification. These events are especially important for robotic hand designs, including prosthetics, as they can greatly improve grasp stability. Most presently published robotic hand designs, however, implement them in vastly different densities and layouts on the hand surface, often reserving the majority of the available space. We used simulations to evaluate 6 different tactile sensor configurations with different densities and layouts, based on their impact on reinforcement learning. Our two-setup system allows for robust results that are not dependent on the use of a given physics simulator, robotic hand model or machine learning algorithm. Our results show setup-specific, as well as generalized effects across the 6 sensorized simulations, and we identify one configuration as consistently yielding the best performance across both setups. These results could help future research aimed at robotic hand designs, including prostheses.

TL;DR: CHORAL: A semantic-aware framework for coordinating heterogeneous robot teams in complex environments by integrating scene understanding with capability-aware routing and task assignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for robot team coordination often assume homogeneous robots or focus on discrete task compatibility rather than continuous routing, failing to fully integrate scene understanding into routing decisions and limiting adaptation to environment and leveraging of each robot's strengths.

Method: Integrated semantic-aware framework that: 1) builds metric-semantic map from reconnaissance flight using open-vocabulary vision models, 2) identifies regions requiring closer inspection and capability-aware paths for each platform, 3) incorporates these into heterogeneous vehicle routing formulation that jointly assigns inspection tasks and computes robot trajectories.

Result: Experiments in simulation and real inspection mission with three robotic platforms demonstrate effectiveness in planning safer and more efficient routes by explicitly accounting for each platform's navigation capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed CHORAL framework successfully integrates semantic scene understanding with heterogeneous robot coordination, enabling more effective monitoring of complex environments, and is released as open source to support reproducibility and deployment of diverse robot teams.

Abstract: Monitoring large, unknown, and complex environments with autonomous robots poses significant navigation challenges, where deploying teams of heterogeneous robots with complementary capabilities can substantially improve both mission performance and feasibility. However, effectively modeling how different robotic platforms interact with the environment requires rich, semantic scene understanding. Despite this, existing approaches often assume homogeneous robot teams or focus on discrete task compatibility rather than continuous routing. Consequently, scene understanding is not fully integrated into routing decisions, limiting their ability to adapt to the environment and to leverage each robot's strengths. In this paper, we propose an integrated semantic-aware framework for coordinating heterogeneous robots. Starting from a reconnaissance flight, we build a metric-semantic map using open-vocabulary vision models and use it to identify regions requiring closer inspection and capability-aware paths for each platform to reach them. These are then incorporated into a heterogeneous vehicle routing formulation that jointly assigns inspection tasks and computes robot trajectories. Experiments in simulation and in a real inspection mission with three robotic platforms demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in planning safer and more efficient routes by explicitly accounting for each platform's navigation capabilities. We release our framework, CHORAL, as open source to support reproducibility and deployment of diverse robot teams.

TL;DR: FastStair: A planner-guided RL framework for humanoid robots to achieve fast, stable stair ascent by combining model-based foothold planning with multi-stage learning and LoRA integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid robots struggle with stair climbing due to conflicting requirements of agility and stability. Model-free RL produces unsafe behaviors on stairs, while model-based planners are too conservative and slow. Need a solution that combines strengths of both approaches.

Method: Multi-stage learning framework integrating parallel model-based foothold planner into RL training loop. First pretrains safety-focused base policy, then fine-tunes into speed-specialized experts, and finally integrates them via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for smooth operation across speed ranges.

Result: Deployed on Oli humanoid robot, achieving stable stair ascent up to 1.65 m/s, traversing 33-step spiral staircase (17cm rise per step) in 12 seconds. Won Canton Tower Robot Run Up Competition.

Conclusion: FastStair successfully reconciles model-free RL's agility with model-based planning's stability, enabling robust high-speed stair ascent for humanoid robots through planner-guided multi-stage learning and LoRA integration.

Abstract: Running up stairs is effortless for humans but remains extremely challenging for humanoid robots due to the simultaneous requirements of high agility and strict stability. Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) can generate dynamic locomotion, yet implicit stability rewards and heavy reliance on task-specific reward shaping tend to result in unsafe behaviors, especially on stairs; conversely, model-based foothold planners encode contact feasibility and stability structure, but enforcing their hard constraints often induces conservative motion that limits speed. We present FastStair, a planner-guided, multi-stage learning framework that reconciles these complementary strengths to achieve fast and stable stair ascent. FastStair integrates a parallel model-based foothold planner into the RL training loop to bias exploration toward dynamically feasible contacts and to pretrain a safety-focused base policy. To mitigate planner-induced conservatism and the discrepancy between low- and high-speed action distributions, the base policy was fine-tuned into speed-specialized experts and then integrated via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable smooth operation across the full commanded-speed range. We deploy the resulting controller on the Oli humanoid robot, achieving stable stair ascent at commanded speeds up to 1.65 m/s and traversing a 33-step spiral staircase (17 cm rise per step) in 12 s, demonstrating robust high-speed performance on long staircases. Notably, the proposed approach served as the champion solution in the Canton Tower Robot Run Up Competition.

TL;DR: BRSL framework enables online symbolic learning with uncertainty quantification for digital twins, combining interpretability of symbolic methods with Bayesian uncertainty handling and real-time adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital twins need models with high accuracy, interpretability, and online adaptation, but existing methods can't meet all requirements simultaneously - Bayesian methods lack interpretability while symbolic methods can't update in real-time.

Method: Proposes Bayesian Regression-based Symbolic Learning (BRSL) framework that formulates online symbolic discovery as probabilistic state-space model with sparse horseshoe priors, enabling simultaneous system identification and uncertainty quantification with online recursive algorithm and forgetting factor.

Result: Framework achieves interpretable, probabilistic prediction and online learning with established recursive conditions for posterior well-posedness, real-time data utility monitoring, and convergence analysis under persistent excitation conditions.

Conclusion: BRSL successfully bridges the gap between interpretable symbolic methods and Bayesian uncertainty quantification, enabling digital twins to have models that are simultaneously accurate, interpretable, and adaptive in real-time.

Abstract: Digital twins (DTs), serving as the core enablers for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance of complex cyber-physical systems, impose critical requirements on their virtual models: high predictive accuracy, strong interpretability, and online adaptive capability. However, existing techniques struggle to meet these demands simultaneously: Bayesian methods excel in uncertainty quantification but lack model interpretability, while interpretable symbolic identification methods (e.g., SINDy) are constrained by their offline, batch-processing nature, which make real-time updates challenging. To bridge this semantic and computational gap, this paper proposes a novel Bayesian Regression-based Symbolic Learning (BRSL) framework. The framework formulates online symbolic discovery as a unified probabilistic state-space model. By incorporating sparse horseshoe priors, model selection is transformed into a Bayesian inference task, enabling simultaneous system identification and uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, we derive an online recursive algorithm with a forgetting factor and establish precise recursive conditions that guarantee the well-posedness of the posterior distribution. These conditions also function as real-time monitors for data utility, enhancing algorithmic robustness. Additionally, a rigorous convergence analysis is provided, demonstrating the convergence of parameter estimates under persistent excitation conditions. Case studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in achieving interpretable, probabilistic prediction and online learning.

### [83] [AI Survival Stories: a Taxonomic Analysis of AI Existential Risk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09765)
*Herman Cappelen,Simon Goldstein,John Hawthorne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper develops a framework for analyzing AI existential risk through a two-premise argument (AI becomes extremely powerful, then destroys humanity) and creates a taxonomy of survival scenarios where one premise fails.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a structured framework for analyzing the existential risk debate around AI systems that has emerged since ChatGPT's release, moving beyond vague discussions to systematic analysis.

Method: Develops a two-premise argument framework: (1) AI systems become extremely powerful, (2) If extremely powerful, they destroy humanity. Constructs taxonomy of survival stories where each story represents one premise failing, analyzes challenges for each story, and connects them to different policy responses.

Result: Creates a taxonomy of four survival scenarios: scientific barriers prevent powerful AI, humanity bans AI research, powerful AI's goals prevent destruction, or detection/disabling systems prevent destruction. Each faces different challenges and motivates different policy responses.

Conclusion: The framework enables systematic analysis of AI existential risk, connects survival scenarios to specific policy responses, and allows for rough probability estimates of AI-caused human extinction (P(doom)), providing a more structured approach to the AI risk debate.

Abstract: Since the release of ChatGPT, there has been a lot of debate about whether AI systems pose an existential risk to humanity. This paper develops a general framework for thinking about the existential risk of AI systems. We analyze a two premise argument that AI systems pose a threat to humanity. Premise one: AI systems will become extremely powerful. Premise two: if AI systems become extremely powerful, they will destroy humanity. We use these two premises to construct a taxonomy of survival stories, in which humanity survives into the far future. In each survival story, one of the two premises fails. Either scientific barriers prevent AI systems from becoming extremely powerful; or humanity bans research into AI systems, thereby preventing them from becoming extremely powerful; or extremely powerful AI systems do not destroy humanity, because their goals prevent them from doing so; or extremely powerful AI systems do not destroy humanity, because we can reliably detect and disable systems that have the goal of doing so. We argue that different survival stories face different challenges. We also argue that different survival stories motivate different responses to the threats from AI. Finally, we use our taxonomy to produce rough estimates of P(doom), the probability that humanity will be destroyed by AI.

*Chen Chen,Jiawei Shao,Dakuan Lu,Haoyi Hu,Xiangcheng Liu,Hantao Yao,Wu Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GUI-Eyes: RL framework for active visual perception in GUI tasks using strategic tool invocation and two-stage reasoning to improve data efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI automation methods rely on static, one-shot visual inputs and passive perception, lacking adaptive decision-making about when, whether, and how to observe interfaces.

Method: Two-stage reasoning process with progressive perception strategy (coarse exploration + fine-grained grounding), two-level policy coordination, and spatially continuous reward function integrating location proximity and region overlap.

Result: Achieves 44.8% grounding accuracy on ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark using only 3k labeled samples, significantly outperforming supervised and RL-based baselines.

Conclusion: Tool-aware active perception enabled by staged policy reasoning and fine-grained reward feedback is critical for building robust and data-efficient GUI agents.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL) have driven progress in GUI automation. However, most existing methods rely on static, one-shot visual inputs and passive perception, lacking the ability to adaptively determine when, whether, and how to observe the interface. We present GUI-Eyes, a reinforcement learning framework for active visual perception in GUI tasks. To acquire more informative observations, the agent learns to make strategic decisions on both whether and how to invoke visual tools, such as cropping or zooming, within a two-stage reasoning process. To support this behavior, we introduce a progressive perception strategy that decomposes decision-making into coarse exploration and fine-grained grounding, coordinated by a two-level policy. In addition, we design a spatially continuous reward function tailored to tool usage, which integrates both location proximity and region overlap to provide dense supervision and alleviate the reward sparsity common in GUI environments. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, GUI-Eyes-3B achieves 44.8% grounding accuracy using only 3k labeled samples, significantly outperforming both supervised and RL-based baselines. These results highlight that tool-aware active perception, enabled by staged policy reasoning and fine-grained reward feedback, is critical for building robust and data-efficient GUI agents.

### [85] [PCN-Rec: Agentic Proof-Carrying Negotiation for Reliable Governance-Constrained Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09771)
*Aradhya Dixit,Shreem Dixit*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PCN-Rec is a proof-carrying negotiation pipeline that separates LLM reasoning from deterministic constraint enforcement to reliably satisfy governance requirements in recommendations while maintaining relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern LLM-based recommenders can generate compelling ranked lists but struggle to reliably satisfy governance constraints like minimum long-tail exposure or diversity requirements, creating a need for systems that can enforce these constraints while maintaining recommendation quality.

Method: A proof-carrying negotiation pipeline with: 1) base recommender produces candidate window, 2) two agents negotiate (User Advocate for relevance, Policy Agent for constraints), 3) mediator LLM synthesizes top-N slate with structured certificate, 4) deterministic verifier checks constraints, 5) if verification fails, constrained-greedy repair produces compliant slate for re-verification.

Result: On MovieLens-100K with governance constraints, PCN-Rec achieves 98.55% pass rate on feasible users (n=551, W=80) vs. one-shot single-LLM baseline, while preserving utility with only 0.021 absolute drop in NDCG@10 (0.403 vs. 0.424), with statistically significant differences (p<0.05).

Conclusion: PCN-Rec successfully separates natural-language reasoning from deterministic enforcement, providing reliable constraint satisfaction with auditable traces while maintaining recommendation quality, addressing a key limitation of current LLM-based recommenders.

Abstract: Modern LLM-based recommenders can generate compelling ranked lists, but they struggle to reliably satisfy governance constraints such as minimum long-tail exposure or diversity requirements. We present PCN-Rec, a proof-carrying negotiation pipeline that separates natural-language reasoning from deterministic enforcement. A base recommender (MF/CF) produces a candidate window of size W, which is negotiated by two agents: a User Advocate optimizing relevance and a Policy Agent enforcing constraints. A mediator LLM synthesizes a top-N slate together with a structured certificate (JSON) describing the claimed constraint satisfaction. A deterministic verifier recomputes all constraints from the slate and accepts only verifier-checked certificates; if verification fails, a deterministic constrained-greedy repair produces a compliant slate for re-verification, yielding an auditable trace. On MovieLens-100K with governance constraints, PCN-Rec achieves a 98.55% pass rate on feasible users (n = 551, W = 80) versus a one-shot single-LLM baseline without verification/repair, while preserving utility with only a 0.021 absolute drop in NDCG@10 (0.403 vs. 0.424); differences are statistically significant (p < 0.05).

### [86] [Antisocial behavior towards large language model users: experimental evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09772)
*Paweł Niszczota,Cassandra Grützner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: People punish peers who use LLMs for tasks, destroying 36% of their earnings, with punishment increasing with actual LLM use. Self-reported "no use" is punished more than actual no use, revealing a credibility gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether negative attitudes toward AI users translate into costly punitive actions, and to examine the social costs of LLM efficiency gains.

Method: Two-phase online experiment where participants could spend their own money to reduce earnings of peers who completed a real-effort task with or without LLM support (N=491 Phase II participants).

Result: Participants destroyed 36% of earnings from those who exclusively used LLMs, with punishment increasing monotonically with actual LLM use. A credibility gap emerged: self-reported null use was punished more than actual null use, while at high use levels, actual reliance was punished more than self-reported reliance.

Conclusion: LLM efficiency gains come at the cost of social sanctions, with people willing to incur personal costs to punish LLM users, revealing significant social costs of AI adoption.

Abstract: The rapid spread of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about the social reactions they provoke. Prior research documents negative attitudes toward AI users, but it remains unclear whether such disapproval translates into costly action. We address this question in a two-phase online experiment (N = 491 Phase II participants; Phase I provided targets) where participants could spend part of their own endowment to reduce the earnings of peers who had previously completed a real-effort task with or without LLM support. On average, participants destroyed 36% of the earnings of those who relied exclusively on the model, with punishment increasing monotonically with actual LLM use. Disclosure about LLM use created a credibility gap: self-reported null use was punished more harshly than actual null use, suggesting that declarations of "no use" are treated with suspicion. Conversely, at high levels of use, actual reliance on the model was punished more strongly than self-reported reliance. Taken together, these findings provide the first behavioral evidence that the efficiency gains of LLMs come at the cost of social sanctions.

### [87] [Improving Chain-of-Thought for Logical Reasoning via Attention-Aware Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09805)
*Nguyen Minh Phuong,Dang Huu Tien,Naoya Inoue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AAI is a non-interactive, end-to-end framework that improves LLM logical reasoning by identifying and reweighting attention heads with logical patterns, requiring no external resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current logical reasoning approaches for LLMs rely on complex interactive frameworks or external resources, which introduce overhead and limit scalability. The authors seek a non-interactive, end-to-end solution that enables reasoning to emerge within the model itself.

Method: Attention-Aware Intervention (AAI) - an inference-time intervention method that identifies attention heads with logical reasoning patterns through few-shot prompting, then reweights attention scores across selected heads to steer reasoning.

Result: AAI enhances logical reasoning performance across diverse benchmarks and model architectures while incurring negligible additional computational overhead.

Conclusion: AAI provides an efficient, non-interactive approach to improve LLM logical reasoning by modulating attention patterns, offering better generalization and analyzability without external dependencies.

Abstract: Modern logical reasoning with LLMs primarily relies on employing complex interactive frameworks that decompose the reasoning process into subtasks solved through carefully designed prompts or requiring external resources (e.g., symbolic solvers) to exploit their strong logical structures. While interactive approaches introduce additional overhead, hybrid approaches depend on external components, which limit their scalability. A non-interactive, end-to-end framework enables reasoning to emerge within the model itself -- improving generalization while preserving analyzability without any external resources. In this work, we introduce a non-interactive, end-to-end framework for reasoning tasks. We show that introducing structural information into the few-shot prompt activates a subset of attention heads that patterns aligned with logical reasoning operators. Building on this insight, we propose Attention-Aware Intervention (AAI), an inference-time intervention method that reweights attention scores across selected heads identified by their logical patterns. AAI offers an efficient way to steer the model's reasoning toward leveraging prior knowledge through attention modulation. Extensive experiments show that AAI enhances logical reasoning performance across diverse benchmarks and model architectures, while incurring negligible additional computational overhead.

### [88] [Thinking Long, but Short: Stable Sequential Test-Time Scaling for Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09855)
*Michael R. Metel,Yufei Cui,Boxing Chen,Prasanna Parthasarathi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Min-Seek is a novel sequential test-time scaling method that stabilizes reasoning accuracy across extended thought sequences without fine-tuning, using efficient KV cache management to enable reasoning beyond context limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sequential test-time scaling methods suffer from accuracy degradation and instability as reasoning length increases, requiring fine-tuning and limiting practical application.

Method: Min-Seek uses a custom KV cache that stores keys without position embeddings, dynamically encoding them contiguously before each new thought, keeping only one additional induced thought's KV pairs in cache for efficiency.

Result: Significantly improves model accuracy across various reasoning tasks, stabilizes accuracy over wide thought ranges, eliminates need for reasoning length fine-tuning, and enables reasoning beyond maximum context length with linear computational complexity.

Conclusion: Min-Seek provides an efficient, stable sequential scaling method that overcomes limitations of current approaches, enabling reliable extended reasoning without fine-tuning requirements.

Abstract: Sequential test-time scaling is a promising training-free method to improve large reasoning model accuracy, but as currently implemented, significant limitations have been observed. Inducing models to think for longer can increase their accuracy, but as the length of reasoning is further extended, it has also been shown to result in accuracy degradation and model instability. This work presents a novel sequential test-time scaling method, Min-Seek, which improves model accuracy significantly over a wide range of induced thoughts, stabilizing the accuracy of sequential scaling, and removing the need for reasoning length fine-tuning. Beyond improving model accuracy over a variety of reasoning tasks, our method is inherently efficient, as only the KV pairs of one additional induced thought are kept in the KV cache during reasoning. With a custom KV cache which stores keys without position embeddings, by dynamically encoding them contiguously before each new generated thought, our method can continue to reason well beyond a model's maximum context length, and under mild conditions has linear computational complexity.

*Andrea Ferrario,Rasita Vinay,Matteo Casserini,Alessandro Facchini*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Scoping review maps ethically-oriented research on anthropomorphising LLM-based conversational agents, analyzing definitions, ethical concerns/opportunities, and methodological approaches, finding conceptual convergence but operational divergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anthropomorphisation of LLM-based conversational agents has become increasingly salient with ethical concerns (deception, overreliance) and potential benefits (autonomy, well-being), but literature remains fragmented across domains with varying definitions and normative evaluations.

Method: Scoping review across five databases and three preprint repositories, synthesizing conceptual foundations, ethical challenges/opportunities, and methodological approaches in ethically-oriented work on anthropomorphising LLM-based CAs.

Result: Found convergence on attribution-based definitions but substantial divergence in operationalization, predominantly risk-forward normative framing, and limited empirical work linking interaction effects to actionable governance guidance.

Conclusion: Proposes research agenda and design/governance recommendations for ethically deploying anthropomorphic cues in LLM-based conversational agents, addressing the gap between observed effects and practical guidance.

Abstract: Anthropomorphisation -- the phenomenon whereby non-human entities are ascribed human-like qualities -- has become increasingly salient with the rise of large language model (LLM)-based conversational agents (CAs). Unlike earlier chatbots, LLM-based CAs routinely generate interactional and linguistic cues, such as first-person self-reference, epistemic and affective expressions that empirical work shows can increase engagement. On the other hand, anthropomorphisation raises ethical concerns, including deception, overreliance, and exploitative relationship framing, while some authors argue that anthropomorphic interaction may support autonomy, well-being, and inclusion. Despite increasing interest in the phenomenon, literature remains fragmented across domains and varies substantially in how it defines, operationalizes, and normatively evaluates anthropomorphisation. This scoping review maps ethically oriented work on anthropomorphising LLM-based CAs across five databases and three preprint repositories. We synthesize (1) conceptual foundations, (2) ethical challenges and opportunities, and (3) methodological approaches. We find convergence on attribution-based definitions but substantial divergence in operationalization, a predominantly risk-forward normative framing, and limited empirical work that links observed interaction effects to actionable governance guidance. We conclude with a research agenda and design/governance recommendations for ethically deploying anthropomorphic cues in LLM-based conversational agents.

### [90] [Epistemology gives a Future to Complementarity in Human-AI Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09871)
*Andrea Ferrario,Alessandro Facchini,Juan M. Durán*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reframes human-AI complementarity through epistemology, arguing it serves as evidence of reliable epistemic processes rather than just a measure of predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complementarity faces theoretical challenges: lacks precise anchoring, is formalized only as post hoc accuracy indicator, ignores other interaction desiderata, and abstracts from performance gain magnitude-cost profiles, making it difficult to obtain empirically.

Method: Leverages epistemology and computational reliabilism to reframe complementarity within justificatory AI discourse, treating historical complementarity instances as evidence of reliable epistemic processes for predictive tasks.

Result: Complementarity contributes to assessing reliability of human-AI teams when generating predictions, supporting practical reasoning of affected stakeholders (patients, managers, regulators).

Conclusion: Complementarity's value lies not in providing relative predictive accuracy measures, but in helping calibrate decision-making to the reliability of AI-supported processes shaping everyday life.

Abstract: Human-AI complementarity is the claim that a human supported by an AI system can outperform either alone in a decision-making process. Since its introduction in the human-AI interaction literature, it has gained traction by generalizing the reliance paradigm and by offering a more practical alternative to the contested construct of 'trust in AI.' Yet complementarity faces key theoretical challenges: it lacks precise theoretical anchoring, it is formalized just as a post hoc indicator of relative predictive accuracy, it remains silent about other desiderata of human-AI interactions and it abstracts away from the magnitude-cost profile of its performance gain. As a result, complementarity is difficult to obtain in empirical settings. In this work, we leverage epistemology to address these challenges by reframing complementarity within the discourse on justificatory AI. Drawing on computational reliabilism, we argue that historical instances of complementarity function as evidence that a given human-AI interaction is a reliable epistemic process for a given predictive task. Together with other reliability indicators assessing the alignment of the human-AI team with the epistemic standards and socio-technical practices, complementarity contributes to the degree of reliability of human-AI teams when generating predictions. This supports the practical reasoning of those affected by these outputs -- patients, managers, regulators, and others. In summary, our approach suggests that the role and value of complementarity lies not in providing a relative measure of predictive accuracy, but in helping calibrate decision-making to the reliability of AI-supported processes that increasingly shape everyday life.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a dynamic information-flow-orchestrated multi-agent paradigm using agent-to-agent communication, eliminating need for predefined workflows and outperforming workflow-based systems on GAIA benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based multi-agent systems rely on predefined workflows that require substantial manual effort to anticipate task states and cannot exhaustively cover complex real-world task state spaces, limiting flexibility and scalability.

Method: Information-Flow-Orchestrated Multi-Agent Paradigm via Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication, where a dedicated orchestrator continuously monitors task progress and dynamically coordinates other agents through natural language A2A toolkit without predefined workflows.

Result: Achieves 63.64% accuracy on GAIA benchmark under pass@1 setting, outperforming workflow-based OWL system's 55.15% by 8.49 percentage points with comparable token consumption, showing more flexible task monitoring and robust edge case handling.

Conclusion: The proposed dynamic orchestration paradigm overcomes limitations of rule-based workflow systems, enabling more flexible and robust multi-agent coordination through continuous monitoring and natural language communication, representing a significant advancement beyond predefined workflow designs.

Abstract: Most existing Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) rely on predefined workflows, where human engineers enumerate task states in advance and specify routing rules and contextual injections accordingly. Such workflow-driven designs are essentially rule-based decision trees, which suffer from two fundamental limitations: they require substantial manual effort to anticipate and encode possible task states, and they cannot exhaustively cover the state space of complex real-world tasks. To address these issues, we propose an Information-Flow-Orchestrated Multi-Agent Paradigm via Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication from CORAL, in which a dedicated information flow orchestrator continuously monitors task progress and dynamically coordinates other agents through the A2A toolkit using natural language, without relying on predefined workflows. We evaluate our approach on the general-purpose benchmark GAIA, using the representative workflow-based MAS OWL as the baseline while controlling for agent roles and underlying models. Under the pass@1 setting, our method achieves 63.64% accuracy, outperforming OWL's 55.15% by 8.49 percentage points with comparable token consumption. Further case-level analysis shows that our paradigm enables more flexible task monitoring and more robust handling of edge cases.

### [92] [Continuum Memory Architectures for Long-Horizon LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09913)
*Joe Logan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Continuum Memory Architecture (CMA) as a solution to RAG's limitations by enabling persistent, stateful memory with temporal continuity for LLM agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG treats memory as a stateless lookup table with no temporal continuity, persistent state, or ability to update information. This structural limitation prevents LLM agents from accumulating, mutating, or disambiguating memory over time.

Method: Proposes Continuum Memory Architecture (CMA) - a class of systems with persistent storage, selective retention, associative routing, temporal chaining, and consolidation into higher-order abstractions. Focuses on architectural requirements rather than implementation specifics.

Result: CMA shows consistent behavioral advantages over RAG on tasks requiring knowledge updates, temporal association, associative recall, and contextual disambiguation. Demonstrates CMA is necessary for long-horizon agents.

Conclusion: CMA addresses fundamental limitations of RAG by enabling stateful, temporally continuous memory, though challenges remain around latency, drift, and interpretability.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the default strategy for providing large language model (LLM) agents with contextual knowledge. Yet RAG treats memory as a stateless lookup table: information persists indefinitely, retrieval is read-only, and temporal continuity is absent. We define the \textit{Continuum Memory Architecture} (CMA), a class of systems that maintain and update internal state across interactions through persistent storage, selective retention, associative routing, temporal chaining, and consolidation into higher-order abstractions. Rather than disclosing implementation specifics, we specify the architectural requirements CMA imposes and show consistent behavioral advantages on tasks that expose RAG's structural inability to accumulate, mutate, or disambiguate memory. The empirical probes (knowledge updates, temporal association, associative recall, contextual disambiguation) demonstrate that CMA is a necessary architectural primitive for long-horizon agents while highlighting open challenges around latency, drift, and interpretability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Single-Shot Planning for Computer Use Agents provides provable security against prompt injection by generating complete execution graphs before observing potentially malicious UI content, while maintaining utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks that can steal credentials or cause financial loss. Current Computer Use Agents (CUAs) require continuous UI observation for task execution, which conflicts with the architectural isolation needed for security.

Method: Introduces Single-Shot Planning for CUAs where a trusted planner generates a complete execution graph with conditional branches before any observation of potentially malicious content, providing provable control flow integrity guarantees against instruction injections.

Result: The approach retains up to 57% of frontier model performance while improving smaller open-source models by up to 19% on OSWorld. However, additional measures are needed to prevent Branch Steering attacks that manipulate UI elements to trigger unintended valid paths.

Conclusion: Rigorous security and utility can coexist in Computer Use Agents through architectural isolation with Single-Shot Planning, though additional defenses are needed against Branch Steering attacks that exploit UI element manipulation.

Abstract: AI agents are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where malicious content hijacks agent behavior to steal credentials or cause financial loss. The only known robust defense is architectural isolation that strictly separates trusted task planning from untrusted environment observations. However, applying this design to Computer Use Agents (CUAs) -- systems that automate tasks by viewing screens and executing actions -- presents a fundamental challenge: current agents require continuous observation of UI state to determine each action, conflicting with the isolation required for security. We resolve this tension by demonstrating that UI workflows, while dynamic, are structurally predictable. We introduce Single-Shot Planning for CUAs, where a trusted planner generates a complete execution graph with conditional branches before any observation of potentially malicious content, providing provable control flow integrity guarantees against arbitrary instruction injections. Although this architectural isolation successfully prevents instruction injections, we show that additional measures are needed to prevent Branch Steering attacks, which manipulate UI elements to trigger unintended valid paths within the plan. We evaluate our design on OSWorld, and retain up to 57% of the performance of frontier models while improving performance for smaller open-source models by up to 19%, demonstrating that rigorous security and utility can coexist in CUAs.

Motivation: LLMs/LRMs have transformative potential in finance and law but suffer from hallucination risks that threaten reliability in regulated, high-stakes environments.

Method: Comprehensive operational framework with root cause awareness, categorizing hallucinations into model/data/context factors, integrating multi-faceted detection methods (uncertainty estimation, reasoning consistency) with stratified mitigation strategies (knowledge grounding, confidence calibration).

Result: Demonstrated through tiered architecture and financial data extraction case study showing model, context, and data tiers form closed feedback loop for progressive reliability enhancement.

Conclusion: Provides systematic, scalable methodology for building trustworthy generative AI systems in regulated environments through targeted interventions over generic fixes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) offer transformative potential for high-stakes domains like finance and law, but their tendency to hallucinate, generating factually incorrect or unsupported content, poses a critical reliability risk. This paper introduces a comprehensive operational framework for hallucination management, built on a continuous improvement cycle driven by root cause awareness. We categorize hallucination sources into model, data, and context-related factors, allowing targeted interventions over generic fixes. The framework integrates multi-faceted detection methods (e.g., uncertainty estimation, reasoning consistency) with stratified mitigation strategies (e.g., knowledge grounding, confidence calibration). We demonstrate its application through a tiered architecture and a financial data extraction case study, where model, context, and data tiers form a closed feedback loop for progressive reliability enhancement. This approach provides a systematic, scalable methodology for building trustworthy generative AI systems in regulated environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose LLMs like GPT-4 struggle with specialized legal subdomains requiring precise knowledge, complex reasoning, and contextual sensitivity in Chinese labor law.

Method: Developed LabourLawLLM tailored to Chinese labor law and created LabourLawBench benchmark covering diverse tasks (provision citation, QA, case classification, compensation computation, NER, case analysis). Used evaluation framework combining objective metrics (ROUGE-L, accuracy, F1, soft-F1) with GPT-4-based subjective assessment.

Conclusion: The methodology provides a scalable approach for building specialized LLMs in other legal subfields, improving accuracy, reliability, and societal value of legal AI applications beyond labor law.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress in domain-specific applications, particularly within the legal domain. However, general-purpose models such as GPT-4 often struggle with specialized subdomains that require precise legal knowledge, complex reasoning, and contextual sensitivity. To address these limitations, we present LabourLawLLM, a legal large language model tailored to Chinese labor law. We also introduce LabourLawBench, a comprehensive benchmark covering diverse labor-law tasks, including legal provision citation, knowledge-based question answering, case classification, compensation computation, named entity recognition, and legal case analysis. Our evaluation framework combines objective metrics (e.g., ROUGE-L, accuracy, F1, and soft-F1) with subjective assessment based on GPT-4 scoring. Experiments show that LabourLawLLM consistently outperforms general-purpose and existing legal-specific LLMs across task categories. Beyond labor law, our methodology provides a scalable approach for building specialized LLMs in other legal subfields, improving accuracy, reliability, and societal value of legal AI applications.

### [96] [SPRInG: Continual LLM Personalization via Selective Parametric Adaptation and Retrieval-Interpolated Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09974)
*Seoyeon Kim,Jaehyung Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPRInG is a semi-parametric framework for continual personalization of LLMs that addresses preference drift through drift-driven selective adaptation and relevance-gated inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current personalization methods assume static user preferences, but real-world user interests evolve over time, creating preference drift. Standard continual learning approaches fail to distinguish genuine preference shifts from transient contexts, leading to catastrophic forgetting or noisy adaptation.

Method: SPRInG uses drift-driven selective adaptation with a likelihood-based scoring function to identify high-novelty interactions. It selectively updates user-specific adapters on drift signals while preserving residuals in a replay buffer. During inference, it applies strict relevance gating and fuses parametric knowledge with retrieved history via logit interpolation.

Result: Experiments on the long-form personalized generation benchmark show that SPRInG outperforms existing baselines, demonstrating robustness for real-world continual personalization.

Conclusion: SPRInG effectively addresses the challenge of continual personalization in dynamic environments by selectively adapting to genuine preference shifts while avoiding catastrophic forgetting, making it suitable for real-world applications where user interests evolve over time.

Abstract: Personalizing Large Language Models typically relies on static retrieval or one-time adaptation, assuming user preferences remain invariant over time. However, real-world interactions are dynamic, where user interests continuously evolve, posing a challenge for models to adapt to preference drift without catastrophic forgetting. Standard continual learning approaches often struggle in this context, as they indiscriminately update on noisy interaction streams, failing to distinguish genuine preference shifts from transient contexts. To address this, we introduce SPRInG, a novel semi-parametric framework designed for effective continual personalization. During training, SPRInG employs drift-driven selective adaptation, which utilizes a likelihood-based scoring function to identify high-novelty interactions. This allows the model to selectively update the user-specific adapter on drift signals while preserving hard-to-learn residuals in a replay buffer. During inference, we apply strict relevance gating and fuse parametric knowledge with retrieved history via logit interpolation. Experiments on the long-form personalized generation benchmark demonstrate that SPRInG outperforms existing baselines, validating its robustness for real-world continual personalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Memo-SQL: A training-free NL2SQL framework using structured decomposition and experience-aware self-correction with dynamic memory of error-fix pairs, achieving SOTA on BIRD with 10x fewer resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NL2SQL systems have two critical limitations: (1) they only use correct examples for in-context learning, ignoring valuable error-fix pairs that could enable robust self-correction, and (2) test-time scaling approaches produce near-identical SQL candidates across runs, limiting ensemble gains. These methods also suffer from an accuracy-efficiency trade-off where high performance requires excessive computation.

Method: Memo-SQL introduces two key ideas: (1) structured decomposition using three clear strategies (entity-wise, hierarchical, and atomic sequential) to encourage diverse reasoning instead of arbitrary decomposition, and (2) experience-aware self-correction with a dynamic memory that stores both successful queries and historical error-fix pairs, using retrieval-augmented prompting to bring relevant examples into context at inference time without fine-tuning or external APIs.

Result: On the BIRD benchmark, Memo-SQL achieves 68.5% execution accuracy, setting a new state of the art among open, zero-fine-tuning methods. The framework uses over 10 times fewer resources than prior test-time scaling approaches while maintaining high performance.

Conclusion: Memo-SQL demonstrates that structured decomposition and experience-aware self-correction with dynamic memory can overcome the limitations of existing NL2SQL systems, achieving superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs without requiring training or external APIs.

Abstract: Existing NL2SQL systems face two critical limitations: (1) they rely on in-context learning with only correct examples, overlooking the rich signal in historical error-fix pairs that could guide more robust self-correction; and (2) test-time scaling approaches often decompose questions arbitrarily, producing near-identical SQL candidates across runs and diminishing ensemble gains. Moreover, these methods suffer from a stark accuracy-efficiency trade-off: high performance demands excessive computation, while fast variants compromise quality. We present Memo-SQL, a training-free framework that addresses these issues through two simple ideas: structured decomposition and experience-aware self-correction. Instead of leaving decomposition to chance, we apply three clear strategies, entity-wise, hierarchical, and atomic sequential, to encourage diverse reasoning. For correction, we build a dynamic memory of both successful queries and historical error-fix pairs, and use retrieval-augmented prompting to bring relevant examples into context at inference time, no fine-tuning or external APIs required. On BIRD, Memo-SQL achieves 68.5% execution accuracy, setting a new state of the art among open, zero-fine-tuning methods, while using over 10 times fewer resources than prior TTS approaches.

TL;DR: Framework models LLM personality using Jungian psychology with three mechanisms for coherent expression, contextual adaptation, and long-term evolution, enabling more natural human-computer interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in HCI but lack nuanced and adaptable personality expression, which is critical for engagement, decision-making, and perceived realism in human-computer interactions.

Method: Jungian psychological type framework with three mechanisms: dominant-auxiliary coordination for core expression, reinforcement-compensation for contextual adaptation, and reflection for long-term personality evolution.

Result: Personality alignment evaluated using Myers-Briggs Type Indicator questionnaires shows evolving, personality-aware LLMs can support coherent, context-sensitive interactions in diverse challenge scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework enables naturalistic agent design in HCI by allowing LLMs to maintain nuanced personality traits while dynamically adapting to interaction demands and evolving over time.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping human-computer interaction (HCI), from personalized assistants to social simulations. Beyond language competence, researchers are exploring whether LLMs can exhibit human-like characteristics that influence engagement, decision-making, and perceived realism. Personality, in particular, is critical, yet existing approaches often struggle to achieve both nuanced and adaptable expression. We present a framework that models LLM personality via Jungian psychological types, integrating three mechanisms: a dominant-auxiliary coordination mechanism for coherent core expression, a reinforcement-compensation mechanism for temporary adaptation to context, and a reflection mechanism that drives long-term personality evolution. This design allows the agent to maintain nuanced traits while dynamically adjusting to interaction demands and gradually updating its underlying structure. Personality alignment is evaluated using Myers-Briggs Type Indicator questionnaires and tested under diverse challenge scenarios as a preliminary structured assessment. Findings suggest that evolving, personality-aware LLMs can support coherent, context-sensitive interactions, enabling naturalistic agent design in HCI.

TL;DR: PaperScout: An autonomous agent for academic paper search using sequential decision-making with Proximal Sequence Policy Optimization (PSPO) to address granularity mismatch in multi-turn agent training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing academic paper search approaches rely on rigid, predefined workflows that struggle with complex, conditional queries, creating a need for more adaptive, intelligent search systems.

Method: Propose PaperScout, an autonomous agent that reformulates paper search as sequential decision-making, dynamically deciding when and how to invoke search tools. Introduce Proximal Sequence Policy Optimization (PSPO) - a process-aware, sequence-level policy optimization method that aligns optimization with agent-environment interaction to address granularity mismatch in multi-turn agent training.

Result: PaperScout significantly outperforms strong workflow-driven and RL baselines in both recall and relevance on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, validating the effectiveness of the adaptive agentic framework and optimization strategy.

Conclusion: The proposed PaperScout agent with PSPO optimization provides an effective solution for complex academic paper search by enabling adaptive, context-aware decision-making and addressing fundamental training challenges in multi-turn agentic systems.

Abstract: Academic paper search is a fundamental task in scientific research, yet most existing approaches rely on rigid, predefined workflows that struggle with complex, conditional queries. To address this limitation, we propose PaperScout, an autonomous agent that reformulates paper search as a sequential decision-making process. Unlike static workflows, PaperScout dynamically decides whether, when, and how to invoke search and expand tools based on accumulated retrieval context. However, training such agents presents a fundamental challenge: standard reinforcement learning methods, typically designed for single-turn tasks, suffer from a granularity mismatch when applied to multi-turn agentic tasks, where token-level optimization diverges from the granularity of sequence-level interactions, leading to noisy credit assignment. We introduce Proximal Sequence Policy Optimization (PSPO), a process-aware, sequence-level policy optimization method that aligns optimization with agent-environment interaction. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that PaperScout significantly outperforms strong workflow-driven and RL baselines in both recall and relevance, validating the effectiveness of our adaptive agentic framework and optimization strategy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FilDeep: A fidelity-based deep learning framework using multi-fidelity data (low-fidelity high-quantity + high-fidelity high-accuracy) to solve large deformation problems in elastic-plastic solids, addressing the quantity-accuracy dilemma in dataset construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical methods for large deformations in elastic-plastic solids have limitations, and current DL approaches require high-quantity, high-accuracy datasets that are difficult to obtain for large deformation problems, creating a quantity-accuracy dilemma in dataset construction.

Method: FilDeep framework simultaneously trains with both low-fidelity (high quantity, lower accuracy) and high-fidelity (high accuracy, lower quantity) data using attention-enabled cross-fidelity modules to capture long-range physical interactions across multi-fidelity data.

Result: Extensive experiments show FilDeep consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance and can be efficiently deployed in manufacturing applications, presenting the first DL framework for large deformation problems using multi-fidelity data.

Conclusion: FilDeep successfully resolves the quantity-accuracy dilemma in large deformation problems by leveraging multi-fidelity data, enabling practical deployment in manufacturing while achieving superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: The scientific computation of large deformations in elastic-plastic solids is crucial in various manufacturing applications. Traditional numerical methods exhibit several inherent limitations, prompting Deep Learning (DL) as a promising alternative. The effectiveness of current DL techniques typically depends on the availability of high-quantity and high-accuracy datasets, which are yet difficult to obtain in large deformation problems. During the dataset construction process, a dilemma stands between data quantity and data accuracy, leading to suboptimal performance in the DL models. To address this challenge, we focus on a representative application of large deformations, the stretch bending problem, and propose FilDeep, a Fidelity-based Deep Learning framework for large Deformation of elastic-plastic solids. Our FilDeep aims to resolve the quantity-accuracy dilemma by simultaneously training with both low-fidelity and high-fidelity data, where the former provides greater quantity but lower accuracy, while the latter offers higher accuracy but in less quantity. In FilDeep, we provide meticulous designs for the practical large deformation problem. Particularly, we propose attention-enabled cross-fidelity modules to effectively capture long-range physical interactions across MF data. To the best of our knowledge, our FilDeep presents the first DL framework for large deformation problems using MF data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FilDeep consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance and can be efficiently deployed in manufacturing.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Analysis of 100T+ tokens from OpenRouter reveals real-world LLM usage patterns: open-weight model adoption, creative roleplay popularity beyond productivity tasks, coding assistance demand, agentic inference rise, and the "Glass Slipper" effect where early users show higher retention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rapid shift to reasoning models like o1 and multi-step deliberation inference, empirical understanding of real-world LLM usage has lagged behind deployment. The paper aims to bridge this gap by analyzing actual usage patterns across tasks, geographies, and time.

Method: Leveraged the OpenRouter platform (AI inference provider) to analyze over 100 trillion tokens of real-world LLM interactions. Conducted empirical study across various dimensions including task types, geographical distribution, temporal patterns, and user retention analysis.

Result: Found substantial adoption of open-weight models, outsized popularity of creative roleplay (beyond assumed productivity dominance), strong coding assistance demand, rise of agentic inference, and identified the "Glass Slipper" effect where early user cohorts show significantly higher retention than later adopters.

Conclusion: Real-world LLM usage is complex and multifaceted, challenging common assumptions. Findings provide data-driven insights for model builders, AI developers, and infrastructure providers to better design and deploy LLM systems based on actual usage patterns rather than theoretical expectations.

Abstract: The past year has marked a turning point in the evolution and real-world use of large language models (LLMs). With the release of the first widely adopted reasoning model, o1, on December 5th, 2024, the field shifted from single-pass pattern generation to multi-step deliberation inference, accelerating deployment, experimentation, and new classes of applications. As this shift unfolded at a rapid pace, our empirical understanding of how these models have actually been used in practice has lagged behind. In this work, we leverage the OpenRouter platform, which is an AI inference provider across a wide variety of LLMs, to analyze over 100 trillion tokens of real-world LLM interactions across tasks, geographies, and time. In our empirical study, we observe substantial adoption of open-weight models, the outsized popularity of creative roleplay (beyond just the productivity tasks many assume dominate) and coding assistance categories, plus the rise of agentic inference. Furthermore, our retention analysis identifies foundational cohorts: early users whose engagement persists far longer than later cohorts. We term this phenomenon the Cinderella "Glass Slipper" effect. These findings underscore that the way developers and end-users engage with LLMs "in the wild" is complex and multifaceted. We discuss implications for model builders, AI developers, and infrastructure providers, and outline how a data-driven understanding of usage can inform better design and deployment of LLM systems.

*Ke Chen,Jiandian Zeng,Zihao Peng,Guo Li,Guangxue Zhang,Tian Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MatrixCoT is a structured Chain-of-Thought framework using matrix-based planning to enhance LLMs' logical reasoning without external solvers, improving robustness and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches have limitations: CoT prompting falls short on symbolic reasoning tasks, neuro-symbolic methods are format-sensitive and brittle, and LLM-driven approaches lack structured representations and error-correction mechanisms.

Method: MatrixCoT normalizes and types natural language expressions, adds citation fields, uses matrix-based planning to preserve global relations among reasoning steps, and includes feedback-driven replanning with semantic-equivalence constraints for verification.

Result: Experiments on five logical-reasoning benchmarks with five LLMs show MatrixCoT enhances both robustness and interpretability while maintaining competitive performance without external solvers.

Conclusion: MatrixCoT provides a structured CoT framework that improves LLMs' logical reasoning capabilities through matrix-based planning and verification mechanisms, addressing limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: As knowledge and semantics on the web grow increasingly complex, enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) comprehension and reasoning capabilities has become particularly important. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, it still falls short on logical reasoning tasks that rely on symbolic expressions and strict deductive rules. Neuro-symbolic methods address this gap by enforcing formal correctness through external solvers. Yet these solvers are highly format-sensitive, and small instabilities in model outputs can lead to frequent processing failures. LLM-driven approaches avoid parsing brittleness, but they lack structured representations and process-level error-correction mechanisms. To further enhance the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we propose MatrixCoT, a structured CoT framework with a matrix-based plan. Specifically, we normalize and type natural language expressions, attach explicit citation fields, and introduce a matrix-based planning method to preserve global relations among steps. The plan becomes a verifiable artifact, making execution more stable. For verification, we also add a feedback-driven replanning mechanism. Under semantic-equivalence constraints, it identifies omissions and defects, rewrites and compresses the dependency matrix, and produces a more trustworthy final answer. Experiments on five logical-reasoning benchmarks and five LLMs show that, without relying on external solvers, MatrixCoT enhances both robustness and interpretability when tackling complex symbolic reasoning tasks, while maintaining competitive performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Student models can outperform teacher LLMs on domain tasks when their advantage on student-favored subdomains outweighs deficits on teacher-favored subdomains, achieved via scheduled checkpoint distillation and adaptive weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are hard to deploy for domain tasks due to scale, and distillation suffers from capacity gaps. The paper explores when/how students can match/surpass teachers on domain-specific tasks.

Method: Proposes Scheduled Checkpoint Distillation (SCD) to emulate teacher's convergence process during SFT, plus sample-wise Adaptive Weighting (AW) to preserve student strengths on student-favored subdomains.

Result: Experiments across QA, NER, and text classification in multiple languages show the method consistently outperforms existing distillation approaches, enabling students to match or exceed teacher performance.

Conclusion: Students can outperform teachers on domain tasks through strategic distillation that balances subdomain advantages, with SCD and AW providing an effective framework for achieving this.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are challenging to deploy for domain-specific tasks due to their massive scale. While distilling a fine-tuned LLM into a smaller student model is a promising alternative, the capacity gap between teacher and student often leads to suboptimal performance. This raises a key question: when and how can a student model match or even surpass its teacher on domain-specific tasks? In this work, we propose a novel theoretical insight: a student can outperform its teacher if its advantage on a Student-Favored Subdomain (SFS) outweighs its deficit on the Teacher-Favored Subdomain (TFS). Guided by this insight, we propose Scheduled Checkpoint Distillation (SCD), which reduces the TFS deficit by emulating the teacher's convergence process during supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the domain task, and a sample-wise Adaptive Weighting (AW) mechanism to preserve student strengths on SFS. Experiments across diverse domain tasks--including QA, NER, and text classification in multiple languages--show that our method consistently outperforms existing distillation approaches, allowing the student model to match or even exceed the performance of its fine-tuned teacher.

TL;DR: MolGen is a two-stage fragment-based framework for generating molecules under precise multi-property constraints, combining retrieval-augmented prototype generation with RL-based fine-grained optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating molecules that satisfy precise numeric constraints over multiple physicochemical properties is critical but challenging. While LLMs are expressive, they struggle with precise multi-objective control and numeric reasoning without external structure and feedback.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Prototype generation using multi-agent reasoner with retrieval-anchored fragment-level edits; 2) RL-based fine-grained optimization using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for one- or multi-hop refinements to minimize property errors while regulating edit complexity and prototype deviation. Uses automatically curated dataset with reasoning chains of fragment edits and property deltas.

Result: Experiments on generation under two sets of property constraints (QED, LogP, Molecular Weight and HOMO, LUMO) show consistent gains in validity and precise satisfaction of multi-property targets, outperforming strong LLMs and graph-based algorithms.

Conclusion: MolGen better reasons about molecules by leveraging fragments and supports controllable refinement toward numeric targets, addressing limitations of prior approaches in multi-property constrained molecule generation.

Abstract: Generating molecules that satisfy precise numeric constraints over multiple physicochemical properties is critical and challenging. Although large language models (LLMs) are expressive, they struggle with precise multi-objective control and numeric reasoning without external structure and feedback. We introduce \textbf{M olGen}, a fragment-level, retrieval-augmented, two-stage framework for molecule generation under multi-property constraints. Stage I : Prototype generation: a multi-agent reasoner performs retrieval-anchored, fragment-level edits to produce a candidate near the feasible region. Stage II : RL-based fine-grained optimization: a fragment-level optimizer trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) applies one- or multi-hop refinements to explicitly minimize the property errors toward our target while regulating edit complexity and deviation from the prototype. A large, automatically curated dataset with reasoning chains of fragment edits and measured property deltas underpins both stages, enabling deterministic, reproducible supervision and controllable multi-hop reasoning. Unlike prior work, our framework better reasons about molecules by leveraging fragments and supports controllable refinement toward numeric targets. Experiments on generation under two sets of property constraints (QED, LogP, Molecular Weight and HOMO, LUMO) show consistent gains in validity and precise satisfaction of multi-property targets, outperforming strong LLMs and graph-based algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can infer temporal regularities from structured behavioral data and predict time intervals between recurring user actions, an area that remains underexplored despite LLMs' impressive reasoning capabilities.

Method: Systematic study using a simple repurchase scenario to benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs in zero-shot settings against statistical and machine-learning models, examining how different levels of contextual information affect predictive behavior.

Result: Two key findings: 1) LLMs surpass lightweight statistical baselines but consistently underperform dedicated ML models, showing limited ability to capture quantitative temporal structure; 2) Moderate context improves LLM accuracy, but adding further user-level detail degrades performance, challenging the "more context leads to better reasoning" assumption.

Conclusion: The study highlights fundamental limitations of today's LLMs in structured temporal inference and offers guidance for designing future context-aware hybrid models that integrate statistical precision with linguistic flexibility.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in reasoning and prediction across different domains. Yet, their ability to infer temporal regularities from structured behavioral data remains underexplored. This paper presents a systematic study investigating whether LLMs can predict time intervals between recurring user actions, such as repeated purchases, and how different levels of contextual information shape their predictive behavior. Using a simple but representative repurchase scenario, we benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs in zero-shot settings against both statistical and machine-learning models. Two key findings emerge. First, while LLMs surpass lightweight statistical baselines, they consistently underperform dedicated machine-learning models, showing their limited ability to capture quantitative temporal structure. Second, although moderate context can improve LLM accuracy, adding further user-level detail degrades performance. These results challenge the assumption that "more context leads to better reasoning". Our study highlights fundamental limitations of today's LLMs in structured temporal inference and offers guidance for designing future context-aware hybrid models that integrate statistical precision with linguistic flexibility.

Motivation: Models trained on static historical data overfit and fail to generalize in dynamic financial markets due to concept drift and distributional non-stationarity, creating a critical gap between training and real-world performance.

Method: A differentiable framework coupling parameterized data manipulation (single-stock transformations, multi-stock mix-ups, curation) with an adaptive planner-scheduler using gradient-based bi-level optimization for unified data augmentation, curriculum learning, and workflow management.

Result: Extensive experiments on forecasting and reinforcement learning trading tasks show enhanced model robustness and improved risk-adjusted returns compared to static historical data approaches.

Conclusion: The system provides a generalizable approach to adaptive data management and learning-guided workflow automation for financial data, addressing the "History Is Not Enough" challenge in quantitative finance.

Abstract: In quantitative finance, the gap between training and real-world performance-driven by concept drift and distributional non-stationarity-remains a critical obstacle for building reliable data-driven systems. Models trained on static historical data often overfit, resulting in poor generalization in dynamic markets. The mantra "History Is Not Enough" underscores the need for adaptive data generation that learns to evolve with the market rather than relying solely on past observations. We present a drift-aware dataflow system that integrates machine learning-based adaptive control into the data curation process. The system couples a parameterized data manipulation module comprising single-stock transformations, multi-stock mix-ups, and curation operations, with an adaptive planner-scheduler that employs gradient-based bi-level optimization to control the system. This design unifies data augmentation, curriculum learning, and data workflow management under a single differentiable framework, enabling provenance-aware replay and continuous data quality monitoring. Extensive experiments on forecasting and reinforcement learning trading tasks demonstrate that our framework enhances model robustness and improves risk-adjusted returns. The system provides a generalizable approach to adaptive data management and learning-guided workflow automation for financial data.

TL;DR: DecisionLLM applies large language models to offline sequential decision-making by treating trajectories as a distinct modality and aligning them with natural language descriptions, achieving significant performance improvements over Decision Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the success of LLMs in complex reasoning tasks and their shared Transformer foundation with Decision Transformers. The authors investigate whether LLMs, operating at much larger scales, can unlock new performance levels in long-horizon sequential decision-making problems, particularly in domains like computational advertising and real-time bidding.

Method: The proposed DecisionLLM addresses LLMs' inability to interpret continuous values by treating trajectories as a distinct modality. The model learns to align trajectory data with natural language task descriptions, enabling autoregressive prediction of future decisions within a unified framework. The authors establish scaling laws showing performance depends on model scale, data volume, and data quality.

Result: DecisionLLM achieves strong performance in offline benchmarks and bidding scenarios. Specifically, DecisionLLM-3B outperforms traditional Decision Transformers by 69.4 on Maze2D umaze-v1 and by 0.085 on AuctionNet. The approach extends the AIGB paradigm and shows promise for online bidding applications.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that LLMs can be effectively applied to offline sequential decision-making by treating trajectories as a distinct modality. The established scaling laws provide guidance for future development, and the strong performance suggests promising directions for extending this approach to online decision-making scenarios like bidding.

Abstract: Long-sequence decision-making, which is usually addressed through reinforcement learning (RL), is a critical component for optimizing strategic operations in dynamic environments, such as real-time bidding in computational advertising. The Decision Transformer (DT) introduced a powerful paradigm by framing RL as an autoregressive sequence modeling problem. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in complex reasoning and planning tasks. This inspires us whether LLMs, which share the same Transformer foundation, but operate at a much larger scale, can unlock new levels of performance in long-horizon sequential decision-making problem. This work investigates the application of LLMs to offline decision making tasks. A fundamental challenge in this domain is the LLMs' inherent inability to interpret continuous values, as they lack a native understanding of numerical magnitude and order when values are represented as text strings. To address this, we propose treating trajectories as a distinct modality. By learning to align trajectory data with natural language task descriptions, our model can autoregressively predict future decisions within a cohesive framework we term DecisionLLM. We establish a set of scaling laws governing this paradigm, demonstrating that performance hinges on three factors: model scale, data volume, and data quality. In offline experimental benchmarks and bidding scenarios, DecisionLLM achieves strong performance. Specifically, DecisionLLM-3B outperforms the traditional Decision Transformer (DT) by 69.4 on Maze2D umaze-v1 and by 0.085 on AuctionNet. It extends the AIGB paradigm and points to promising directions for future exploration in online bidding.

TL;DR: MMPG is a multi-perspective protein graph framework using Mixture of Experts to fuse physical, chemical, and geometric residue interaction views for superior protein representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GNN-based protein representation learning methods use single-perspective graph construction, capturing only partial residue interaction properties and resulting in incomplete protein representations.

Method: Constructs protein graphs from physical, chemical, and geometric perspectives, then uses Mixture of Experts to dynamically route perspectives to specialized experts that learn intrinsic features, cross-perspective interactions, and global consensus.

Result: MMPG produces superior protein representations and achieves advanced performance on four different downstream protein tasks, with MoE automatically specializing experts in modeling distinct levels of interaction.

Conclusion: Multi-perspective graph construction with adaptive MoE fusion effectively captures comprehensive residue interaction properties, leading to improved protein representation learning across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely adopted for Protein Representation Learning (PRL), as residue interaction networks can be naturally represented as graphs. Current GNN-based PRL methods typically rely on single-perspective graph construction strategies, which capture partial properties of residue interactions, resulting in incomplete protein representations. To address this limitation, we propose MMPG, a framework that constructs protein graphs from multiple perspectives and adaptively fuses them via Mixture of Experts (MoE) for PRL. MMPG constructs graphs from physical, chemical, and geometric perspectives to characterize different properties of residue interactions. To capture both perspective-specific features and their synergies, we develop an MoE module, which dynamically routes perspectives to specialized experts, where experts learn intrinsic features and cross-perspective interactions. We quantitatively verify that MoE automatically specializes experts in modeling distinct levels of interaction from individual representations, to pairwise inter-perspective synergies, and ultimately to a global consensus across all perspectives. Through integrating this multi-level information, MMPG produces superior protein representations and achieves advanced performance on four different downstream protein tasks.

TL;DR: Neural agents learn compositional generalization through a "Composition through Decomposition" method with two steps: Decompose (learning basic concepts) and Compose (describing novel images), achieving zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate how artificial neural agents can acquire and utilize compositional generalization - the human cognitive ability to systematically combine known concepts in novel ways - particularly for describing previously unseen images.

Method: "Composition through Decomposition" with two sequential training steps: 1) Decompose step - agents learn to decompose images into basic concepts using a codebook acquired during interaction in a multi-target coordination game; 2) Compose step - agents use this codebook to describe novel images by composing basic concepts into complex phrases.

Result: The agents successfully learn to describe novel images by composing basic concepts, with remarkable cases where generalization in the Compose step is achieved zero-shot without additional training.

Conclusion: Artificial neural agents can acquire compositional generalization capabilities through structured training involving decomposition and composition, enabling them to describe unseen images by systematically combining learned concepts, sometimes achieving zero-shot generalization.

Abstract: Compositionality is a cognitive mechanism that allows humans to systematically combine known concepts in novel ways. This study demonstrates how artificial neural agents acquire and utilize compositional generalization to describe previously unseen images. Our method, termed "Composition through Decomposition", involves two sequential training steps. In the 'Decompose' step, the agents learn to decompose an image into basic concepts using a codebook acquired during interaction in a multi-target coordination game. Subsequently, in the 'Compose' step, the agents employ this codebook to describe novel images by composing basic concepts into complex phrases. Remarkably, we observe cases where generalization in the `Compose' step is achieved zero-shot, without the need for additional training.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A systematic workflow evaluates how downsampling affects diagnostic information in high-frequency nEMG signals, identifying shape-aware algorithms that preserve waveform integrity while enabling near real-time analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High and heterogeneous sampling rates in needle EMG signals pose computational challenges for real-time analysis of neuromuscular diseases, but the impact of downsampling on diagnostic content is poorly understood.

Method: A workflow combining shape-based distortion metrics, classification outcomes from feature-based ML models, and feature space analysis to quantify how different downsampling algorithms affect waveform integrity and predictive performance.

Result: Shape-aware downsampling algorithms outperform standard decimation by better preserving peak structure and signal morphology, enabling configurations that maintain diagnostic information while reducing computational load.

Conclusion: The workflow provides practical guidance for selecting downsampling configurations for near real-time nEMG analysis and offers a generalizable approach for balancing data reduction with model performance in high-frequency time-series applications.

Abstract: Automated analysis of needle electromyography (nEMG) signals is emerging as a tool to support the detection of neuromuscular diseases (NMDs), yet the signals' high and heterogeneous sampling rates pose substantial computational challenges for feature-based machine-learning models, particularly for near real-time analysis. Downsampling offers a potential solution, but its impact on diagnostic signal content and classification performance remains insufficiently understood. This study presents a workflow for systematically evaluating information loss caused by downsampling in high-frequency time series. The workflow combines shape-based distortion metrics with classification outcomes from available feature-based machine learning models and feature space analysis to quantify how different downsampling algorithms and factors affect both waveform integrity and predictive performance. We use a three-class NMD classification task to experimentally evaluate the workflow. We demonstrate how the workflow identifies downsampling configurations that preserve diagnostic information while substantially reducing computational load. Analysis of shape-based distortion metrics showed that shape-aware downsampling algorithms outperform standard decimation, as they better preserve peak structure and overall signal morphology. The results provide practical guidance for selecting downsampling configurations that enable near real-time nEMG analysis and highlight a generalisable workflow that can be used to balance data reduction with model performance in other high-frequency time-series applications as well.

*Jiujiu Chen,Weijun Zeng,Shaofeng Hu,Sihong Xie,Hui Xiong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GFM4GA is a graph foundation model for group anomaly detection that uses dual-level contrastive pretraining and few-shot fine-tuning to identify abnormal groups where individuals may appear normal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Group anomaly detection is important for network applications but challenging due to diverse patterns. Existing graph foundation models work for individual anomalies but fail for group anomalies, where abnormal groups must be detected as a whole despite individuals appearing normal.

Method: Proposes GFM4GA with dual-level contrastive pretraining based on feature-based estimation and group extraction to capture group anomaly structures and feature inconsistencies. Downstream tasks use parameter-constrained, group-anomaly-proportion weighted few-shot fine-tuning, with adaptive expansion via group contexts from labeled anomaly neighbors.

Result: GFM4GA outperforms both group anomaly detectors and GFMs for individual anomalies, achieving average improvements of 2.85% in AUROC and 2.55% in AUPRC.

Conclusion: GFM4GA effectively addresses group anomaly detection challenges by leveraging graph foundation models with specialized pretraining and few-shot adaptation techniques, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Group anomaly detection is crucial in many network applications, but faces challenges due to diverse anomaly patterns. Motivated by the success of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing, graph foundation models (GFMs) is proposed to handle few-shot learning task with fewer labeling efforts. GFMs have been successfully applied to detection of individual anomalies but cannot be generalized to group anomalies, as group anomaly patterns must be detected as a whole and individuals in an abnormal group can look rather normal. Therefore, we propose GFM4GA, a novel graph foundation model for group anomaly detection. The pipeline is pretrained via dual-level contrastive learning based on feature-based estimation and group extraction, to capture potential group anomaly structure and feature inconsistencies. In the downstream tasks, the pipeline is finetuned in parameter-constrained and group-anomaly-proportion weighted few-shot settings, and its adaptive ability to unseen group anomalies expanded via group contexts determined by labeled anomaly neighbors. Experiments show that GFM4GA surpasses group anomaly detectors and GFMs for individual anomalies, achieving average improvements of 2.85% in AUROC and 2.55% in AUPRC.

### [113] [Topo-RAG: Topology-aware retrieval for hybrid text-table documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10215)
*Alex Dantart,Marco Kóvacs-Navarro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Topo-RAG is a framework that processes enterprise documents with both narrative text and tabular data separately, using dense retrieval for text and cell-aware late interaction for tables, achieving 18.4% better search performance than linearization approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems use linearization (converting tables to text strings) to handle enterprise documents containing both narrative text and structured tabular data, but this approach is mathematically insufficient for capturing the spatial relationships and geometry of tabular structures.

Method: Topo-RAG uses a dual architecture: 1) traditional dense retrievers for fluid narrative text, and 2) a Cell-Aware Late Interaction mechanism for tabular structures that preserves their spatial relationships and topology.

Result: Evaluated on SEC-25 (a synthetic enterprise corpus mimicking real-world complexity), Topo-RAG demonstrates an 18.4% improvement in nDCG@10 on hybrid queries compared to standard linearization approaches.

Conclusion: The paper argues that effective enterprise document retrieval requires understanding the "shape of information" - treating narrative and structured data differently rather than forcing everything into text format, leading to significantly better search performance.

Abstract: In enterprise datasets, documents are rarely pure. They are not just text, nor just numbers; they are a complex amalgam of narrative and structure. Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have attempted to address this complexity with a blunt tool: linearization. We convert rich, multidimensional tables into simple Markdown-style text strings, hoping that an embedding model will capture the geometry of a spreadsheet in a single vector. But it has already been shown that this is mathematically insufficient.
  This work presents Topo-RAG, a framework that challenges the assumption that "everything is text". We propose a dual architecture that respects the topology of the data: we route fluid narrative through traditional dense retrievers, while tabular structures are processed by a Cell-Aware Late Interaction mechanism, preserving their spatial relationships. Evaluated on SEC-25, a synthetic enterprise corpus that mimics real-world complexity, Topo-RAG demonstrates an 18.4% improvement in nDCG@10 on hybrid queries compared to standard linearization approaches. It's not just about searching better; it's about understanding the shape of information.

### [114] [TRIM: Hybrid Inference via Targeted Stepwise Routing in Multi-Step Reasoning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10245)
*Vansh Kapoor,Aman Gupta,Hao Chen,Anurag Beniwal,Jing Huang,Aviral Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRIM is a step-level routing method that identifies critical reasoning steps likely to cause cascading failures and routes only those to larger models, achieving 5x higher cost efficiency on math reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM routing methods assign entire queries to one model, treating all reasoning steps as equal, which is inefficient for multi-step reasoning tasks where only critical steps need stronger models to prevent cascading failures.

Method: TRIM operates at step-level using process reward models to identify erroneous steps, making routing decisions based on step-level uncertainty and budget constraints with strategies ranging from simple threshold-based policies to more expressive ones that reason about long-horizon accuracy-cost trade-offs.

Result: On MATH-500, simplest thresholding strategy surpasses prior routing methods with 5x higher cost efficiency; advanced policies match strong model's performance using 80% fewer expensive model tokens. On AIME, achieves up to 6x higher cost efficiency.

Conclusion: Targeted step-level interventions can fundamentally transform inference efficiency by confining expensive calls to precisely those steps where stronger models prevent cascading errors, and step-level difficulty represents fundamental characteristics of reasoning across math tasks.

Abstract: Multi-step reasoning tasks like mathematical problem solving are vulnerable to cascading failures, where a single incorrect step leads to complete solution breakdown. Current LLM routing methods assign entire queries to one model, treating all reasoning steps as equal. We propose TRIM (Targeted routing in multi-step reasoning tasks), which routes only critical steps$\unicode{x2013}$those likely to derail the solution$\unicode{x2013}$to larger models while letting smaller models handle routine continuations. Our key insight is that targeted step-level interventions can fundamentally transform inference efficiency by confining expensive calls to precisely those steps where stronger models prevent cascading errors. TRIM operates at the step-level: it uses process reward models to identify erroneous steps and makes routing decisions based on step-level uncertainty and budget constraints. We develop several routing strategies within TRIM, ranging from a simple threshold-based policy to more expressive policies that reason about long-horizon accuracy-cost trade-offs and uncertainty in step-level correctness estimates. On MATH-500, even the simplest thresholding strategy surpasses prior routing methods with 5x higher cost efficiency, while more advanced policies match the strong, expensive model's performance using 80% fewer expensive model tokens. On harder benchmarks such as AIME, TRIM achieves up to 6x higher cost efficiency. All methods generalize effectively across math reasoning tasks, demonstrating that step-level difficulty represents fundamental characteristics of reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NoReGeo is a new benchmark that tests LLMs' intrinsic geometric understanding without requiring reasoning or algebra, revealing that even top models like GPT-4 only achieve 65% accuracy, showing a significant gap in their native geometric cognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on reasoning-based geometry using algebraic methods, but there's a need to evaluate whether LLMs can inherently encode spatial relationships and recognize geometric properties directly, without relying on computation or reasoning.

Method: Created NoReGeo benchmark with 2,500 trivial geometric problems across 25 categories, designed to be solvable purely through native geometric understanding with known object locations. Tested state-of-the-art models including GPT-4 and conducted ablation experiments to study the emergence of geometric understanding through fine-tuning.

Result: Even the most advanced LLMs achieve only up to 65% accuracy on binary classification tasks. Ablation experiments show geometric understanding doesn't emerge through fine-tuning alone, indicating specialized training approaches are needed from the outset.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have a significant gap in their ability to natively grasp geometric concepts. The findings provide a foundation for future research toward developing models with true geometric cognition, requiring specialized training approaches rather than just fine-tuning.

Abstract: We present NoReGeo, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the intrinsic geometric understanding of large language models (LLMs) without relying on reasoning or algebraic computation. Unlike existing benchmarks that primarily assess models' proficiency in reasoning-based geometry-where solutions are derived using algebraic methods-NoReGeo focuses on evaluating whether LLMs can inherently encode spatial relationships and recognize geometric properties directly. Our benchmark comprises 2,500 trivial geometric problems spanning 25 categories, each carefully crafted to be solvable purely through native geometric understanding, assuming known object locations. We assess a range of state-of-the-art models on NoReGeo, including frontier models like GPT-4, observing that even the most advanced systems achieve an overall maximum of 65% accuracy in binary classification tasks. Further, our ablation experiments demonstrate that such geometric understanding does not emerge through fine-tuning alone, indicating that effective training for geometric comprehension requires a specialized approach from the outset. Our findings highlight a significant gap in current LLMs' ability to natively grasp geometric concepts, providing a foundation for future research toward models with true geometric cognition.

*Xin Guan,Zijian Li,Shen Huang,Pengjun Xie,Jingren Zhou,Jiuxin Cao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EAPO introduces evidence-augmented RL with dense process supervision to improve long-context reasoning by addressing sparse reward issues and focusing on evidence extraction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL approaches for LLM reasoning in long-context scenarios suffer from sparse outcome rewards, which fail to penalize ungrounded "lucky guesses" and leave evidence retrieval largely unsupervised, creating a critical bottleneck.

Method: EAPO establishes Evidence-Augmented Reasoning paradigm, validates evidence extraction as the bottleneck via Tree-Structured Evidence Sampling, then introduces specialized RL with Group-Relative Evidence Reward for dense process supervision, plus Adaptive Reward-Policy Co-Evolution to refine reward model throughout training.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations across eight benchmarks demonstrate that EAPO significantly enhances long-context reasoning performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: EAPO successfully addresses the sparse reward problem in long-context reasoning by providing dense process supervision focused on evidence quality, leading to substantial performance improvements through evidence-augmented policy optimization.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has advanced LLM reasoning, applying it to long-context scenarios is hindered by sparsity of outcome rewards. This limitation fails to penalize ungrounded "lucky guesses," leaving the critical process of needle-in-a-haystack evidence retrieval largely unsupervised. To address this, we propose EAPO (Evidence-Augmented Policy Optimization). We first establish the Evidence-Augmented Reasoning paradigm, validating via Tree-Structured Evidence Sampling that precise evidence extraction is the decisive bottleneck for long-context reasoning. Guided by this insight, EAPO introduces a specialized RL algorithm where a reward model computes a Group-Relative Evidence Reward, providing dense process supervision to explicitly improve evidence quality. To sustain accurate supervision throughout training, we further incorporate an Adaptive Reward-Policy Co-Evolution mechanism. This mechanism iteratively refines the reward model using outcome-consistent rollouts, sharpening its discriminative capability to ensure precise process guidance. Comprehensive evaluations across eight benchmarks demonstrate that EAPO significantly enhances long-context reasoning performance compared to SOTA baselines.

TL;DR: C-GRASP is a guardrailed RAG-enhanced pipeline that decomposes HRV interpretation into eight traceable steps to mitigate physiological hallucinations in LLMs, achieving 37.3% accuracy in emotion classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Applying LLMs to HRV interpretation is hindered by physiological hallucinations including RSA contamination, short-data instability in nonlinear metrics, and neglect of individualized baselines in favor of population norms.

Method: C-GRASP uses a guardrailed RAG-enhanced pipeline with eight traceable reasoning steps, featuring a Z-score Priority Hierarchy that weights individualized baseline shifts over normative statistics, and automated RSA-aware guardrails to prevent spectral contamination.

Result: On 414 trials from DREAMER dataset, C-GRASP with high-scale reasoning models achieved 37.3% accuracy in 4-class emotion classification and 69.6% Clinical Reasoning Consistency score. Ablation studies confirmed the individualized Delta Z-score module prevents population bias.

Conclusion: C-GRASP transitions affective computing from black-box classification to transparent, evidence-based clinical decision support, enabling safer AI integration in biomedical engineering by mitigating LLM hallucinations in HRV interpretation.

Abstract: Heart rate variability (HRV) is a pivotal noninvasive marker for autonomic monitoring; however, applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to HRV interpretation is hindered by physiological hallucinations. These include respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) contamination, short-data instability in nonlinear metrics, and the neglect of individualized baselines in favor of population norms. We propose C-GRASP (Clinically-Grounded Reasoning for Affective Signal Processing), a guardrailed RAG-enhanced pipeline that decomposes HRV interpretation into eight traceable reasoning steps. Central to C-GRASP is a Z-score Priority Hierarchy that enforces the weighting of individualized baseline shifts over normative statistics. The system effectively mitigates spectral hallucinations through automated RSA-aware guardrails, preventing contamination of frequency-domain indices. Evaluated on 414 trials from the DREAMER dataset, C-GRASP integrated with high-scale reasoning models (e.g., MedGemma3-thinking) achieved superior performance in 4-class emotion classification (37.3% accuracy) and a Clinical Reasoning Consistency (CRC) score of 69.6%. Ablation studies confirm that the individualized Delta Z-score module serves as the critical logical anchor, preventing the "population bias" common in native LLMs. Ultimately, C-GRASP transitions affective computing from black-box classification to transparent, evidence-based clinical decision support, paving the way for safer AI integration in biomedical engineering.

*Xuancheng Ren,Shijing Hu,Zhihui Lu,Jiangqi Huang,Qiang Duan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LatentRefusal is a safety mechanism for LLM-based text-to-SQL systems that predicts query answerability from hidden model activations to refuse unanswerable/underspecified queries, improving F1 to 88.5% with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unanswerable and underspecified queries in text-to-SQL systems can generate executable programs that produce misleading results or violate safety constraints, creating deployment barriers. Existing refusal strategies are either brittle (output-level instruction following) or complex/overhead-heavy (uncertainty estimation).

Method: Formalizes safe refusal as answerability-gating problem; proposes LatentRefusal using intermediate hidden activations of LLMs to predict query answerability; introduces Tri-Residual Gated Encoder to suppress schema noise and amplify sparse cues of question-schema mismatch.

Result: Extensive evaluations across diverse ambiguous/unanswerable settings show effectiveness; improves average F1 to 88.5% across four benchmarks on both backbones; adds only ~2ms probe overhead; provides attachable, efficient safety layer.

Conclusion: LatentRefusal offers a practical solution for safe text-to-SQL deployment by leveraging latent signals from model activations to detect unanswerable queries, balancing accuracy and efficiency while addressing limitations of existing refusal approaches.

Abstract: In LLM-based text-to-SQL systems, unanswerable and underspecified user queries may generate not only incorrect text but also executable programs that yield misleading results or violate safety constraints, posing a major barrier to safe deployment. Existing refusal strategies for such queries either rely on output-level instruction following, which is brittle due to model hallucinations, or estimate output uncertainty, which adds complexity and overhead. To address this challenge, we formalize safe refusal in text-to-SQL systems as an answerability-gating problem and propose LatentRefusal, a latent-signal refusal mechanism that predicts query answerability from intermediate hidden activations of a large language model. We introduce the Tri-Residual Gated Encoder, a lightweight probing architecture, to suppress schema noise and amplify sparse, localized cues of question-schema mismatch that indicate unanswerability. Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse ambiguous and unanswerable settings, together with ablation studies and interpretability analyses, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and show that LatentRefusal provides an attachable and efficient safety layer for text-to-SQL systems. Across four benchmarks, LatentRefusal improves average F1 to 88.5 percent on both backbones while adding approximately 2 milliseconds of probe overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agents struggle with ultra-long-horizon autonomy in scientific discovery, failing to maintain strategic coherence over experimental cycles spanning days/weeks due to overwhelming execution details and inability to consolidate sparse feedback into long-term guidance.

Method: Introduces Hierarchical Cognitive Caching (HCC), a multi-tiered architecture inspired by computer systems that reframes context management as cognitive accumulation. HCC dynamically distills transient execution traces into stable knowledge and cross-task wisdom, enabling agents to decouple immediate execution from long-term experimental strategy.

Result: ML-Master 2.0 achieves state-of-the-art 56.44% medal rate on OpenAI's MLE-Bench under 24-hour budgets, demonstrating superior performance in ultra-long-horizon machine learning engineering tasks.

Conclusion: Ultra-long-horizon autonomy provides a scalable blueprint for AI capable of autonomous exploration beyond human-precedent complexities, with HCC overcoming the scaling limits of static context windows for sustained strategic coherence.

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence toward agentic science is currently bottlenecked by the challenge of ultra-long-horizon autonomy, the ability to sustain strategic coherence and iterative correction over experimental cycles spanning days or weeks. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated prowess in short-horizon reasoning, they are easily overwhelmed by execution details in the high-dimensional, delayed-feedback environments of real-world research, failing to consolidate sparse feedback into coherent long-term guidance. Here, we present ML-Master 2.0, an autonomous agent that masters ultra-long-horizon machine learning engineering (MLE) which is a representative microcosm of scientific discovery. By reframing context management as a process of cognitive accumulation, our approach introduces Hierarchical Cognitive Caching (HCC), a multi-tiered architecture inspired by computer systems that enables the structural differentiation of experience over time. By dynamically distilling transient execution traces into stable knowledge and cross-task wisdom, HCC allows agents to decouple immediate execution from long-term experimental strategy, effectively overcoming the scaling limits of static context windows. In evaluations on OpenAI's MLE-Bench under 24-hour budgets, ML-Master 2.0 achieves a state-of-the-art medal rate of 56.44%. Our findings demonstrate that ultra-long-horizon autonomy provides a scalable blueprint for AI capable of autonomous exploration beyond human-precedent complexities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ErrEval is an error-aware evaluation framework for automatic question generation that uses explicit error diagnostics to improve assessment accuracy and reduce overestimation of low-quality questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QG evaluation methods (including LLM-based evaluators) are black-box and holistic, lacking explicit error modeling. This leads to neglect of critical defects like factual hallucinations and answer mismatches, resulting in overestimation of question quality.

Method: ErrEval reformulates evaluation as a two-stage process: 1) Error diagnosis using a lightweight plug-and-play Error Identifier that detects and categorizes common errors across structural, linguistic, and content aspects; 2) Informed scoring where diagnostic signals are incorporated as explicit evidence to guide LLM evaluators toward more fine-grained judgments.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show ErrEval improves alignment with human judgments. Further analyses confirm it effectively mitigates overestimation of low-quality questions.

Conclusion: Explicit error diagnostics enhance QG evaluation by providing more accurate assessment of question quality, addressing the limitations of current black-box evaluation methods.

Abstract: Automatic Question Generation (QG) often produces outputs with critical defects, such as factual hallucinations and answer mismatches. However, existing evaluation methods, including LLM-based evaluators, mainly adopt a black-box and holistic paradigm without explicit error modeling, leading to the neglect of such defects and overestimation of question quality. To address this issue, we propose ErrEval, a flexible and Error-aware Evaluation framework that enhances QG evaluation through explicit error diagnostics. Specifically, ErrEval reformulates evaluation as a two-stage process of error diagnosis followed by informed scoring. At the first stage, a lightweight plug-and-play Error Identifier detects and categorizes common errors across structural, linguistic, and content-related aspects. These diagnostic signals are then incorporated as explicit evidence to guide LLM evaluators toward more fine-grained and grounded judgments. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of ErrEval, showing that incorporating explicit diagnostics improves alignment with human judgments. Further analyses confirm that ErrEval effectively mitigates the overestimation of low-quality questions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy policies are difficult for people to comprehend due to complex legal language and inconsistent practices across sectors, creating a need for automated, large-scale analysis tools.

Method: Combines LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and custom knowledge bases in a three-component framework: pre-processor, LLM-based processor, and data flow post-processor to extract personal data flows and construct graphs.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness and accuracy through a case study examining ten privacy policies from the automotive industry, showing the framework can extract personal data flows and construct analyzable data flow graphs.

Conclusion: LADFA provides a flexible, customizable framework for automated privacy policy analysis that can be extended to other text-based analysis tasks beyond privacy policies.

Abstract: Privacy policies help inform people about organisations' personal data processing practices, covering different aspects such as data collection, data storage, and sharing of personal data with third parties. Privacy policies are often difficult for people to fully comprehend due to the lengthy and complex legal language used and inconsistent practices across different sectors and organisations. To help conduct automated and large-scale analyses of privacy policies, many researchers have studied applications of machine learning and natural language processing techniques, including large language models (LLMs). While a limited number of prior studies utilised LLMs for extracting personal data flows from privacy policies, our approach builds on this line of work by combining LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a customised knowledge base derived from existing studies. This paper presents the development of LADFA, an end-to-end computational framework, which can process unstructured text in a given privacy policy, extract personal data flows and construct a personal data flow graph, and conduct analysis of the data flow graph to facilitate insight discovery. The framework consists of a pre-processor, an LLM-based processor, and a data flow post-processor. We demonstrated and validated the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach by conducting a case study that involved examining ten selected privacy policies from the automotive industry. Moreover, it is worth noting that LADFA is designed to be flexible and customisable, making it suitable for a range of text-based analysis tasks beyond privacy policy analysis.

TL;DR: LLMdoctor is a novel test-time alignment framework using a patient-doctor paradigm with token-level reward acquisition and flow-guided preference optimization to align frozen LLMs efficiently while preserving diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fine-tuning for LLM alignment is computationally expensive and inflexible, while existing test-time methods rely on distorted trajectory-level signals or inefficient sampling, limiting performance and failing to preserve generative diversity.

Method: LLMdoctor uses a patient-doctor paradigm where a frozen patient LLM is steered by a smaller doctor model. It extracts fine-grained token-level preference signals from behavioral variations, then trains the doctor via token-level flow-guided preference optimization (TFPO) that establishes flow consistency across all subtrajectories.

Result: Extensive experiments show LLMdoctor significantly outperforms existing test-time alignment methods and even surpasses the performance of full fine-tuning approaches like DPO.

Conclusion: LLMdoctor provides an efficient test-time alignment framework that enables precise token-by-token alignment while inherently preserving generation diversity, addressing key limitations of traditional fine-tuning and existing test-time methods.

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences is critical, yet traditional fine-tuning methods are computationally expensive and inflexible. While test-time alignment offers a promising alternative, existing approaches often rely on distorted trajectory-level signals or inefficient sampling, fundamentally capping performance and failing to preserve the generative diversity of the base model. This paper introduces LLMdoctor, a novel framework for efficient test-time alignment that operates via a patient-doctor paradigm. It integrates token-level reward acquisition with token-level flow-guided preference optimization (TFPO) to steer a large, frozen patient LLM with a smaller, specialized doctor model. Unlike conventional methods that rely on trajectory-level rewards, LLMdoctor first extracts fine-grained, token-level preference signals from the patient model's behavioral variations. These signals then guide the training of the doctor model via TFPO, which establishes flow consistency across all subtrajectories, enabling precise token-by-token alignment while inherently preserving generation diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLMdoctor significantly outperforms existing test-time alignment methods and even surpasses the performance of full fine-tuning approaches like DPO.

TL;DR: NSR-Boost is a neuro-symbolic residual boosting framework that enables safe, low-cost upgrades of legacy GBDT models in production by performing targeted repairs on hard regions using LLM-generated symbolic experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Upgrading legacy GBDT models in high-concurrency production environments faces prohibitive retraining costs and systemic risks, creating a need for non-intrusive solutions that can safely improve existing models.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Identify hard regions through residuals, 2) Generate interpretable experts using LLM to create symbolic code structures and fine-tune parameters with Bayesian optimization, 3) Dynamically integrate experts with legacy model output via lightweight aggregator.

Result: Successfully deployed in Qfin Holdings' core financial risk control system, significantly outperforms SOTA baselines across six public datasets and one private dataset, shows excellent performance gains on real-world online data.

Conclusion: Effectively captures long-tail risks missed by traditional models and offers a safe, low-cost evolutionary paradigm for industrial model upgrades without requiring full retraining.

Abstract: Although the Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs) dominate industrial tabular applications, upgrading legacy models in high-concurrency production environments still faces prohibitive retraining costs and systemic risks. To address this problem, we present NSR-Boost, a neuro-symbolic residual boosting framework designed specifically for industrial scenarios. Its core advantage lies in being "non-intrusive". It treats the legacy model as a frozen model and performs targeted repairs on "hard regions" where predictions fail. The framework comprises three key stages: first, finding hard regions through residuals, then generating interpretable experts by generating symbolic code structures using Large Language Model (LLM) and fine-tuning parameters using Bayesian optimization, and finally dynamically integrating experts with legacy model output through a lightweight aggregator. We report on the successful deployment of NSR-Boost within the core financial risk control system at Qfin Holdings. This framework not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines across six public datasets and one private dataset, more importantly, shows excellent performance gains on real-world online data. In conclusion, it effectively captures long-tail risks missed by traditional models and offers a safe, low-cost evolutionary paradigm for industry.

TL;DR: Proposes ChartComplete dataset covering 30 chart types to address limitations of existing chart understanding benchmarks that only cover small sets of chart types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing chart understanding benchmarks for multimodal large language models are limited to small sets of chart types, creating a gap in comprehensive evaluation capabilities.

Method: Created ChartComplete dataset based on visualization community's chart taxonomy, covering 30 different chart types as a collection of classified chart images without learning signals.

Result: Developed comprehensive ChartComplete dataset that addresses the diversity gap in chart understanding benchmarks by covering 30 chart types.

Conclusion: ChartComplete dataset is presented to the community as a foundation for building more comprehensive chart understanding benchmarks and advancing multimodal chart analysis research.

Abstract: With advancements in deep learning (DL) and computer vision techniques, the field of chart understanding is evolving rapidly. In particular, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are proving to be efficient and accurate in understanding charts. To accurately measure the performance of MLLMs, the research community has developed multiple datasets to serve as benchmarks. By examining these datasets, we found that they are all limited to a small set of chart types. To bridge this gap, we propose the ChartComplete dataset. The dataset is based on a chart taxonomy borrowed from the visualization community, and it covers thirty different chart types. The dataset is a collection of classified chart images and does not include a learning signal. We present the ChartComplete dataset as is to the community to build upon it.

*Runhao Zhao,Weixin Zeng,Wentao Zhang,Chong Chen,Zhengpin Li,Xiang Zhao,Lei Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Domain-specific knowledge graphs often lack coverage, so the paper introduces DKGF task to enrich them by fusing facts from general knowledge graphs, proposing ExeFuse model using Fact-as-Program paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain-specific knowledge graphs (DKGs) have limited coverage compared to general knowledge graphs (GKGs), creating a need to enrich DKGs by integrating relevant facts from GKGs while addressing challenges of domain relevance ambiguity and knowledge granularity misalignment.

Method: Proposes ExeFuse, a Fact-as-Program paradigm that treats each GKG fact as a latent semantic program, maps abstract relations to granularity-aware operators, and verifies domain relevance via program executability on the target DKG in a unified probabilistic framework.

Result: Constructed two benchmarks (DKGF(W-I) and DKGF(Y-I)) with 21 evaluation configurations, and extensive experiments validated both the importance of the DKGF task and the effectiveness of the proposed ExeFuse model.

Conclusion: The paper introduces the novel DKGF task, proposes an effective ExeFuse model using Fact-as-Program paradigm, establishes standardized benchmarks, and demonstrates the approach's effectiveness in addressing domain relevance and granularity challenges in knowledge graph fusion.

Abstract: Domain-specific knowledge graphs (DKGs) often lack coverage compared to general knowledge graphs (GKGs). To address this, we introduce Domain-specific Knowledge Graph Fusion (DKGF), a novel task that enriches DKGs by integrating relevant facts from GKGs. DKGF faces two key challenges: high ambiguity in domain relevance and misalignment in knowledge granularity across graphs. We propose ExeFuse, a simple yet effective Fact-as-Program paradigm. It treats each GKG fact as a latent semantic program, maps abstract relations to granularity-aware operators, and verifies domain relevance via program executability on the target DKG. This unified probabilistic framework jointly resolves relevance and granularity issues. We construct two benchmarks, DKGF(W-I) and DKGF(Y-I), with 21 evaluation configurations. Extensive experiments validate the task's importance and our model's effectiveness, providing the first standardized testbed for DKGF.

### [126] [Breaking Up with Normatively Monolithic Agency with GRACE: A Reason-Based Neuro-Symbolic Architecture for Safe and Ethical AI Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10520)
*Felix Jahn,Yannic Muskalla,Lisa Dargasz,Patrick Schramowski,Kevin Baum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GRACE is a neuro-symbolic architecture that separates normative reasoning from instrumental decision-making to ensure AI agents act ethically while maintaining effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI agents become more autonomous and impactful in real-world contexts, there's a critical need to ensure their decisions are not just effective but also normatively aligned with ethical principles.

Method: GRACE uses a three-module architecture: Moral Module (deontic logic-based reasoning for permissible macro actions), Decision-Making Module (encapsulates target agent for optimal primitive actions), and Guard (monitors/enforces moral compliance). It combines symbolic reasoning for interpretability with neural components for effectiveness.

Result: The architecture enables formal verification, statistical guarantees of alignment, and interpretability. Demonstrated on an LLM therapy assistant, it allows stakeholders to understand, contest, and refine agent behavior.

Conclusion: GRACE provides a scalable, verifiable framework for aligning AI agents with ethical norms while maintaining their instrumental effectiveness, addressing the critical challenge of normative alignment in autonomous systems.

Abstract: As AI agents become increasingly autonomous, widely deployed in consequential contexts, and efficacious in bringing about real-world impacts, ensuring that their decisions are not only instrumentally effective but also normatively aligned has become critical. We introduce a neuro-symbolic reason-based containment architecture, Governor for Reason-Aligned ContainmEnt (GRACE), that decouples normative reasoning from instrumental decision-making and can contain AI agents of virtually any design. GRACE restructures decision-making into three modules: a Moral Module (MM) that determines permissible macro actions via deontic logic-based reasoning; a Decision-Making Module (DMM) that encapsulates the target agent while selecting instrumentally optimal primitive actions in accordance with derived macro actions; and a Guard that monitors and enforces moral compliance. The MM uses a reason-based formalism providing a semantic foundation for deontic logic, enabling interpretability, contestability, and justifiability. Its symbolic representation enriches the DMM's informational context and supports formal verification and statistical guarantees of alignment enforced by the Guard. We demonstrate GRACE on an example of a LLM therapy assistant, showing how it enables stakeholders to understand, contest, and refine agent behavior.

### [127] [Diagnosing Generalization Failures in Fine-Tuned LLMs: A Cross-Architectural Study on Phishing Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10524)
*Frank Bobe,Gregory D. Vetaw,Chase Pavlick,Darshan Bryner,Matthew Cook,Jose Salas-Vernis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fine-tuning LLMs for phishing detection reveals critical insights: generalization depends on architecture-data synergy, with Gemma 2 excelling on diverse data, Llama 3.1 failing to integrate diverse data, and Mistral showing consistent resilience across training paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite fine-tuning LLMs achieving state-of-the-art performance on specialized tasks, diagnosing why these models become brittle and fail to generalize remains a critical open problem that needs systematic investigation.

Method: Applied multi-layered diagnostic framework to cross-architectural study, fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Mistral models on phishing detection task, using SHAP analysis and mechanistic interpretability to uncover root causes of generalization failures.

Result: Three key findings: 1) Generalization driven by synergy between architecture and data diversity (Gemma 2 achieves >91% F1 only with diverse "generalist" dataset), 2) Generalization highly architecture-dependent (Llama 3.1 fails to integrate diverse data), 3) Some architectures inherently more generalizable (Mistral consistently resilient across training paradigms).

Conclusion: Reliable AI requires deep validation of the interplay between architecture, data, and training strategy; the work provides concrete methodology for diagnosing and understanding generalization failures by pinpointing flawed heuristics responsible for model brittleness.

Abstract: The practice of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved state-of-the-art performance on specialized tasks, yet diagnosing why these models become brittle and fail to generalize remains a critical open problem. To address this, we introduce and apply a multi-layered diagnostic framework to a cross-architectural study. We fine-tune Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Mistral models on a high-stakes phishing detection task and use SHAP analysis and mechanistic interpretability to uncover the root causes of their generalization failures. Our investigation reveals three critical findings: (1) Generalization is driven by a powerful synergy between architecture and data diversity. The Gemma 2 9B model achieves state-of-the-art performance (>91\% F1), but only when trained on a stylistically diverse ``generalist'' dataset. (2) Generalization is highly architecture-dependent. We diagnose a specific failure mode in Llama 3.1 8B, which performs well on a narrow domain but cannot integrate diverse data, leading to a significant performance drop. (3) Some architectures are inherently more generalizable. The Mistral model proves to be a consistent and resilient performer across multiple training paradigms. By pinpointing the flawed heuristics responsible for these failures, our work provides a concrete methodology for diagnosing and understanding generalization failures, underscoring that reliable AI requires deep validation of the interplay between architecture, data, and training strategy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Frontier AI models show heterogeneous safety performance across modalities, with GPT-5.2 being most balanced while others trade off benchmark safety, adversarial robustness, multilingual generalization, and compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite rapid advances in LLMs and MLLMs, it's unclear whether safety has improved proportionally due to fragmented evaluation practices limited to single modalities or threat models.

Method: Integrated safety evaluation of 7 frontier models across language, vision-language, and image generation using unified protocol with benchmark evaluation, adversarial evaluation, multilingual evaluation, and compliance evaluation.

Result: GPT-5.2 shows consistently strong and balanced safety performance, while other models exhibit trade-offs. Both language and vision-language modalities are vulnerable to adversarial attacks despite strong benchmark results. Text-to-image models achieve better alignment in regulated categories but remain brittle.

Conclusion: Safety in frontier models is multidimensional and shaped by modality, language, and evaluation scheme, highlighting the need for standardized safety evaluations to assess real-world risk and guide responsible development.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has produced substantial gains in reasoning, perception, and generative capability across language and vision. However, whether these advances yield commensurate improvements in safety remains unclear, in part due to fragmented evaluation practices limited to single modalities or threat models. In this report, we present an integrated safety evaluation of 7 frontier models: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Qwen3-VL, Doubao 1.8, Grok 4.1 Fast, Nano Banana Pro, and Seedream 4.5. We evaluate each model across language, vision-language, and image generation settings using a unified protocol that integrates benchmark evaluation, adversarial evaluation, multilingual evaluation, and compliance evaluation. Aggregating our evaluations into safety leaderboards and model safety profiles across multiple evaluation modes reveals a sharply heterogeneous safety landscape. While GPT-5.2 demonstrates consistently strong and balanced safety performance across evaluations, other models exhibit pronounced trade-offs among benchmark safety, adversarial alignment, multilingual generalization, and regulatory compliance. Both language and vision-language modalities show significant vulnerability under adversarial evaluation, with all models degrading substantially despite strong results on standard benchmarks. Text-to-image models achieve relatively stronger alignment in regulated visual risk categories, yet remain brittle under adversarial or semantically ambiguous prompts. Overall, these results show that safety in frontier models is inherently multidimensional--shaped by modality, language, and evaluation scheme, underscoring the need for standardized safety evaluations to accurately assess real-world risk and guide responsible model development and deployment.

*Yinzhi Zhao,Ming Wang,Shi Feng,Xiaocui Yang,Daling Wang,Yifei Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes SafeProbing, a decoding-time defense that surfaces latent safety signals in LLMs to detect jailbreak attacks early, improving safety without degrading utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM safety alignment is shallow and vulnerable to jailbreaks. Existing defenses either fail against sophisticated attacks or excessively degrade model utility. The authors observe that even jailbroken models exhibit internal safety signals during generation that are overridden by fluency drives.

Method: Examines LLM decoding process and proposes SafeProbing - an approach that explicitly surfaces latent safety-related signals during generation for early detection of unsafe content. The method leverages these intrinsic safety signals without requiring external detectors or heavy constraints.

Result: Experiments across diverse jailbreak attacks show significant safety enhancement with low over-refusal rates on benign inputs and preserved response quality. The approach outperforms existing defense mechanisms against sophisticated jailbreaks.

Conclusion: Activating intrinsic safety-awareness during decoding offers a promising complementary direction for defending against jailbreak attacks. The method demonstrates that latent safety signals exist even in jailbroken models and can be effectively leveraged for early detection.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across natural language tasks and are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. Despite extensive safety alignment efforts, recent studies show that such alignment is often shallow and remains vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Existing defense mechanisms, including decoding-based constraints and post-hoc content detectors, struggle against sophisticated jailbreaks, often intervening robust detection or excessively degrading model utility. In this work, we examine the decoding process of LLMs and make a key observation: even when successfully jailbroken, models internally exhibit latent safety-related signals during generation. However, these signals are overridden by the model's drive for fluent continuation, preventing timely self-correction or refusal. Building on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective approach that explicitly surfaces and leverages these latent safety signals for early detection of unsafe content during decoding. Experiments across diverse jailbreak attacks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances safety, while maintaining low over-refusal rates on benign inputs and preserving response quality. Our results suggest that activating intrinsic safety-awareness during decoding offers a promising and complementary direction for defending against jailbreak attacks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that understanding collective behavior in LLM-based multi-agent systems requires new theoretical frameworks and methods due to LLMs' unique characteristics of pre-trained knowledge and social priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding collective behavior of LLM-based agents is essential due to significant societal implications in terms of both risks and benefits. LLMs' distinctive features—pre-trained knowledge, implicit social priors, and in-context learning adaptation—require new approaches to study how these systems interact and produce emergent phenomena.

Method: Proposes an interactionist paradigm with alternative theoretical foundations, methodologies, and analytical tools to systematically examine how prior knowledge and embedded values interact with social context in multi-agent generative AI systems.

Result: The paper identifies four crucial directions for developing and deploying LLM-based collectives, focusing on theory, methods, and trans-disciplinary dialogue, though specific results are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: A new research paradigm is needed to understand LLM-based collective behavior, requiring interdisciplinary collaboration and novel approaches to address the unique challenges posed by LLMs' pre-trained knowledge and social priors in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: In this article, we argue that understanding the collective behavior of agents based on large language models (LLMs) is an essential area of inquiry, with important implications in terms of risks and benefits, impacting us as a society at many levels. We claim that the distinctive nature of LLMs--namely, their initialization with extensive pre-trained knowledge and implicit social priors, together with their capability of adaptation through in-context learning--motivates the need for an interactionist paradigm consisting of alternative theoretical foundations, methodologies, and analytical tools, in order to systematically examine how prior knowledge and embedded values interact with social context to shape emergent phenomena in multi-agent generative AI systems. We propose and discuss four directions that we consider crucial for the development and deployment of LLM-based collectives, focusing on theory, methods, and trans-disciplinary dialogue.

TL;DR: Symbolic algorithm for LTLf synthesis with multiple properties computes maximal realizable goal sets in one fixed-point computation instead of enumerating subsets, achieving up to 100x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LTLf synthesis with multiple properties uses enumeration of subsets when satisfying all properties is impossible, which is inefficient for large numbers of properties.

Method: Developed a fully symbolic algorithm using Boolean goal variables and exploiting monotonicity to compactly represent exponentially many goal combinations, computing relation between product-game states and realizable goal sets in one fixed-point computation.

Result: The approach substantially outperforms enumeration-based baselines with speedups of up to two orders of magnitude (up to 100x faster).

Conclusion: Symbolic representation of goal sets enables efficient computation of maximal realizable properties in LTLf synthesis without enumerating subsets, providing significant performance improvements.

Abstract: We study LTLf synthesis with multiple properties, where satisfying all properties may be impossible. Instead of enumerating subsets of properties, we compute in one fixed-point computation the relation between product-game states and the goal sets that are realizable from them, and we synthesize strategies achieving maximal realizable sets. We develop a fully symbolic algorithm that introduces Boolean goal variables and exploits monotonicity to represent exponentially many goal combinations compactly. Our approach substantially outperforms enumeration-based baselines, with speedups of up to two orders of magnitude.

TL;DR: HRM shows surprising failure modes on simple puzzles, exhibits "grokking" dynamics, and gets trapped in incorrect fixed points, suggesting it's "guessing" rather than reasoning. Three scaling strategies boost Sudoku-Extreme accuracy from 54.5% to 96.9%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the strengths and failure modes of Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) which achieves extraordinary performance on reasoning tasks but shows puzzling behaviors that need mechanistic explanation.

Method: Conducted mechanistic study of HRM's reasoning patterns, identified three surprising facts about its behavior, then proposed three scaling strategies: data augmentation, input perturbation, and model bootstrapping to improve performance.

Result: Developed Augmented HRM that boosts accuracy on Sudoku-Extreme from 54.5% to 96.9% by combining all three scaling methods, while providing insights into how reasoning models actually work.

Conclusion: HRM appears to be "guessing" rather than "reasoning" based on observed patterns, but this guessing behavior can be effectively scaled to dramatically improve performance on complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Hierarchical reasoning model (HRM) achieves extraordinary performance on various reasoning tasks, significantly outperforming large language model-based reasoners. To understand the strengths and potential failure modes of HRM, we conduct a mechanistic study on its reasoning patterns and find three surprising facts: (a) Failure of extremely simple puzzles, e.g., HRM can fail on a puzzle with only one unknown cell. We attribute this failure to the violation of the fixed point property, a fundamental assumption of HRM. (b) "Grokking" dynamics in reasoning steps, i.e., the answer is not improved uniformly, but instead there is a critical reasoning step that suddenly makes the answer correct; (c) Existence of multiple fixed points. HRM "guesses" the first fixed point, which could be incorrect, and gets trapped there for a while or forever. All facts imply that HRM appears to be "guessing" instead of "reasoning". Leveraging this "guessing" picture, we propose three strategies to scale HRM's guesses: data augmentation (scaling the quality of guesses), input perturbation (scaling the number of guesses by leveraging inference randomness), and model bootstrapping (scaling the number of guesses by leveraging training randomness). On the practical side, by combining all methods, we develop Augmented HRM, boosting accuracy on Sudoku-Extreme from 54.5% to 96.9%. On the scientific side, our analysis provides new insights into how reasoning models "reason".

### [134] [Structure and Diversity Aware Context Bubble Construction for Enterprise Retrieval Augmented Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10681)
*Amir Khurshid,Abhishek Sehgal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for constructing "context bubbles" that preserves document structure and enforces diversity constraints to create compact, informative context sets within token budgets, improving over traditional top-k RAG retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG approaches using top-k passage retrieval cause information fragmentation, over-retrieval, content duplication, and insufficient coverage of secondary query facets. There's a need for more structured, efficient context construction within limited token budgets.

Method: Proposes a structure-informed, diversity-constrained context bubble framework that organizes multi-granular spans (sections, rows) using task-conditioned structural priors. Starts from high-relevance anchor spans and constructs context bubbles through constrained selection balancing query relevance, marginal coverage, and redundancy penalties with explicit diversity and budget constraints.

Result: Experiments on enterprise documents show context bubbles significantly reduce redundant context, better cover secondary facets, and improve answer quality and citation faithfulness within limited context windows. Ablation studies confirm both structural priors and diversity constraints are necessary for optimal performance.

Conclusion: The context bubble framework provides a more efficient, structured alternative to traditional top-k RAG retrieval by preserving document structure and enforcing diversity constraints, resulting in compact, informative context sets with better coverage and auditability.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) contexts are typically constructed using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which involves ranking and selecting the top-k passages. The approach causes fragmentation in information graphs in document structures, over-retrieval, and duplication of content alongside insufficient query context, including 2nd and 3rd order facets. In this paper, a structure-informed and diversity-constrained context bubble construction framework is proposed that assembles coherent, citable bundles of spans under a strict token budget. The method preserves and exploits inherent document structure by organising multi-granular spans (e.g., sections and rows) and using task-conditioned structural priors to guide retrieval. Starting from high-relevance anchor spans, a context bubble is constructed through constrained selection that balances query relevance, marginal coverage, and redundancy penalties. It will explicitly constrain diversity and budget, producing compact and informative context sets, unlike top-k retrieval. Moreover, a full retrieval is emitted that traces the scoring and selection choices of the records, thus providing auditability and deterministic tuning. Experiments on enterprise documents demonstrate the efficiency of context bubble as it significantly reduces redundant context, is better able to cover secondary facets and has a better answer quality and citation faithfulness within a limited context window. Ablation studies demonstrate that both structural priors as well as diversity constraint selection are necessary; removing either component results in a decline in coverage and an increase in redundant or incomplete context.

*Han Jiang,Yao Xiao,Rachel Hurley,Shichao Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GenAI helps novice architects improve design performance but reduces creative self-efficacy, with effectiveness depending on user expertise and prompting strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how generative AI impacts architectural design performance, creative self-efficacy, and cognitive load, particularly examining differences based on user expertise and interaction strategies.

Method: Two-phase experimental design with 36 students completing architectural design tasks independently first, then with external tools (GenAI vs. control using existing project repository). Expert evaluation of designs, self-reported self-efficacy and cognitive load measurements, and difference-in-differences analysis with subgroup examination.

Result: No overall performance advantage for GenAI, but significant improvement for novice designers. Creative self-efficacy declined with GenAI use. No significant cognitive load differences, but iterative idea generation and visual feedback prompts reduced cognitive load.

Conclusion: GenAI effectiveness in architectural design depends on users' prior expertise and interaction strategies through prompting, suggesting tailored implementation approaches are needed.

Abstract: Our study examines how generative AI (GenAI) influences performance, creative self-efficacy, and cognitive load in architectural conceptual design tasks. Thirty-six student participants from Architectural Engineering and other disciplines completed a two-phase architectural design task, first independently and then with external tools (GenAI-assisted condition and control condition using an online repository of existing architectural projects). Design outcomes were evaluated by expert raters, while self-efficacy and cognitive load were self-reported after each phase. Difference-in-differences analyses revealed no overall performance advantage of GenAI across participants; however, subgroup analyses showed that GenAI significantly improved design performance for novice designers. In contrast, general creative self-efficacy declined for students using GenAI. Cognitive load did not differ significantly between conditions, though prompt usage patterns showed that iterative idea generation and visual feedback prompts were linked to greater reductions in cognitive load. These findings suggest that GenAI effectiveness depends on users' prior expertise and interaction strategies through prompting.
