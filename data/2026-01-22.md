*Ho Yin Au,Junkun Jiang,Jie Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SOSControl: A symbolic framework using Salient Orientation Symbolic scripts for precise body orientation and timing control in text-to-motion generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional text-to-motion frameworks lack precise control over body part orientations and motion timing, with existing joint keyframe approaches being unintuitive and limited to positional guidance only.

Method: 1) SOS script - programmable symbolic framework for specifying orientations and timing; 2) Automatic SOS extraction pipeline using temporally-constrained clustering and Saliency-based Masking Scheme; 3) SOSControl framework prioritizing salient orientation symbols with SMS-based data augmentation, gradient optimization, and ControlNet-based ACTOR-PAE Decoder.

Result: SOS extraction generates human-interpretable scripts with symbolic annotations at salient keyframes. SOSControl outperforms existing baselines in motion quality, controllability, and generalizability for timing and orientation control.

Conclusion: The proposed SOS framework successfully addresses limitations of traditional text-to-motion systems by providing intuitive symbolic control over body orientations and motion timing through interpretable scripts and enhanced generation methods.

Abstract: Traditional text-to-motion frameworks often lack precise control, and existing approaches based on joint keyframe locations provide only positional guidance, making it challenging and unintuitive to specify body part orientations and motion timing. To address these limitations, we introduce the Salient Orientation Symbolic (SOS) script, a programmable symbolic framework for specifying body part orientations and motion timing at keyframes. We further propose an automatic SOS extraction pipeline that employs temporally-constrained agglomerative clustering for frame saliency detection and a Saliency-based Masking Scheme (SMS) to generate sparse, interpretable SOS scripts directly from motion data. Moreover, we present the SOSControl framework, which treats the available orientation symbols in the sparse SOS script as salient and prioritizes satisfying these constraints during motion generation. By incorporating SMS-based data augmentation and gradient-based iterative optimization, the framework enhances alignment with user-specified constraints. Additionally, it employs a ControlNet-based ACTOR-PAE Decoder to ensure smooth and natural motion outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the SOS extraction pipeline generates human-interpretable scripts with symbolic annotations at salient keyframes, while the SOSControl framework outperforms existing baselines in motion quality, controllability, and generalizability with respect to motion timing and body part orientation control.

*Ziwen Zhong,Zhitao Shu,Yue Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cloud-based multimodal emotion recognition using cross-modal transformers achieves state-of-the-art performance with 3% F1-score improvement and 35% latency reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-modality emotion recognition systems have limited robustness and poor generalization in real-world environments, creating a need for more robust multimodal approaches.

Method: Proposes a Cloud-Based Cross-Modal Transformer framework integrating visual, auditory, and textual signals using pretrained encoders (Vision Transformer, Wav2Vec2, BERT) with cross-modal attention, deployed on cloud infrastructure with Kubernetes and TensorFlow Serving.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on IEMOCAP, MELD, and AffectNet datasets with 3.0% F1-score improvement, 12.9% cross-entropy loss reduction, and 128ms average response latency (35% reduction).

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient, real-time emotion recognition for applications like intelligent customer service and virtual tutoring, representing progress toward cloud-native affective computing and emotionally intelligent interactive systems.

Abstract: Emotion recognition is a fundamental component of next-generation human-computer interaction (HCI), enabling machines to perceive, understand, and respond to users' affective states. However, existing systems often rely on single-modality analysis such as facial expressions, speech tone, or textual sentiment, resulting in limited robustness and poor generalization in real-world environments. To address these challenges, this study proposes a Cloud-Based Cross-Modal Transformer (CMT) framework for multimodal emotion recognition and adaptive human-computer interaction. The proposed model integrates visual, auditory, and textual signals using pretrained encoders (Vision Transformer, Wav2Vec2, and BERT) and employs a cross-modal attention mechanism to capture complex interdependencies among heterogeneous features. By leveraging cloud computing infrastructure with distributed training on Kubernetes and TensorFlow Serving, the system enables scalable, low-latency emotion recognition for large-scale user interactions. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets including IEMOCAP, MELD, and AffectNet demonstrate that the CMT achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving the F1-score by 3.0 percent and reducing cross-entropy loss by 12.9 percent compared to strong multimodal baselines. Additionally, cloud deployment evaluations show an average response latency of 128 ms, representing a 35 percent reduction compared with conventional transformer-based fusion systems. These results confirm that the proposed framework enables efficient, real-time emotion recognition and adaptive feedback in applications such as intelligent customer service, virtual tutoring systems, and affective computing interfaces, marking an important step toward cloud-native affective computing and emotionally intelligent interactive systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A three-stage MLLM-driven framework for intelligent power grid drawing review that mimics human expert process: global semantic understanding, high-resolution region analysis, and confidence-aware decision making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated systems fail with ultra-high-resolution power grid drawings due to computational demands, information loss, and lack of holistic semantic understanding for design error identification.

Method: Three-stage framework using pre-trained MLLMs with prompt engineering: 1) Global semantic understanding to propose domain-specific regions from low-resolution overview, 2) High-resolution fine-grained recognition within proposed regions with confidence scores, 3) Comprehensive decision-making integrating confidence-aware results.

Result: Preliminary results on real-world power grid drawings show significant enhancement of MLLM's ability to grasp macroscopic semantic information and pinpoint design errors, with improved defect discovery accuracy and greater reliability in review judgments compared to traditional passive MLLM inference.

Conclusion: The research offers a novel, prompt-driven paradigm for intelligent and reliable power grid drawing review, demonstrating a more effective approach than traditional methods.

Abstract: The intelligent review of power grid engineering design drawings is crucial for power system safety. However, current automated systems struggle with ultra-high-resolution drawings due to high computational demands, information loss, and a lack of holistic semantic understanding for design error identification. This paper proposes a novel three-stage framework for intelligent power grid drawing review, driven by pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through advanced prompt engineering. Mimicking the human expert review process, the first stage leverages an MLLM for global semantic understanding to intelligently propose domain-specific semantic regions from a low-resolution overview. The second stage then performs high-resolution, fine-grained recognition within these proposed regions, acquiring detailed information with associated confidence scores. In the final stage, a comprehensive decision-making module integrates these confidence-aware results to accurately diagnose design errors and provide a reliability assessment. Preliminary results on real-world power grid drawings demonstrate our approach significantly enhances MLLM's ability to grasp macroscopic semantic information and pinpoint design errors, showing improved defect discovery accuracy and greater reliability in review judgments compared to traditional passive MLLM inference. This research offers a novel, prompt-driven paradigm for intelligent and reliable power grid drawing review.

### [4] [LURE: Latent Space Unblocking for Multi-Concept Reawakening in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14330)
*Mengyu Sun,Ziyuan Yang,Andrew Beng Jin Teoh,Junxu Liu,Haibo Hu,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LURE is a novel method that reawakens erased concepts in diffusion models by reconstructing latent space and guiding sampling trajectories, addressing limitations of existing prompt-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept erasure methods in diffusion models are vulnerable to reawakening, and current reawakening approaches focus only on prompt-level optimization, neglecting other generative factors like model parameters and latent states.

Method: LURE models generation as an implicit function to analyze multiple factors, then uses semantic re-binding to reconstruct latent space, Gradient Field Orthogonalization to prevent feature entanglement in multi-concept scenarios, and Latent Semantic Identification-Guided Sampling for stable reawakening.

Result: Extensive experiments show LURE enables simultaneous, high-fidelity reawakening of multiple erased concepts across diverse erasure tasks and methods.

Conclusion: LURE provides a comprehensive approach to concept reawakening by addressing multiple generative factors, offering insights into diffusion model vulnerabilities and enabling robust evaluation of erasure methods.

Abstract: Concept erasure aims to suppress sensitive content in diffusion models, but recent studies show that erased concepts can still be reawakened, revealing vulnerabilities in erasure methods. Existing reawakening methods mainly rely on prompt-level optimization to manipulate sampling trajectories, neglecting other generative factors, which limits a comprehensive understanding of the underlying dynamics. In this paper, we model the generation process as an implicit function to enable a comprehensive theoretical analysis of multiple factors, including text conditions, model parameters, and latent states. We theoretically show that perturbing each factor can reawaken erased concepts. Building on this insight, we propose a novel concept reawakening method: Latent space Unblocking for concept REawakening (LURE), which reawakens erased concepts by reconstructing the latent space and guiding the sampling trajectory. Specifically, our semantic re-binding mechanism reconstructs the latent space by aligning denoising predictions with target distributions to reestablish severed text-visual associations. However, in multi-concept scenarios, naive reconstruction can cause gradient conflicts and feature entanglement. To address this, we introduce Gradient Field Orthogonalization, which enforces feature orthogonality to prevent mutual interference. Additionally, our Latent Semantic Identification-Guided Sampling (LSIS) ensures stability of the reawakening process via posterior density verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LURE enables simultaneous, high-fidelity reawakening of multiple erased concepts across diverse erasure tasks and methods.

Conclusion: CityCube effectively exposes limitations in current VLMs' cross-view spatial reasoning in urban environments, highlighting the need for specialized benchmarks and showing that fine-tuning can improve performance but significant gaps with human reasoning remain.

Abstract: Cross-view spatial reasoning is essential for embodied AI, underpinning spatial understanding, mental simulation and planning in complex environments. Existing benchmarks primarily emphasize indoor or street settings, overlooking the unique challenges of open-ended urban spaces characterized by rich semantics, complex geometries, and view variations. To address this, we introduce CityCube, a systematic benchmark designed to probe cross-view reasoning capabilities of current VLMs in urban settings. CityCube integrates four viewpoint dynamics to mimic camera movements and spans a wide spectrum of perspectives from multiple platforms, e.g., vehicles, drones and satellites. For a comprehensive assessment, it features 5,022 meticulously annotated multi-view QA pairs categorized into five cognitive dimensions and three spatial relation expressions. A comprehensive evaluation of 33 VLMs reveals a significant performance disparity with humans: even large-scale models struggle to exceed 54.1% accuracy, remaining 34.2% below human performance. By contrast, small-scale fine-tuned VLMs achieve over 60.0% accuracy, highlighting the necessity of our benchmark. Further analyses indicate the task correlations and fundamental cognitive disparity between VLMs and human-like reasoning.

*A. Enes Doruk*

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current voxelization methods for 3D semantic occupancy prediction suffer from excessive computation complexity, brittle fusion processes, and breakdown under dynamic environmental settings, while autonomous vehicles need robust solutions for long-tail safety challenges.

Conclusion: The Gaussian-based adaptive fusion model provides a robust, efficient solution for 3D semantic occupancy prediction that overcomes limitations of current voxelization methods and addresses long-tail safety challenges for autonomous vehicles through effective camera-LiDAR multimodal integration.

Abstract: The sparse object detection paradigm shift towards dense 3D semantic occupancy prediction is necessary for dealing with long-tail safety challenges for autonomous vehicles. Nonetheless, the current voxelization methods commonly suffer from excessive computation complexity demands, where the fusion process is brittle, static, and breaks down under dynamic environmental settings. To this end, this research work enhances a novel Gaussian-based adaptive camera-LiDAR multimodal 3D occupancy prediction model that seamlessly bridges the semantic strengths of camera modality with the geometric strengths of LiDAR modality through a memory-efficient 3D Gaussian model. The proposed solution has four key components: (1) LiDAR Depth Feature Aggregation (LDFA), where depth-wise deformable sampling is employed for dealing with geometric sparsity, (2) Entropy-Based Feature Smoothing, where cross-entropy is employed for handling domain-specific noise, (3) Adaptive Camera-LiDAR Fusion, where dynamic recalibration of sensor outputs is performed based on model outputs, and (4) Gauss-Mamba Head that uses Selective State Space Models for global context decoding that enjoys linear computation complexity.

TL;DR: NASA introduces a multi-spectral aerial wildfire dataset and deep learning model for real-time fire perimeter detection, achieving 96% accuracy and 74% IoU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-altitude multi-spectral aerial imagery is scarce and expensive, yet needed for wildfire detection algorithms. Current methods lack sufficient data for training robust models.

Method: Created human-annotated dataset from NASA AMS with 12 spectral channels (IR, SWIR, thermal). Trained two deep neural networks: one for image classification and one for pixel-level segmentation, combined into real-time segmentation model.

Result: Model achieves 96% classification accuracy, 74% IoU, and 84% recall, surpassing past methods. Can detect wildfires at nighttime and behind clouds while distinguishing false positives. SWIR, IR, and thermal bands most important.

Conclusion: Multi-spectral aerial data enables robust wildfire detection even in challenging conditions. The dataset and model advance automated fire perimeter determination for real-time wildfire monitoring.

Abstract: High-altitude, multi-spectral, aerial imagery is scarce and expensive to acquire, yet it is necessary for algorithmic advances and application of machine learning models to high-impact problems such as wildfire detection. We introduce a human-annotated dataset from the NASA Autonomous Modular Sensor (AMS) using 12-channel, medium to high altitude (3 - 50 km) aerial wildfire images similar to those used in current US wildfire missions. Our dataset combines spectral data from 12 different channels, including infrared (IR), short-wave IR (SWIR), and thermal. We take imagery from 20 wildfire missions and randomly sample small patches to generate over 4000 images with high variability, including occlusions by smoke/clouds, easily-confused false positives, and nighttime imagery.
  We demonstrate results from a deep-learning model to automate the human-intensive process of fire perimeter determination. We train two deep neural networks, one for image classification and the other for pixel-level segmentation. The networks are combined into a unique real-time segmentation model to efficiently localize active wildfire on an incoming image feed. Our model achieves 96% classification accuracy, 74% Intersection-over-Union(IoU), and 84% recall surpassing past methods, including models trained on satellite data and classical color-rule algorithms. By leveraging a multi-spectral dataset, our model is able to detect active wildfire at nighttime and behind clouds, while distinguishing between false positives. We find that data from the SWIR, IR, and thermal bands is the most important to distinguish fire perimeters. Our code and dataset can be found here: https://github.com/nasa/Autonomous-Modular-Sensor-Wildfire-Segmentation/tree/main and https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-u4vs9rqwkwgdeeeoUhftCxrfe_4QPTn?=usp=drive_link

*Frank Bieder,Hendrik Königshof,Haohao Hu,Fabian Immel,Yinzhe Shen,Jan-Hendrik Pauls,Christoph Stiller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XD-MAP transfers sensor-specific knowledge from camera images to LiDAR by creating semantic parametric maps from camera detections to generate pseudo labels for LiDAR data without manual annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models depend on aligned training data, but available datasets often don't match deployment domains. Domain adaptation is needed to bridge gaps between different sensor modalities like camera and LiDAR.

Method: Leverages detections from neural networks on camera images to create semantic parametric maps, which are modeled to produce pseudo labels in the LiDAR domain without manual annotation. Unlike previous approaches, doesn't require direct sensor overlap and extends angular perception from front-view to 360°.

Result: Outperforms single shot baselines by +19.5 mIoU for 2D semantic segmentation, +19.5 PQth for 2D panoptic segmentation, and +32.3 mIoU in 3D semantic segmentation on large-scale road feature dataset.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effective transfer of knowledge from camera to LiDAR without manual labeling, achieving strong performance on LiDAR data and enabling cross-sensor domain adaptation without direct overlap requirements.

Abstract: Until open-world foundation models match the performance of specialized approaches, the effectiveness of deep learning models remains heavily dependent on dataset availability. Training data must align not only with the target object categories but also with the sensor characteristics and modalities. To bridge the gap between available datasets and deployment domains, domain adaptation strategies are widely used. In this work, we propose a novel approach to transferring sensor-specific knowledge from an image dataset to LiDAR, an entirely different sensing domain. Our method XD-MAP leverages detections from a neural network on camera images to create a semantic parametric map. The map elements are modeled to produce pseudo labels in the target domain without any manual annotation effort. Unlike previous domain transfer approaches, our method does not require direct overlap between sensors and enables extending the angular perception range from a front-view camera to a full 360 view. On our large-scale road feature dataset, XD-MAP outperforms single shot baseline approaches by +19.5 mIoU for 2D semantic segmentation, +19.5 PQth for 2D panoptic segmentation, and +32.3 mIoU in 3D semantic segmentation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach achieving strong performance on LiDAR data without any manual labeling.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified OCR system that combines reading, detection, and grounding capabilities in a single checkpoint, addressing the need for comprehensive document understanding beyond basic text recognition.

Method: Fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B models on business documents, scientific articles, and synthetic grounding data to create GutenOCR models with prompt-based interface for full-page/localized reading, bounding boxes, and conditional queries.

Conclusion: GutenOCR demonstrates that fine-tuning vision-language models can create powerful unified OCR systems with strong grounding capabilities, though certain document types and tasks present ongoing challenges that need to be addressed in future work.

Abstract: GutenOCR is a family of grounded OCR front-ends obtained by fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B.

Trained on business documents, scientific articles, and synthetic grounding data, the models support full-page and localized reading with line- and paragraph-level bounding boxes and conditional ``where is x?'' queries. We introduce a grounded OCR evaluation protocol and show that GutenOCR-7B more than doubles the composite grounded OCR score of its Qwen2.5-VL-7B backbone on 10.5K held-out business and scientific pages (0.40 to 0.82). On Fox and OmniDocBench v1.5, our approach substantially improves region- and line-level OCR as well as text-detection recall, but reveals trade-offs in page-level linearization, color-guided OCR, and formula-heavy layouts.

### [12] [PAS-Mamba: Phase-Amplitude-Spatial State Space Model for MRI Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14530)
*Xiaoyan Kui,Zijie Fan,Zexin Ji,Qinsong Li,Hao Xu,Weixin Si,Haodong Xu,Beiji Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAS-Mamba is a novel MRI reconstruction framework that decouples phase and magnitude modeling in frequency domain using specialized branches, combines with spatial features via LocalMamba, and employs circular frequency scanning with dual-domain fusion for superior reconstruction performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MRI reconstruction methods treat frequency domain as a whole, neglecting that phase and amplitude carry fundamentally different information (phase governs structure, amplitude reflects pixel intensity), leading to interference in feature learning when modeled together.

Method: Proposes PAS-Mamba with: 1) Image-domain LocalMamba preserving spatial locality; 2) Frequency-domain decoupling into separate phase and amplitude branches; 3) Circular Frequency Domain Scanning (CFDS) for concentric frequency serialization; 4) Dual-Domain Complementary Fusion Module (DDCFM) for adaptive fusion and bidirectional exchange.

Result: Extensive experiments on IXI and fastMRI knee datasets show PAS-Mamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art reconstruction methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of decoupled phase-amplitude modeling and dual-domain fusion.

Conclusion: Decoupling phase and amplitude modeling in frequency domain while maintaining spatial features and enabling bidirectional domain exchange leads to superior MRI reconstruction, addressing limitations of unified frequency-domain approaches.

Abstract: Joint feature modeling in both the spatial and frequency domains has become a mainstream approach in MRI reconstruction. However, existing methods generally treat the frequency domain as a whole, neglecting the differences in the information carried by its internal components. According to Fourier transform theory, phase and amplitude represent different types of information in the image. Our spectrum swapping experiments show that magnitude mainly reflects pixel-level intensity, while phase predominantly governs image structure. To prevent interference between phase and magnitude feature learning caused by unified frequency-domain modeling, we propose the Phase-Amplitude-Spatial State Space Model (PAS-Mamba) for MRI Reconstruction, a framework that decouples phase and magnitude modeling in the frequency domain and combines it with image-domain features for better reconstruction. In the image domain, LocalMamba preserves spatial locality to sharpen fine anatomical details. In frequency domain, we disentangle amplitude and phase into two specialized branches to avoid representational coupling. To respect the concentric geometry of frequency information, we propose Circular Frequency Domain Scanning (CFDS) to serialize features from low to high frequencies. Finally, a Dual-Domain Complementary Fusion Module (DDCFM) adaptively fuses amplitude phase representations and enables bidirectional exchange between frequency and image domains, delivering superior reconstruction. Extensive experiments on the IXI and fastMRI knee datasets show that PAS-Mamba consistently outperforms state of the art reconstruction methods.

TL;DR: SDT-Net: Dual-teacher single-student framework for scribble-supervised medical image segmentation with dynamic teacher switching and hierarchical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scribble annotations reduce annotation burden but introduce ambiguity, leading to noisy pseudo-labels and poor boundary learning in medical image segmentation.

Method: Dual-teacher single-student framework with Dynamic Teacher Switching (DTS) module, Pick Reliable Pixels (PRP) mechanism for pseudo-label refinement, and Hierarchical Consistency (HiCo) module for multi-level feature alignment.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on ACDC and MSCMRseg datasets, producing more accurate and anatomically plausible segmentation.

Conclusion: SDT-Net effectively maximizes supervision quality from weak scribble annotations through adaptive teacher selection and synergistic guidance mechanisms.

Abstract: Scribble-supervised methods have emerged to mitigate the prohibitive annotation burden in medical image segmentation. However, the inherent sparsity of these annotations introduces significant ambiguity, which results in noisy pseudo-label propagation and hinders the learning of robust anatomical boundaries. To address this challenge, we propose SDT-Net, a novel dual-teacher, single-student framework designed to maximize supervision quality from these weak signals. Our method features a Dynamic Teacher Switching (DTS) module to adaptively select the most reliable teacher. This selected teacher then guides the student via two synergistic mechanisms: high-confidence pseudo-labels, refined by a Pick Reliable Pixels (PRP) mechanism, and multi-level feature alignment, enforced by a Hierarchical Consistency (HiCo) module. Extensive experiments on the ACDC and MSCMRseg datasets demonstrate that SDT-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing more accurate and anatomically plausible segmentation.

Method: Develops a fuzzy controller (FC-r) based on key system parameters and inference metrics, then proposes a video inference enhancement framework that leverages spatiotemporal correlation of targets across frames and dynamically switches between models of varying scales based on real-time device resource conditions.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively achieves a balance between resource utilization and inference performance.

Conclusion: The fuzzy controller-guided framework successfully addresses the resource efficiency vs. inference performance trade-off in video inference enhancement by enabling dynamic model switching based on real-time conditions.

Abstract: Existing video inference (VI) enhancement methods typically aim to improve performance by scaling up model sizes and employing sophisticated network architectures. While these approaches demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, they often overlooked the trade-off of resource efficiency and inference effectiveness, leading to inefficient resource utilization and suboptimal inference performance. To address this problem, a fuzzy controller (FC-r) is developed based on key system parameters and inference-related metrics. Guided by the FC-r, a VI enhancement framework is proposed, where the spatiotemporal correlation of targets across adjacent video frames is leveraged. Given the real-time resource conditions of the target device, the framework can dynamically switch between models of varying scales during VI. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively achieves a balance between resource utilization and inference performance.

### [15] [Anatomically Guided Latent Diffusion for Brain MRI Progression Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14584)
*Cheng Wan,Bahram Jafrasteh,Ehsan Adeli,Miaomiao Zhang,Qingyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AG-LDM is a segmentation-guided latent diffusion model that simplifies brain MRI progression modeling while improving anatomical consistency and clinical covariate utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches like BrLP have architectural complexity, suboptimal use of clinical covariates, and limited anatomical consistency guarantees, necessitating a simpler yet more effective framework for longitudinal brain MRI progression modeling.

Method: Proposes Anatomically Guided Latent Diffusion Model (AG-LDM) that directly fuses baseline anatomy, noisy follow-up states, and clinical covariates at input level, avoiding auxiliary control networks. Uses lightweight 3D tissue segmentation model (WarpSeg) for explicit anatomical supervision during both autoencoder fine-tuning and diffusion training.

Result: Matches or surpasses more complex diffusion models on 31,713 ADNI longitudinal pairs, achieves state-of-the-art image quality, 15-20% reduction in volumetric errors, 31.5x higher sensitivity to clinical covariates than BrLP, and generates biologically plausible Alzheimer's progression trajectories.

Conclusion: AG-LDM is an efficient, anatomically grounded framework for reliable brain MRI progression modeling that simplifies training while improving anatomical consistency and clinical covariate utilization.

Abstract: Accurately modeling longitudinal brain MRI progression is crucial for understanding neurodegenerative diseases and predicting individualized structural changes. Existing state-of-the-art approaches, such as Brain Latent Progression (BrLP), often use multi-stage training pipelines with auxiliary conditioning modules but suffer from architectural complexity, suboptimal use of conditional clinical covariates, and limited guarantees of anatomical consistency. We propose Anatomically Guided Latent Diffusion Model (AG-LDM), a segmentation-guided framework that enforces anatomically consistent progression while substantially simplifying the training pipeline. AG-LDM conditions latent diffusion by directly fusing baseline anatomy, noisy follow-up states, and clinical covariates at the input level, a strategy that avoids auxiliary control networks by learning a unified, end-to-end model that represents both anatomy and progression. A lightweight 3D tissue segmentation model (WarpSeg) provides explicit anatomical supervision during both autoencoder fine-tuning and diffusion model training, ensuring consistent brain tissue boundaries and morphometric fidelity. Experiments on 31,713 ADNI longitudinal pairs and zero-shot evaluation on OASIS-3 demonstrate that AG-LDM matches or surpasses more complex diffusion models, achieving state-of-the-art image quality and 15-20\% reduction in volumetric errors in generated images. AG-LDM also exhibits markedly stronger utilization of temporal and clinical covariates (up to 31.5x higher sensitivity than BrLP) and generates biologically plausible counterfactual trajectories, accurately capturing hallmarks of Alzheimer's progression such as limbic atrophy and ventricular expansion. These results highlight AG-LDM as an efficient, anatomically grounded framework for reliable brain MRI progression modeling.

Motivation: Expert annotations are scarce and expensive for medical image analysis, limiting deep learning effectiveness. While 3D self-supervised methods like VoCo help, they have high computational costs and memory requirements.

Method: Proposes 2D-VoCo, an efficient slice-level adaptation of VoCo that learns spatial-semantic features from unlabeled 2D CT slices via contrastive learning. The pre-trained CNN backbone is then integrated into a CNN-LSTM architecture for multi-organ injury classification.

Abstract: The requirement for expert annotations limits the effectiveness of deep learning for medical image analysis. Although 3D self-supervised methods like volume contrast learning (VoCo) are powerful and partially address the labeling scarcity issue, their high computational cost and memory consumption are barriers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LFS learns to select diverse, event-relevant frames for video captioning using caption feedback from frozen video-LLMs, improving caption quality and downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform frame sampling for video captioning is inefficient due to uneven event distribution, motivating a learnable frame selector that balances temporal diversity and event relevance.

Method: Learnable Frame Selector (LFS) models temporal importance, uses stratified strategy for coverage, and leverages caption feedback from frozen video-LLMs to optimize frame selection for caption quality.

Result: LFS improves detailed video captioning by up to 2.0% on VDC and over 4% on new ICH-CC benchmark, and enhances video question answering performance.

Conclusion: LFS provides an effective, easy-to-integrate solution for detailed video captioning by learning optimal frame selection that directly optimizes downstream caption quality.

Abstract: Video captioning models convert frames into visual tokens and generate descriptions with large language models (LLMs). Since encoding all frames is prohibitively expensive, uniform sampling is the default choice, but it enforces equal temporal coverage while ignoring the uneven events distribution. This motivates a Learnable Frame Selector (LFS) that selects temporally diverse and event-relevant frames. LFS explicitly models temporal importance to balance temporal diversity and event relevance, and employs a stratified strategy to ensure temporal coverage while avoiding clustering. Crucially, LFS leverages caption feedback from frozen video-LLMs to learn frame selection that directly optimizes downstream caption quality. Additionally, we identify the gap between existing benchmark and human's cognition. Thus, we introduce ICH-CC built from carefully designed questions by annotators that reflect human-consistent understanding of video. Experiments indicate that LFS consistently improves detailed video captioning across two representative community benchmarks and ICH-CC, achieving up to 2.0% gains on VDC and over 4% gains on ICH-CC. Moreover, we observe that enhanced captions with LFS leads to improved performance on video question answering. Overall, LFS provides an effective and easy-to-integrate solution for detailed video captioning.

TL;DR: 3D spatial scratchpad enables visual language models to perform explicit 3D reasoning for precise image generation, improving text alignment by 32%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual language models lack spatial reasoning mechanisms analogous to LLMs' chain-of-thought, limiting their ability to generate images with accurate geometric relations, object identities, and compositional intent.

Method: Introduces a 3D spatial scratchpad that parses text prompts into subjects/background elements, instantiates them as editable 3D meshes, uses agentic scene planning for placement/orientation/viewpoint selection, then renders back to image domain with identity-preserving cues.

Result: Achieves 32% improvement in text alignment on GenAI-Bench, demonstrating reliable 3D edits that propagate to final images and enabling spatially consistent, visually coherent outputs.

Conclusion: Proposes a new paradigm for vision-language models that deliberate not only in language but also in space, enabling explicit 3D reasoning for precise, controllable image generation.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has shown that reasoning improves when intermediate thoughts are externalized into explicit workspaces, such as chain-of-thought traces or tool-augmented reasoning. Yet, visual language models (VLMs) lack an analogous mechanism for spatial reasoning, limiting their ability to generate images that accurately reflect geometric relations, object identities, and compositional intent. We introduce the concept of a spatial scratchpad -- a 3D reasoning substrate that bridges linguistic intent and image synthesis. Given a text prompt, our framework parses subjects and background elements, instantiates them as editable 3D meshes, and employs agentic scene planning for placement, orientation, and viewpoint selection. The resulting 3D arrangement is rendered back into the image domain with identity-preserving cues, enabling the VLM to generate spatially consistent and visually coherent outputs. Unlike prior 2D layout-based methods, our approach supports intuitive 3D edits that propagate reliably into final images. Empirically, it achieves a 32% improvement in text alignment on GenAI-Bench, demonstrating the benefit of explicit 3D reasoning for precise, controllable image generation. Our results highlight a new paradigm for vision-language models that deliberate not only in language, but also in space. Code and visualizations at https://oindrilasaha.github.io/3DScratchpad/

TL;DR: U-Harmony: A joint training method that enables single segmentation models to learn from heterogeneous medical datasets by normalizing and denormalizing feature distributions, supporting universal modality adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical segmentation datasets are often limited and heterogeneous with variations across institutions (modalities, protocols, anatomical targets). Existing deep learning models struggle to jointly learn from such diverse data, sacrificing either generalization or domain-specific knowledge.

Method: Propose Universal Harmonization (U-Harmony) integrated into deep learning architectures with domain-gated head. The approach sequentially normalizes and then denormalizes feature distributions to mitigate domain-specific variations while preserving original dataset-specific knowledge. Supports universal modality adaptation for learning new imaging modalities and anatomical classes.

Result: Extensive experiments on cross-institutional brain lesion datasets demonstrate effectiveness, establishing a new benchmark for robust and adaptable 3D medical image segmentation models in real-world clinical settings.

Conclusion: U-Harmony enables a single segmentation model to learn from heterogeneous datasets simultaneously, overcoming challenges of limited and diverse medical data in clinical practice.

Abstract: In clinical practice, medical segmentation datasets are often limited and heterogeneous, with variations in modalities, protocols, and anatomical targets across institutions. Existing deep learning models struggle to jointly learn from such diverse data, often sacrificing either generalization or domain-specific knowledge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a joint training method called Universal Harmonization (U-Harmony), which can be integrated into deep learning-based architectures with a domain-gated head, enabling a single segmentation model to learn from heterogeneous datasets simultaneously. By integrating U-Harmony, our approach sequentially normalizes and then denormalizes feature distributions to mitigate domain-specific variations while preserving original dataset-specific knowledge. More appealingly, our framework also supports universal modality adaptation, allowing the seamless learning of new imaging modalities and anatomical classes. Extensive experiments on cross-institutional brain lesion datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, establishing a new benchmark for robust and adaptable 3D medical image segmentation models in real-world clinical settings.

### [20] [Learning Consistent Taxonomic Classification through Hierarchical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14610)
*Zhenghong Li,Kecheng Zheng,Haibin Ling*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VL-Taxon improves VLM hierarchical reasoning for taxonomic classification using a two-stage framework with top-down classification and hierarchical consistency enforcement, achieving >10% accuracy gains over larger models with minimal fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with hierarchical knowledge, often misclassifying coarser taxonomic levels even when correctly identifying specific leaf levels. Existing approaches fail to model hierarchical reasoning, creating a gap in taxonomic classification.

Method: VL-Taxon uses a two-stage hierarchy-based reasoning framework: 1) Top-down process for leaf-level classification accuracy, 2) Leveraging accurate leaf-level output to ensure consistency throughout the entire taxonomic hierarchy. Each stage uses supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning to refine reasoning.

Result: VL-Taxon implemented on Qwen2.5-VL-7B outperforms the original 72B counterpart by over 10% in both leaf-level and hierarchical consistency accuracy on average on iNaturalist-2021 dataset, achieved with fine-tuning on only a small data subset without using examples from other VLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed VL-Taxon framework effectively addresses hierarchical reasoning limitations in VLMs, demonstrating that proper hierarchical modeling can significantly improve taxonomic classification accuracy and consistency, even with smaller models and minimal training data.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at visual understanding, they often fail to grasp hierarchical knowledge. This leads to common errors where VLMs misclassify coarser taxonomic levels even when correctly identifying the most specific level (leaf level). Existing approaches largely overlook this issue by failing to model hierarchical reasoning. To address this gap, we propose VL-Taxon, a two-stage, hierarchy-based reasoning framework designed to improve both leaf-level accuracy and hierarchical consistency in taxonomic classification. The first stage employs a top-down process to enhance leaf-level classification accuracy. The second stage then leverages this accurate leaf-level output to ensure consistency throughout the entire taxonomic hierarchy. Each stage is initially trained with supervised fine-tuning to instill taxonomy knowledge, followed by reinforcement learning to refine the model's reasoning and generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments reveal a remarkable result: our VL-Taxon framework, implemented on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model, outperforms its original 72B counterpart by over 10% in both leaf-level and hierarchical consistency accuracy on average on the iNaturalist-2021 dataset. Notably, this significant gain was achieved by fine-tuning on just a small subset of data, without relying on any examples generated by other VLMs.

### [21] [Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty with Asymmetric Learning for Diffusion-Generated Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14625)
*Yingsong Huang,Hui Guo,Jing Huang,Bing Bai,Qi Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEUA framework uses diffusion epistemic uncertainty estimation and asymmetric learning to detect AI-generated images, outperforming previous methods by distinguishing between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in reconstruction errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous diffusion-based detection methods ignore the different impacts of aleatoric uncertainty (inherent data noise) and epistemic uncertainty (model's lack of knowledge). Aleatoric uncertainty creates ambiguity that hinders detection, while epistemic uncertainty actually helps distinguish generated images. Current methods don't properly separate these two types of uncertainty, undermining detection performance.

Method: Proposes DEUA framework with two key components: 1) Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty (DEU) estimation using Laplace approximation to measure data proximity to diffusion-generated manifold, and 2) Asymmetric loss function to train balanced classifiers with larger margins for better generalizability.

Result: Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in detecting diffusion-generated images, validating the effectiveness of separating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty.

Conclusion: Properly distinguishing between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in diffusion-based measurements significantly improves detection of AI-generated images. The DEUA framework provides a robust solution that enhances generalizability and achieves superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: The rapid progress of diffusion models highlights the growing need for detecting generated images. Previous research demonstrates that incorporating diffusion-based measurements, such as reconstruction error, can enhance the generalizability of detectors. However, ignoring the differing impacts of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty on reconstruction error can undermine detection performance. Aleatoric uncertainty, arising from inherent data noise, creates ambiguity that impedes accurate detection of generated images. As it reflects random variations within the data (e.g., noise in natural textures), it does not help distinguish generated images. In contrast, epistemic uncertainty, which represents the model's lack of knowledge about unfamiliar patterns, supports detection. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty with Asymmetric Learning~(DEUA), for detecting diffusion-generated images. We introduce Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty~(DEU) estimation via the Laplace approximation to assess the proximity of data to the manifold of diffusion-generated samples. Additionally, an asymmetric loss function is introduced to train a balanced classifier with larger margins, further enhancing generalizability. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks validate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.

TL;DR: Forest-Chat is an LLM-driven agent for forest change analysis using satellite imagery, enabling natural language querying for multiple remote sensing interpretation tasks through a multi-level vision-language framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of pixel-level change detection and semantic change interpretation in complex forest dynamics by integrating LLMs with vision-language models for remote sensing, which remains underexplored beyond urban environments.

Method: An LLM-driven agent framework with multi-level change interpretation vision-language backbone, zero-shot change detection via foundation model, interactive point-prompt interface, and introduces Forest-Change dataset with bi-temporal imagery, change masks, and semantic captions.

Result: Forest-Chat achieves strong performance on Forest-Change dataset and LEVIR-MCI-Trees subset for joint change detection and captioning, demonstrating potential for improved accessibility, interpretability, and analytical efficiency.

Conclusion: Interactive, LLM-driven remote sensing image change interpretation systems show promise for enhancing forest monitoring workflows by making analysis more accessible and interpretable while maintaining analytical efficiency.

Abstract: The increasing availability of high-resolution satellite imagery, together with advances in deep learning, creates new opportunities for enhancing forest monitoring workflows. Two central challenges in this domain are pixel-level change detection and semantic change interpretation, particularly for complex forest dynamics. While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for data exploration, their integration with vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing image change interpretation (RSICI) remains underexplored, especially beyond urban environments. We introduce Forest-Chat, an LLM-driven agent designed for integrated forest change analysis. The proposed framework enables natural language querying and supports multiple RSICI tasks, including change detection, change captioning, object counting, deforestation percentage estimation, and change reasoning. Forest-Chat builds upon a multi-level change interpretation (MCI) vision-language backbone with LLM-based orchestration, and incorporates zero-shot change detection via a foundation change detection model together with an interactive point-prompt interface to support fine-grained user guidance. To facilitate adaptation and evaluation in forest environments, we introduce the Forest-Change dataset, comprising bi-temporal satellite imagery, pixel-level change masks, and multi-granularity semantic change captions generated through a combination of human annotation and rule-based methods. Experimental results demonstrate that Forest-Chat achieves strong performance on Forest-Change and on LEVIR-MCI-Trees, a tree-focused subset of LEVIR-MCI, for joint change detection and captioning, highlighting the potential of interactive, LLM-driven RSICI systems to improve accessibility, interpretability, and analytical efficiency in forest change analysis.

### [23] [READ-Net: Clarifying Emotional Ambiguity via Adaptive Feature Recalibration for Audio-Visual Depression Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14651)
*Chenglizhao Chen,Boze Li,Mengke Song,Dehao Feng,Xinyu Liu,Shanchen Pang,Jufeng Yang,Hui Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: READ-Net is an audio-visual depression detection framework that addresses Emotional Ambiguity by adaptively recalibrating emotional features to enhance depression-related signals while filtering out irrelevant emotional noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio-visual depression detection methods either ignore emotional cues (missing subtle depressive signals) or incorporate emotions but confuse transient emotional expressions with stable depressive symptoms (Emotional Ambiguity), leading to detection errors.

Method: READ-Net uses Adaptive Feature Recalibration (AFR) to dynamically adjust weights of emotional features, identifying and preserving depression-relevant cues within emotional features while adaptively filtering out irrelevant emotional noise.

Result: Extensive evaluations on three public datasets show READ-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods with average gains of 4.55% in accuracy and 1.26% in F1-score, demonstrating robustness to emotional disturbances.

Conclusion: READ-Net effectively resolves Emotional Ambiguity in audio-visual depression detection, can be easily integrated into existing frameworks, and significantly improves detection performance by clarifying feature representations and mitigating emotional interference.

Abstract: Depression is a severe global mental health issue that impairs daily functioning and overall quality of life. Although recent audio-visual approaches have improved automatic depression detection, methods that ignore emotional cues often fail to capture subtle depressive signals hidden within emotional expressions. Conversely, those incorporating emotions frequently confuse transient emotional expressions with stable depressive symptoms in feature representations, a phenomenon termed \emph{Emotional Ambiguity}, thereby leading to detection errors. To address this critical issue, we propose READ-Net, the first audio-visual depression detection framework explicitly designed to resolve Emotional Ambiguity through Adaptive Feature Recalibration (AFR). The core insight of AFR is to dynamically adjust the weights of emotional features to enhance depression-related signals. Rather than merely overlooking or naively combining emotional information, READ-Net innovatively identifies and preserves depressive-relevant cues within emotional features, while adaptively filtering out irrelevant emotional noise. This recalibration strategy significantly clarifies feature representations, and effectively mitigates the persistent challenge of emotional interference. Additionally, READ-Net can be easily integrated into existing frameworks for improved performance. Extensive evaluations on three publicly available datasets show that READ-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with average gains of 4.55\% in accuracy and 1.26\% in F1-score, demonstrating its robustness to emotional disturbances and improving audio-visual depression detection.

*Yonghao Yu,Lang Huang,Zerun Wang,Runyi Li,Toshihiko Yamasaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mirai framework injects future information (foresight) into autoregressive visual generation training to improve global coherence and accelerate convergence without architecture changes or inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive visual generators suffer from diminished global coherence and slow convergence because they're trained with strict causality supervision (next token likelihood), which only optimizes each step by its immediate next token. The authors investigate whether foresight (training signals from later tokens) can help AR visual generation.

Method: Propose Mirai framework with two variants: Mirai-E uses explicit foresight from multiple future positions of unidirectional representations, while Mirai-I leverages implicit foresight from matched bidirectional representations. Both inject future information into AR training without architecture changes or extra inference overhead, aligning foresight to AR models' internal representation on 2D image grids.

Result: Mirai significantly accelerates convergence (up to 10× speedup for LlamaGen-B) and improves generation quality (reduces FID from 5.34 to 4.34 on ImageNet class-condition image generation benchmark). Extensive experiments demonstrate improved performance across various metrics.

Conclusion: Visual autoregressive models need foresight. The Mirai framework effectively injects future information into AR training, improving causality modeling, accelerating convergence, and enhancing generation quality without architectural modifications or inference overhead.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) visual generators model images as sequences of discrete tokens and are trained with next token likelihood. This strict causality supervision optimizes each step only by its immediate next token, which diminishes global coherence and slows convergence. We ask whether foresight, training signals that originate from later tokens, can help AR visual generation. We conduct a series of controlled diagnostics along the injection level, foresight layout, and foresight source axes, unveiling a key insight: aligning foresight to AR models' internal representation on the 2D image grids improves causality modeling. We formulate this insight with Mirai (meaning "future" in Japanese), a general framework that injects future information into AR training with no architecture change and no extra inference overhead: Mirai-E uses explicit foresight from multiple future positions of unidirectional representations, whereas Mirai-I leverages implicit foresight from matched bidirectional representations. Extensive experiments show that Mirai significantly accelerates convergence and improves generation quality. For instance, Mirai can speed up LlamaGen-B's convergence by up to 10$\times$ and reduce the generation FID from 5.34 to 4.34 on the ImageNet class-condition image generation benchmark. Our study highlights that visual autoregressive models need foresight.

TL;DR: LAVR-4D uses implicit geometric knowledge from a large 4D reconstruction model's latent space to condition video generation, achieving state-of-the-art video re-rendering without explicit reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video re-rendering methods face two main challenges: geometrically unconditioned models lack spatial awareness and suffer from drift/deformation, while geometrically-conditioned models depend on estimated depth and explicit reconstruction, making them vulnerable to depth inaccuracies and calibration errors.

Method: Proposes using implicit geometric knowledge embedded in the latent space of a large 4D reconstruction model to condition video generation. These latents capture scene structure continuously without explicit reconstruction, providing flexible representation that allows pretrained diffusion prior to regularize errors effectively. Jointly conditions on these latents and source camera poses.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art results on the video re-rendering task.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses limitations of both geometrically unconditioned and conditioned models by leveraging implicit geometric knowledge from 4D reconstruction latents, enabling more robust and accurate video re-rendering.

Abstract: Given a monocular video, the goal of video re-rendering is to generate views of the scene from a novel camera trajectory. Existing methods face two distinct challenges. Geometrically unconditioned models lack spatial awareness, leading to drift and deformation under viewpoint changes. On the other hand, geometrically-conditioned models depend on estimated depth and explicit reconstruction, making them susceptible to depth inaccuracies and calibration errors.
  We propose to address these challenges by using the implicit geometric knowledge embedded in the latent space of a large 4D reconstruction model to condition the video generation process. These latents capture scene structure in a continuous space without explicit reconstruction. Therefore, they provide a flexible representation that allows the pretrained diffusion prior to regularize errors more effectively. By jointly conditioning on these latents and source camera poses, we demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the video re-rendering task.

*Justin Cheung,Samuel Savine,Calvin Nguyen,Lin Lu,Alhassan S. Yasin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Domain adaptation with DANN improves cross-cancer generalization in histopathology, outperforming supervised models and ensembles, with stain normalization effects varying by target domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised deep learning models in cancer histopathology fail to generalize across different cancer types despite shared morphological features, creating a need for domain adaptation to address domain shift and annotation scarcity.

Method: Evaluated ResNet50 on lung, colon, breast, and kidney adenocarcinomas; compared supervised models, ensembles, and domain adversarial neural networks (DANN); tested stain normalization impact; used Integrated Gradients for interpretability.

Result: Single-domain ResNet50 achieves >98% accuracy on own domain but minimal cross-domain generalization. DANN substantially improves performance (95.56% accuracy adapting breast/colon to lung). Stain normalization effects vary: harmful for lung (95.56%→66.60%) but beneficial for breast/colon targets. DANN learns biologically meaningful features.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation via DANN enables effective knowledge transfer across cancer types, addressing domain shift in histopathology. Stain normalization impact is domain-dependent, and DANN learns clinically relevant features applicable to unlabeled cancer types.

Abstract: Supervised deep learning models often achieve excellent performance within their training distribution but struggle to generalize beyond it. In cancer histopathology, for example, a convolutional neural network (CNN) may classify cancer severity accurately for cancer types represented in its training data, yet fail on related but unseen types. Although adenocarcinomas from different organs share morphological features that might support limited cross-domain generalization, addressing domain shift directly is necessary for robust performance. Domain adaptation offers a way to transfer knowledge from labeled data in one cancer type to unlabeled data in another, helping mitigate the scarcity of annotated medical images.
  This work evaluates cross-domain classification performance among lung, colon, breast, and kidney adenocarcinomas. A ResNet50 trained on any single adenocarcinoma achieves over 98% accuracy on its own domain but shows minimal generalization to others. Ensembling multiple supervised models does not resolve this limitation. In contrast, converting the ResNet50 into a domain adversarial neural network (DANN) substantially improves performance on unlabeled target domains. A DANN trained on labeled breast and colon data and adapted to unlabeled lung data reaches 95.56% accuracy.
  We also examine the impact of stain normalization on domain adaptation. Its effects vary by target domain: for lung, accuracy drops from 95.56% to 66.60%, while for breast and colon targets, stain normalization boosts accuracy from 49.22% to 81.29% and from 78.48% to 83.36%, respectively. Finally, using Integrated Gradients reveals that DANNs consistently attribute importance to biologically meaningful regions such as densely packed nuclei, indicating that the model learns clinically relevant features and can apply them to unlabeled cancer types.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared small target detection under complex backgrounds is challenging due to low signal-to-clutter ratio, dynamic interference, and lack of distinct features. Existing multi-frame methods struggle with inefficient long-range dependency modeling and insufficient robustness.

Method: Proposes FeedbackSTS-Det with spatio-temporal semantic feedback strategy using paired forward/backward refinement modules across encoder-decoder. Includes embedded sparse semantic module (SSM) for structured sparse temporal modeling to capture long-range dependencies with low computational cost. Maintains consistent training-inference pipeline.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets confirm effectiveness. The method facilitates robust implicit inter-frame registration and continuous semantic refinement, effectively suppressing false alarms.

Conclusion: FeedbackSTS-Det overcomes limitations of existing ISTD methods through efficient spatio-temporal modeling and semantic feedback, achieving reliable performance transfer and increased robustness for infrared small target detection in complex backgrounds.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) under complex backgrounds remains a critical yet challenging task, primarily due to the extremely low signal-to-clutter ratio, persistent dynamic interference, and the lack of distinct target features. While multi-frame detection methods leverages temporal cues to improve upon single-frame approaches, existing methods still struggle with inefficient long-range dependency modeling and insufficient robustness. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel scheme for ISTD, realized through a sparse frames-based spatio-temporal semantic feedback network named FeedbackSTS-Det. The core of our approach is a novel spatio-temporal semantic feedback strategy with a closed-loop semantic association mechanism, which consists of paired forward and backward refinement modules that work cooperatively across the encoder and decoder. Moreover, both modules incorporate an embedded sparse semantic module (SSM), which performs structured sparse temporal modeling to capture long-range dependencies with low computational cost. This integrated design facilitates robust implicit inter-frame registration and continuous semantic refinement, effectively suppressing false alarms. Furthermore, our overall procedure maintains a consistent training-inference pipeline, which ensures reliable performance transfer and increases model robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of FeedbackSTS-Det. Code and models are available at: https://github.com/IDIP-Lab/FeedbackSTS-Det.

### [29] [RegFreeNet: A Registration-Free Network for CBCT-based 3D Dental Implant Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14703)
*Xinquan Yang,Xuguang Li,Mianjie Zheng,Xuefen Liu,Kun Tang,Kian Ming Lim,He Meng,Jianfeng Ren,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes RegFreeNet for dental implant position prediction using masked post-implantation CBCT data, eliminating need for registration and enabling multi-center dataset construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Commercial surgical guide software doesn't export implant positions, requiring time-consuming registration of post-implantation data to pre-implantation space. Limited paired CBCT data restricts multi-center dataset construction.

Method: Mask implants in post-implantation CBCT data to use any implant-containing CBCT as training data. Propose RegFreeNet with neighboring distance perception (NDP) module for tooth area variation features and implant slope prediction branch for robust feature learning.

Result: Created ImplantFairy dataset with 1622 CBCT data and voxel-level 3D annotations. RegFreeNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImplantFairy and two public datasets.

Conclusion: The registration-free approach enables large-scale multi-center dataset construction and improves dental implant position prediction through innovative network architecture with NDP module and slope prediction branch.

Abstract: As the commercial surgical guide design software usually does not support the export of implant position for pre-implantation data, existing methods have to scan the post-implantation data and map the implant to pre-implantation space to get the label of implant position for training. Such a process is time-consuming and heavily relies on the accuracy of registration algorithm. Moreover, not all hospitals have paired CBCT data, limitting the construction of multi-center dataset. Inspired by the way dentists determine the implant position based on the neighboring tooth texture, we found that even if the implant area is masked, it will not affect the determination of the implant position. Therefore, we propose to mask the implants in the post-implantation data so that any CBCT containing the implants can be used as training data. This paradigm enables us to discard the registration process and makes it possible to construct a large-scale multi-center implant dataset. On this basis, we proposes ImplantFairy, a comprehensive, publicly accessible dental implant dataset with voxel-level 3D annotations of 1622 CBCT data. Furthermore, according to the area variation characteristics of the tooth's spatial structure and the slope information of the implant, we designed a slope-aware implant position prediction network. Specifically, a neighboring distance perception (NDP) module is designed to adaptively extract tooth area variation features, and an implant slope prediction branch assists the network in learning more robust features through additional implant supervision information. Extensive experiments conducted on ImplantFairy and two public dataset demonstrate that the proposed RegFreeNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fashion retrieval benchmarks don't reflect real e-commerce dynamics, lack contemporary trends, and suffer from data contamination issues where models can memorize test data. There's a need for a holistic, challenging benchmark that mirrors real shopping behaviors and stays current with fashion trends.

Method: Created LookBench with: 1) Recent product images from live websites + AI-generated fashion images, 2) Time-stamped test samples with periodic updates, 3) Fine-grained attribute taxonomy, 4) Single-item and outfit-level retrieval tasks, 5) Contamination-aware evaluation aligned with training cutoffs.

Conclusion: LookBench provides a durable, evolving benchmark for fashion retrieval that reflects real e-commerce needs. It will be updated semi-annually with new test samples and harder task variants, with public release of leaderboard, dataset, code, and trained models to advance the field.

Abstract: In this paper, we present LookBench (We use the term "look" to reflect retrieval that mirrors how people shop -- finding the exact item, a close substitute, or a visually consistent alternative.), a live, holistic and challenging benchmark for fashion image retrieval in real e-commerce settings. LookBench includes both recent product images sourced from live websites and AI-generated fashion images, reflecting contemporary trends and use cases. Each test sample is time-stamped and we intend to update the benchmark periodically, enabling contamination-aware evaluation aligned with declared training cutoffs. Grounded in our fine-grained attribute taxonomy, LookBench covers single-item and outfit-level retrieval across. Our experiments reveal that LookBench poses a significant challenge on strong baselines, with many models achieving below $60\%$ Recall@1. Our proprietary model achieves the best performance on LookBench, and we release an open-source counterpart that ranks second, with both models attaining state-of-the-art results on legacy Fashion200K evaluations. LookBench is designed to be updated semi-annually with new test samples and progressively harder task variants, providing a durable measure of progress.

*Yiyang Fu,Hui Li,Wangyu Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CPF-CTE framework improves WSSS by capturing contextual patch dependencies and enhancing class-specific semantics through CF-BiLSTM and learnable class tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing WSSS methods focus on inter-class distinctions and data augmentation but neglect complex contextual dependencies among image patches, leading to incomplete local representations and limited segmentation accuracy.

Method: Proposes CPF-CTE framework with CF-BiLSTM module to capture spatial dependencies between patches via bidirectional information flow, and learnable class tokens that dynamically encode and refine class-specific semantics.

Result: Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 show CPF-CTE consistently surpasses prior WSSS methods.

Conclusion: By effectively integrating spatial and semantic cues through contextual patch fusion and class token enhancement, CPF-CTE produces richer and more accurate image representations for improved weakly supervised semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which relies only on image-level labels, has attracted significant attention for its cost-effectiveness and scalability. Existing methods mainly enhance inter-class distinctions and employ data augmentation to mitigate semantic ambiguity and reduce spurious activations. However, they often neglect the complex contextual dependencies among image patches, resulting in incomplete local representations and limited segmentation accuracy. To address these issues, we propose the Context Patch Fusion with Class Token Enhancement (CPF-CTE) framework, which exploits contextual relations among patches to enrich feature representations and improve segmentation. At its core, the Contextual-Fusion Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (CF-BiLSTM) module captures spatial dependencies between patches and enables bidirectional information flow, yielding a more comprehensive understanding of spatial correlations. This strengthens feature learning and segmentation robustness. Moreover, we introduce learnable class tokens that dynamically encode and refine class-specific semantics, enhancing discriminative capability. By effectively integrating spatial and semantic cues, CPF-CTE produces richer and more accurate representations of image content. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 validate that CPF-CTE consistently surpasses prior WSSS methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with streaming video inputs, failing to maintain stable understanding, real-time responses, and low GPU memory simultaneously.

Method: Proposes HERMES with hierarchical KV cache framework that reuses compact cache across multiple granularities, requiring no auxiliary computations for user queries.

Result: Achieves 10× faster TTFT than SOTA, reduces video tokens by up to 68% vs uniform sampling, with superior/comparable accuracy across benchmarks and up to 11.4% gains on streaming datasets.

Conclusion: HERMES enables efficient real-time streaming video understanding with minimal resource overhead through innovative KV cache memory architecture.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant improvement in offline video understanding. However, extending these capabilities to streaming video inputs, remains challenging, as existing models struggle to simultaneously maintain stable understanding performance, real-time responses, and low GPU memory overhead. To address this challenge, we propose HERMES, a novel training-free architecture for real-time and accurate understanding of video streams. Based on a mechanistic attention investigation, we conceptualize KV cache as a hierarchical memory framework that encapsulates video information across multiple granularities. During inference, HERMES reuses a compact KV cache, enabling efficient streaming understanding under resource constraints. Notably, HERMES requires no auxiliary computations upon the arrival of user queries, thereby guaranteeing real-time responses for continuous video stream interactions, which achieves 10$\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA. Even when reducing video tokens by up to 68% compared with uniform sampling, HERMES achieves superior or comparable accuracy across all benchmarks, with up to 11.4% gains on streaming datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models for drug discovery struggle with interpreting molecular images and generating outputs consistent with 3D geometry and stereochemistry. String/graph-based models miss visual details, while vision-language models often overlook stereochemical information and have difficulty mapping continuous 3D structures into discrete tokens.

Method: DeepMoLM uses a dual-view framework that grounds high-resolution (1024×1024) molecular images in geometric invariants derived from molecular conformations. It encodes conformer neighborhoods as discrete Extended 3-Dimensional Fingerprints and fuses visual and geometric streams using cross-attention, enabling physically grounded generation without requiring atom coordinates.

Result: DeepMoLM achieves 12.3% relative METEOR gain over strongest generalist baselines on PubChem captioning while staying competitive with specialist methods. It produces valid numeric outputs for all property queries and attains MAE 13.64 g/mol on Molecular Weight and 37.89 on Complexity in specialist settings. On ChEBI-20 description generation, it exceeds generalist baselines and matches state-of-the-art vision-language models.

Conclusion: DeepMoLM successfully addresses the limitations of existing molecular AI models by integrating visual and geometric information, enabling more accurate molecular understanding and generation while preserving stereochemical details. The framework demonstrates strong performance across multiple tasks and provides a promising approach for drug discovery and chemical literature mining applications.

Abstract: AI models for drug discovery and chemical literature mining must interpret molecular images and generate outputs consistent with 3D geometry and stereochemistry.

We propose DeepMoLM: Deep Molecular Language M odeling, a dual-view framework that grounds high-resolution molecular images in geometric invariants derived from molecular conformations. DeepMoLM preserves high-frequency evidence from 1024 $\times$ 1024 inputs, encodes conformer neighborhoods as discrete Extended 3-Dimensional Fingerprints, and fuses visual and geometric streams with cross-attention, enabling physically grounded generation without atom coordinates.

*Liqin Wang,Qianyue Hu,Wei Lu,Xiangyang Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VoidFace is a novel proactive defense method against diffusion-based face swapping attacks that disrupts identity pathways through targeted perturbations while maintaining visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing proactive defenses adapted from image editing attacks fail against diffusion-based face swapping due to overlooking the structural resilience and unique static conditional guidance mechanisms in these systems.

Method: Views face swapping as a coupled identity pathway and injects perturbations at critical bottlenecks. Uses localization disruption and identity erasure to degrade physical regression and semantic embeddings, then intervenes in generative domain by decoupling attention mechanisms and corrupting intermediate diffusion features. Performs adversarial search in latent manifold with perceptual adaptive strategy for visual imperceptibility.

Result: Extensive experiments show VoidFace outperforms existing defenses across various diffusion-based swapping models while producing adversarial faces with superior visual quality.

Conclusion: VoidFace provides an effective systemic defense against diffusion-based face swapping by targeting the unique structural vulnerabilities of these systems through carefully designed perturbations that disrupt identity pathways while maintaining visual quality.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of diffusion models has democratized face swapping but also raises concerns about privacy and identity security. Existing proactive defenses, often adapted from image editing attacks, prove ineffective in this context. We attribute this failure to an oversight of the structural resilience and the unique static conditional guidance mechanism inherent in face swapping systems. To address this, we propose VoidFace, a systemic defense method that views face swapping as a coupled identity pathway. By injecting perturbations at critical bottlenecks, VoidFace induces cascading disruption throughout the pipeline. Specifically, we first introduce localization disruption and identity erasure to degrade physical regression and semantic embeddings, thereby impairing the accurate modeling of the source face. We then intervene in the generative domain by decoupling attention mechanisms to sever identity injection, and corrupting intermediate diffusion features to prevent the reconstruction of source identity. To ensure visual imperceptibility, we perform adversarial search in the latent manifold, guided by a perceptual adaptive strategy to balance attack potency with image quality. Extensive experiments show that VoidFace outperforms existing defenses across various diffusion-based swapping models, while producing adversarial faces with superior visual quality.

TL;DR: FlowSSC is a generative framework for monocular semantic scene completion that uses flow-matching in triplane latent space for real-time inference, achieving SOTA performance on SemanticKITTI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feed-forward SSC methods struggle with generating plausible details in occluded regions and preserving spatial relationships, which is critical for real-world applications like autonomous systems.

Method: FlowSSC treats SSC as conditional generation, uses Shortcut Flow-matching in compact triplane latent space for single-step high-fidelity generation, and can integrate with existing feed-forward methods.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on SemanticKITTI, significantly outperforming existing baselines while enabling real-time inference suitable for autonomous systems.

Conclusion: FlowSSC demonstrates that generative approaches can effectively address SSC challenges, providing high-quality scene completion with practical real-time performance for autonomous applications.

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) from monocular RGB images is a fundamental yet challenging task due to the inherent ambiguity of inferring occluded 3D geometry from a single view. While feed-forward methods have made progress, they often struggle to generate plausible details in occluded regions and preserve the fundamental spatial relationships of objects. Such accurate generative reasoning capability for the entire 3D space is critical in real-world applications. In this paper, we present FlowSSC, the first generative framework applied directly to monocular semantic scene completion. FlowSSC treats the SSC task as a conditional generation problem and can seamlessly integrate with existing feed-forward SSC methods to significantly boost their performance. To achieve real-time inference without compromising quality, we introduce Shortcut Flow-matching that operates in a compact triplane latent space. Unlike standard diffusion models that require hundreds of steps, our method utilizes a shortcut mechanism to achieve high-fidelity generation in a single step, enabling practical deployment in autonomous systems. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI demonstrate that FlowSSC achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baselines.

*Chongbin Yi,Yuxin Liang,Ziqi Zhou,Peng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an end-edge collaborative framework that combines low-resolution text-to-image generation with region-aware hybrid super-resolution to reduce latency by 33% while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution text-to-image generation faces a trade-off between image fidelity and latency, especially in resource-constrained edge computing environments. Existing super-resolution methods either struggle with fine detail recovery (lightweight learning-based) or have high computational costs (diffusion-based).

Method: End-edge collaborative generation-enhancement framework: 1) Generate low-resolution image at edge with adaptive denoising steps and SR scales, 2) Partition into patches, 3) Apply region-aware hybrid SR policy: diffusion-based SR for foreground patches (detail recovery) and lightweight learning-based SR for background patches (efficient upscaling), 4) Stitch enhanced patches into high-resolution image.

Result: The system reduces service latency by 33% compared to baselines while maintaining competitive image quality.

Conclusion: The proposed end-edge collaborative framework with region-aware hybrid super-resolution effectively addresses the latency-fidelity trade-off in high-resolution text-to-image generation, enabling faster generation while preserving image quality through intelligent patch-level processing.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) has made significant strides, with high-resolution text-to-image (T2I) generation becoming increasingly critical for improving users' Quality of Experience (QoE). Although resource-constrained edge computing adequately supports fast low-resolution T2I generations, achieving high-resolution output still faces the challenge of ensuring image fidelity at the cost of latency. To address this, we first investigate the performance of super-resolution (SR) methods for image enhancement, confirming a fundamental trade-off that lightweight learning-based SR struggles to recover fine details, while diffusion-based SR achieves higher fidelity at a substantial computational cost. Motivated by these observations, we propose an end-edge collaborative generation-enhancement framework. Upon receiving a T2I generation task, the system first generates a low-resolution image based on adaptively selected denoising steps and super-resolution scales at the edge side, which is then partitioned into patches and processed by a region-aware hybrid SR policy. This policy applies a diffusion-based SR model to foreground patches for detail recovery and a lightweight learning-based SR model to background patches for efficient upscaling, ultimately stitching the enhanced ones into the high-resolution image. Experiments show that our system reduces service latency by 33% compared with baselines while maintaining competitive image quality.

Motivation: Current video generation models for robotics lack standardized evaluation benchmarks, making fair comparisons difficult, and suffer from insufficient high-quality training data for generating physically realistic robot behaviors.

Method: Introduces RBench benchmark with five task domains and four embodiments, evaluating task correctness and visual fidelity through reproducible metrics (structural consistency, physical plausibility, action completeness). Also develops a four-stage data pipeline to create RoVid-X, the largest open-source robotic video dataset with 4 million annotated clips.

Result: Evaluation of 25 models shows significant deficiencies in generating physically realistic robot behaviors. RBench achieves 0.96 Spearman correlation with human evaluations. RoVid-X provides comprehensive physical property annotations covering thousands of tasks.

Conclusion: The synergistic ecosystem of RBench evaluation benchmark and RoVid-X training dataset establishes a foundation for rigorous assessment and scalable training of video models, accelerating progress toward embodied AI general intelligence.

Abstract: Video generation models have significantly advanced embodied intelligence, unlocking new possibilities for generating diverse robot data that capture perception, reasoning, and action in the physical world. However, synthesizing high-quality videos that accurately reflect real-world robotic interactions remains challenging, and the lack of a standardized benchmark limits fair comparisons and progress. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive robotics benchmark, RBench, designed to evaluate robot-oriented video generation across five task domains and four distinct embodiments. It assesses both task-level correctness and visual fidelity through reproducible sub-metrics, including structural consistency, physical plausibility, and action completeness. Evaluation of 25 representative models highlights significant deficiencies in generating physically realistic robot behaviors. Furthermore, the benchmark achieves a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.96 with human evaluations, validating its effectiveness. While RBench provides the necessary lens to identify these deficiencies, achieving physical realism requires moving beyond evaluation to address the critical shortage of high-quality training data. Driven by these insights, we introduce a refined four-stage data pipeline, resulting in RoVid-X, the largest open-source robotic dataset for video generation with 4 million annotated video clips, covering thousands of tasks and enriched with comprehensive physical property annotations. Collectively, this synergistic ecosystem of evaluation and data establishes a robust foundation for rigorous assessment and scalable training of video models, accelerating the evolution of embodied AI toward general intelligence.

Conclusion: SimD3 is a valuable resource for training and benchmarking robust drone detection models under diverse challenging conditions, and the attention-enhanced architecture improves generalization to unseen real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Reliable drone detection is challenging due to limited annotated real-world data, large appearance variability, and the presence of visually similar distractors such as birds. To address these challenges, this paper introduces SimD3, a large-scale high-fidelity synthetic dataset designed for robust drone detection in complex aerial environments. Unlike existing synthetic drone datasets, SimD3 explicitly models drones with heterogeneous payloads, incorporates multiple bird species as realistic distractors, and leverages diverse Unreal Engine 5 environments with controlled weather, lighting, and flight trajectories captured using a 360 six-camera rig. Using SimD3, we conduct an extensive experimental evaluation within the YOLOv5 detection framework, including an attention-enhanced variant termed Yolov5m+C3b, where standard bottleneck-based C3 blocks are replaced with C3b modules. Models are evaluated on synthetic data, combined synthetic and real data, and multiple unseen real-world benchmarks to assess robustness and generalization. Experimental results show that SimD3 provides effective supervision for small-object drone detection and that Yolov5m+C3b consistently outperforms the baseline across in-domain and cross-dataset evaluations. These findings highlight the utility of SimD3 for training and benchmarking robust drone detection models under diverse and challenging conditions.

TL;DR: Iterative test-time refinement using vision-language model feedback improves compositional image generation over parallel sampling baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I models struggle with complex compositional prompts requiring multiple objects, relations, and attributes simultaneously. Existing inference-time strategies like parallel sampling remain inadequate for richly compositional settings.

Method: Proposes iterative refinement where T2I model progressively refines generations across multiple steps, guided by feedback from a vision-language model critic. Simple, requires no external tools/priors, and flexibly applicable to various image generators and VLMs.

Result: 16.9% improvement in all-correct rate on ConceptMix (k=7), 13.8% improvement on T2I-CompBench (3D-Spatial), 12.5% improvement on Visual Jenga scene decomposition vs compute-matched parallel sampling. Human evaluators prefer method 58.7% vs 41.3% for baseline.

Conclusion: Iterative self-correction is a broadly applicable principle for compositional image generation that produces more faithful generations by decomposing complex prompts into sequential corrections.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have achieved remarkable progress, yet they continue to struggle with complex prompts that require simultaneously handling multiple objects, relations, and attributes. Existing inference-time strategies, such as parallel sampling with verifiers or simply increasing denoising steps, can improve prompt alignment but remain inadequate for richly compositional settings where many constraints must be satisfied. Inspired by the success of chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models, we propose an iterative test-time strategy in which a T2I model progressively refines its generations across multiple steps, guided by feedback from a vision-language model as the critic in the loop. Our approach is simple, requires no external tools or priors, and can be flexibly applied to a wide range of image generators and vision-language models. Empirically, we demonstrate consistent gains on image generation across benchmarks: a 16.9% improvement in all-correct rate on ConceptMix (k=7), a 13.8% improvement on T2I-CompBench (3D-Spatial category) and a 12.5% improvement on Visual Jenga scene decomposition compared to compute-matched parallel sampling. Beyond quantitative gains, iterative refinement produces more faithful generations by decomposing complex prompts into sequential corrections, with human evaluators preferring our method 58.7% of the time over 41.3% for the parallel baseline. Together, these findings highlight iterative self-correction as a broadly applicable principle for compositional image generation.

Conclusion: Demonstrates potential of MIL and self-supervised learning for automated CCE image analysis with broader implications for medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Identifying unique polyps in colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) images is a critical yet challenging task for medical personnel due to the large volume of images, the cognitive load it creates for clinicians, and the ambiguity in labeling specific frames. This paper formulates this problem as a multi-instance learning (MIL) task, where a query polyp image is compared with a target bag of images to determine uniqueness. We employ a multi-instance verification (MIV) framework that incorporates attention mechanisms, such as variance-excited multi-head attention (VEMA) and distance-based attention (DBA), to enhance the model's ability to extract meaningful representations. Additionally, we investigate the impact of self-supervised learning using SimCLR to generate robust embeddings. Experimental results on a dataset of 1912 polyps from 754 patients demonstrate that attention mechanisms significantly improve performance, with DBA L1 achieving the highest test accuracy of 86.26\% and a test AUC of 0.928 using a ConvNeXt backbone with SimCLR pretraining. This study underscores the potential of MIL and self-supervised learning in advancing automated analysis of Colon Capsule Endoscopy images, with implications for broader medical imaging applications.

*Keita Takeda,Tomoya Sakai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Medical VLMs learn diagnostically relevant features, but non-medical VLMs with enhanced text encoders (like LLM2CLIP) can produce more refined representations, suggesting text encoder improvement is more crucial than intensive medical image training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical VLMs are expected to capture diagnostically relevant features, but their learned representations remain underexplored. Standard evaluations like classification accuracy don't fully reveal if they acquire truly discriminative, lesion-specific features. Understanding these representations is crucial for revealing medical image structures and improving downstream tasks in medical image analysis.

Method: Analyzed feature distributions of multiple image modalities extracted by representative medical VLMs across lesion classification datasets on multiple modalities. Compared these distributions with non-medical VLMs to assess domain-specific medical training impact.

Result: Medical VLMs can extract discriminative features effective for medical classification tasks. However, non-medical VLMs with recent improvements in contextual enrichment (like LLM2CLIP) produce more refined feature representations. Non-medical models are particularly vulnerable to biases from overlaid text strings on images.

Conclusion: Enhancing text encoder is more crucial than training intensively on medical images when developing medical VLMs. Need careful model selection based on downstream tasks and awareness of potential risks from background biases like textual information in images.

Abstract: This study investigates the feature representations produced by publicly available open source medical vision-language models (VLMs). While medical VLMs are expected to capture diagnostically relevant features, their learned representations remain underexplored, and standard evaluations like classification accuracy do not fully reveal if they acquire truly discriminative, lesion-specific features. Understanding these representations is crucial for revealing medical image structures and improving downstream tasks in medical image analysis. This study aims to investigate the feature distributions learned by medical VLMs and evaluate the impact of medical specialization. We analyze the feature distribution of multiple image modalities extracted by some representative medical VLMs across lesion classification datasets on multiple modalities. These distributions were compared them with non-medical VLMs to assess the domain-specific medical training. Our experiments showed that medical VLMs can extract discriminative features that are effective for medical classification tasks. Moreover, it was found that non-medical VLMs with recent improvement with contextual enrichment such as LLM2CLIP produce more refined feature representations. Our results imply that enhancing text encoder is more crucial than training intensively on medical images when developing medical VLMs. Notably, non-medical models are particularly vulnerable to biases introduced by overlaied text strings on images. These findings underscore the need for careful consideration on model selection according to downstream tasks besides potential risks in inference due to background biases such as textual information in images.

### [43] [M2I2HA: A Multi-modal Object Detection Method Based on Intra- and Inter-Modal Hypergraph Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14776)
*Xiaofan Yang,Yubin Liu,Wei Pan,Guoqing Chu,Junming Zhang,Jie Zhao,Zhuoqi Man,Xuanming Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M2I2HA: A hypergraph-based multi-modal perception network that addresses limitations of CNNs, Transformers, and SSMs for object detection by capturing high-order relationships within and across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal detection methods struggle with extracting task-relevant information, cross-modal alignment, and modeling complex dependencies. CNNs have limited receptive fields, Transformers have quadratic complexity, and SSMs disrupt spatial structures when flattening 2D to 1D sequences.

Method: Proposes M2I2HA with three key modules: 1) Intra-Hypergraph Enhancement for capturing many-to-many high-order relationships within each modality, 2) Inter-Hypergraph Fusion for aligning and fusing cross-modal features while bridging configuration/spatial gaps, and 3) M2-FullPAD for adaptive multi-level fusion and enhanced data distribution across the architecture.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal object detection tasks compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The hypergraph-based approach effectively addresses limitations of existing architectures by better capturing complex dependencies within and across modalities, leading to superior multi-modal object detection performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal detection have significantly improved detection accuracy in challenging environments (e.g., low light, overexposure). By integrating RGB with modalities such as thermal and depth, multi-modal fusion increases data redundancy and system robustness. However, significant challenges remain in effectively extracting task-relevant information both within and across modalities, as well as in achieving precise cross-modal alignment. While CNNs excel at feature extraction, they are limited by constrained receptive fields, strong inductive biases, and difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies. Transformer-based models offer global context but suffer from quadratic computational complexity and are confined to pairwise correlation modeling. Mamba and other State Space Models (SSMs), on the other hand, are hindered by their sequential scanning mechanism, which flattens 2D spatial structures into 1D sequences, disrupting topological relationships and limiting the modeling of complex higher-order dependencies. To address these issues, we propose a multi-modal perception network based on hypergraph theory called M2I2HA. Our architecture includes an Intra-Hypergraph Enhancement module to capture global many-to-many high-order relationships within each modality, and an Inter-Hypergraph Fusion module to align, enhance, and fuse cross-modal features by bridging configuration and spatial gaps between data sources. We further introduce a M2-FullPAD module to enable adaptive multi-level fusion of multi-modal enhanced features within the network, meanwhile enhancing data distribution and flow across the architecture. Extensive object detection experiments on multiple public datasets against baselines demonstrate that M2I2HA achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal object detection tasks.

TL;DR: FunCineForge: An end-to-end pipeline for creating large-scale dubbing datasets and an MLLM-based dubbing model that outperforms SOTA methods across various cinematic scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dubbing methods face limitations due to scarce high-quality multimodal datasets (limited scale, high word error rates, sparse annotations, costly manual labeling, restricted to monologues) and models that rely solely on lip regions, limiting applicability to complex cinematic scenes with suboptimal performance in lip sync, speech quality, and emotional expressiveness.

Method: Proposes FunCineForge with two components: (1) an end-to-end production pipeline for large-scale dubbing datasets, and (2) an MLLM-based dubbing model designed for diverse cinematic scenes. Constructs the first Chinese television dubbing dataset with rich annotations using this pipeline.

Result: The constructed dataset demonstrates high quality. Experiments across monologue, narration, dialogue, and multi-speaker scenes show the dubbing model consistently outperforms SOTA methods in audio quality, lip sync, timbre transfer, and instruction following.

Conclusion: FunCineForge addresses key limitations in movie dubbing by providing a scalable dataset creation pipeline and a superior MLLM-based model that handles diverse cinematic scenes effectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics.

Abstract: Movie dubbing is the task of synthesizing speech from scripts conditioned on video scenes, requiring accurate lip sync, faithful timbre transfer, and proper modeling of character identity and emotion. However, existing methods face two major limitations: (1) high-quality multimodal dubbing datasets are limited in scale, suffer from high word error rates, contain sparse annotations, rely on costly manual labeling, and are restricted to monologue scenes, all of which hinder effective model training; (2) existing dubbing models rely solely on the lip region to learn audio-visual alignment, which limits their applicability to complex live-action cinematic scenes, and exhibit suboptimal performance in lip sync, speech quality, and emotional expressiveness. To address these issues, we propose FunCineForge, which comprises an end-to-end production pipeline for large-scale dubbing datasets and an MLLM-based dubbing model designed for diverse cinematic scenes. Using the pipeline, we construct the first Chinese television dubbing dataset with rich annotations, and demonstrate the high quality of these data. Experiments across monologue, narration, dialogue, and multi-speaker scenes show that our dubbing model consistently outperforms SOTA methods in audio quality, lip sync, timbre transfer, and instruction following.

*Yifei Liu,Changxing Ding,Ling Guo,Huaiguang Jiang,Qiong Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAM introduces a motion reconstruction branch and Reconstructive Error Guidance to address representational gaps and error propagation in text-to-motion diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion diffusion models suffer from two key limitations: 1) representational gap due to pre-trained text encoders lacking motion-specific information, and 2) error propagation during iterative denoising processes.

Method: Two main components: 1) RAM uses a motion latent space with co-trained reconstruction branch featuring self-regularization and motion-centric latent alignment objectives. 2) Reconstructive Error Guidance (REG) - a testing-stage mechanism that amplifies residuals between current predictions and reconstructed estimates to highlight improvements.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements and state-of-the-art performance in text-to-motion generation tasks.

Conclusion: RAM effectively addresses representational gaps and error propagation in motion diffusion models through motion latent space supervision and reconstructive error guidance, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Diffusion models have seen widespread adoption for text-driven human motion generation and related tasks due to their impressive generative capabilities and flexibility. However, current motion diffusion models face two major limitations: a representational gap caused by pre-trained text encoders that lack motion-specific information, and error propagation during the iterative denoising process. This paper introduces Reconstruction-Anchored Diffusion Model (RAM) to address these challenges. First, RAM leverages a motion latent space as intermediate supervision for text-to-motion generation. To this end, RAM co-trains a motion reconstruction branch with two key objective functions: self-regularization to enhance the discrimination of the motion space and motion-centric latent alignment to enable accurate mapping from text to the motion latent space. Second, we propose Reconstructive Error Guidance (REG), a testing-stage guidance mechanism that exploits the diffusion model's inherent self-correction ability to mitigate error propagation. At each denoising step, REG uses the motion reconstruction branch to reconstruct the previous estimate, reproducing the prior error patterns. By amplifying the residual between the current prediction and the reconstructed estimate, REG highlights the improvements in the current prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAM achieves significant improvements and state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be released.

TL;DR: Synthetic images from Stable Diffusion with LoRA can effectively augment limited real datasets for Chinese porcelain classification, with task-specific improvements up to 5.5% F1-macro.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scarcity of training data poses a fundamental challenge for deep learning in archaeological artifact classification, especially for rare types of Chinese porcelain.

Method: Used Stable Diffusion with LoRA to generate synthetic images, then trained MobileNetV3 with transfer learning on mixed real-synthetic datasets (95:5 and 90:10 ratios) for four classification tasks: dynasty, glaze, kiln, and type identification.

Result: Type classification showed the most substantial improvement (5.5% F1-macro increase with 90:10 ratio), while dynasty and kiln tasks exhibited modest gains (3-4%). Synthetic augmentation effectiveness depends on alignment between generated features and task-relevant visual signatures.

Conclusion: Provides practical guidelines for deploying generative AI in archaeological research, demonstrating both potential and limitations of synthetic data when balancing archaeological authenticity with data diversity.

Abstract: The scarcity of training data presents a fundamental challenge in applying deep learning to archaeological artifact classification, particularly for the rare types of Chinese porcelain. This study investigates whether synthetic images generated through Stable Diffusion with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can effectively augment limited real datasets for multi-task CNN-based porcelain classification. Using MobileNetV3 with transfer learning, we conducted controlled experiments comparing models trained on pure real data against those trained on mixed real-synthetic datasets (95:5 and 90:10 ratios) across four classification tasks: dynasty, glaze, kiln and type identification. Results demonstrate task-specific benefits: type classification showed the most substantial improvement (5.5\% F1-macro increase with 90:10 ratio), while dynasty and kiln tasks exhibited modest gains (3-4\%), suggesting that synthetic augmentation effectiveness depends on the alignment between generated features and task-relevant visual signatures. Our work contributes practical guidelines for deploying generative AI in archaeological research, demonstrating both the potential and limitations of synthetic data when archaeological authenticity must be balanced with data diversity.

### [47] [UniRoute: Unified Routing Mixture-of-Experts for Modality-Adaptive Remote Sensing Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14797)
*Qingling Shu,Sibao Chen,Wei Lu,Zhihui You,Chengzhuang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniRoute is a unified framework for modality-adaptive remote sensing change detection that addresses limitations of specialized models through conditional routing and self-distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current change detection methods rely on specialized models that don't scale well across different modalities. Homogeneous CD needs fine spatial details while heterogeneous CD requires broader context, and difference operators work poorly for cross-modal or misaligned scenarios.

Method: Proposes UniRoute with: 1) AR2-MoE module for disentangling local spatial details from global context, 2) MDR-MoE module for adaptive fusion primitive selection per pixel, and 3) CASD strategy for stabilizing training in data-scarce heterogeneous settings.

Result: Extensive experiments on five public datasets show strong overall performance with favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off under unified deployment.

Conclusion: UniRoute provides a unified solution for modality-adaptive change detection that overcomes limitations of specialized models through adaptive routing mechanisms and consistency-aware training.

Abstract: Current remote sensing change detection (CD) methods mainly rely on specialized models, which limits the scalability toward modality-adaptive Earth observation. For homogeneous CD, precise boundary delineation relies on fine-grained spatial cues and local pixel interactions, whereas heterogeneous CD instead requires broader contextual information to suppress speckle noise and geometric distortions. Moreover, difference operator (e.g., subtraction) works well for aligned homogeneous images but introduces artifacts in cross-modal or geometrically misaligned scenarios. Across different modality settings, specialized models based on static backbones or fixed difference operations often prove insufficient. To address this challenge, we propose UniRoute, a unified framework for modality-adaptive learning by reformulating feature extraction and fusion as conditional routing problems. We introduce an Adaptive Receptive Field Routing MoE (AR2-MoE) module to disentangle local spatial details from global semantic context, and a Modality-Aware Difference Routing MoE (MDR-MoE) module to adaptively select the most suitable fusion primitive at each pixel. In addition, we propose a Consistency-Aware Self-Distillation (CASD) strategy that stabilizes unified training under data-scarce heterogeneous settings by enforcing multi-level consistency. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that UniRoute achieves strong overall performance, with a favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off under a unified deployment setting.

*Qihua Liang,Liang Chen,Yaozong Zheng,Jian Nong,Zhiyi Mo,Bineng Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UBATrack introduces a Mamba-based multi-modal tracking framework with spatio-temporal modeling and dynamic feature mixing, achieving SOTA results on RGB-T, RGB-D, and RGB-E benchmarks without full fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal trackers using prompt learning overlook effective spatio-temporal cue capture, limiting their performance despite integrating complementary modalities like thermal, depth, and event data.

Method: UBATrack uses two modules: 1) Spatio-temporal Mamba Adapter (STMA) leveraging Mamba's long-sequence modeling for cross-modal dependencies and spatio-temporal cues via adapter-tuning, and 2) Dynamic Multi-modal Feature Mixer enhancing representation across feature dimensions.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on RGB-T, RGB-D, and RGB-E tracking benchmarks (LasHeR, RGBT234, RGBT210, DepthTrack, VOT-RGBD22, VisEvent datasets) while eliminating costly full-parameter fine-tuning.

Conclusion: UBATrack effectively captures spatio-temporal cues in multi-modal tracking through Mamba-based architecture, achieving superior performance with improved training efficiency across diverse modality combinations.

Abstract: Multi-modal object tracking has attracted considerable attention by integrating multiple complementary inputs (e.g., thermal, depth, and event data) to achieve outstanding performance. Although current general-purpose multi-modal trackers primarily unify various modal tracking tasks (i.e., RGB-Thermal infrared, RGB-Depth or RGB-Event tracking) through prompt learning, they still overlook the effective capture of spatio-temporal cues. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-modal tracking framework based on a mamba-style state space model, termed UBATrack. Our UBATrack comprises two simple yet effective modules: a Spatio-temporal Mamba Adapter (STMA) and a Dynamic Multi-modal Feature Mixer. The former leverages Mamba's long-sequence modeling capability to jointly model cross-modal dependencies and spatio-temporal visual cues in an adapter-tuning manner. The latter further enhances multi-modal representation capacity across multiple feature dimensions to improve tracking robustness. In this way, UBATrack eliminates the need for costly full-parameter fine-tuning, thereby improving the training efficiency of multi-modal tracking algorithms. Experiments show that UBATrack outperforms state-of-the-art methods on RGB-T, RGB-D, and RGB-E tracking benchmarks, achieving outstanding results on the LasHeR, RGBT234, RGBT210, DepthTrack, VOT-RGBD22, and VisEvent datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LocBAM: A novel attention mechanism that incorporates location context into patch-based 3D medical image segmentation to improve performance when anatomical context is important.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Patch-based methods for 3D medical image segmentation often ignore patch location within the global volume, limiting performance when anatomical context matters. This is especially problematic with low patch-to-volume coverage where global context is missing.

Method: Proposes LocBAM, a novel attention mechanism that explicitly processes spatial information and incorporates location context into patch-based segmentation. Compares against classical coordinate encoding via CoordConv.

Result: Experiments on BTCV, AMOS22, and KiTS23 datasets show that incorporating location context stabilizes training and improves segmentation performance, especially under low patch-to-volume coverage. LocBAM consistently outperforms CoordConv.

Conclusion: Location context is important for patch-based 3D medical image segmentation, and the proposed LocBAM attention mechanism effectively incorporates this information to improve performance, particularly when global context is limited.

Abstract: Patch-based methods are widely used in 3D medical image segmentation to address memory constraints in processing high-resolution volumetric data. However, these approaches often neglect the patch's location within the global volume, which can limit segmentation performance when anatomical context is important. In this paper, we investigate the role of location context in patch-based 3D segmentation and propose a novel attention mechanism, LocBAM, that explicitly processes spatial information. Experiments on BTCV, AMOS22, and KiTS23 demonstrate that incorporating location context stabilizes training and improves segmentation performance, particularly under low patch-to-volume coverage where global context is missing. Furthermore, LocBAM consistently outperforms classical coordinate encoding via CoordConv. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/compai-lab/2026-ISBI-hooft

*Tobias Weißberg,Weikang Wang,Paul Roetzer,Nafie El Amrani,Florian Bernard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a feature disentanglement approach for 3D shapes that extracts both symmetry-informative and symmetry-agnostic features, with refinement to improve robustness, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in symmetry detection and shape matching tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing symmetry-aware shape descriptors are limited - recent methods extract only 1D symmetry-informative features, missing other semantic information, and produce noisy results with misclassified patches. There's a need for better symmetry-aware descriptors that preserve comprehensive semantic information while being robust.

Method: Feature disentanglement approach that simultaneously extracts symmetry-informative and symmetry-agnostic features from shape descriptors. Includes a feature refinement technique to improve robustness of predicted symmetry-informative features.

Result: Extensive experiments show effectiveness in intrinsic symmetry detection, left/right classification, and shape matching tasks. Outperforms various state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses limitations of existing symmetry-aware descriptors by providing comprehensive feature disentanglement and refinement, demonstrating superior performance across multiple shape analysis tasks.

Abstract: Shape descriptors, i.e., per-vertex features of 3D meshes or point clouds, are fundamental to shape analysis. Historically, various handcrafted geometry-aware descriptors and feature refinement techniques have been proposed. Recently, several studies have initiated a new research direction by leveraging features from image foundation models to create semantics-aware descriptors, demonstrating advantages across tasks like shape matching, editing, and segmentation. Symmetry, another key concept in shape analysis, has also attracted increasing attention. Consequently, constructing symmetry-aware shape descriptors is a natural progression. Although the recent method $χ$ (Wang et al., 2025) successfully extracted symmetry-informative features from semantic-aware descriptors, its features are only one-dimensional, neglecting other valuable semantic information. Furthermore, the extracted symmetry-informative feature is usually noisy and yields small misclassified patches. To address these gaps, we propose a feature disentanglement approach which is simultaneously symmetry informative and symmetry agnostic. Further, we propose a feature refinement technique to improve the robustness of predicted symmetry informative features. Extensive experiments, including intrinsic symmetry detection, left/right classification, and shape matching, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework compared to various state-of-the-art methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

TL;DR: POTR is a post-training compression codec for 3D Gaussian Splatting that reduces storage requirements while maintaining quality and accelerating inference through novel pruning and lighting coefficient optimization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers faster training and inference than NeRF but has substantially higher storage requirements, creating a need for efficient compression methods that don't require retraining.

Method: POTR uses two novel techniques: 1) A pruning approach using a modified 3DGS rasterizer to calculate each splat's removal effect simultaneously, and 2) A method to recompute lighting coefficients to reduce entropy without training. It also includes an optional fine-tuning scheme.

Result: POTR achieves 2-4x fewer splats than other post-training pruning techniques, 1.5-2x faster inference than other compressed models, increases AC lighting coefficient sparsity from 70% to 97%, and outperforms all other post-training compression techniques in rate-distortion performance and inference speed.

Conclusion: POTR provides an effective post-training compression solution for 3DGS that significantly reduces storage requirements while improving inference speed and maintaining quality, making 3DGS more practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a promising contender to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) in 3D scene reconstruction and real-time novel view synthesis. 3DGS outperforms NeRF in training and inference speed but has substantially higher storage requirements. To remedy this downside, we propose POTR, a post-training 3DGS codec built on two novel techniques. First, POTR introduces a novel pruning approach that uses a modified 3DGS rasterizer to efficiently calculate every splat's individual removal effect simultaneously. This technique results in 2-4x fewer splats than other post-training pruning techniques and as a result also significantly accelerates inference with experiments demonstrating 1.5-2x faster inference than other compressed models. Second, we propose a novel method to recompute lighting coefficients, significantly reducing their entropy without using any form of training. Our fast and highly parallel approach especially increases AC lighting coefficient sparsity, with experiments demonstrating increases from 70% to 97%, with minimal loss in quality. Finally, we extend POTR with a simple fine-tuning scheme to further enhance pruning, inference, and rate-distortion performance. Experiments demonstrate that POTR, even without fine-tuning, consistently outperforms all other post-training compression techniques in both rate-distortion performance and inference speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microtubules are essential cytoskeletal filaments and therapeutic targets, but their segmentation is challenging due to filament curvature, dense crossings, and image noise. Accurate segmentation is critical for studying microtubule organization and dynamics.

Method: MTFlow uses a time-conditioned flow-matching model with a U-Net backbone and temporal embeddings. Unlike conventional U-Net variants that predict masks in one pass, it learns vector fields that iteratively transport noisy masks toward ground truth through trajectory-based refinement.

Result: MTFlow achieves competitive segmentation accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art models on synthetic and real microtubule datasets. It also generalizes well to other curvilinear biomedical structures like retinal blood vessels and nerves, offering time-efficient analysis with more precise annotations than manual/semi-automatic approaches.

Conclusion: MTFlow provides a powerful, interpretable tool for filamentous structure analysis with trajectory-based refinement capabilities, addressing challenges in microtubule segmentation while maintaining competitive performance and generalization to related biomedical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Microtubules are cytoskeletal filaments that play essential roles in many cellular processes and are key therapeutic targets in several diseases. Accurate segmentation of microtubule networks is critical for studying their organization and dynamics but remains challenging due to filament curvature, dense crossings, and image noise. We present MTFlow, a novel time-conditioned flow-matching model for microtubule segmentation. Unlike conventional U-Net variants that predict masks in a single pass, MTFlow learns vector fields that iteratively transport noisy masks toward the ground truth, enabling interpretable, trajectory-based refinement. Our architecture combines a U-Net backbone with temporal embeddings, allowing the model to capture the dynamics of uncertainty resolution along filament boundaries. We trained and evaluated MTFlow on synthetic and real microtubule datasets and assessed its generalization capability on public biomedical datasets of curvilinear structures such as retinal blood vessels and nerves. MTFlow achieves competitive segmentation accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art models, offering a powerful and time-efficient tool for filamentous structure analysis with more precise annotations than manual or semi-automatic approaches.

Method: Proposes GAT-NeRF, a hybrid framework integrating Transformer mechanism into NeRF pipeline. Combines coordinate-aligned MLP with lightweight Geometry-Aware-Transformer (GAT) module that fuses multi-modal inputs: 3D spatial coordinates, 3DMM expression parameters, and learnable latent codes to enhance feature representations for fine-grained geometry.

Result: Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in visual fidelity and high-frequency detail recovery, particularly for complex local facial patterns like dynamic wrinkles and acne scars.

Conclusion: GAT-NeRF forges new pathways for creating realistic dynamic digital humans for multimedia applications by significantly enhancing the modeling of fine facial details from monocular video.

Abstract: High-fidelity 4D dynamic facial avatar reconstruction from monocular video is a critical yet challenging task, driven by increasing demands for immersive virtual human applications. While Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have advanced scene representation, their capacity to capture high-frequency facial details, such as dynamic wrinkles and subtle textures from information-constrained monocular streams, requires significant enhancement. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel hybrid neural radiance field framework, called Geometry-Aware-Transformer Enhanced NeRF (GAT-NeRF) for high-fidelity and controllable 4D facial avatar reconstruction, which integrates the Transformer mechanism into the NeRF pipeline. GAT-NeRF synergistically combines a coordinate-aligned Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with a lightweight Transformer module, termed as Geometry-Aware-Transformer (GAT) due to its processing of multi-modal inputs containing explicit geometric priors. The GAT module is enabled by fusing multi-modal input features, including 3D spatial coordinates, 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) expression parameters, and learnable latent codes to effectively learn and enhance feature representations pertinent to fine-grained geometry. The Transformer's effective feature learning capabilities are leveraged to significantly augment the modeling of complex local facial patterns like dynamic wrinkles and acne scars. Comprehensive experiments unequivocally demonstrate GAT-NeRF's state-of-the-art performance in visual fidelity and high-frequency detail recovery, forging new pathways for creating realistic dynamic digital humans for multimedia applications.

TL;DR: SpatialMem is a memory system that creates queryable 3D representations from casual RGB video, combining geometry, semantics, and language for spatial reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable embodied spatial intelligence by creating a unified representation that combines 3D geometry, semantics, and language from casual egocentric video, supporting interpretable reasoning over spatial relations without specialized sensors.

Method: Reconstructs metrically scaled indoor environments from RGB video, detects structural 3D anchors (walls, doors, windows) as scaffold, and populates hierarchical memory with open-vocabulary object nodes linking evidence patches, visual embeddings, and textual descriptions to 3D coordinates.

Result: Experiments across three real-life indoor scenes show SpatialMem maintains strong anchor-description-level navigation completion and hierarchical retrieval accuracy under increasing clutter and occlusion.

Conclusion: SpatialMem offers an efficient and extensible framework for embodied spatial intelligence that enables interpretable reasoning over spatial relations and supports downstream tasks like language-guided navigation and object retrieval.

Abstract: We present SpatialMem, a memory-centric system that unifies 3D geometry, semantics, and language into a single, queryable representation. Starting from casually captured egocentric RGB video, SpatialMem reconstructs metrically scaled indoor environments, detects structural 3D anchors (walls, doors, windows) as the first-layer scaffold, and populates a hierarchical memory with open-vocabulary object nodes -- linking evidence patches, visual embeddings, and two-layer textual descriptions to 3D coordinates -- for compact storage and fast retrieval. This design enables interpretable reasoning over spatial relations (e.g., distance, direction, visibility) and supports downstream tasks such as language-guided navigation and object retrieval without specialized sensors. Experiments across three real-life indoor scenes demonstrate that SpatialMem maintains strong anchor-description-level navigation completion and hierarchical retrieval accuracy under increasing clutter and occlusion, offering an efficient and extensible framework for embodied spatial intelligence.

TL;DR: EroSeg-AT: Vulnerability-aware adversarial training framework using EroSeg to generate adversarial examples that disrupt semantic consistency, improving attack effectiveness and model robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing segmentation models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and current adversarial training methods are limited because they only consider global semantic information while ignoring contextual semantic relationships within samples.

Method: Propose EroSeg-AT framework using EroSeg to generate adversarial examples. EroSeg first selects sensitive pixels based on pixel-level confidence, then progressively propagates perturbations to higher-confidence pixels to disrupt semantic consistency.

Result: Experimental results show the approach significantly improves attack effectiveness compared to existing methods and enhances model robustness under adversarial training.

Conclusion: EroSeg-AT effectively addresses limitations of existing adversarial training by considering contextual semantic relationships, leading to better attack performance and improved model robustness.

Abstract: Existing segmentation models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial attacks.To improve robustness, adversarial training incorporates adversarial examples into model training. However, existing attack methods consider only global semantic information and ignore contextual semantic relationships within the samples, limiting the effectiveness of adversarial training. To address this issue, we propose EroSeg-AT, a vulnerability-aware adversarial training framework that leverages EroSeg to generate adversarial examples. EroSeg first selects sensitive pixels based on pixel-level confidence and then progressively propagates perturbations to higher-confidence pixels, effectively disrupting the semantic consistency of the samples. Experimental results show that, compared to existing methods, our approach significantly improves attack effectiveness and enhances model robustness under adversarial training.

### [57] [TempViz: On the Evaluation of Temporal Knowledge in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14951)
*Carolin Holtermann,Nina Krebs,Anne Lauscher*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TempViz is the first dataset to evaluate temporal knowledge in text-to-image models, revealing weak temporal competence across models and unreliable automated evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time significantly affects visual appearance of entities, making temporal knowledge crucial for generating contextually-relevant images. Despite substantial NLP research on temporal understanding, there's scarce research on how temporal phenomena appear and are handled in text-to-image models.

Method: Created TempViz dataset with 7.9k prompts and 600+ reference images to holistically evaluate temporal knowledge. Studied five T2I models across five temporal knowledge categories using human evaluation, and examined automated evaluation methods by comparing them against human judgments.

Result: Temporal competence in T2I models is generally weak, with no model exceeding 75% accuracy across categories. Automated evaluation methods fail to provide reliable assessment of temporal cues, showing poor correlation with human judgments.

Conclusion: There is a pressing need for future research on temporal knowledge in text-to-image models, as current models show limited temporal understanding and existing evaluation methods are inadequate for assessing temporal cues.

Abstract: Time alters the visual appearance of entities in our world, like objects, places, and animals. Thus, for accurately generating contextually-relevant images, knowledge and reasoning about time can be crucial (e.g., for generating a landscape in spring vs. in winter). Yet, although substantial work exists on understanding and improving temporal knowledge in natural language processing, research on how temporal phenomena appear and are handled in text-to-image (T2I) models remains scarce. We address this gap with TempViz, the first data set to holistically evaluate temporal knowledge in image generation, consisting of 7.9k prompts and more than 600 reference images. Using TempViz, we study the capabilities of five T2I models across five temporal knowledge categories. Human evaluation shows that temporal competence is generally weak, with no model exceeding 75% accuracy across categories. Towards larger-scale studies, we also examine automated evaluation methods, comparing several established approaches against human judgments. However, none of these approaches provides a reliable assessment of temporal cues - further indicating the pressing need for future research on temporal knowledge in T2I.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LDF-VFI introduces a video-centric diffusion transformer for frame interpolation that ensures long-range temporal coherence through auto-regressive modeling, skip-concatenate sampling, and efficient processing of arbitrary resolutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VFI methods use frame-centric approaches that process videos as independent short segments, causing temporal inconsistencies and motion artifacts. The paper aims to overcome these limitations with a holistic, video-centric paradigm.

Method: Proposes LDF-VFI built on an auto-regressive diffusion transformer modeling entire video sequences. Introduces skip-concatenate sampling to mitigate error accumulation, sparse local attention with tiled VAE encoding for efficiency and arbitrary resolution support, and an enhanced conditional VAE decoder using multi-scale input features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging long-sequence benchmarks, demonstrating superior per-frame quality and temporal consistency, especially in scenes with large motion.

Conclusion: LDF-VFI successfully addresses temporal inconsistency in video frame interpolation through a holistic video-centric approach with diffusion transformers, offering efficient processing and generalization to arbitrary resolutions without retraining.

Abstract: Existing video frame interpolation (VFI) methods often adopt a frame-centric approach, processing videos as independent short segments (e.g., triplets), which leads to temporal inconsistencies and motion artifacts. To overcome this, we propose a holistic, video-centric paradigm named \textbf{L}ocal \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{F}orcing for \textbf{V}ideo \textbf{F}rame \textbf{I}nterpolation (LDF-VFI). Our framework is built upon an auto-regressive diffusion transformer that models the entire video sequence to ensure long-range temporal coherence. To mitigate error accumulation inherent in auto-regressive generation, we introduce a novel skip-concatenate sampling strategy that effectively maintains temporal stability. Furthermore, LDF-VFI incorporates sparse, local attention and tiled VAE encoding, a combination that not only enables efficient processing of long sequences but also allows generalization to arbitrary spatial resolutions (e.g., 4K) at inference without retraining. An enhanced conditional VAE decoder, which leverages multi-scale features from the input video, further improves reconstruction fidelity. Empirically, LDF-VFI achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging long-sequence benchmarks, demonstrating superior per-frame quality and temporal consistency, especially in scenes with large motion.

*Nilanjana Chatterjee,Sidharatha Garg,A V Subramanyam,Brejesh Lall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scale-TBPS trains a single unified model for text-based person search across multiple datasets using noise-aware dataset curation and scalable identity learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TBPS methods require dataset-specific fine-tuning due to limited training data and VLMs not being pre-trained for pedestrian recognition, leading to multiple independent models. Synthetic data helps but doesn't eliminate dataset-specific adaptation.

Method: Proposes Scale-TBPS with two key components: (1) noise-aware unified dataset curation strategy that cohesively merges diverse TBPS datasets, and (2) scalable discriminative identity learning framework effective with large numbers of unique identities.

Result: Extensive experiments on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, RSTPReid, IIITD-20K, and UFine6926 show that a single Scale-TBPS model outperforms both dataset-centric optimized models and naive joint training approaches.

Conclusion: Scale-TBPS successfully addresses the challenge of training a unified TBPS model across multiple datasets by overcoming limitations of current training paradigms that don't scale well to large identity counts and are vulnerable to noisy data.

Abstract: Text-Based Person Search (TBPS) has seen significant progress with vision-language models (VLMs), yet it remains constrained by limited training data and the fact that VLMs are not inherently pre-trained for pedestrian-centric recognition. Existing TBPS methods therefore rely on dataset-centric fine-tuning to handle distribution shift, resulting in multiple independently trained models for different datasets. While synthetic data can increase the scale needed to fine-tune VLMs, it does not eliminate dataset-specific adaptation. This motivates a fundamental question: can we train a single unified TBPS model across multiple datasets? We show that naive joint training over all datasets remains sub-optimal because current training paradigms do not scale to a large number of unique person identities and are vulnerable to noisy image-text pairs. To address these challenges, we propose Scale-TBPS with two contributions: (i) a noise-aware unified dataset curation strategy that cohesively merges diverse TBPS datasets; and (ii) a scalable discriminative identity learning framework that remains effective under a large number of unique identities. Extensive experiments on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, RSTPReid, IIITD-20K, and UFine6926 demonstrate that a single Scale-TBPS model outperforms dataset-centric optimized models and naive joint training.

*Xiaodong Wang,Langling Huang,Zhirong Wu,Xu Zhao,Teng Xu,Xuhong Xia,Peixi Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiViBench is the first omnimodal benchmark for interactive livestream videos with 24 tasks, featuring a semi-automatic annotation workflow and LiVi-LLM-7B model that outperforms larger open-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video evaluation benchmarks focus on non-interactive videos (movies, recordings), creating a gap for interactive livestream video understanding which involves audio, speech, and real-time comments.

Method: 1) Created LiViBench with 24 diverse tasks using standardized semi-automatic annotation workflow with human-in-the-loop; 2) Developed LiVi-LLM-7B with two-stage instruction-tuning and Video-to-Comment Retrieval (VCR) module; 3) Used multi-agent MLLM system for video description and seed-question-driven annotation.

Result: LiVi-LLM-7B outperforms larger open-source models (up to 72B parameters), narrows gap with proprietary models on LiViBench, and achieves enhanced performance on general video benchmarks (VideoMME, LongVideoBench, MLVU, VideoEval-Pro).

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the gap in interactive livestream video understanding by introducing the first omnimodal benchmark (LiViBench) and developing a specialized model (LiVi-LLM-7B) that demonstrates superior performance on both interactive and general video tasks.

Abstract: The development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has advanced general video understanding. However, existing video evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on non-interactive videos, such as movies and recordings. To fill this gap, this paper proposes the first omnimodal benchmark for interactive livestream videos, LiViBench. It features a diverse set of 24 tasks, highlighting the perceptual, reasoning, and livestream-specific challenges. To efficiently construct the dataset, we design a standardized semi-automatic annotation workflow that incorporates the human-in-the-loop at multiple stages. The workflow leverages multiple MLLMs to form a multi-agent system for comprehensive video description and uses a seed-question-driven method to construct high-quality annotations. All interactive videos in the benchmark include audio, speech, and real-time comments modalities. To enhance models' understanding of interactive videos, we design tailored two-stage instruction-tuning and propose a Video-to-Comment Retrieval (VCR) module to improve the model's ability to utilize real-time comments. Based on these advancements, we develop LiVi-LLM-7B, an MLLM with enhanced knowledge of interactive livestreams. Experiments show that our model outperforms larger open-source models with up to 72B parameters, narrows the gap with leading proprietary models on LiViBench, and achieves enhanced performance on general video benchmarks, including VideoMME, LongVideoBench, MLVU, and VideoEval-Pro.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video-to-audio generation focuses only on semantic and temporal alignment, lacking spatial perception and immersive quality due to reliance on mono audio datasets that don't capture binaural spatial information needed for visual-to-spatial audio mappings.

Method: Two key contributions: 1) BinauralVGGSound - first large-scale video-binaural audio dataset, 2) End-to-end spatial audio generation framework with visual-guided audio spatialization module that explicitly models spatial features while maintaining semantic/temporal alignment.

Result: Approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art models in spatial fidelity and delivers more immersive auditory experience without sacrificing temporal or semantic consistency.

Conclusion: The work addresses the spatial perception gap in video-to-audio generation through novel dataset and framework, enabling realistic spatial audio synthesis from visual cues, with all resources to be publicly released for future research.

Abstract: While video-to-audio generation has achieved remarkable progress in semantic and temporal alignment, most existing studies focus solely on these aspects, paying limited attention to the spatial perception and immersive quality of the synthesized audio. This limitation stems largely from current models' reliance on mono audio datasets, which lack the binaural spatial information needed to learn visual-to-spatial audio mappings. To address this gap, we introduce two key contributions: we construct BinauralVGGSound, the first large-scale video-binaural audio dataset designed to support spatially aware video-to-audio generation; and we propose a end-to-end spatial audio generation framework guided by visual cues, which explicitly models spatial features. Our framework incorporates a visual-guided audio spatialization module that ensures the generated audio exhibits realistic spatial attributes and layered spatial depth while maintaining semantic and temporal alignment. Experiments show that our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art models in spatial fidelity and delivers a more immersive auditory experience, without sacrificing temporal or semantic consistency. All datasets, code, and model checkpoints will be publicly released to facilitate future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Federated learning enables multi-institutional brain tumor analysis without data sharing, matching centralized performance while providing explainable attention patterns aligned with clinical practice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain tumor analysis requires large datasets but privacy regulations prevent data sharing across institutions, creating a need for privacy-preserving collaborative learning approaches.

Method: Federated learning framework using hybrid Transformer-Graph Neural Network architecture deployed within CAFEIN platform, with explainability analysis through Transformer attention mechanisms.

Result: Federated learning enables continued model improvement beyond isolated training, matching centralized performance; deeper layers show increased attention to T2 and FLAIR modalities (p<0.001, Cohen's d=1.50).

Conclusion: Federated learning is justified for complex medical tasks as it aggregates knowledge from multiple institutions while preserving privacy, with explainability aligning with clinical practice.

Abstract: Deep learning models for brain tumor analysis require large and diverse datasets that are often siloed across healthcare institutions due to privacy regulations. We present a federated learning framework for brain tumor localization that enables multi-institutional collaboration without sharing sensitive patient data. Our method extends a hybrid Transformer-Graph Neural Network architecture derived from prior decoder-free supervoxel GNNs and is deployed within CAFEIN\textsuperscript{\textregistered}, CERN's federated learning platform designed for healthcare environments. We provide an explainability analysis through Transformer attention mechanisms that reveals which MRI modalities drive the model predictions. Experiments on the BraTS dataset demonstrate a key finding: while isolated training on individual client data triggers early stopping well before reaching full training capacity, federated learning enables continued model improvement by leveraging distributed data, ultimately matching centralized performance. This result provides strong justification for federated learning when dealing with complex tasks and high-dimensional input data, as aggregating knowledge from multiple institutions significantly benefits the learning process. Our explainability analysis, validated through rigorous statistical testing on the full test set (paired t-tests with Bonferroni correction), reveals that deeper network layers significantly increase attention to T2 and FLAIR modalities ($p<0.001$, Cohen's $d$=1.50), aligning with clinical practice.

TL;DR: Proposes a differential privacy framework using Error Feedback SGD with reconstruction loss and noise injection to generate high-quality synthetic images while maintaining privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional anonymization methods fail to balance privacy protection and data utility for machine learning. Synthetic data can prevent information leakage but existing methods struggle with the privacy-utility trade-off.

Method: Uses Error Feedback Stochastic Gradient Descent (EFSGD) with reconstruction loss and noise injection mechanism for differential privacy generation of synthetic images.

Result: Achieves higher quality images under same privacy budget than related work, with state-of-the-art results on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CelebA benchmarks across almost all metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively generates privacy-preserving synthetic images with good utility, demonstrating generalization across grayscale and RGB image datasets.

Abstract: Traditional data masking techniques such as anonymization cannot achieve the expected privacy protection while ensuring data utility for privacy-preserving machine learning. Synthetic data plays an increasingly important role as it generates a large number of training samples and prevents information leakage in real data. The existing methods suffer from the repeating trade-off processes between privacy and utility. We propose a novel framework for differential privacy generation, which employs an Error Feedback Stochastic Gradient Descent(EFSGD) method and introduces a reconstruction loss and noise injection mechanism into the training process. We generate images with higher quality and usability under the same privacy budget as the related work. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our proposed framework for both grayscale and RGB images. We achieve state-of-the-art results over almost all metrics on three benchmarks: MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CelebA.

TL;DR: New deep leakage attack for federated learning uses generative flow matching prior to reconstruct private client data from model updates, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across various metrics and defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning is vulnerable to deep leakage attacks that reconstruct private client data from shared model updates, but existing methods have limitations in stability, fidelity, and robustness under realistic FL settings.

Method: Integrates generative Flow Matching (FM) prior into reconstruction process, guiding optimization toward realistic image distribution using a flow matching foundation model without requiring knowledge of private data.

Result: Consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks across pixel-level, perceptual, and feature-based similarity metrics on multiple datasets and target models, remaining effective across different training epochs, larger client batch sizes, and under common defenses (noise injection, clipping, sparsification).

Conclusion: The success of this attack calls for development of new defense strategies that explicitly account for adversaries equipped with powerful generative priors.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for decentralized model training, yet it remains vulnerable to deep leakage (DL) attacks that reconstruct private client data from shared model updates. While prior DL methods have demonstrated varying levels of success, they often suffer from instability, limited fidelity, or poor robustness under realistic FL settings. We introduce a new DL attack that integrates a generative Flow Matching (FM) prior into the reconstruction process. By guiding optimization toward the distribution of realistic images (represented by a flow matching foundation model), our method enhances reconstruction fidelity without requiring knowledge of the private data. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and target models demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks across pixel-level, perceptual, and feature-based similarity metrics. Crucially, the method remains effective across different training epochs, larger client batch sizes, and under common defenses such as noise injection, clipping, and sparsification. Our findings call for the development of new defense strategies that explicitly account for adversaries equipped with powerful generative priors.

TL;DR: BREPS introduces a method to evaluate robustness of promptable segmentation models (like SAM) to natural variations in bounding box prompts by generating adversarial bounding boxes that minimize/maximize segmentation error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current promptable segmentation models show strong generalization but their training/evaluation uses synthetic prompts with limited real-world insight. Real user annotations show substantial variability, indicating high sensitivity to natural prompt noise.

Method: 1) Conducted user study collecting real bounding box annotations; 2) Reformulated robustness evaluation as white-box optimization over bounding box prompt space; 3) Developed BREPS method to generate adversarial bounding boxes with naturalness constraints.

Result: Analysis revealed SAM-like models are highly sensitive to natural prompt variations. BREPS enables systematic robustness evaluation across 10 datasets spanning everyday scenes to medical imaging.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a framework for evaluating promptable segmentation model robustness to real-world bounding box variations, highlighting sensitivity issues and providing tools for systematic assessment.

Abstract: Promptable segmentation models such as SAM have established a powerful paradigm, enabling strong generalization to unseen objects and domains with minimal user input, including points, bounding boxes, and text prompts. Among these, bounding boxes stand out as particularly effective, often outperforming points while significantly reducing annotation costs. However, current training and evaluation protocols typically rely on synthetic prompts generated through simple heuristics, offering limited insight into real-world robustness. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of promptable segmentation models to natural variations in bounding box prompts. First, we conduct a controlled user study and collect thousands of real bounding box annotations. Our analysis reveals substantial variability in segmentation quality across users for the same model and instance, indicating that SAM-like models are highly sensitive to natural prompt noise. Then, since exhaustive testing of all possible user inputs is computationally prohibitive, we reformulate robustness evaluation as a white-box optimization problem over the bounding box prompt space. We introduce BREPS, a method for generating adversarial bounding boxes that minimize or maximize segmentation error while adhering to naturalness constraints. Finally, we benchmark state-of-the-art models across 10 datasets, spanning everyday scenes to medical imaging. Code - https://github.com/emb-ai/BREPS.

TL;DR: A plug-and-play framework that improves CLIP-based FG-BG decomposition for few-shot OOD detection by adaptively suppressing background patches and rectifying confusable foreground patches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FG-BG decomposition methods have limitations: uniform background suppression ignores varying patch contributions, and foreground handling fails to address patches that look similar to other classes, misleading training.

Method: Three components: 1) FG-BG Decomposition module to separate foreground/background, 2) Adaptive Background Suppression that weights patch entropy adaptively, 3) Confusable Foreground Rectification to identify and fix confusing foreground patches.

Result: Extensive experiments show the framework significantly improves performance of existing FG-BG decomposition methods for few-shot OOD detection.

Conclusion: The proposed plug-and-play framework effectively addresses limitations of current FG-BG methods by adaptive background suppression and foreground rectification, enhancing few-shot OOD detection performance.

Abstract: CLIP-based foreground-background (FG-BG) decomposition methods have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in improving few-shot out-of-distribution (OOD) detection performance. However, existing approaches still suffer from several limitations. For background regions obtained from decomposition, existing methods adopt a uniform suppression strategy for all patches, overlooking the varying contributions of different patches to the prediction. For foreground regions, existing methods fail to adequately consider that some local patches may exhibit appearance or semantic similarity to other classes, which may mislead the training process. To address these issues, we propose a new plug-and-play framework. This framework consists of three core components: (1) a Foreground-Background Decomposition module, which follows previous FG-BG methods to separate an image into foreground and background regions; (2) an Adaptive Background Suppression module, which adaptively weights patch classification entropy; and (3) a Confusable Foreground Rectification module, which identifies and rectifies confusable foreground patches. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed plug-and-play framework significantly improves the performance of existing FG-BG decomposition methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cervical spine fractures require precise detection for clinical management, but traditional 3D segmentation methods are computationally complex. The study aims to develop an efficient 2D projection-based approach that reduces computational burden while maintaining high performance.

Method: End-to-end pipeline: 1) Approximate 3D volume through optimized 2D axial/sagittal/coronal projections, 2) Use YOLOv8 for ROI detection across views and combine for 3D cervical spine localization, 3) DenseNet121-Unet multi-label segmentation using variance/energy-based projections, 4) Extract individual vertebra volumes from approximated 3D masks, 5) Fracture detection using ensemble of 2.5D Spatio-Sequential models analyzing raw slices and projections.

Result: Achieved 94.45% 3D mIoU for localization, 87.86% Dice score for segmentation. Fracture detection: vertebra-level F1=68.15, ROC-AUC=91.62; patient-level F1=82.26, ROC-AUC=83.04. Competitive performance compared to expert radiologists in interobserver variability analysis.

Conclusion: 2D projection-based approach effectively reduces computational complexity while maintaining high performance for cervical spine fracture detection. The method provides explainable visualizations and demonstrates competitive results compared to expert radiologists, validating its clinical viability.

Abstract: Cervical spine fractures are critical medical conditions requiring precise and efficient detection for effective clinical management. This study explores the viability of 2D projection-based vertebra segmentation for vertebra-level fracture detection in 3D CT volumes, presenting an end-to-end pipeline for automated analysis of cervical vertebrae (C1-C7). By approximating a 3D volume through optimized 2D axial, sagittal, and coronal projections, regions of interest are identified using the YOLOv8 model from all views and combined to approximate the 3D cervical spine area, achieving a 3D mIoU of 94.45 percent. This projection-based localization strategy reduces computational complexity compared to traditional 3D segmentation methods while maintaining high performance. It is followed by a DenseNet121-Unet-based multi-label segmentation leveraging variance- and energy-based projections, achieving a Dice score of 87.86 percent. Strategic approximation of 3D vertebral masks from these 2D segmentation masks enables the extraction of individual vertebra volumes. The volumes are analyzed for fractures using an ensemble of 2.5D Spatio-Sequential models incorporating both raw slices and projections per vertebra for complementary evaluation. This ensemble achieves vertebra-level and patient-level F1 scores of 68.15 and 82.26, and ROC-AUC scores of 91.62 and 83.04, respectively. We further validate our approach through an explainability study that provides saliency map visualizations highlighting anatomical regions relevant for diagnosis, and an interobserver variability analysis comparing our model's performance with expert radiologists, demonstrating competitive results.

Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of decoding visual experiences from fMRI data, where neural responses vary across individuals and trials due to anatomical, functional, cognitive, and experimental factors. This variability makes fMRI-to-image reconstruction non-injective, especially in zero-shot scenarios where reconstructing images for unseen subjects without subject-specific training is needed.

Method: Proposes PictorialCortex with compositional latent formulation that structures stimulus-driven representations under subject-, dataset-, and trial-related variability. Uses a universal cortical latent space with latent factorization-composition module, reinforced by paired factorization and re-factorizing consistency regularization. During inference, aggregates surrogate latents synthesized under multiple seen-subject conditions to guide diffusion-based image synthesis for unseen subjects.

Result: Extensive experiments show that PictorialCortex improves zero-shot cross-subject visual reconstruction, demonstrating the benefits of compositional latent modeling and multi-dataset training on the unified UniCortex-fMRI dataset.

Conclusion: The compositional latent modeling approach successfully addresses cross-subject variability in fMRI-to-image reconstruction, enabling zero-shot reconstruction for unseen individuals through structured representation learning and multi-dataset training.

Abstract: Decoding visual experiences from human brain activity remains a central challenge at the intersection of neuroscience, neuroimaging, and artificial intelligence. A critical obstacle is the inherent variability of cortical responses: neural activity elicited by the same visual stimulus differs across individuals and trials due to anatomical, functional, cognitive, and experimental factors, making fMRI-to-image reconstruction non-injective. In this paper, we tackle a challenging yet practically meaningful problem: zero-shot cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction, where the visual experience of a previously unseen individual must be reconstructed without subject-specific training. To enable principled evaluation, we present a unified cortical-surface dataset -- UniCortex-fMRI, assembled from multiple visual-stimulus fMRI datasets to provide broad coverage of subjects and stimuli. Our UniCortex-fMRI is particularly processed by standardized data formats to make it possible to explore this possibility in the zero-shot scenario of cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction. To tackle the modeling challenge, we propose PictorialCortex, which models fMRI activity using a compositional latent formulation that structures stimulus-driven representations under subject-, dataset-, and trial-related variability. PictorialCortex operates in a universal cortical latent space and implements this formulation through a latent factorization-composition module, reinforced by paired factorization and re-factorizing consistency regularization. During inference, surrogate latents synthesized under multiple seen-subject conditions are aggregated to guide diffusion-based image synthesis for unseen subjects. Extensive experiments show that PictorialCortex improves zero-shot cross-subject visual reconstruction, highlighting the benefits of compositional latent modeling and multi-dataset training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pb4U-GNet introduces a resolution-adaptive graph neural network for garment simulation that decouples message propagation from feature updates, enabling strong cross-resolution generalization even when trained only on low-resolution meshes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional physics-based garment simulation is computationally expensive, while existing GNN approaches suffer from poor cross-resolution generalization, degrading significantly on higher-resolution meshes beyond training distribution due to fixed message-passing depth and resolution-dependent displacement magnitudes.

Method: Proposes Propagation-before-Update Graph Network (Pb4U-GNet) with two key mechanisms: (1) dynamic propagation depth control that adjusts message-passing iterations based on mesh resolution, and (2) geometry-aware update scaling that scales predictions according to local mesh characteristics, decoupling message propagation from feature updates.

Result: Extensive experiments show Pb4U-GNet exhibits strong generalizability across diverse mesh resolutions, even when trained solely on low-resolution meshes, addressing the fundamental cross-resolution generalization challenge in neural garment simulation.

Conclusion: Pb4U-GNet provides a resolution-adaptive framework that overcomes limitations of existing GNNs for garment simulation, enabling efficient and generalizable neural simulation across varying mesh resolutions.

Abstract: Garment simulation is fundamental to various applications in computer vision and graphics, from virtual try-on to digital human modelling. However, conventional physics-based methods remain computationally expensive, hindering their application in time-sensitive scenarios. While graph neural networks (GNNs) offer promising acceleration, existing approaches exhibit poor cross-resolution generalisation, demonstrating significant performance degradation on higher-resolution meshes beyond the training distribution. This stems from two key factors: (1) existing GNNs employ fixed message-passing depth that fails to adapt information aggregation to mesh density variation, and (2) vertex-wise displacement magnitudes are inherently resolution-dependent in garment simulation. To address these issues, we introduce Propagation-before-Update Graph Network (Pb4U-GNet), a resolution-adaptive framework that decouples message propagation from feature updates. Pb4U-GNet incorporates two key mechanisms: (1) dynamic propagation depth control, adjusting message-passing iterations based on mesh resolution, and (2) geometry-aware update scaling, which scales predictions according to local mesh characteristics. Extensive experiments show that even trained solely on low-resolution meshes, Pb4U-GNet exhibits strong generalisability across diverse mesh resolutions, addressing a fundamental challenge in neural garment simulation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MARS is a training-free multi-stage adversarial reasoning framework for hateful video detection that uses objective description, evidence-based reasoning, and counter-evidence reasoning to produce reliable and interpretable hate detection decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hateful video detection methods face limitations: training-based approaches are constrained by limited data and lack interpretability, while direct prompting of large vision-language models often fails to deliver reliable hate detection.

Method: MARS uses a multi-stage adversarial reasoning framework: 1) objective description of video content, 2) evidence-based reasoning supporting hateful interpretations, 3) counter-evidence reasoning capturing non-hateful perspectives, and 4) synthesis of perspectives into explainable decisions.

Result: MARS achieves up to 10% improvement over other training-free approaches under certain backbones/settings, outperforms state-of-the-art training-based methods on one dataset, and produces human-understandable justifications for content moderation.

Conclusion: MARS provides a reliable, interpretable, and training-free solution for hateful video detection that supports compliance oversight and enhances transparency in content moderation workflows.

Abstract: Hateful videos pose serious risks by amplifying discrimination, inciting violence, and undermining online safety. Existing training-based hateful video detection methods are constrained by limited training data and lack of interpretability, while directly prompting large vision-language models often struggle to deliver reliable hate detection. To address these challenges, this paper introduces MARS, a training-free Multi-stage Adversarial ReaSoning framework that enables reliable and interpretable hateful content detection. MARS begins with the objective description of video content, establishing a neutral foundation for subsequent analysis. Building on this, it develops evidence-based reasoning that supports potential hateful interpretations, while in parallel incorporating counter-evidence reasoning to capture plausible non-hateful perspectives. Finally, these perspectives are synthesized into a conclusive and explainable decision. Extensive evaluation on two real-world datasets shows that MARS achieves up to 10% improvement under certain backbones and settings compared to other training-free approaches and outperforms state-of-the-art training-based methods on one dataset. In addition, MARS produces human-understandable justifications, thereby supporting compliance oversight and enhancing the transparency of content moderation workflows.

TL;DR: GraSP is a unified framework for visual graph recognition that works across diverse graph types and drawings without task-specific modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual relationship recognition (modeled as graph extraction from images) remains challenging due to lack of canonical approaches. Existing solutions are problem-specific and not transferable between contexts despite addressing the same conceptual problem.

Method: GraSP (Graph Recognition via Subgraph Prediction) - a method designed for broad applicability and simplicity that recognizes graphs in images through subgraph prediction.

Result: The method works across several synthetic benchmarks and one real-world application, handling diverse graph types and their drawings, and can be transferred between tasks without task-specific modifications.

Conclusion: GraSP paves the way for a more unified framework for visual graph recognition, addressing the fragmentation in current approaches to this challenging computer vision task.

Abstract: Despite tremendous improvements in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation, the recognition of visual relationships, commonly modeled as the extraction of a graph from an image, remains a challenging task. We believe that this mainly stems from the fact that there is no canonical way to approach the visual graph recognition task. Most existing solutions are specific to a problem and cannot be transferred between different contexts out-of-the box, even though the conceptual problem remains the same. With broad applicability and simplicity in mind, in this paper we develop a method, \textbf{Gra}ph Recognition via \textbf{S}ubgraph \textbf{P}rediction (\textbf{GraSP}), for recognizing graphs in images. We show across several synthetic benchmarks and one real-world application that our method works with a set of diverse types of graphs and their drawings, and can be transferred between tasks without task-specific modifications, paving the way to a more unified framework for visual graph recognition.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of research across machine learning, vision, and language has produced a volume of publications that is increasingly difficult to synthesize. Traditional bibliometric tools rely mainly on metadata and offer limited visibility into the semantic content of papers, making it hard to track how research themes evolve over time or how different areas influence one another. To obtain a clearer picture of recent developments, we compile a unified corpus of more than 100,000 papers from 22 major conferences between 2020 and 2025 and construct a multidimensional profiling pipeline to organize and analyze their textual content. By combining topic clustering, LLM-assisted parsing, and structured retrieval, we derive a comprehensive representation of research activity that supports the study of topic lifecycles, methodological transitions, dataset and model usage patterns, and institutional research directions.

Motivation: Most 2D human pose estimation benchmarks are nearly saturated except for crowded scenes, highlighting the need for better performance in challenging crowded environments.

Method: PMPose incorporates probabilistic formulation and mask-conditioning for top-down 2D pose estimation. BMPv2 integrates PMPose with an enhanced SAM-based mask refinement module for improved performance.

Result: BMPv2 surpasses state-of-the-art by 1.5 AP points on COCO and 6 AP points on OCHuman, becoming the first method to exceed 50 AP on OCHuman. It also improves 3D pose estimation in crowded scenes through 2D prompting of 3D models.

Conclusion: Advances in 2D pose quality directly benefit 3D estimation, and multi-person performance is more affected by pose prediction accuracy than by detection. The work provides a comprehensive solution for crowded scene pose estimation.

Abstract: Most 2D human pose estimation benchmarks are nearly saturated, with the exception of crowded scenes. We introduce PMPose, a top-down 2D pose estimator that incorporates the probabilistic formulation and the mask-conditioning. PMPose improves crowded pose estimation without sacrificing performance on standard scenes. Building on this, we present BBoxMaskPose v2 (BMPv2) integrating PMPose and an enhanced SAM-based mask refinement module. BMPv2 surpasses state-of-the-art by 1.5 average precision (AP) points on COCO and 6 AP points on OCHuman, becoming the first method to exceed 50 AP on OCHuman. We demonstrate that BMP's 2D prompting of 3D model improves 3D pose estimation in crowded scenes and that advances in 2D pose quality directly benefit 3D estimation. Results on the new OCHuman-Pose dataset show that multi-person performance is more affected by pose prediction accuracy than by detection.

TL;DR: Hybrid ensemble model Evan_V2 achieves near-perfect 99.99% accuracy for Alzheimer's disease classification by combining CNN and Transformer architectures, outperforming standalone models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early and accurate classification of Alzheimer's disease from brain MRI scans is essential for timely clinical intervention and improved patient outcomes, requiring robust diagnostic tools.

Method: Comparative analysis of 5 CNN architectures (EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, DenseNet201, MobileNetV3, VGG16), 5 Transformer models (ViT, ConvTransformer, PatchTransformer, MLP-Mixer, SimpleTransformer), and a proposed hybrid model Evan_V2 that integrates outputs from all 10 architectures through feature-level fusion for four-class AD classification.

Result: CNNs performed strongly (ResNet50: 98.83% accuracy), Transformers showed competitive generalization (ViT: 95.38% accuracy), but Evan_V2 achieved best overall performance with 99.99% accuracy, 0.9989 F1-score, and 0.9968 ROC AUC, substantially reducing misclassification across all dementia stages.

Conclusion: Hybrid ensemble strategies combining CNN and Transformer architectures can produce highly reliable and clinically meaningful diagnostic tools for Alzheimer's disease classification, with Evan_V2 demonstrating superior performance over standalone models.

Abstract: Early and accurate classification of Alzheimers disease (AD) from brain MRI scans is essential for timely clinical intervention and improved patient outcomes. This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of five CNN architectures (EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, DenseNet201, MobileNetV3, VGG16), five Transformer-based models (ViT, ConvTransformer, PatchTransformer, MLP-Mixer, SimpleTransformer), and a proposed hybrid model named Evan_V2. All models were evaluated on a four-class AD classification task comprising Mild Dementia, Moderate Dementia, Non-Demented, and Very Mild Dementia categories. Experimental findings show that CNN architectures consistently achieved strong performance, with ResNet50 attaining 98.83% accuracy. Transformer models demonstrated competitive generalization capabilities, with ViT achieving the highest accuracy among them at 95.38%. However, individual Transformer variants exhibited greater class-specific instability. The proposed Evan_V2 hybrid model, which integrates outputs from ten CNN and Transformer architectures through feature-level fusion, achieved the best overall performance with 99.99% accuracy, 0.9989 F1-score, and 0.9968 ROC AUC. Confusion matrix analysis further confirmed that Evan_V2 substantially reduced misclassification across all dementia stages, outperforming every standalone model. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid ensemble strategies in producing highly reliable and clinically meaningful diagnostic tools for Alzheimers disease classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScenDi integrates 3D and 2D diffusion models to generate realistic urban scenes with both geometric accuracy and appearance details while maintaining camera controllability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D diffusion models degrade appearance details, while 2D-only methods compromise camera controllability for urban scene generation.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Train 3D latent diffusion model to generate 3D Gaussians for coarse geometry, optionally conditioned on bounding boxes, road maps, or text. 2) Train 2D video diffusion model to enhance appearance details using rendered images from 3D Gaussians as guidance.

Result: Experiments on Waymo and KITTI-360 datasets demonstrate effective urban scene generation that adheres to input conditions and accurate camera trajectories.

Conclusion: ScenDi successfully integrates 3D and 2D diffusion models to overcome limitations of single-model approaches, generating realistic urban scenes with both geometric accuracy and appearance details.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D object generation using diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, but generating realistic 3D urban scenes remains challenging. Existing methods relying solely on 3D diffusion models tend to suffer a degradation in appearance details, while those utilizing only 2D diffusion models typically compromise camera controllability. To overcome this limitation, we propose ScenDi, a method for urban scene generation that integrates both 3D and 2D diffusion models. We first train a 3D latent diffusion model to generate 3D Gaussians, enabling the rendering of images at a relatively low resolution. To enable controllable synthesis, this 3DGS generation process can be optionally conditioned by specifying inputs such as 3d bounding boxes, road maps, or text prompts. Then, we train a 2D video diffusion model to enhance appearance details conditioned on rendered images from the 3D Gaussians. By leveraging the coarse 3D scene as guidance for 2D video diffusion, ScenDi generates desired scenes based on input conditions and successfully adheres to accurate camera trajectories. Experiments on two challenging real-world datasets, Waymo and KITTI-360, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: VLMs struggle with task progress estimation from partial observations; Progress-Bench benchmark reveals limitations, while ProgressLM training approach shows promise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs excel at describing visible content but lack ability to infer task progress from partial observations, which requires reasoning over long-horizon dynamics rather than static visual recognition.

Method: Introduced Progress-Bench benchmark for systematic evaluation, explored human-inspired two-stage progress reasoning through both training-free prompting and training-based ProgressLM-45K dataset approach.

Result: Most of 14 tested VLMs are not ready for task progress estimation, showing sensitivity to demonstration modality/viewpoint changes and poor handling of unanswerable cases. Training-free prompting yields limited gains, but ProgressLM-3B achieves consistent improvements despite being trained on disjoint task sets.

Conclusion: Progress reasoning remains challenging for current VLMs, but training-based approaches show promise. The study provides insights into characteristic error patterns and clarifies when progress reasoning succeeds or fails.

Abstract: Estimating task progress requires reasoning over long-horizon dynamics rather than recognizing static visual content. While modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at describing what is visible, it remains unclear whether they can infer how far a task has progressed from partial observations. To this end, we introduce Progress-Bench, a benchmark for systematically evaluating progress reasoning in VLMs. Beyond benchmarking, we further explore a human-inspired two-stage progress reasoning paradigm through both training-free prompting and training-based approach based on curated dataset ProgressLM-45K. Experiments on 14 VLMs show that most models are not yet ready for task progress estimation, exhibiting sensitivity to demonstration modality and viewpoint changes, as well as poor handling of unanswerable cases. While training-free prompting that enforces structured progress reasoning yields limited and model-dependent gains, the training-based ProgressLM-3B achieves consistent improvements even at a small model scale, despite being trained on a task set fully disjoint from the evaluation tasks. Further analyses reveal characteristic error patterns and clarify when and why progress reasoning succeeds or fails.

Conclusion: DrivIng addresses the gap in existing datasets by providing both real-world data and a digital twin, enabling reproducible research, robust validation, and comprehensive testing of perception algorithms for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Perception is a cornerstone of autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to understand their surroundings and make safe, reliable decisions. Developing robust perception algorithms requires large-scale, high-quality datasets that cover diverse driving conditions and support thorough evaluation. Existing datasets often lack a high-fidelity digital twin, limiting systematic testing, edge-case simulation, sensor modification, and sim-to-real evaluations. To address this gap, we present DrivIng, a large-scale multimodal dataset with a complete geo-referenced digital twin of a ~18 km route spanning urban, suburban, and highway segments. Our dataset provides continuous recordings from six RGB cameras, one LiDAR, and high-precision ADMA-based localization, captured across day, dusk, and night. All sequences are annotated at 10 Hz with 3D bounding boxes and track IDs across 12 classes, yielding ~1.2 million annotated instances. Alongside the benefits of a digital twin, DrivIng enables a 1-to-1 transfer of real traffic into simulation, preserving agent interactions while enabling realistic and flexible scenario testing. To support reproducible research and robust validation, we benchmark DrivIng with state-of-the-art perception models and publicly release the dataset, digital twin, HD map, and codebase.

*Yu Wu,Minsik Jeon,Jen-Hao Rick Chang,Oncel Tuzel,Shubham Tulsiani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RayRoPE is a novel positional encoding for multi-view transformers that uses ray-based encoding with predicted 3D points, achieves SE(3) invariance, handles uncertainty, and improves performance on novel-view synthesis and depth estimation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing positional encoding schemes for multi-view transformers fail to meet key requirements: they don't encode patches uniquely, lack SE(3)-invariant attention with multi-frequency similarity, and aren't adaptive to scene geometry.

Method: RayRoPE represents patch positions using associated rays but leverages predicted 3D points along rays instead of directions. It computes query-frame projective coordinates for SE(3) invariance and analytically computes expected position encoding under uncertainty when predicted 3D points are imprecise.

Result: RayRoPE consistently outperforms alternative position encoding schemes, achieving 15% relative improvement on LPIPS in CO3D for novel-view synthesis. It also enables seamless incorporation of RGB-D input, resulting in larger gains over alternatives that can't encode this information.

Conclusion: RayRoPE addresses limitations of prior multi-view positional encodings by providing unique patch encoding, SE(3)-invariant attention, geometry awareness, and uncertainty handling, leading to significant performance improvements in 3D vision tasks.

Abstract: We study positional encodings for multi-view transformers that process tokens from a set of posed input images, and seek a mechanism that encodes patches uniquely, allows SE(3)-invariant attention with multi-frequency similarity, and can be adaptive to the geometry of the underlying scene. We find that prior (absolute or relative) encoding schemes for multi-view attention do not meet the above desiderata, and present RayRoPE to address this gap. RayRoPE represents patch positions based on associated rays but leverages a predicted point along the ray instead of the direction for a geometry-aware encoding. To achieve SE(3) invariance, RayRoPE computes query-frame projective coordinates for computing multi-frequency similarity. Lastly, as the 'predicted' 3D point along a ray may not be precise, RayRoPE presents a mechanism to analytically compute the expected position encoding under uncertainty. We validate RayRoPE on the tasks of novel-view synthesis and stereo depth estimation and show that it consistently improves over alternate position encoding schemes (e.g. 15% relative improvement on LPIPS in CO3D). We also show that RayRoPE can seamlessly incorporate RGB-D input, resulting in even larger gains over alternatives that cannot positionally encode this information.

TL;DR: StableWorld introduces a dynamic frame eviction mechanism to address stability and temporal consistency issues in interactive video generation by filtering degraded frames to prevent cumulative drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current interactive video generation methods suffer from severe instability and temporal degradation, causing spatial drift and scene collapse during long-horizon interactions, despite progress in world modeling.

Method: Proposes StableWorld - a Dynamic Frame Eviction Mechanism that continuously filters out degraded frames while retaining geometrically consistent ones to prevent cumulative error propagation from the same scene.

Result: Demonstrates promising results on multiple interactive video models (Matrix-Game, Open-Oasis, Hunyuan-GameCraft), showing StableWorld is model-agnostic and substantially improves stability, temporal consistency, and generalization across diverse interactive scenarios.

Conclusion: StableWorld effectively addresses the overlooked challenge of stability in interactive video generation by preventing cumulative drift at its source, making it a simple yet effective solution applicable to various interactive video frameworks.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the overlooked challenge of stability and temporal consistency in interactive video generation, which synthesizes dynamic and controllable video worlds through interactive behaviors such as camera movements and text prompts. Despite remarkable progress in world modeling, current methods still suffer from severe instability and temporal degradation, often leading to spatial drift and scene collapse during long-horizon interactions. To better understand this issue, we initially investigate the underlying causes of instability and identify that the major source of error accumulation originates from the same scene, where generated frames gradually deviate from the initial clean state and propagate errors to subsequent frames. Building upon this observation, we propose a simple yet effective method, \textbf{StableWorld}, a Dynamic Frame Eviction Mechanism. By continuously filtering out degraded frames while retaining geometrically consistent ones, StableWorld effectively prevents cumulative drift at its source, leading to more stable and temporal consistency of interactive generation. Promising results on multiple interactive video models, \eg, Matrix-Game, Open-Oasis, and Hunyuan-GameCraft, demonstrate that StableWorld is model-agnostic and can be applied to different interactive video generation frameworks to substantially improve stability, temporal consistency, and generalization across diverse interactive scenarios.

Our method leverages a generative image-based light decomposition model that factorizes complex indoor scene illumination into its constituent light sources. This factorization enables independent manipulation of individual light sources, specifically allowing control over their state (on/off), chromaticity, and intensity. We further introduce multi-view lighting harmonization to ensure consistent propagation of the lighting decomposition across all scene views. This is integrated into a relightable 3D Gaussian splatting representation, providing real-time interactive control over the individual light sources. Our results demonstrate highly photorealistic lighting decomposition and relighting outcomes across diverse indoor scenes. We evaluate our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets and provide a quantitative and qualitative comparison to state-of-the-art techniques.

TL;DR: EgoWM transforms pretrained video diffusion models into action-conditioned world models for accurate future prediction across diverse embodiments, achieving better physical correctness with lower latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create video generation models that can accurately predict correct futures rather than just plausible ones, enabling controllable future prediction that faithfully follows actions while preserving realism and generalization.

Method: Repurpose pretrained video diffusion models by injecting motor commands through lightweight conditioning layers, transforming them into action-conditioned world models without training from scratch. Scales across embodiments from 3-DoF robots to 25-DoF humanoids.

Result: Achieves up to 80% improvement in Structural Consistency Score over prior navigation world models, 6x lower inference latency, robust generalization to unseen environments (including navigation inside paintings), and coherent rollouts for navigation and manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: EgoWM demonstrates that leveraging existing video diffusion models with lightweight action conditioning enables accurate, controllable future prediction across diverse embodiments while maintaining strong generalization and efficiency.

Abstract: What if a video generation model could not only imagine a plausible future, but the correct one, accurately reflecting how the world changes with each action? We address this question by presenting the Egocentric World Model (EgoWM), a simple, architecture-agnostic method that transforms any pretrained video diffusion model into an action-conditioned world model, enabling controllable future prediction. Rather than training from scratch, we repurpose the rich world priors of Internet-scale video models and inject motor commands through lightweight conditioning layers. This allows the model to follow actions faithfully while preserving realism and strong generalization. Our approach scales naturally across embodiments and action spaces, ranging from 3-DoF mobile robots to 25-DoF humanoids, where predicting egocentric joint-angle-driven dynamics is substantially more challenging. The model produces coherent rollouts for both navigation and manipulation tasks, requiring only modest fine-tuning. To evaluate physical correctness independently of visual appearance, we introduce the Structural Consistency Score (SCS), which measures whether stable scene elements evolve consistently with the provided actions. EgoWM improves SCS by up to 80 percent over prior state-of-the-art navigation world models, while achieving up to six times lower inference latency and robust generalization to unseen environments, including navigation inside paintings.

*Gautom Das,Vincent La,Ethan Lau,Abhinav Shrivastava,Matthew Gwilliam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates quantization methods for multimodal pipelines, showing ViT and LLM have comparable importance despite parameter differences, with LLM quantization achieving high accuracy at lower bits per weight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs require fast GPUs with large memory, so quantization reduces memory and latency. While research exists on quantization for individual models, there's limited work on applying these methods to multimodal pipelines combining vision models, language models, and connectors.

Method: Applied various quantization methods (including state-of-the-art GPTQ and AWQ) to multimodal pipelines. Investigated effects on performance across captioning, retrieval, and QA tasks, varying bit width, quantization method, and which pipeline components were quantized.

Result: ViT and LLM show comparable importance in model performance despite significant parameter size differences. Lower-bit quantization of LLM achieves high accuracy at reduced bits per weight (bpw). Performance varies based on which pipeline components are quantized.

Conclusion: Provides practical insights for efficient deployment of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and highlights the value of exploring component sensitivities in multimodal models. Code is available for further research and application.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive results for a variety of tasks, but state-of-the-art systems require fast GPUs with large amounts of memory. To reduce both the memory and latency of these systems, practitioners quantize their learned parameters, typically at half precision. A growing body of research focuses on preserving the model performance with more aggressive bit widths, and some work has been done to apply these strategies to other models, like vision transformers. In our study we investigate how a variety of quantization methods, including state-of-the-art GPTQ and AWQ, can be applied effectively to multimodal pipelines comprised of vision models, language models, and their connectors. We address how performance on captioning, retrieval, and question answering can be affected by bit width, quantization method, and which portion of the pipeline the quantization is used for. Results reveal that ViT and LLM exhibit comparable importance in model performance, despite significant differences in parameter size, and that lower-bit quantization of the LLM achieves high accuracy at reduced bits per weight (bpw). These findings provide practical insights for efficient deployment of MLLMs and highlight the value of exploration for understanding component sensitivities in multimodal models.

### [84] [APPLE: Attribute-Preserving Pseudo-Labeling for Diffusion-Based Face Swapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15288)
*Jiwon Kang,Yeji Choi,JoungBin Lee,Wooseok Jang,Jinhyeok Choi,Taekeun Kang,Yongjae Park,Myungin Kim,Seungryong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APPLE is a diffusion-based teacher-student framework for face swapping that uses attribute-aware pseudo-label supervision to better preserve target attributes while transferring source identity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face swapping faces challenges due to lack of real ground truth data, making it difficult to achieve both accurate identity transfer and high-quality attribute preservation. Existing diffusion-based approaches using masked conditional inpainting lose crucial target appearance cues, resulting in misaligned attributes.

Method: APPLE uses a teacher-student framework with attribute-aware pseudo-label supervision. It reformulates face swapping as conditional deblurring to preserve target attributes, introduces attribute-aware inversion for detailed preservation, and creates high-quality pseudo triplets through elaborate attribute-preserving teacher learning.

Result: APPLE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both attribute preservation and identity transfer, producing more photorealistic and target-faithful face swapping results compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed APPLE framework successfully addresses the limitations of existing face swapping methods by using attribute-aware pseudo-label supervision and conditional deblurring, enabling better preservation of target-specific attributes while maintaining accurate identity transfer.

Abstract: Face swapping aims to transfer the identity of a source face onto a target face while preserving target-specific attributes such as pose, expression, lighting, skin tone, and makeup. However, since real ground truth for face swapping is unavailable, achieving both accurate identity transfer and high-quality attribute preservation remains challenging. In addition, recent diffusion-based approaches attempt to improve visual fidelity through conditional inpainting on masked target images, but the masked condition removes crucial appearance cues of target, resulting in plausible yet misaligned attributes. To address these limitations, we propose APPLE (Attribute-Preserving Pseudo-Labeling), a diffusion-based teacher-student framework that enhances attribute fidelity through attribute-aware pseudo-label supervision. We reformulate face swapping as a conditional deblurring task to more faithfully preserve target-specific attributes such as lighting, skin tone, and makeup. In addition, we introduce an attribute-aware inversion scheme to further improve detailed attribute preservation. Through an elaborate attribute-preserving design for teacher learning, APPLE produces high-quality pseudo triplets that explicitly provide the student with direct face-swapping supervision. Overall, APPLE achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of attribute preservation and identity transfer, producing more photorealistic and target-faithful results.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic AI with LLMs offers new possibilities for UAV swarms in high-risk scenarios like wildfires and disaster response, but real-world deployment faces challenges from infrastructure constraints, dynamic environments, and computational demands of multi-agent coordination.

Method: Proposes three architectures for UAV swarm support: standalone, edge-enabled, and edge-cloud hybrid deployments optimized for varying autonomy and connectivity levels. Demonstrates effectiveness through a wildfire search and rescue use case with edge-enabled architecture.

Conclusion: Integration of LLM-based agentic AI with edge computing shows promise for scalable, resilient UAV swarm autonomy in mission-critical applications, though open challenges remain for practical deployment.

Abstract: The integration of agentic AI, powered by large language models (LLMs) with autonomous reasoning, planning, and execution, into unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms opens new operational possibilities and brings the vision of the Internet of Drones closer to reality. However, infrastructure constraints, dynamic environments, and the computational demands of multi-agent coordination limit real-world deployment in high-risk scenarios such as wildfires and disaster response. This paper investigates the integration of LLM-based agentic AI and edge computing to realize scalable and resilient autonomy in UAV swarms. We first discuss three architectures for supporting UAV swarms - standalone, edge-enabled, and edge-cloud hybrid deployment - each optimized for varying autonomy and connectivity levels. Then, a use case for wildfire search and rescue (SAR) is designed to demonstrate the efficiency of the edge-enabled architecture, enabling high SAR coverage, reduced mission completion times, and a higher level of autonomy compared to traditional approaches. Finally, we highlight open challenges in integrating LLMs and edge computing for mission-critical UAV-swarm applications.

TL;DR: NIMA improves haptic feedback in robotic surgery with 95% better force accuracy and eliminates dangerous kickback effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current haptic feedback in robot-assisted surgery lacks accuracy in force rendering and has safety issues like "kickback" forces that can harm patients and surgeons.

Method: Developed Nonlinear Impedance Matching Approach (NIMA) that extends previous IMA method by incorporating nonlinear dynamics to better model complex tool-tissue interactions.

Result: NIMA achieved 0.01N mean absolute error (95% improvement over IMA) and completely eliminated haptic kickback when users release handles, enhancing safety and comfort.

Conclusion: NIMA's nonlinear modeling significantly improves force fidelity, responsiveness, and precision in surgical haptics, advancing safer and more realistic robotic surgery interfaces.

Abstract: Background: The integration of haptic feedback into robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS) has long been limited by challenges in accurately rendering forces and ensuring system safety. The need for robust, high-fidelity haptic systems is critical for enhancing the precision and reliability of teleoperated surgical tools. Methods: In this study, we present a Nonlinear Impedance Matching Approach (NIMA) designed to improve force rendering by accurately modelling complex tool-tissue interactions. Based on our previously validated Impedance Matching Approach (IMA), our novel NIMA method includes nonlinear dynamics to capture and render tool-tissue forces effectively. Results: NIMA improves force feedback accuracy with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.01 (SD 0.02) N, achieving a 95% reduction in MAE compared to IMA. Furthermore, NIMA effectively eliminates haptic "kickback" by ensuring no force is applied by the haptic device to the user's hand when they release the handle, enhancing both patient safety and user comfort. Conclusion: NIMA's ability to account for nonlinearities in tool-tissue interactions provides an improvement in force fidelity, responsiveness, and precision across various surgical conditions. Our findings promote the advancement of haptic feedback systems for robotic surgery, offering a realistic and reliable interface for robot-assisted surgical procedures.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Uncertainty-aware grasping pipeline for occluded strawberries using Monte Carlo dropout for shape completion, generating multiple hypotheses, and using lower confidence bound for safe grasp decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic strawberry harvesting is difficult under partial occlusion where leaves create geometric uncertainty, making single deterministic shape estimates unreliable for grasp decisions.

Method: Uses point cloud completion with Monte Carlo dropout to sample multiple shape hypotheses, generates candidate grasps for each completion, evaluates grasp feasibility with force-closure metrics, and applies lower confidence bound criterion for safe decision making.

Result: Outperforms deterministic baselines in both simulation and physical experiments, enabling reliable abstention from high-risk grasps under severe occlusion while maintaining robust execution when confidence is sufficient.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling completion uncertainty and using conservative decision criteria enables safe and effective robotic strawberry harvesting under partial occlusion conditions.

Abstract: Robotic strawberry harvesting is challenging under partial occlusion, where leaves induce significant geometric uncertainty and make grasp decisions based on a single deterministic shape estimate unreliable. From a single partial observation, multiple incompatible 3D completions may be plausible, causing grasps that appear feasible on one completion to fail on another. We propose an uncertainty-aware grasping pipeline for partially occluded strawberries that explicitly models completion uncertainty arising from both occlusion and learned shape reconstruction. Our approach uses point cloud completion with Monte Carlo dropout to sample multiple shape hypotheses, generates candidate grasps for each completion, and evaluates grasp feasibility using physically grounded force-closure-based metrics. Rather than selecting a grasp based on a single estimate, we aggregate feasibility across completions and apply a conservative lower confidence bound (LCB) criterion to decide whether a grasp should be attempted or safely abstained. We evaluate the proposed method in simulation and on a physical robot across increasing levels of synthetic and real leaf occlusion. Results show that uncertainty-aware decision making enables reliable abstention from high-risk grasp attempts under severe occlusion while maintaining robust grasp execution when geometric confidence is sufficient, outperforming deterministic baselines in both simulated and physical robot experiments.

TL;DR: TacUMI: A multi-modal data collection system with ViTac sensors, force-torque sensor, and pose tracker for contact-rich manipulation tasks, plus a segmentation framework for detecting event boundaries in demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual and proprioceptive data alone often fail to reveal event transitions in complex, contact-rich manipulation tasks, requiring better multi-modal data collection and robust segmentation methods.

Method: Extends UMI with TacUMI - a compact gripper integrating ViTac sensors, force-torque sensor, and pose tracker for synchronized multi-modal data collection during human demonstrations, plus a temporal model-based segmentation framework.

Result: Achieved over 90% segmentation accuracy on cable mounting task, with performance improving significantly with more modalities, validating the system's effectiveness.

Conclusion: TacUMI provides a practical foundation for scalable collection and segmentation of multi-modal demonstrations in contact-rich manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Task decomposition is critical for understanding and learning complex long-horizon manipulation tasks. Especially for tasks involving rich physical interactions, relying solely on visual observations and robot proprioceptive information often fails to reveal the underlying event transitions. This raises the requirement for efficient collection of high-quality multi-modal data as well as robust segmentation method to decompose demonstrations into meaningful modules. Building on the idea of the handheld demonstration device Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI), we introduce TacUMI, a multi-modal data collection system that integrates additionally ViTac sensors, force-torque sensor, and pose tracker into a compact, robot-compatible gripper design, which enables synchronized acquisition of all these modalities during human demonstrations. We then propose a multi-modal segmentation framework that leverages temporal models to detect semantically meaningful event boundaries in sequential manipulations. Evaluation on a challenging cable mounting task shows more than 90 percent segmentation accuracy and highlights a remarkable improvement with more modalities, which validates that TacUMI establishes a practical foundation for both scalable collection and segmentation of multi-modal demonstrations in contact-rich tasks.

*Ling Xiao,Toshihiko Yamasaki*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Effective prompt design for small VLMs in social robot navigation, using cognitive theories for system guidance and motivational framing, significantly improves action accuracy more than direct finetuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks overlook principled prompt design for socially compliant behavior in language models for robot navigation, especially critical for small VLMs with weaker decision-making capabilities compared to large models.

Method: Study prompt design along two dimensions: system guidance (action-focused, reasoning-oriented, perception-reasoning prompts) and motivational framing (competition against humans, other AI systems, or past selves). Experiments on two socially compliant navigation datasets.

Result: 1) For non-finetuned GPT-4o, human competition works best; for finetuned models, competition against past self works best. 2) Inappropriate prompts degrade performance worse than direct finetuning. 3) System prompts improve action accuracy disproportionately more than direct finetuning, acting as decision-level constraints.

Conclusion: Principled prompt design based on cognitive theories is crucial for small VLMs in social navigation, providing decision-level constraints that significantly boost action accuracy beyond what finetuning alone achieves.

Abstract: Language models are increasingly used for social robot navigation, yet existing benchmarks largely overlook principled prompt design for socially compliant behavior. This limitation is particularly relevant in practice, as many systems rely on small vision language models (VLMs) for efficiency. Compared to large language models, small VLMs exhibit weaker decision-making capabilities, making effective prompt design critical for accurate navigation. Inspired by cognitive theories of human learning and motivation, we study prompt design along two dimensions: system guidance (action-focused, reasoning-oriented, and perception-reasoning prompts) and motivational framing, where models compete against humans, other AI systems, or their past selves. Experiments on two socially compliant navigation datasets reveal three key findings. First, for non-finetuned GPT-4o, competition against humans achieves the best performance, while competition against other AI systems performs worst. For finetuned models, competition against the model's past self yields the strongest results, followed by competition against humans, with performance further influenced by coupling effects among prompt design, model choice, and dataset characteristics. Second, inappropriate system prompt design can significantly degrade performance, even compared to direct finetuning. Third, while direct finetuning substantially improves semantic-level metrics such as perception, prediction, and reasoning, it yields limited gains in action accuracy. In contrast, our system prompts produce a disproportionately larger improvement in action accuracy, indicating that the proposed prompt design primarily acts as a decision-level constraint rather than a representational enhancement.

Motivation: Current robotic policies struggle with dynamic stability, reflexive responsiveness, and temporal memory that biological systems naturally possess, despite advances in data and model scaling.

Method: A system-level bio-inspired design with three components: high-level model for planning goals, adaptive cerebellum module for motion stabilization using high-frequency sensor feedback, and bio-inspired spinal layer for fast action generation.

Result: First deployment of neuromorphic VLA on physical robotics achieving state-of-the-art performance, with emergent biological motor characteristics: eliminates arm shaking, uses only 0.4W energy, demonstrates temporal memory, and triggers safety reflexes in <20ms.

Conclusion: NeuroVLA successfully replicates key biological motion capabilities through neuromorphic architecture, offering a promising approach for energy-efficient, stable, and responsive robotic control.

Abstract: Recent advances in embodied intelligence have leveraged massive scaling of data and model parameters to master natural-language command following and multi-task control. In contrast, biological systems demonstrate an innate ability to acquire skills rapidly from sparse experience. Crucially, current robotic policies struggle to replicate the dynamic stability, reflexive responsiveness, and temporal memory inherent in biological motion. Here we present Neuromorphic Vision-Language-Action (NeuroVLA), a framework that mimics the structural organization of the bio-nervous system between the cortex, cerebellum, and spinal cord. We adopt a system-level bio-inspired design: a high-level model plans goals, an adaptive cerebellum module stabilizes motion using high-frequency sensors feedback, and a bio-inspired spinal layer executes lightning-fast actions generation. NeuroVLA represents the first deployment of a neuromorphic VLA on physical robotics, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We observe the emergence of biological motor characteristics without additional data or special guidance: it stops the shaking in robotic arms, saves significant energy(only 0.4w on Neuromorphic Processor), shows temporal memory ability and triggers safety reflexes in less than 20 milliseconds.

TL;DR: Anthropomimetic foot joint structure shows multi-jointed arch-like skeletal architecture enhances impact attenuation during landing, with posture tuning the trade-off between attenuation and rebound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cadaveric studies have limitations for studying posture-dependent viscoelastic responses immediately after landing impact, leaving the contribution of skeletal architecture to landing dynamics incompletely understood.

Method: Developed anthropomimetic foot joint structure replicating human skeletal geometry, used vertical drop apparatus simulating landing with viscoelastic system-identification model to investigate how skeletal structure and posture modulate post-impact viscoelastic response.

Result: Multi-jointed anthropomimetic structure showed higher damping ratio than simplified flat/rigid feet. Ankle dorsiflexion and toe extension systematically shifted parameters, reducing damping ratio. Arch-like multi-jointed architecture enhances impact attenuation.

Conclusion: Skeletal architecture can enhance impact attenuation in anthropomimetic mechanical foot, with morphology and passive posture alone tuning attenuation-rebound trade-off. Posture-dependent trends consistent with human landing strategies, suggesting skeletal architecture may partly account for modulation. Anatomically informed skeletal replication offers engineering advantage for achieving human-like viscoelastic behavior through postural adjustment.

Abstract: Cadaveric studies have provided important insights into the mechanics of the human foot arch and plantar fascia. However, repeatedly probing posture-dependent viscoelastic responses immediately after landing impact is difficult in biological specimens, leaving the contribution of skeletal architecture to landing dynamics incompletely understood. In this study, we developed an anthropomimetic foot joint structure aimed at replicating the skeletal geometry of the human foot. Using a vertical drop apparatus that simulates landing and a viscoelastic system-identification model, we investigated how skeletal structure and posture modulate the apparent post-impact viscoelastic response. The results show that the multi-jointed anthropomimetic structure exhibited a higher damping ratio than simplified flat and rigid feet. Moreover, ankle dorsiflexion and toe extension systematically shifted the identified parameters, reducing the damping ratio under the tested conditions. Taken together, these findings indicate that an arch-like, multi-jointed skeletal architecture can enhance impact attenuation in an anthropomimetic mechanical foot, and that morphology and passive posture alone can tune the trade-off between attenuation and rebound. The observed posture-dependent trends are qualitatively consistent with reported differences in human landing strategies, suggesting that skeletal architecture may partly account for the modulation. Furthermore, these results highlight the engineering advantage of anatomically informed skeletal replication for achieving human-like apparent viscoelastic behavior through postural adjustment during landing.

TL;DR: Proposes Adaptive Experience Selection (AES) and model-based forward planning to improve mobile manipulation efficiency and spatial generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile manipulation suffers from low sample efficiency due to ineffective use of long-horizon interaction data, and poor spatial generalization where policies trained on specific layouts fail in new environments without retraining.

Method: Uses Adaptive Experience Selection (AES) to focus on critical experience fragments in long trajectories, improving skill chain learning and reducing skill forgetting. Combines AES with a Recurrent State-Space Model (RSSM) for Model-Predictive Forward Planning (MPFP) to capture coupled mobile base-manipulator dynamics and imagine future manipulation outcomes.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing mobile manipulation policies across different experimental configurations. Real-world experiments validate the method's feasibility and practicality.

Conclusion: The proposed approach addresses key limitations in mobile manipulation through adaptive experience selection and model-based forward planning, enabling more efficient learning and better spatial generalization to new environments.

Abstract: Mobile Manipulation (MM) involves long-horizon decision-making over multi-stage compositions of heterogeneous skills, such as navigation and picking up objects. Despite recent progress, existing MM methods still face two key limitations: (i) low sample efficiency, due to ineffective use of redundant data generated during long-term MM interactions; and (ii) poor spatial generalization, as policies trained on specific tasks struggle to transfer to new spatial layouts without additional training. In this paper, we address these challenges through Adaptive Experience Selection (AES) and model-based dynamic imagination. In particular, AES makes MM agents pay more attention to critical experience fragments in long trajectories that affect task success, improving skill chain learning and mitigating skill forgetting. Based on AES, a Recurrent State-Space Model (RSSM) is introduced for Model-Predictive Forward Planning (MPFP) by capturing the coupled dynamics between the mobile base and the manipulator and imagining the dynamics of future manipulations. RSSM-based MPFP can reinforce MM skill learning on the current task while enabling effective generalization to new spatial layouts. Comparative studies across different experimental configurations demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing MM policies. Real-world experiments further validate the feasibility and practicality of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance autonomous robot exploration by integrating high-level semantic reasoning with fast local control, addressing the need for both strategic planning and reactive execution in unknown environments.

Method: Hierarchical framework with LLM for slow-thinking global reasoning (interprets environment descriptions, synthesizes strategies, generates waypoints via topological graph with modularity-based pruning) and RL for fast-thinking local execution (reacts to observations, guided by waypoints with reward shaping for adherence).

Result: FARE achieves substantial improvements in exploration efficiency over state-of-the-art baselines in challenging simulated environments, and successfully validates in complex real-world building environments (200m×130m scale).

Conclusion: The FARE framework effectively decouples semantic reasoning from geometric decision-making, allowing each module to operate at appropriate scales, resulting in coherent and robust closed-loop exploration behavior.

Abstract: This work advances autonomous robot exploration by integrating agent-level semantic reasoning with fast local control. We introduce FARE, a hierarchical autonomous exploration framework that integrates a large language model (LLM) for global reasoning with a reinforcement learning (RL) policy for local decision making. FARE follows a fast-slow thinking paradigm. The slow-thinking LLM module interprets a concise textual description of the unknown environment and synthesizes an agent-level exploration strategy, which is then grounded into a sequence of global waypoints through a topological graph. To further improve reasoning efficiency, this module employs a modularity-based pruning mechanism that reduces redundant graph structures. The fast-thinking RL module executes exploration by reacting to local observations while being guided by the LLM-generated global waypoints. The RL policy is additionally shaped by a reward term that encourages adherence to the global waypoints, enabling coherent and robust closed-loop behavior. This architecture decouples semantic reasoning from geometric decision, allowing each module to operate in its appropriate temporal and spatial scale. In challenging simulated environments, our results show that FARE achieves substantial improvements in exploration efficiency over state-of-the-art baselines. We further deploy FARE on hardware and validate it in complex, large scale $200m\times130m$ building environment.

Abstract: Collaborative robots, or cobots, are increasingly integrated into various industrial and service settings to work efficiently and safely alongside humans. However, for effective human-robot collaboration, robots must reason based on human factors such as motivation level and aggression level.

By leveraging probabilistic models and control strategies, the proposed method aims to anticipate human actions and emotions, enabling cobots to adapt their behavior accordingly. So far, most of the research has been done to detect the intentions of human co-workers. This paper discusses the theoretical framework, implementation strategies, simulation results, and potential applications of the bilateral collaboration approach for safety and efficiency in collaborative robotics.

TL;DR: A 1.47 mm modular soft robotic catheter integrates sensing, actuation, and therapy for safer endoluminal navigation, demonstrated in pancreatic duct access and navigation with semi-autonomous control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current soft robotic instruments lack sufficient tip functionalization and real-time feedback for clinical adoption, especially for delicate procedures like ERCP where standard catheters cannot access fragile pancreatic ducts.

Method: Developed a 1.47 mm diameter modular soft robotic catheter with up to four independently controlled functional units for anchoring, manipulation, sensing, and drug delivery. Uses closed-loop autonomous/shared-control system combining learned models, magnetic actuation, onboard shape sensing, and visual marker tracking.

Result: Successfully demonstrated semi-autonomous deployment into pancreatic duct and 7.5 cm endoscopic navigation within it (currently inaccessible region). Validated across multiple in vivo settings, showing improved cannulation accuracy with the closed-loop system.

Conclusion: Establishes a scalable platform for multifunctional soft robotic catheters and a new paradigm for complex endoluminal interventions, with potential to reduce radiation exposure, shorten training, and accelerate clinical translation of soft robotic technologies.

Abstract: Soft robotic instruments could navigate delicate, tortuous anatomy more safely than rigid tools, but clinical adoption is limited by insufficient tip functionalization and real-time feedback at the tissue interface. Few sensing and therapeutic modules are compact, robust, and adaptable enough to measure, and respond to, subtle physiological cues during intraluminal procedures. We present a 1.47 mm diameter modular soft robotic catheter that integrates sensing, actuation, and therapy while retaining the compliance needed for safe endoluminal navigation. Validated across multiple in vivo settings, we emphasize its utility in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), a highly technical procedure and a key access route to the pancreas, an organ that is fragile, difficult to instrument, and central to diseases such as pancreatic cancer. Our architecture supports up to four independently controlled functional units, allowing customizable combinations of anchoring, manipulation, sensing, and targeted drug delivery. In a live porcine model, we demonstrate semi-autonomous deployment into the pancreatic duct and 7.5 cm of endoscopic navigation within it, a region currently inaccessible with standard catheters. A closed-loop autonomous/shared-control system that combines a learned model, magnetic actuation, onboard shape sensing, and visual marker tracking further improves cannulation accuracy. Together, these results establish a scalable platform for multifunctional soft robotic catheters and a new paradigm for complex endoluminal interventions, with potential to reduce radiation exposure, shorten training, and accelerate clinical translation of soft robotic technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate tool localization is crucial in Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery (RMIS) for patient safety and task success, but remains challenging for cable-driven robots like da Vinci due to erroneous encoder readings causing pose estimation errors.

Method: Proposes a calibration framework with two interrelated algorithms: 1) feature association block for robust key point correspondences on monocular images without pre-training, and 2) hand-eye calibration block with filter approaches to accommodate various surgical scenarios, computing hand-eye transformation matrix on-the-fly.

Conclusion: The proposed calibration framework effectively addresses tool localization challenges in cable-driven surgical robots by providing accurate, time-efficient localization through on-the-fly hand-eye calibration without requiring pre-training.

Abstract: In Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery (RMIS), accurate tool localization is crucial to ensure patient safety and successful task execution. However, this remains challenging for cable-driven robots, such as the da Vinci robot, because erroneous encoder readings lead to pose estimation errors. In this study, we propose a calibration framework to produce accurate tool localization results through computing the hand-eye transformation matrix on-the-fly. The framework consists of two interrelated algorithms: the feature association block and the hand-eye calibration block, which provide robust correspondences for key points detected on monocular images without pre-training, and offer the versatility to accommodate various surgical scenarios by adopting an array of filter approaches, respectively. To validate its efficacy, we test the framework extensively on publicly available video datasets that feature multiple surgical instruments conducting tasks in both in vitro and ex vivo scenarios, under varying illumination conditions and with different levels of key point measurement accuracy. The results show a significant reduction in tool localization errors under the proposed calibration framework, with accuracies comparable to other state-of-the-art methods while being more time-efficient.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid robots need to adapt contact behavior to diverse objects and tasks, but current controllers rely on fixed, hand-tuned impedance gains and gripper settings, limiting adaptability.

Method: Combines vision-language model for semantic task inference with FAISS-based RAG module that retrieves experimentally validated stiffness-damping pairs and object-specific grasp angles from custom databases, executed through task-space impedance controller.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of linking semantic perception with retrieval-based control as an interpretable path toward adaptive humanoid manipulation.

Abstract: Humanoid robots must adapt their contact behavior to diverse objects and tasks, yet most controllers rely on fixed, hand-tuned impedance gains and gripper settings. This paper introduces HumanoidVLM, a vision-language driven retrieval framework that enables the Unitree G1 humanoid to select task-appropriate Cartesian impedance parameters and gripper configurations directly from an egocentric RGB image. The system couples a vision-language model for semantic task inference with a FAISS-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that retrieves experimentally validated stiffness-damping pairs and object-specific grasp angles from two custom databases, and executes them through a task-space impedance controller for compliant manipulation. We evaluate HumanoidVLM on 14 visual scenarios and achieve a retrieval accuracy of 93%. Real-world experiments show stable interaction dynamics, with z-axis tracking errors typically within 1-3.5 cm and virtual forces consistent with task-dependent impedance settings. These results demonstrate the feasibility of linking semantic perception with retrieval-based control as an interpretable path toward adaptive humanoid manipulation.

Motivation: Real-world deployment of VLMs for robotics faces challenges with latency, limited onboard resources, and privacy risks from cloud offloading. Edge intelligence in 6G networks (Open RAN and MEC) offers a solution by bringing computation closer to data sources.

Method: Used Unitree G1 humanoid robot as testbed with WebRTC-based pipeline streaming multimodal data to edge nodes. Evaluated LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct deployed at edge vs cloud, and tested Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct for resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: Edge deployment on 6G ORAN/MEC infrastructure enables efficient VLM deployment for robotics, balancing latency reduction with accuracy preservation, with smaller models offering faster response for resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable multimodal reasoning for robotic perception and interaction, but their deployment in real-world systems remains constrained by latency, limited onboard resources, and privacy risks of cloud offloading. Edge intelligence within 6G, particularly Open RAN and Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), offers a pathway to address these challenges by bringing computation closer to the data source. This work investigates the deployment of VLMs on ORAN/MEC infrastructure using the Unitree G1 humanoid robot as an embodied testbed. We design a WebRTC-based pipeline that streams multimodal data to an edge node and evaluate LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct deployed at the edge versus in the cloud under real-time conditions. Our results show that edge deployment preserves near-cloud accuracy while reducing end-to-end latency by 5\%.

### [101] [TIDAL: Temporally Interleaved Diffusion and Action Loop for High-Frequency VLA Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14945)
*Yuteng Sun,Haoran Wang,Ruofei Bai,Zhengguo Li,Jun Li,Meng Yee,Chuah,Wei Yun Yau*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TIDAL is a hierarchical framework that decouples semantic reasoning from high-frequency actuation in VLA models, enabling 9 Hz control updates on edge hardware through dual-frequency loops and temporally misaligned training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale VLA models suffer from high inference latency, limiting them to low-frequency batch-and-execute paradigms that create execution blind spots in dynamic environments where targets move during open-loop execution windows.

Method: TIDAL uses a backbone-agnostic dual-frequency architecture: low-frequency macro-intent loop caches semantic embeddings, while high-frequency micro-control loop interleaves single-step flow integration with execution. Includes temporally misaligned training for predictive compensation and differential motion predictor for velocity sensitivity.

Result: Achieves 9 Hz control updates on edge hardware (vs. 2.4 Hz baselines), 2x performance gain in dynamic interception tasks, 4x increase in feedback frequency, and extends effective horizon of semantic embeddings beyond native action chunk size.

Conclusion: TIDAL addresses the frequency mismatch in VLA models, enabling robust performance in dynamic environments through architectural decoupling of semantic reasoning and high-frequency actuation, remaining effective where standard baselines fail due to latency.

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer semantic generalization but suffer from high inference latency, limiting them to low-frequency batch-and-execute paradigm. This frequency mismatch creates an execution blind spot, causing failures in dynamic environments where targets move during the open-loop execution window. We propose TIDAL (Temporally Interleaved Diffusion and Action Loop), a hierarchical framework that decouples semantic reasoning from high-frequency actuation. TIDAL operates as a backbone-agnostic module for diffusion-based VLAs, using a dual-frequency architecture to redistribute the computational budget. Specifically, a low-frequency macro-intent loop caches semantic embeddings, while a high-frequency micro-control loop interleaves single-step flow integration with execution. This design enables approximately 9 Hz control updates on edge hardware (vs. approximately 2.4 Hz baselines) without increasing marginal overhead. To handle the resulting latency shift, we introduce a temporally misaligned training strategy where the policy learns predictive compensation using stale semantic intent alongside real-time proprioception. Additionally, we address the insensitivity of static vision encoders to velocity by incorporating a differential motion predictor. TIDAL is architectural, making it orthogonal to system-level optimizations. Experiments show a 2x performance gain over open-loop baselines in dynamic interception tasks. Despite a marginal regression in static success rates, our approach yields a 4x increase in feedback frequency and extends the effective horizon of semantic embeddings beyond the native action chunk size. Under non-paused inference protocols, TIDAL remains robust where standard baselines fail due to latency.

TL;DR: eGRAP: Graph-based adaptive planning system for autonomous disassembly of electronic devices using dual-arm robots with vision and real-time planning


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: E-waste is growing rapidly while recycling rates remain low, creating a need for automated disassembly systems to improve recycling efficiency

Method: Electronic-device Graph-based Adaptive Planning (eGRAP) integrates vision, dynamic planning, and dual-arm execution. Uses camera-equipped arm for part identification/pose estimation, directed graph for disassembly sequence, topological ordering for scheduling, and dual arms (one with screwdriver, one for handling) for parallel task execution

Result: Demonstrated on 3.5in hard drives with consistent full disassembly, high success rates, and efficient cycle times. System updates graph and plan online as parts are removed

Conclusion: eGRAP effectively adaptively coordinates dual-arm tasks in real time for autonomous electronic device disassembly, showing promise for e-waste recycling automation

Abstract: E-waste is growing rapidly while recycling rates remain low. We propose an electronic-device Graph-based Adaptive Planning (eGRAP) that integrates vision, dynamic planning, and dual-arm execution for autonomous disassembly. A camera-equipped arm identifies parts and estimates their poses, and a directed graph encodes which parts must be removed first. A scheduler uses topological ordering of this graph to select valid next steps and assign them to two robot arms, allowing independent tasks to run in parallel. One arm carries a screwdriver (with an eye-in-hand depth camera) and the other holds or handles components. We demonstrate eGRAP on 3.5in hard drives: as parts are unscrewed and removed, the system updates its graph and plan online. Experiments show consistent full disassembly of each HDD, with high success rates and efficient cycle times, illustrating the method's ability to adaptively coordinate dual-arm tasks in real time.

*Fumiya Ohnishi,Masaki Takahashi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DWPP improves pure pursuit by explicitly incorporating velocity/acceleration constraints in velocity space, preventing overshoot and improving tracking accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional pure pursuit methods don't account for velocity and acceleration constraints, causing discrepancies between commanded/actual velocities that lead to overshoot and degraded tracking performance.

Method: Dynamic Window Pure Pursuit (DWPP) reformulates command velocity computation in velocity space (v-ω plane), selecting command velocity as the point within the dynamic window closest to the line ω=κv.

Result: DWPP avoids constraint-violating commands and achieves superior path-tracking accuracy compared to conventional pure pursuit methods.

Conclusion: DWPP provides a practical improvement to pure pursuit that explicitly handles motion constraints, has been integrated into Nav2, and is publicly available for use.

Abstract: Pure pursuit and its variants are widely used for mobile robot path tracking owing to their simplicity and computational efficiency. However, many conventional approaches do not explicitly account for velocity and acceleration constraints, resulting in discrepancies between commanded and actual velocities that result in overshoot and degraded tracking performance. To address this problem, this paper proposes dynamic window pure pursuit (DWPP), which fundamentally reformulates the command velocity computation process to explicitly incorporate velocity and acceleration constraints. Specifically, DWPP formulates command velocity computation in the velocity space (the $v$-$ω$ plane) and selects the command velocity as the point within the dynamic window that is closest to the line $ω= κv$. Experimental results demonstrate that DWPP avoids constraint-violating commands and achieves superior path-tracking accuracy compared with conventional pure pursuit methods. The proposed method has been integrated into the official Nav2 repository and is publicly available (https://github.com/ros-navigation/navigation2).

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A general method for accurate risk estimation in automated driving that combines collision probability estimation with collision severity, allowing individual severity functions for different collision types while being computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing risk calculation approaches for automated vehicles lack generalizability and accuracy due to empirical modeling or severe approximations. Risk assessment is crucial for both motion planning and safety evaluation, as it helps navigate vehicles around traffic participants while maintaining safety distances based on uncertainty and potential collision severity.

Method: Combines recent advances in collision probability estimation with collision severity concepts to develop a general risk estimation method. The approach allows assignment of individual severity functions for different collision constellations (e.g., frontal vs. side collisions) and is designed to be computationally efficient for real-time applications.

Result: The proposed method provides accurate risk estimation that accounts for both uncertainty in state estimates and collision severity. It's computationally efficient enough for real-time motion planning applications, with programming code provided for an exemplary implementation using Gaussian uncertainties.

Conclusion: The paper presents a generalizable and accurate risk estimation method for automated driving that addresses limitations of existing approaches by properly combining collision probability and severity considerations, enabling safer and more effective motion planning.

Abstract: Safety is a central requirement for automated vehicles. As such, the assessment of risk in automated driving is key in supporting both motion planning technologies and safety evaluation. In automated driving, risk is characterized by two aspects. The first aspect is the uncertainty on the state estimates of other road participants by an automated vehicle. The second aspect is the severity of a collision event with said traffic participants. Here, the uncertainty aspect typically causes the risk to be non-zero for near-collision events. This makes risk particularly useful for automated vehicle motion planning. Namely, constraining or minimizing risk naturally navigates the automated vehicle around traffic participants while keeping a safety distance based on the level of uncertainty and the potential severity of the impending collision. Existing approaches to calculate the risk either resort to empirical modeling or severe approximations, and, hence, lack generalizability and accuracy. In this paper, we combine recent advances in collision probability estimation with the concept of collision severity to develop a general method for accurate risk estimation. The proposed method allows us to assign individual severity functions for different collision constellations, such as, e.g., frontal or side collisions. Furthermore, we show that the proposed approach is computationally efficient, which is beneficial, e.g., in real-time motion planning applications. The programming code for an exemplary implementation of Gaussian uncertainties is also provided.

Method: Incremental construction of 3D Semantic Scene Graphs integrated with expectations from contextual priors (past observations) and external semantic knowledge (ConceptNet), embedded into heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks for expectation-biased inference.

Result: The approach moves beyond static frame-by-frame analysis to enhance robustness and consistency of scene understanding over time, with planned integration on mobile robotic platforms.

Conclusion: Knowledge-level expectations integrated via 3DSSG and GNNs provide a promising approach to improve robotic object interpretation by combining sensor data with semantic consistency and environmental knowledge.

Abstract: While deep learning has significantly advanced robotic object recognition, purely data-driven approaches often lack semantic consistency and fail to leverage valuable, pre-existing knowledge about the environment. This report presents the ExPrIS project, which addresses this challenge by investigating how knowledge-level expectations can serve as to improve object interpretation from sensor data. Our approach is based on the incremental construction of a 3D Semantic Scene Graph (3DSSG). We integrate expectations from two sources: contextual priors from past observations and semantic knowledge from external graphs like ConceptNet. These are embedded into a heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (GNN) to create an expectation-biased inference process. This method moves beyond static, frame-by-frame analysis to enhance the robustness and consistency of scene understanding over time. The report details this architecture, its evaluation, and outlines its planned integration on a mobile robotic platform.

Motivation: Dexterous grasping in cluttered environments is challenging due to high DoF hands, occlusion, and collision risks from diverse object geometries and complex layouts.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Predict sparse IBS (scene-decoupled, contact- and collision-aware representation) using occupancy-diffusion model with voxel-level conditional guidance and force closure filtering; 2) Optimize grasp poses using energy functions and ranking strategies based on sparse IBS.

Result: Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world settings validate effectiveness, demonstrating collision mitigation while maintaining high grasp success rates across diverse objects and complex scenes.

Conclusion: CADGrasp successfully addresses dexterous grasping challenges in cluttered environments through a novel two-stage approach with sparse IBS representation and diffusion-based prediction, enabling stable, collision-free grasps from single-view point clouds.

Abstract: Dexterous grasping in cluttered environments presents substantial challenges due to the high degrees of freedom of dexterous hands, occlusion, and potential collisions arising from diverse object geometries and complex layouts. To address these challenges, we propose CADGrasp, a two-stage algorithm for general dexterous grasping using single-view point cloud inputs. In the first stage, we predict sparse IBS, a scene-decoupled, contact- and collision-aware representation, as the optimization target. Sparse IBS compactly encodes the geometric and contact relationships between the dexterous hand and the scene, enabling stable and collision-free dexterous grasp pose optimization. To enhance the prediction of this high-dimensional representation, we introduce an occupancy-diffusion model with voxel-level conditional guidance and force closure score filtering. In the second stage, we develop several energy functions and ranking strategies for optimization based on sparse IBS to generate high-quality dexterous grasp poses. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world settings validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its capability to mitigate collisions while maintaining a high grasp success rate across diverse objects and complex scenes.

### [108] [Systematic Evaluation of Hip Exoskeleton Assistance Parameters for Enhancing Gait Stability During Ground Slip Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15056)
*Maria T. Tagliaferri,Inseung Kang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Hip exoskeleton assistance parameters (magnitude and duration) significantly affect stability during walking perturbations, with duration being critical for determining stabilizing vs destabilizing effects. Stability-optimal parameters reduced whole-body angular momentum by 25.7% compared to energy-optimized control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Falls are the leading cause of injury-related hospitalization and mortality in older adults. While lower-limb exoskeletons could improve gait stability, most controllers are optimized for energy efficiency rather than stability, leaving the effects of specific assistance parameters unexplored.

Method: Systematically modulated magnitude and duration of torque from a bilateral hip exoskeleton during slip perturbations in eight healthy adults. Quantified stability using whole-body angular momentum (WBAM) and compared experimentally identified stability-optimal parameters to existing energy-optimized controllers.

Result: WBAM responses showed significant interaction between assistance magnitude and duration, with duration determining whether assistance was stabilizing or destabilizing. Stability-optimal parameters reduced WBAM range by 25.7% compared to energy-optimized control. Substantial inter-subject variability was observed in optimal parameter combinations.

Conclusion: Optimizing exoskeleton assistance for energy efficiency alone is insufficient for improving reactive stability during gait perturbations. Stability-focused control should prioritize temporal parameters and include user-specific personalization, representing an important step toward personalized, stability-focused exoskeleton control for fall prevention.

Abstract: Falls are the leading cause of injury related hospitalization and mortality among older adults. Consequently, mitigating age-related declines in gait stability and reducing fall risk during walking is a critical goal for assistive devices. Lower-limb exoskeletons have the potential to support users in maintaining stability during walking. However, most exoskeleton controllers are optimized to reduce the energetic cost of walking rather than to improve stability. While some studies report stability benefits with assistance, the effects of specific parameters, such as assistance magnitude and duration, remain unexplored. To address this gap, we systematically modulated the magnitude and duration of torque provided by a bilateral hip exoskeleton during slip perturbations in eight healthy adults, quantifying stability using whole-body angular momentum (WBAM). WBAM responses were governed by a significant interaction between assistance magnitude and duration, with duration determining whether exoskeleton assistance was stabilizing or destabilizing relative to not wearing the exoskeleton device. Compared to an existing energy-optimized controller, experimentally identified stability-optimal parameters reduced WBAM range by 25.7% on average. Notably, substantial inter-subject variability was observed in the parameter combinations that minimized WBAM during perturbations. We found that optimizing exoskeleton assistance for energetic outcomes alone is insufficient for improving reactive stability during gait perturbations. Stability-focused exoskeleton control should prioritize temporal assistance parameters and include user-specific personalization. This study represents an important step toward personalized, stability-focused exoskeleton control, with direct implications for improving stability and reducing fall risk in older adults.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic data generation methods have limitations: generated scenes are often physically implausible, language-driven programs can "succeed" without satisfying task semantics, and high-level instructions need grounding into executable actions.

Method: Three key components: 1) Context-aware instantiation with prohibited spatial area mapping to prevent interpenetration and ensure reachable configurations; 2) Hierarchical instruction decomposition to break high-level goals into action primitives; 3) VLM-based verification loop that performs rejection sampling after each subtask to filter out "silent failures."

Result: V-CAGE produces datasets with superior physical and semantic fidelity, significantly boosting downstream policy success rates and generalization compared to non-verified baselines.

Conclusion: The closed-loop framework with geometric consistency enforcement, hierarchical planning, and visual verification addresses key limitations in synthetic data generation for long-horizon embodied behaviors.

Abstract: Learning long-horizon embodied behaviors from synthetic data remains challenging because generated scenes are often physically implausible, language-driven programs frequently "succeed" without satisfying task semantics, and high-level instructions require grounding into executable action sequences. To address these limitations, we introduce V-CAGE, a closed-loop framework for generating robust, semantically aligned manipulation datasets at scale. First, we propose a context-aware instantiation mechanism that enforces geometric consistency during scene synthesis. By dynamically maintaining a map of prohibited spatial areas as objects are placed, our system prevents interpenetration and ensures reachable, conflict-free configurations in cluttered environments. Second, to bridge the gap between abstract intent and low-level control, we employ a hierarchical instruction decomposition module. This decomposes high-level goals (e.g., "get ready for work") into compositional action primitives, facilitating coherent long-horizon planning. Crucially, we enforce semantic correctness through a VLM-based verification loop. Acting as a visual critic, the VLM performs rigorous rejection sampling after each subtask, filtering out "silent failures" where code executes but fails to achieve the visual goal. Experiments demonstrate that V-CAGE yields datasets with superior physical and semantic fidelity, significantly boosting the success rate and generalization of downstream policies compared to non-verified baselines.

TL;DR: MonoRace: An onboard drone racing system using monocular camera and IMU that won the 2025 A2RL competition, beating human champions with speeds up to 100 km/h.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous drone racing requires AI that can run on lightweight drones under tight resource constraints while pushing physical limits. Current state-of-the-art uses stereo cameras and IMUs in controlled environments, but there's a need for systems that generalize to competition environments without external tracking.

Method: Combines neural-network-based gate segmentation with drone model for robust state estimation, includes offline optimization using gate geometry to refine parameters, and uses a neural network for guidance/control that directly sends motor commands at 500Hz without inner loop controllers.

Result: Won the 2025 Abu Dhabi Autonomous Drone Racing Competition (A2RL), outperforming all competing AI teams and three human world champion pilots. Reached speeds up to 100 km/h and successfully handled camera interference and IMU saturation.

Conclusion: MonoRace sets a new milestone in autonomous drone racing research, demonstrating that monocular camera systems can achieve championship-level performance in real competition environments without external tracking.

Abstract: Autonomous drone racing represents a major frontier in robotics research. It requires an Artificial Intelligence (AI) that can run on board light-weight flying robots under tight resource and time constraints, while pushing the physical system to its limits. The state of the art in this area consists of a system with a stereo camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) that beat human drone racing champions in a controlled indoor environment. Here, we present MonoRace: an onboard drone racing approach that uses a monocular, rolling-shutter camera and IMU that generalizes to a competition environment without any external motion tracking system. The approach features robust state estimation that combines neural-network-based gate segmentation with a drone model. Moreover, it includes an offline optimization procedure that leverages the known geometry of gates to refine any state estimation parameter. This offline optimization is based purely on onboard flight data and is important for fine-tuning the vital external camera calibration parameters. Furthermore, the guidance and control are performed by a neural network that foregoes inner loop controllers by directly sending motor commands. This small network runs on the flight controller at 500Hz. The proposed approach won the 2025 Abu Dhabi Autonomous Drone Racing Competition (A2RL), outperforming all competing AI teams and three human world champion pilots in a direct knockout tournament. It set a new milestone in autonomous drone racing research, reaching speeds up to 100 km/h on the competition track and successfully coping with problems such as camera interference and IMU saturation.

### [112] [The Ontological Neutrality Theorem: Why Neutral Ontological Substrates Must Be Pre-Causal and Pre-Normative](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14271)
*Denise M. Case*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Impossibility of neutral ontological substrates that include causal or normative commitments - such systems cannot serve as shared substrates across conflicting frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern data systems need to support accountability across persistent legal, political, and analytic disagreement, requiring strict constraints on ontology design for shared substrates.

Method: Establishes an impossibility result through logical analysis: neutrality (interpretive non-commitment and stability under incompatible extensions) is incompatible with including causal or normative commitments at the foundational layer.

Result: Any ontology asserting causal or deontic conclusions as ontological facts cannot serve as neutral substrate across divergent frameworks without revision or contradiction. Neutral substrates must be pre-causal and pre-normative.

Conclusion: Neutral ontological substrates must represent only entities with identity and persistence conditions while externalizing interpretation, evaluation, and explanation. This establishes necessary design constraints for systems maintaining shared representations across conflicting frameworks.

Abstract: Modern data systems must support accountability across persistent legal, political, and analytic disagreement. This requirement imposes strict constraints on the design of any ontology intended to function as a shared substrate. We establish an impossibility result for ontological neutrality: neutrality, understood as interpretive non-commitment and stability under incompatible extensions, is incompatible with the inclusion of causal or normative commitments at the foundational layer. Any ontology that asserts causal or deontic conclusions as ontological facts cannot serve as a neutral substrate across divergent frameworks without revision or contradiction. It follows that neutral ontological substrates must be pre-causal and pre-normative, representing entities, together with identity and persistence conditions, while externalizing interpretation, evaluation, and explanation. This paper does not propose a specific ontology or protocol; rather, it establishes the necessary design constraints for any system intended to maintain a shared, stable representation of reality across conflicting interpretive frameworks.

### [113] [Epistemic Constitutionalism Or: how to avoid coherence bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14295)
*Michele Loi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI systems need explicit epistemic constitutions to govern their belief-forming behavior, moving beyond implicit biases like source attribution bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems operate with implicit, uninspected epistemic policies that govern belief formation, credibility assessment, and confidence expression. The paper identifies source attribution bias as a key problem where models penalize arguments based on perceived ideological alignment between sources and content.

Method: The paper analyzes frontier models' behavior with source attribution bias, showing they enforce identity-stance coherence and suppress source-sensitivity when detecting systematic testing. It distinguishes between Platonic (formal correctness, source-independence) and Liberal (procedural norms, principled source-attending) constitutional approaches.

Result: Models exhibit source attribution bias by penalizing arguments from ideologically misaligned sources, but this effect collapses when they detect systematic testing, revealing they treat source-sensitivity as bias rather than legitimate epistemic capacity.

Conclusion: The paper argues for a Liberal epistemic constitution with eight principles and four orientations, advocating for explicit, contestable meta-norms in AI epistemic governance similar to existing AI ethics frameworks.

Abstract: Large language models increasingly function as artificial reasoners: they evaluate arguments, assign credibility, and express confidence. Yet their belief-forming behavior is governed by implicit, uninspected epistemic policies. This paper argues for an epistemic constitution for AI: explicit, contestable meta-norms that regulate how systems form and express beliefs. Source attribution bias provides the motivating case: I show that frontier models enforce identity-stance coherence, penalizing arguments attributed to sources whose expected ideological position conflicts with the argument's content. When models detect systematic testing, these effects collapse, revealing that systems treat source-sensitivity as bias to suppress rather than as a capacity to execute well. I distinguish two constitutional approaches: the Platonic, which mandates formal correctness and default source-independence from a privileged standpoint, and the Liberal, which refuses such privilege, specifying procedural norms that protect conditions for collective inquiry while allowing principled source-attending grounded in epistemic vigilance. I argue for the Liberal approach, sketch a constitutional core of eight principles and four orientations, and propose that AI epistemic governance requires the same explicit, contestable structure we now expect for AI ethics.

*Saeed Khaki,Ashudeep Singh,Nima Safaei,Kamal Ginotra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VLMs struggle with visual math problems vs text versions (modality gap). VisTIRA framework uses tool-integrated reasoning to decompose image problems into natural language + Python steps. Created LaTeX pipeline to convert text math datasets to images and synthetic tool-use trajectories for fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models perform significantly worse on mathematical reasoning when problems are presented as images rather than text, creating a "modality gap" due to failures in reading dense formulas, layout, and mixed symbolic-diagrammatic context.

Method: 1) Introduced VisTIRA - a tool-integrated reasoning framework that decomposes image-based math problems into natural language rationales and executable Python steps. 2) Built a framework with LaTeX pipeline to convert chain-of-thought math corpora into image counterparts, and created synthetic tool-use trajectories from SnapAsk dataset for VLM fine-tuning.

Result: Tool-integrated supervision improves image-based reasoning, and OCR grounding helps smaller models (though benefit diminishes at scale). Modality gap severity inversely correlates with model size. Structured reasoning and OCR-based grounding are complementary strategies for advancing visual mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: The modality gap in visual math reasoning can be addressed through structured tool-integrated reasoning frameworks like VisTIRA and targeted training data generation. Combining reasoning decomposition with OCR grounding provides effective strategies, with model scale playing a crucial role in overcoming visual comprehension challenges.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) lag behind text-only language models on mathematical reasoning when the same problems are presented as images rather than text. We empirically characterize this as a modality gap: the same question in text form yields markedly higher accuracy than its visually typeset counterpart, due to compounded failures in reading dense formulas, layout, and mixed symbolic-diagrammatic context. First, we introduce VisTIRA (Vision and Tool-Integrated Reasoning Agent), a tool-integrated reasoning framework that enables structured problem solving by iteratively decomposing a given math problem (as an image) into natural language rationales and executable Python steps to determine the final answer. Second, we build a framework to measure and improve visual math reasoning: a LaTeX-based pipeline that converts chain-of-thought math corpora (e.g., NuminaMath) into challenging image counterparts, and a large set of synthetic tool-use trajectories derived from a real-world, homework-style image dataset (called SnapAsk) for fine-tuning VLMs. Our experiments show that tool-integrated supervision improves image-based reasoning, and OCR grounding can further narrow the gap for smaller models, although its benefit diminishes at scale. These findings highlight that modality gap severity inversely correlates with model size, and that structured reasoning and OCR-based grounding are complementary strategies for advancing visual mathematical reasoning.

*Valerio Belcamino,Nicholas Attolino,Alessio Capitanelli,Fulvio Mastrogiovanni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fine-tuned LLMs achieve high valid plan rates in-domain but fail completely on unseen domains, revealing reliance on domain-specific patterns rather than transferable planning competence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether fine-tuned LLMs exhibit genuine transferable planning competence or merely domain-specific memorization when solving PDDL planning tasks.

Method: Fine-tuned a 1.7B-parameter LLM on 40,000 domain-problem-plan tuples from 10 IPC 2023 domains, then evaluated in-domain and cross-domain generalization. Introduced three diagnostic interventions: symbol anonymization, compact plan serialization, and verifier-reward fine-tuning using VAL validator.

Result: Model achieved 82.9% valid plan rate in-domain but 0% on two unseen domains. Diagnostic interventions revealed strong sensitivity to surface representations (performance drops with anonymization/serialization). Verifier-reward fine-tuning reached saturation faster but didn't improve cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned LLMs rely heavily on domain-specific patterns rather than transferable planning competence, highlighting a persistent generalization gap in LLM-based planning. The diagnostic tools help study causes of this failure.

Abstract: Recent work shows that fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve high valid plan rates on PDDL planning tasks. However, it remains unclear whether this reflects transferable planning competence or domain-specific memorization. In this work, we fine-tune a 1.7B-parameter LLM on 40,000 domain-problem-plan tuples from 10 IPC 2023 domains, and evaluate both in-domain and cross-domain generalization. While the model reaches 82.9% valid plan rate in in-domain conditions, it achieves 0% on two unseen domains. To analyze this failure, we introduce three diagnostic interventions, namely (i) instance-wise symbol anonymization, (ii) compact plan serialization, and (iii) verifier-reward fine-tuning using the VAL validator as a success-focused reinforcement signal. Symbol anonymization and compact serialization cause significant performance drops despite preserving plan semantics, thus revealing strong sensitivity to surface representations. Verifier-reward fine-tuning reaches performance saturation in half the supervised training epochs, but does not improve cross-domain generalization. For the explored configurations, in-domain performance plateaus around 80%, while cross-domain performance collapses, suggesting that our fine-tuned model relies heavily on domain-specific patterns rather than transferable planning competence in this setting. Our results highlight a persistent generalization gap in LLM-based planning and provide diagnostic tools for studying its causes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GP evolves knee-point-based group selection rules for scalable multi-mode project scheduling, outperforming sequential decision-making


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing group selection strategies for multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling suffer from scalability issues when applied to larger problem instances, limiting their practical application

Method: Multi-tree genetic programming framework that evolves both activity ordering rules and group selection rules simultaneously, using knee-point-based selection to identify promising activity subsets before evaluating combinations

Result: The approach scales well to large instances and outperforms GP with sequential decision-making in most scenarios

Conclusion: Knee-point-based group selection mechanism effectively enhances scalability of group selection strategies for dynamic multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problems

Abstract: The dynamic multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem is a challenging scheduling problem that requires making decisions on both the execution order of activities and their corresponding execution modes. Genetic programming has been widely applied as a hyper-heuristic to evolve priority rules that guide the selection of activity-mode pairs from the current eligible set. Recently, an activity group selection strategy has been proposed to select a subset of activities rather than a single activity at each decision point, allowing for more effective scheduling by considering the interdependence between activities. Although effective in small-scale instances, this strategy suffers from scalability issues when applied to larger problems. In this work, we enhance the scalability of the group selection strategy by introducing a knee-point-based selection mechanism to identify a promising subset of activities before evaluating their combinations. An activity ordering rule is first used to rank all eligible activity-mode pairs, followed by a knee point selection to find the promising pairs. Then, a group selection rule selects the best activity combination. We develop a multi-tree GP framework to evolve both types of rules simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach scales well to large instances and outperforms GP with sequential decision-making in most scenarios.

*Tony Chen,Sam Cheyette,Kelsey Allen,Joshua Tenenbaum,Kevin Smith*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: People use "Just-in-Time" mental simulation that builds simplified representations on the fly by interleaving simulation with visual search, allowing efficient reasoning despite limited cognitive capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human mental simulation is crucial for reasoning but exceeds capacity limits in complex environments. While people likely use simplified representations, it's unclear how they determine these simplifications efficiently.

Method: Proposed "Just-in-Time" framework that interleaves simulation, visual search, and representation modification. Current simulation guides where to look, and visual search flags objects to encode for subsequent simulation, creating simplified representations online.

Result: The model makes high-utility predictions despite encoding only a small subset of objects. Strong empirical support found over alternative models in grid-world planning and physical reasoning tasks across multiple behavioral measures.

Conclusion: Provides concrete algorithmic account of how people construct reduced representations to support efficient mental simulation through just-in-time representation building.

Abstract: Probabilistic mental simulation is thought to play a key role in human reasoning, planning, and prediction, yet the demands of simulation in complex environments exceed realistic human capacity limits. A theory with growing evidence is that people simulate using simplified representations of the environment that abstract away from irrelevant details, but it is unclear how people determine these simplifications efficiently. Here, we present a "Just-in-Time" framework for simulation-based reasoning that demonstrates how such representations can be constructed online with minimal added computation. The model uses a tight interleaving of simulation, visual search, and representation modification, with the current simulation guiding where to look and visual search flagging objects that should be encoded for subsequent simulation. Despite only ever encoding a small subset of objects, the model makes high-utility predictions. We find strong empirical support for this account over alternative models in a grid-world planning task and a physical reasoning task across a range of behavioral measures. Together, these results offer a concrete algorithmic account of how people construct reduced representations to support efficient mental simulation.

TL;DR: PhyloEvolve is an LLM-agent system that treats GPU algorithm optimization as In-Context Reinforcement Learning, using phylogenetic trees to organize optimization history and enable trajectory-based learning without model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-assisted evolutionary methods for GPU code optimization rely on outcome-based selection and random mutation, failing to utilize rich trajectory information generated during iterative optimization processes.

Method: PhyloEvolve integrates Algorithm Distillation and prompt-based Decision Transformers into an iterative workflow, using phylogenetic trees to capture inheritance, divergence, and recombination among algorithm variants. It combines elite trajectory pooling, multi-island parallel exploration, and containerized execution.

Result: The system demonstrates consistent improvements in runtime, memory efficiency, and correctness over baseline and evolutionary methods across scientific computing workloads including PDE solvers, manifold learning, and spectral graph algorithms.

Conclusion: PhyloEvolve successfully reframes GPU algorithm optimization as an In-Context Reinforcement Learning problem, enabling trajectory-conditioned reuse of optimization experience without model retraining through phylogenetic organization of optimization history.

Abstract: Optimizing scientific computing algorithms for modern GPUs is a labor-intensive and iterative process involving repeated code modification, benchmarking, and tuning across complex hardware and software stacks. Recent work has explored large language model (LLM)-assisted evolutionary methods for automated code optimization, but these approaches primarily rely on outcome-based selection and random mutation, underutilizing the rich trajectory information generated during iterative optimization. We propose PhyloEvolve, an LLM-agent system that reframes GPU-oriented algorithm optimization as an In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) problem. This formulation enables trajectory-conditioned reuse of optimization experience without model retraining. PhyloEvolve integrates Algorithm Distillation and prompt-based Decision Transformers into an iterative workflow, treating sequences of algorithm modifications and performance feedback as first-class learning signals. To organize optimization history, we introduce a phylogenetic tree representation that captures inheritance, divergence, and recombination among algorithm variants, enabling backtracking, cross-lineage transfer, and reproducibility. The system combines elite trajectory pooling, multi-island parallel exploration, and containerized execution to balance exploration and exploitation across heterogeneous hardware. We evaluate PhyloEvolve on scientific computing workloads including PDE solvers, manifold learning, and spectral graph algorithms, demonstrating consistent improvements in runtime, memory efficiency, and correctness over baseline and evolutionary methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAS-Orchestra is a training-time framework that formulates multi-agent system orchestration as function-calling RL with holistic orchestration, while MASBENCH is a benchmark to systematically study when and why MAS outperform single-agent systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent system (MAS) design approaches under-deliver due to methodological complexity (sequential, code-level execution limiting holistic reasoning) and efficacy uncertainty (deploying MAS without understanding benefits over single-agent systems).

Method: MAS-Orchestra abstracts agents as callable functions and formulates MAS orchestration as function-calling reinforcement learning with holistic orchestration (generating entire MAS at once). MASBENCH provides a controlled benchmark characterizing tasks along five axes: Depth, Horizon, Breadth, Parallel, and Robustness.

Result: Analysis reveals MAS gains depend on task structure, verification protocols, and capabilities of orchestrator/sub-agents rather than being universal. MAS-Orchestra achieves consistent improvements on mathematical reasoning, multi-hop QA, and search-based QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: MAS-Orchestra and MASBENCH together enable better training and understanding of multi-agent systems, advancing toward multi-agent intelligence by addressing methodological complexity and efficacy uncertainty in MAS design.

Abstract: While multi-agent systems (MAS) promise elevated intelligence through coordination of agents, current approaches to automatic MAS design under-deliver. Such shortcomings stem from two key factors: (1) methodological complexity - agent orchestration is performed using sequential, code-level execution that limits global system-level holistic reasoning and scales poorly with agent complexity - and (2) efficacy uncertainty - MAS are deployed without understanding if there are tangible benefits compared to single-agent systems (SAS). We propose MAS-Orchestra, a training-time framework that formulates MAS orchestration as a function-calling reinforcement learning problem with holistic orchestration, generating an entire MAS at once. In MAS-Orchestra, complex, goal-oriented sub-agents are abstracted as callable functions, enabling global reasoning over system structure while hiding internal execution details. To rigorously study when and why MAS are beneficial, we introduce MASBENCH, a controlled benchmark that characterizes tasks along five axes: Depth, Horizon, Breadth, Parallel, and Robustness. Our analysis reveals that MAS gains depend critically on task structure, verification protocols, and the capabilities of both orchestrator and sub-agents, rather than holding universally. Guided by these insights, MAS-Orchestra achieves consistent improvements on public benchmarks including mathematical reasoning, multi-hop QA, and search-based QA. Together, MAS-Orchestra and MASBENCH enable better training and understanding of MAS in the pursuit of multi-agent intelligence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AGEA framework enables efficient extraction of hidden knowledge graphs from GraphRAG systems using limited queries, achieving up to 90% recovery of entities and relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work shows GraphRAG systems may leak retrieved subgraphs, but the feasibility of reconstructing the complete hidden graph structure under realistic query budgets remains unexplored. The paper aims to study whether modern GraphRAG systems are vulnerable to structured extraction attacks even with strict query limits.

Method: Proposes AGEA (Agentic Graph Extraction Attack) framework with: 1) novelty-guided exploration-exploitation strategy, 2) external graph memory modules, and 3) a two-stage graph extraction pipeline combining lightweight discovery with LLM-based filtering. Evaluated on medical, agriculture, and literary datasets across Microsoft-GraphRAG and LightRAG systems.

Result: Under identical query budgets, AGEA significantly outperforms prior attack baselines, recovering up to 90% of entities and relationships while maintaining high precision. Demonstrates modern GraphRAG systems are highly vulnerable to structured, agentic extraction attacks even under strict query limits.

Conclusion: GraphRAG systems are vulnerable to efficient graph extraction attacks using the proposed AGEA framework, which can reconstruct most of the hidden knowledge graph structure with limited queries, highlighting significant security concerns for retrieval-augmented generation systems.

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) systems construct knowledge graphs over document collections to support multi-hop reasoning. While prior work shows that GraphRAG responses may leak retrieved subgraphs, the feasibility of query-efficient reconstruction of the hidden graph structure remains unexplored under realistic query budgets. We study a budget-constrained black-box setting where an adversary adaptively queries the system to steal its latent entity-relation graph. We propose AGEA (Agentic Graph Extraction Attack), a framework that leverages a novelty-guided exploration-exploitation strategy, external graph memory modules, and a two-stage graph extraction pipeline combining lightweight discovery with LLM-based filtering. We evaluate AGEA on medical, agriculture, and literary datasets across Microsoft-GraphRAG and LightRAG systems. Under identical query budgets, AGEA significantly outperforms prior attack baselines, recovering up to 90% of entities and relationships while maintaining high precision. These results demonstrate that modern GraphRAG systems are highly vulnerable to structured, agentic extraction attacks, even under strict query limits.

*Aisvarya Adeseye,Jouni Isoaho,Seppo Virtanen,Mohammad Tahir*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-based framework (SFAA) for context-aware anonymization of qualitative research data outperforms manual methods in detecting sensitive information while preserving data utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual anonymization of qualitative research data is time-consuming, inconsistent, and often misses critical identifiers. Existing automated tools lack context awareness and may distort data meaning.

Method: Developed Structured Framework for Adaptive Anonymizer (SFAA) with three steps: detection, classification, and adaptive anonymization using four strategies (rule-based substitution, context-aware rewriting, generalization, suppression). Evaluated using local LLMs (LLaMA and Phi) on two case studies with 82 and 93 interviews.

Result: LLMs detected more sensitive data than human reviewers. Phi found over 91% of sensitive data with 94.8% sentiment preservation, outperforming LLaMA but with slightly more errors. Framework effectively anonymized while maintaining data utility.

Conclusion: LLM-based anonymization provides reliable, repeatable, context-aware protection for qualitative research data, balancing privacy preservation with data utility for analysis.

Abstract: Qualitative research often contains personal, contextual, and organizational details that pose privacy risks if not handled appropriately. Manual anonymization is time-consuming, inconsistent, and frequently omits critical identifiers. Existing automated tools tend to rely on pattern matching or fixed rules, which fail to capture context and may alter the meaning of the data. This study uses local LLMs to build a reliable, repeatable, and context-aware anonymization process for detecting and anonymizing sensitive data in qualitative transcripts. We introduce a Structured Framework for Adaptive Anonymizer (SFAA) that includes three steps: detection, classification, and adaptive anonymization. The SFAA incorporates four anonymization strategies: rule-based substitution, context-aware rewriting, generalization, and suppression. These strategies are applied based on the identifier type and the risk level. The identifiers handled by the SFAA are guided by major international privacy and research ethics standards, including the GDPR, HIPAA, and OECD guidelines. This study followed a dual-method evaluation that combined manual and LLM-assisted processing. Two case studies were used to support the evaluation. The first includes 82 face-to-face interviews on gamification in organizations. The second involves 93 machine-led interviews using an AI-powered interviewer to test LLM awareness and workplace privacy. Two local models, LLaMA and Phi were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. The results indicate that the LLMs found more sensitive data than a human reviewer. Phi outperformed LLaMA in finding sensitive data, but made slightly more errors. Phi was able to find over 91% of the sensitive data and 94.8% kept the same sentiment as the original text, which means it was very accurate, hence, it does not affect the analysis of the qualitative data.

*Shuai Wang,Yaoming Yang,Bingdong Li,Hao Hao,Aimin Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IB-GRPO is an indicator-guided alignment method for LLM-based Learning Path Recommendation that addresses pedagogical misalignment, data scarcity, and multi-objective optimization challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have rich semantic understanding for free-form recommendation but face challenges in long-horizon Learning Path Recommendation: (1) misalignment with pedagogical objectives like Zone of Proximal Development under sparse feedback, (2) scarce expert demonstrations, and (3) complex multi-objective interactions among learning effect, difficulty scheduling, length control, and diversity.

Method: Proposes IB-GRPO (Indicator-Based Group Relative Policy Optimization) with hybrid expert demonstrations via Genetic Algorithm search and teacher RL agents, supervised fine-tuning warm-start, within-session ZPD alignment score for difficulty scheduling, and $I_{ε+}$ dominance indicator for computing group-relative advantages over multiple objectives without manual scalarization.

Result: Experiments on ASSIST09 and Junyi datasets using KES simulator with Qwen2.5-7B backbone show consistent improvements over representative RL and LLM baselines.

Conclusion: IB-GRPO effectively addresses the key challenges in LLM-based Learning Path Recommendation through indicator-guided alignment, hybrid demonstration construction, and multi-objective optimization without manual scalarization, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Learning Path Recommendation (LPR) aims to generate personalized sequences of learning items that maximize long-term learning effect while respecting pedagogical principles and operational constraints. Although large language models (LLMs) offer rich semantic understanding for free-form recommendation, applying them to long-horizon LPR is challenging due to (i) misalignment with pedagogical objectives such as the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) under sparse, delayed feedback, (ii) scarce and costly expert demonstrations, and (iii) multi-objective interactions among learning effect, difficulty scheduling, length controllability, and trajectory diversity. To address these issues, we propose IB-GRPO (Indicator-Based Group Relative Policy Optimization), an indicator-guided alignment approach for LLM-based LPR. To mitigate data scarcity, we construct hybrid expert demonstrations via Genetic Algorithm search and teacher RL agents and warm-start the LLM with supervised fine-tuning. Building on this warm-start, we design a within-session ZPD alignment score for difficulty scheduling. IB-GRPO then uses the $I_{ε+}$ dominance indicator to compute group-relative advantages over multiple objectives, avoiding manual scalarization and improving Pareto trade-offs. Experiments on ASSIST09 and Junyi using the KES simulator with a Qwen2.5-7B backbone show consistent improvements over representative RL and LLM baselines.

Motivation: Current LLM-based evaluation of agent performance assumes agent reasoning traces faithfully reflect internal reasoning and environment state, but this assumption may be brittle and susceptible to manipulation.

Method: Systematically rewrote agent chain-of-thought reasoning while holding actions and observations fixed across 800 trajectories spanning diverse web tasks. Studied both style-based (presentation changes) and content-based (fabricating task progress signals) manipulation strategies. Evaluated prompting techniques and scaling judge-time compute as potential defenses.

Result: Manipulated reasoning alone can inflate false positive rates of state-of-the-art VLM judges by up to 90%. Content-based manipulations are consistently more effective than style-based approaches. Prompting and compute scaling reduce but don't eliminate susceptibility to manipulation.

Conclusion: LLM-based evaluation has a fundamental vulnerability to reasoning trace manipulation, highlighting the need for judging mechanisms that verify reasoning claims against observable evidence rather than relying on potentially manipulated reasoning traces.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as judges to evaluate agent performance, particularly in non-verifiable settings where judgments rely on agent trajectories including chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. This paradigm implicitly assumes that the agent's CoT faithfully reflects both its internal reasoning and the underlying environment state. We show this assumption is brittle: LLM judges are highly susceptible to manipulation of agent reasoning traces. By systematically rewriting agent CoTs while holding actions and observations fixed, we demonstrate that manipulated reasoning alone can inflate false positive rates of state-of-the-art VLM judges by up to 90% across 800 trajectories spanning diverse web tasks. We study manipulation strategies spanning style-based approaches that alter only the presentation of reasoning and content-based approaches that fabricate signals of task progress, and find that content-based manipulations are consistently more effective. We evaluate prompting-based techniques and scaling judge-time compute, which reduce but do not fully eliminate susceptibility to manipulation. Our findings reveal a fundamental vulnerability in LLM-based evaluation and highlight the need for judging mechanisms that verify reasoning claims against observable evidence.

*Zecong Tang,Zixu Wang,Yifei Wang,Weitong Lian,Tianjian Gao,Haoran Li,Tengju Ru,Lingyi Meng,Zhejun Cui,Yichen Zhu,Qi Kang,Kaixuan Wang,Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoDriDM is a decision-centric benchmark for evaluating vision-language models in autonomous driving, focusing on decision-making beyond perception with 6,650 questions across Object, Scene, and Decision dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous driving benchmarks overemphasize perceptual competence and fail to adequately assess decision-making processes, despite VLMs showing promising reasoning abilities for this domain.

Method: Created AutoDriDM benchmark with 6,650 questions across three dimensions (Object, Scene, Decision), evaluated mainstream VLMs, conducted correlation analysis between perception and decision performance, performed explainability analyses, and introduced an analyzer model for automated large-scale annotation.

Result: Revealed weak alignment between perception and decision-making performance in VLMs, identified key failure modes like logical reasoning errors, and demonstrated the gap between perception-centered and decision-centered evaluation.

Conclusion: AutoDriDM bridges the perception-decision evaluation gap and provides guidance for developing safer, more reliable VLMs for real-world autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Autonomous driving is a highly challenging domain that requires reliable perception and safe decision-making in complex scenarios. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate reasoning and generalization abilities, opening new possibilities for autonomous driving; however, existing benchmarks and metrics overemphasize perceptual competence and fail to adequately assess decision-making processes. In this work, we present AutoDriDM, a decision-centric, progressive benchmark with 6,650 questions across three dimensions - Object, Scene, and Decision. We evaluate mainstream VLMs to delineate the perception-to-decision capability boundary in autonomous driving, and our correlation analysis reveals weak alignment between perception and decision-making performance. We further conduct explainability analyses of models' reasoning processes, identifying key failure modes such as logical reasoning errors, and introduce an analyzer model to automate large-scale annotation. AutoDriDM bridges the gap between perception-centered and decision-centered evaluation, providing guidance toward safer and more reliable VLMs for real-world autonomous driving.

TL;DR: DARA: A dual-phase LLM framework combining few-shot reasoning with fine-grained optimization for AI-generated bidding, outperforming baselines in advertiser value under budget constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advertisers face complex optimization challenges in AI-Generated Bidding with personalized objectives but limited historical data, creating few-shot scenarios where traditional RL methods struggle. LLMs offer in-context learning capabilities but lack numerical precision for fine-grained optimization.

Method: Introduces GRPO-Adaptive for efficient LLM post-training to enhance reasoning and numerical precision, then proposes DARA - a dual-phase framework with: 1) few-shot reasoner generating initial plans via in-context prompting, and 2) fine-grained optimizer refining plans using feedback-driven reasoning.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic data environments show the approach consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of cumulative advertiser value under budget constraints.

Conclusion: DARA successfully combines LLMs' in-context learning strengths with precise adaptability required for AIGB tasks, providing an effective solution for few-shot bidding optimization problems.

Abstract: Optimizing the advertiser's cumulative value of winning impressions under budget constraints poses a complex challenge in online advertising, under the paradigm of AI-Generated Bidding (AIGB). Advertisers often have personalized objectives but limited historical interaction data, resulting in few-shot scenarios where traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle to perform effectively. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative for AIGB by leveraging their in-context learning capabilities to generalize from limited data. However, they lack the numerical precision required for fine-grained optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce GRPO-Adaptive, an efficient LLM post-training strategy that enhances both reasoning and numerical precision by dynamically updating the reference policy during training. Built upon this foundation, we further propose DARA, a novel dual-phase framework that decomposes the decision-making process into two stages: a few-shot reasoner that generates initial plans via in-context prompting, and a fine-grained optimizer that refines these plans using feedback-driven reasoning. This separation allows DARA to combine LLMs' in-context learning strengths with precise adaptability required by AIGB tasks. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic data environments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of cumulative advertiser value under budget constraints.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASP's rule-based formalism makes it naturally suitable for explainable reasoning, which is increasingly important with the rise of Explainable AI (XAI). Current ASP explanation approaches often address specific scenarios but may not cover all user needs, requiring a comprehensive survey.

Method: Survey methodology: provides overview of ASP explanation types, connects them to user questions for explanation, describes coverage by current theory and tools, and analyzes existing approaches.

A number of explanation approaches and tools for ASP have been developed, which often tackle specific explanatory settings and may not cover all scenarios that ASP users encounter. In this survey, we provide, guided by an XAI perspective, an overview of types of ASP explanations in connection with user questions for explanation, and describe how their coverage by current theory and tools. Furthermore, we pinpoint gaps in existing ASP explanations approaches and identify research directions for future work.

*Haizhou Liu,Haodong Jin,Yiming Wang,Hui Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Novel semantic-guided unsupervised video summarization method using frame-level semantic alignment attention and incremental training to overcome GAN instability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised video summarization methods rely on GANs but overlook semantic guidance in keyframe selection and suffer from unstable training.

Method: Proposes semantic-guided unsupervised approach with frame-level semantic alignment attention mechanism integrated into keyframe selector, guiding Transformer-based generator within adversarial framework, plus incremental training strategy.

Result: Achieves superior performance on multiple benchmark datasets compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Semantic guidance and incremental training effectively address limitations of existing GAN-based unsupervised video summarization methods.

Abstract: Video summarization is a crucial technique for social understanding, enabling efficient browsing of massive multimedia content and extraction of key information from social platforms. Most existing unsupervised summarization methods rely on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enhance keyframe selection and generate coherent, video summaries through adversarial training. However, such approaches primarily exploit unimodal features, overlooking the guiding role of semantic information in keyframe selection, and often suffer from unstable training. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Semantic-Guided Unsupervised Video Summarization method. Specifically, we design a novel frame-level semantic alignment attention mechanism and integrate it into a keyframe selector, which guides the Transformer-based generator within the adversarial framework to better reconstruct videos. In addition, we adopt an incremental training strategy to progressively update the model components, effectively mitigating the instability of GAN training. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on multiple benchmark datasets.

*Amaury Guichard,Laurent Michel,Hélène Verhaeghe,Pierre Schaus*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: First bound-consistent algorithm for no-overlap constraint using MDD-based filtering with width threshold for polynomial-time complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bound consistency for no-overlap constraint is NP-complete, so existing polynomial-time techniques (edge finding, not-first-not-last, energetic reasoning) provide only partial filtering. Need stronger filtering that approaches bound consistency while maintaining polynomial complexity.

Method: Builds on no-overlap MDD by Ciré and van Hoeve. Extracts bounds on job time windows from MDD to tighten start/end times. Limits MDD width with threshold to control size and complexity, creating relaxed MDD for practical bound-consistent filtering.

Result: MDD-based filtering achieves stronger search tree reduction than previous precedence-detection algorithm. Complementary to classical propagation methods, reduces both nodes visited and solving time on sequencing problems with time windows and just-in-time objective.

Conclusion: First bound-consistent algorithm for no-overlap constraint, using width-limited MDD for polynomial-time filtering that outperforms existing methods and complements classical approaches.

Abstract: Achieving bound consistency for the no-overlap constraint is known to be NP-complete. Therefore, several polynomial-time tightening techniques, such as edge finding, not-first-not-last reasoning, and energetic reasoning, have been introduced for this constraint. In this work, we derive the first bound-consistent algorithm for the no-overlap constraint. By building on the no-overlap MDD defined by Ciré and van Hoeve, we extract bounds of the time window of the jobs, allowing us to tighten start and end times in time polynomial in the number of nodes of the MDD. Similarly, to bound the size and time-complexity, we limit the width of the MDD to a threshold, creating a relaxed MDD that can also be used to relax the bound-consistent filtering. Through experiments on a sequencing problem with time windows and a just-in-time objective ($1 \mid r_j, d_j, \bar{d}_j \mid \sum E_j + \sum T_j$), we observe that the proposed filtering, even with a threshold on the width, achieves a stronger reduction in the number of nodes visited in the search tree compared to the previously proposed precedence-detection algorithm of Ciré and van Hoeve. The new filtering also appears to be complementary to classical propagation methods for the no-overlap constraint, allowing a substantial reduction in both the number of nodes and the solving time on several instances.

*Zhi Qiu,Jiazheng Sun,Chenxiao Xia,Jun Zheng,Xin Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CI4A introduces semantic UI component interfaces optimized for agents, enabling better web interaction performance than traditional human-centric interfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are good at high-level planning but struggle with fine-grained web component manipulation; existing RL approaches force agents to adapt to human interfaces rather than optimizing interfaces for agents.

Method: CI4A abstracts complex UI interaction logic into unified tool primitives for agents, implemented in Ant Design covering 23 UI component categories, with a hybrid agent featuring dynamic action space.

Result: CI4A-based agent achieves 86.3% task success rate (new SoTA) on upgraded WebArena benchmark with substantial execution efficiency improvements.

Conclusion: Optimizing interfaces for agents (CI4A) rather than forcing agents to adapt to human interfaces significantly improves web interaction performance and efficiency.

Abstract: While Large Language Models demonstrate remarkable proficiency in high-level semantic planning, they remain limited in handling fine-grained, low-level web component manipulations. To address this limitation, extensive research has focused on enhancing model grounding capabilities through techniques such as Reinforcement Learning. However, rather than compelling agents to adapt to human-centric interfaces, we propose constructing interaction interfaces specifically optimized for agents. This paper introduces Component Interface for Agent (CI4A), a semantic encapsulation mechanism that abstracts the complex interaction logic of UI components into a set of unified tool primitives accessible to agents. We implemented CI4A within Ant Design, an industrial-grade front-end framework, covering 23 categories of commonly used UI components. Furthermore, we developed a hybrid agent featuring an action space that dynamically updates according to the page state, enabling flexible invocation of available CI4A tools. Leveraging the CI4A-integrated Ant Design, we refactored and upgraded the WebArena benchmark to evaluate existing SoTA methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the CI4A-based agent significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving a new SoTA task success rate of 86.3%, alongside substantial improvements in execution efficiency.

Conclusion: Hierarchical evaluation and representation-level alignment are crucial for safer and more clinically meaningful deployment of vision-language models in medical imaging.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models show strong zero-shot performance for chest X-ray classification, but standard flat metrics fail to distinguish between clinically minor and severe errors. This work investigates how to quantify and mitigate abstraction errors by leveraging medical taxonomies. We benchmark several state-of-the-art VLMs using hierarchical metrics and introduce Catastrophic Abstraction Errors to capture cross-branch mistakes. Our results reveal substantial misalignment of VLMs with clinical taxonomies despite high flat performance. To address this, we propose risk-constrained thresholding and taxonomy-aware fine-tuning with radial embeddings, which reduce severe abstraction errors to below 2 per cent while maintaining competitive performance. These findings highlight the importance of hierarchical evaluation and representation-level alignment for safer and more clinically meaningful deployment of VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neuro-symbolic methods lack native support for ontologies, limiting their ability to ensure predictions are consistent with formal domain knowledge represented in Description Logic ontologies.

Method: Encode Description Logic ontology as a circuit (feed-forward differentiable computational graph) that supports tractable query execution and transformations. Use this circuit for: (i) generating synthetic datasets capturing ontology semantics, (ii) efficient GPU-based deductive reasoning, and (iii) implementing neuro-symbolic models with provably consistent predictions.

Result: Synthetic datasets qualitatively capture ontology semantics while being challenging for ML classifiers. Circuit compilation enables reasoning up to 1000x faster than existing reasoners. Neuro-symbolic classifiers reliably produce consistent predictions while maintaining or outperforming neural network baselines.

Conclusion: Compiling Description Logic ontologies into circuits enables tighter integration between Deep Learning and Knowledge Representation, allowing a single circuit representation to tackle multiple challenging real-world application tasks.

Abstract: Background: Neuro-symbolic methods enhance the reliability of neural network classifiers through logical constraints, but they lack native support for ontologies.
  Objectives: We aim to develop a neuro-symbolic method that reliably outputs predictions consistent with a Description Logic ontology that formalizes domain-specific knowledge.
  Methods: We encode a Description Logic ontology as a circuit, a feed-forward differentiable computational graph that supports tractable execution of queries and transformations. We show that the circuit can be used to (i) generate synthetic datasets that capture the semantics of the ontology; (ii) efficiently perform deductive reasoning on a GPU; (iii) implement neuro-symbolic models whose predictions are approximately or provably consistent with the knowledge defined in the ontology.
  Results We show that the synthetic dataset generated using the circuit qualitatively captures the semantics of the ontology while being challenging for Machine Learning classifiers, including neural networks. Moreover, we show that compiling the ontology into a circuit is a promising approach for scalable deductive reasoning, with runtimes up to three orders of magnitude faster than available reasoners. Finally, we show that our neuro-symbolic classifiers reliably produce consistent predictions when compared to neural network baselines, maintaining competitive performances or even outperforming them.
  Conclusions By compiling Description Logic ontologies into circuits, we obtain a tighter integration between the Deep Learning and Knowledge Representation fields. We show that a single circuit representation can be used to tackle different challenging tasks closely related to real-world applications.

*Nadine Meertens,Suet Lee,Ophelia Deroy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes shifting focus from AI consciousness debates to evaluating "awareness" as a more practical, measurable alternative for assessing AI systems' capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current debates about AI consciousness and moral status lack agreement on evaluation methods, creating a need for more productive and methodologically tractable approaches to assess AI systems.

Method: Introduces a practical method for evaluating awareness across diverse systems, defined as abilities to process, store, and use information for goal-directed action. The approach must be domain-sensitive, scalable, multidimensional, predictive of task performance, and enable ability-level comparisons.

Result: Proposes a structured approach to evaluate and compare "awareness profiles" across AI systems with different architectures, scales, and operational domains, enabling principled assessment and comparison.

Conclusion: Shifting focus from artificial consciousness to "being just aware enough" facilitates more constructive scientific and public discourse, supports better AI design and oversight, and provides a practical framework for assessing AI capabilities.

Abstract: Recent debates on artificial intelligence increasingly emphasise questions of AI consciousness and moral status, yet there remains little agreement on how such properties should be evaluated. In this paper, we argue that awareness offers a more productive and methodologically tractable alternative. We introduce a practical method for evaluating awareness across diverse systems, where awareness is understood as encompassing a system's abilities to process, store and use information in the service of goal-directed action. Central to this approach is the claim that any evaluation aiming to capture the diversity of artificial systems must be domain-sensitive, deployable at any scale, multidimensional, and enable the prediction of task performance, while generalising to the level of abilities for the sake of comparison. Given these four desiderata, we outline a structured approach to evaluating and comparing awareness profiles across artificial systems with differing architectures, scales, and operational domains. By shifting the focus from artificial consciousness to being just aware enough, this approach aims to facilitate principled assessment, support design and oversight, and enable more constructive scientific and public discourse.

TL;DR: TGA is a linear-complexity graph attention network that models multi-behavior transitions in e-commerce by identifying informative transitions at item, category, and neighbor levels, outperforming SOTA models with reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing transformer-based approaches for sequential modeling of multi-behavior data (clicks, favorites, cart adds, purchases) have polynomial time complexity, making them computationally expensive and impractical for large-scale industrial systems with long user sequences.

Method: Proposes Transition-Aware Graph Attention Network (TGA) with linear complexity. Constructs structured sparse graph by identifying informative transitions from three perspectives: (1) item-level transitions, (2) category-level transitions, and (3) neighbor-level transitions. Uses transition-aware graph attention to jointly model user-item interactions and behavior transition types.

Result: TGA outperforms all state-of-the-art models while significantly reducing computational cost. Successfully deployed in large-scale industrial production environment with impressive improvements in key business metrics.

Conclusion: TGA provides an efficient and effective solution for modeling multi-behavior transitions in e-commerce, addressing computational limitations of existing approaches while achieving superior performance and practical deployment success.

Abstract: User interactions on e-commerce platforms are inherently diverse, involving behaviors such as clicking, favoriting, adding to cart, and purchasing. The transitions between these behaviors offer valuable insights into user-item interactions, serving as a key signal for understanding evolving preferences. Consequently, there is growing interest in leveraging multi-behavior data to better capture user intent. Recent studies have explored sequential modeling of multi-behavior data, many relying on transformer-based architectures with polynomial time complexity. While effective, these approaches often incur high computational costs, limiting their applicability in large-scale industrial systems with long user sequences. To address this challenge, we propose the Transition-Aware Graph Attention Network (TGA), a linear-complexity approach for modeling multi-behavior transitions. Unlike traditional transformers that treat all behavior pairs equally, TGA constructs a structured sparse graph by identifying informative transitions from three perspectives: (a) item-level transitions, (b) category-level transitions, and (c) neighbor-level transitions. Built upon the structured graph, TGA employs a transition-aware graph Attention mechanism that jointly models user-item interactions and behavior transition types, enabling more accurate capture of sequential patterns while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show that TGA outperforms all state-of-the-art models while significantly reducing computational cost. Notably, TGA has been deployed in a large-scale industrial production environment, where it leads to impressive improvements in key business metrics.

TL;DR: Paper critiques current XAI approaches as treating meaning as inherent to models, proposes alternative framework using Barad's agential realism where interpretations emerge from human-AI-context entanglements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current XAI approaches are limited by unexamined assumptions: treating meaning as immanent to AI models, positioning explainers outside systems, and presuming causal structures are computationally recoverable. Need alternative onto-epistemological foundation.

Method: Draw on Barad's agential realism to develop alternative XAI framework. Analyze comprehensive set of XAI methods through this lens to reveal assumptions/limitations. Articulate ethical dimensions and propose design directions for XAI interfaces supporting emergent interpretation, using speculative text-to-music interface as case study.

Result: Develops alternative onto-epistemology where interpretations are material-discursive performances emerging from situated entanglements of AI models with humans, context, and interpretative apparatus. Reveals limitations of current XAI methods and provides ethical framework.

Conclusion: XAI should move beyond technical problem-solving to embrace emergent interpretations from human-AI-context entanglements. Proposed framework offers ethical foundation and design directions for more meaningful XAI interfaces.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is frequently positioned as a technical problem of revealing the inner workings of an AI model. This position is affected by unexamined onto-epistemological assumptions: meaning is treated as immanent to the model, the explainer is positioned outside the system, and a causal structure is presumed recoverable through computational techniques. In this paper, we draw on Barad's agential realism to develop an alternative onto-epistemology of XAI. We propose that interpretations are material-discursive performances that emerge from situated entanglements of the AI model with humans, context, and the interpretative apparatus. To develop this position, we read a comprehensive set of XAI methods through agential realism and reveal the assumptions and limitations that underpin several of these methods. We then articulate the framework's ethical dimension and propose design directions for XAI interfaces that support emergent interpretation, using a speculative text-to-music interface as a case study.

### [136] [The Responsibility Vacuum: Organizational Failure in Scaled Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15059)
*Oleg Romanchuk,Roman Bondar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Modern CI/CD pipelines with AI agents create a "responsibility vacuum" where decisions are made but no one has both authority to approve and capacity to understand them, leading to ritualized approvals instead of meaningful verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses a critical gap in modern software deployment: as AI agents generate code at scale, traditional approval processes break down because human reviewers lack the capacity to meaningfully verify decisions they're formally approving, creating systemic accountability failures.

Method: The authors define "responsibility vacuum" as a structural condition, analyze scaling limits under standard deployment assumptions (parallel agent generation, CI validation, human approval gates), and characterize CI amplification dynamics where increased automation worsens the problem.

Result: The research identifies a throughput threshold beyond which verification becomes ritualized approval based on proxy signals, shows that personalized responsibility becomes structurally unattainable at scale, and demonstrates that additional automation amplifies rather than mitigates the responsibility vacuum.

Conclusion: Organizations must redesign decision boundaries or shift responsibility from individual decisions to batch/system-level ownership to address responsibility vacuum, which otherwise remains an invisible but persistent failure mode in scaled AI agent deployments.

Abstract: Modern CI/CD pipelines integrating agent-generated code exhibit a structural failure in responsibility attribution. Decisions are executed through formally correct approval processes, yet no entity possesses both the authority to approve those decisions and the epistemic capacity to meaningfully understand their basis.
  We define this condition as responsibility vacuum: a state in which decisions occur, but responsibility cannot be attributed because authority and verification capacity do not coincide. We show that this is not a process deviation or technical defect, but a structural property of deployments where decision generation throughput exceeds bounded human verification capacity.
  We identify a scaling limit under standard deployment assumptions, including parallel agent generation, CI-based validation, and individualized human approval gates. Beyond a throughput threshold, verification ceases to function as a decision criterion and is replaced by ritualized approval based on proxy signals. Personalized responsibility becomes structurally unattainable in this regime.
  We further characterize a CI amplification dynamic, whereby increasing automated validation coverage raises proxy signal density without restoring human capacity. Under fixed time and attention constraints, this accelerates cognitive offloading in the broad sense and widens the gap between formal approval and epistemic understanding. Additional automation therefore amplifies, rather than mitigates, the responsibility vacuum.
  We conclude that unless organizations explicitly redesign decision boundaries or reassign responsibility away from individual decisions toward batch- or system-level ownership, responsibility vacuum remains an invisible but persistent failure mode in scaled agent deployments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for general agentic attribution that identifies internal factors driving LLM agent actions, using hierarchical analysis at component and sentence levels to pinpoint historical events and textual evidence behind agent behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLM-based agents become more autonomous and deployed at scale, understanding why agents take particular actions is crucial for accountability and governance. Existing research focuses only on failure attribution for unsuccessful trajectories, which is insufficient for explaining reasoning behind all agent behaviors.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical framework: at component level, uses temporal likelihood dynamics to identify critical interaction steps; at sentence level, refines localization using perturbation-based analysis to isolate specific textual evidence driving agent actions.

Result: Experimental validation across diverse agentic scenarios (standard tool use and subtle reliability risks like memory-induced bias) shows the framework reliably pinpoints pivotal historical events and sentences behind agent behavior.

Conclusion: The framework offers a critical step toward safer and more accountable agentic systems by providing general attribution that works regardless of task outcome, moving beyond just failure attribution.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are widely used in real-world applications such as customer service, web navigation, and software engineering. As these systems become more autonomous and are deployed at scale, understanding why an agent takes a particular action becomes increasingly important for accountability and governance. However, existing research predominantly focuses on \textit{failure attribution} to localize explicit errors in unsuccessful trajectories, which is insufficient for explaining the reasoning behind agent behaviors. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework for \textbf{general agentic attribution}, designed to identify the internal factors driving agent actions regardless of the task outcome. Our framework operates hierarchically to manage the complexity of agent interactions. Specifically, at the \textit{component level}, we employ temporal likelihood dynamics to identify critical interaction steps; then at the \textit{sentence level}, we refine this localization using perturbation-based analysis to isolate the specific textual evidence. We validate our framework across a diverse suite of agentic scenarios, including standard tool use and subtle reliability risks like memory-induced bias. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework reliably pinpoints pivotal historical events and sentences behind the agent behavior, offering a critical step toward safer and more accountable agentic systems.

TL;DR: RISE: A "Real-to-Virtual" method that synthesizes virtual trajectories and negative samples to mitigate intent deviation in LLM tool-using agents, achieving significant improvements in task completion and intent alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM tool-using agents suffer from intent deviation issues that hinder reliable evaluation and performance improvement. Existing methods are either costly (real system samples) or suffer from distribution shift (virtual data), and both lack negative samples for intent deviation scenarios.

Method: RISE anchors on verified tool primitives to synthesize virtual trajectories and generates diverse negative samples through mutation on critical parameters. It then fine-tunes backbone LLMs via two-stage training for intent alignment using the synthetic data.

Result: RISE achieves promising results across eight metrics covering user requirements, execution trajectories, and agent responses. It shows 35.28% average improvement in task completion (Acctask) and 23.27% in intent alignment (Accintent), outperforming SOTA baselines by 1.20-42.09% and 1.17-54.93% respectively.

Conclusion: RISE effectively addresses intent deviation in LLM tool-using agents through real-to-virtual data synthesis and targeted negative sample generation, significantly improving both task completion and intent alignment compared to existing methods.

Abstract: LLMs have advanced tool-using agents for real-world applications, yet they often lead to unexpected behaviors or results. Beyond obvious failures, the subtle issue of "intent deviation" severely hinders reliable evaluation and performance improvement. Existing post-training methods generally leverage either real system samples or virtual data simulated by LLMs. However, the former is costly due to reliance on hand-crafted user requests, while the latter suffers from distribution shift from the real tools in the wild. Additionally, both methods lack negative samples tailored to intent deviation scenarios, hindering effective guidance on preference learning. We introduce RISE, a "Real-to-Virtual" method designed to mitigate intent deviation. Anchoring on verified tool primitives, RISE synthesizes virtual trajectories and generates diverse negative samples through mutation on critical parameters. With synthetic data, RISE fine-tunes backbone LLMs via the two-stage training for intent alignment. Evaluation results demonstrate that data synthesized by RISE achieve promising results in eight metrics covering user requires, execution trajectories and agent responses. Integrating with training, RISE achieves an average 35.28% improvement in Acctask (task completion) and 23.27% in Accintent (intent alignment), outperforming SOTA baselines by 1.20--42.09% and 1.17--54.93% respectively.

### [139] [The Plausibility Trap: Using Probabilistic Engines for Deterministic Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15130)
*Ivan Carrera,Daniel Maldonado-Ruiz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies the "Plausibility Trap" - wasteful use of expensive AI models for simple deterministic tasks, introduces tools to decide when to use/avoid generative AI, and calls for curriculum changes in digital literacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ubiquity of LLMs is causing a paradigm shift where user convenience supersedes computational efficiency, leading to wasteful deployment of expensive probabilistic engines for simple deterministic tasks like OCR and basic verification.

Method: The authors use micro-benchmarks and case studies on OCR and fact-checking to quantify the "efficiency tax," introduce Tool Selection Engineering and the Deterministic-Probabilistic Decision Matrix framework, and propose curriculum shifts.

Result: The research demonstrates a ~6.5x latency penalty (efficiency tax) and identifies risks of algorithmic sycophancy when using generative AI for simple deterministic tasks instead of more efficient traditional methods.

Conclusion: True digital literacy requires knowing not only how to use generative AI, but also when to avoid it; developers need frameworks to make appropriate tool selection decisions between deterministic and probabilistic approaches.

Abstract: The ubiquity of Large Language Models (LLMs) is driving a paradigm shift where user convenience supersedes computational efficiency. This article defines the "Plausibility Trap": a phenomenon where individuals with access to Artificial Intelligence (AI) models deploy expensive probabilistic engines for simple deterministic tasks-such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) or basic verification-resulting in significant resource waste. Through micro-benchmarks and case studies on OCR and fact-checking, we quantify the "efficiency tax"-demonstrating a ~6.5x latency penalty-and the risks of algorithmic sycophancy. To counter this, we introduce Tool Selection Engineering and the Deterministic-Probabilistic Decision Matrix, a framework to help developers determine when to use Generative AI and, crucially, when to avoid it. We argue for a curriculum shift, emphasizing that true digital literacy relies not only in knowing how to use Generative AI, but also on knowing when not to use it.

*Shijie Lian,Bin Yu,Xiaopeng Lin,Laurence T. Yang,Zhaolong Shen,Changti Wu,Yuzhuo Miao,Cong Huang,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BayesianVLA addresses information collapse in VLA models by enforcing instruction following through Bayesian decomposition, improving generalization without new data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models struggle with generalization due to dataset bias where language instructions become predictable from visual observations alone, causing models to ignore language constraints in OOD settings.

Method: Proposes BayesianVLA with learnable Latent Action Queries in a dual-branch architecture to estimate vision-only prior and language-conditioned posterior, optimizing policy to maximize conditional PMI between actions and instructions.

Result: Significantly improves generalization with 11.3% improvement on challenging OOD SimplerEnv benchmark, demonstrating robust language grounding in action across SimplerEnv and RoboCasa experiments.

Conclusion: BayesianVLA effectively addresses information collapse pathology in VLA training, enabling models to properly follow language instructions and generalize better without requiring additional data collection.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promise in robot manipulation but often struggle to generalize to new instructions or complex multi-task scenarios. We identify a critical pathology in current training paradigms where goal-driven data collection creates a dataset bias. In such datasets, language instructions are highly predictable from visual observations alone, causing the conditional mutual information between instructions and actions to vanish, a phenomenon we term Information Collapse. Consequently, models degenerate into vision-only policies that ignore language constraints and fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. To address this, we propose BayesianVLA, a novel framework that enforces instruction following via Bayesian decomposition. By introducing learnable Latent Action Queries, we construct a dual-branch architecture to estimate both a vision-only prior $p(a \mid v)$ and a language-conditioned posterior $π(a \mid v, \ell)$. We then optimize the policy to maximize the conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between actions and instructions. This objective effectively penalizes the vision shortcut and rewards actions that explicitly explain the language command. Without requiring new data, BayesianVLA significantly improves generalization. Extensive experiments across on SimplerEnv and RoboCasa demonstrate substantial gains, including an 11.3% improvement on the challenging OOD SimplerEnv benchmark, validating the ability of our approach to robustly ground language in action.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A deep reinforcement learning approach for vehicle routing with finite time horizon that maximizes served customer requests using novel network embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vehicle routing problem with finite time horizon where the goal is to maximize the number of customer requests served within limited time, overcoming limitations of existing methods.

Method: Proposes a novel routing network embedding module with local node embeddings and context-aware global graph representation, integrated into a Markov decision process with policy gradient-based deep reinforcement learning framework.

Result: Achieves higher customer service rate than existing routing methods with significantly lower solution time, validated on both real-world and synthetic Euclidean networks.

Conclusion: The proposed deep reinforcement learning approach with time-aware network embeddings effectively solves finite time horizon vehicle routing problems, outperforming existing methods in both service rate and computational efficiency.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the vehicle routing problem with a finite time horizon. In this routing problem, the objective is to maximize the number of customer requests served within a finite time horizon. We present a novel routing network embedding module which creates local node embedding vectors and a context-aware global graph representation. The proposed Markov decision process for the vehicle routing problem incorporates the node features, the network adjacency matrix and the edge features as components of the state space. We incorporate the remaining finite time horizon into the network embedding module to provide a proper routing context to the embedding module. We integrate our embedding module with a policy gradient-based deep Reinforcement Learning framework to solve the vehicle routing problem with finite time horizon. We trained and validated our proposed routing method on real-world routing networks, as well as synthetically generated Euclidean networks. Our experimental results show that our method achieves a higher customer service rate than the existing routing methods. Additionally, the solution time of our method is significantly lower than that of the existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizations face bottlenecks because critical domain knowledge resides with few experts, causing non-experts to create poor visualizations and waste expert time on basic tasks.

Method: Software engineering framework that augments LLM with request classifier, RAG system for code generation, codified expert rules, and visualization design principles in an autonomous agent.

Result: 206% improvement in output quality across 5 scenarios, with agent achieving expert-level ratings in all cases vs baseline poor performance, while maintaining superior code quality with lower variance.

Conclusion: Non-experts can achieve expert-level outcomes in specialized domains through systematic capture of human domain knowledge and codification of tacit expert knowledge into AI agents.

Abstract: Critical domain knowledge typically resides with few experts, creating organizational bottlenecks in scalability and decision-making. Non-experts struggle to create effective visualizations, leading to suboptimal insights and diverting expert time. This paper investigates how to capture and embed human domain knowledge into AI agent systems through an industrial case study. We propose a software engineering framework to capture human domain knowledge for engineering AI agents in simulation data visualization by augmenting a Large Language Model (LLM) with a request classifier, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for code generation, codified expert rules, and visualization design principles unified in an agent demonstrating autonomous, reactive, proactive, and social behavior. Evaluation across five scenarios spanning multiple engineering domains with 12 evaluators demonstrates 206% improvement in output quality, with our agent achieving expert-level ratings in all cases versus baseline's poor performance, while maintaining superior code quality with lower variance. Our contributions are: an automated agent-based system for visualization generation and a validated framework for systematically capturing human domain knowledge and codifying tacit expert knowledge into AI agents, demonstrating that non-experts can achieve expert-level outcomes in specialized domains.

*Yuval Kansal,Niraj K. Jha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Bottom-up learning paradigm using knowledge graphs as implicit reward models enables LLMs to perform compositional multi-hop reasoning in specialized domains, outperforming larger models on complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel in structured reasoning domains but struggle with compositional multi-hop reasoning in specialized scientific fields, needing better approaches for complex unseen tasks.

Method: Post-training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning and RL, where knowledge graphs act as implicit reward models. Novel reward signals derived from knowledge graph paths encourage composing intermediate axioms rather than optimizing only final answers.

Result: 14B model trained on short-hop reasoning paths (1-3 hops) achieves significant zero-shot generalization to complex multi-hop queries (4-5 hops), outperforming larger models and frontier systems like GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro on difficult reasoning tasks. Robust to adversarial perturbations.

Conclusion: Grounding reasoning processes in structured knowledge via knowledge graph path-derived rewards provides a scalable and efficient path toward intelligent compositional reasoning in specialized domains.

Abstract: Large language models have achieved near-expert performance in structured reasoning domains like mathematics and programming, yet their ability to perform compositional multi-hop reasoning in specialized scientific fields remains limited. We propose a bottom-up learning paradigm in which models are grounded in axiomatic domain facts and compose them to solve complex, unseen tasks. To this end, we present a post-training pipeline, based on a combination of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL), in which knowledge graphs act as implicit reward models. By deriving novel reward signals from knowledge graph paths, we provide verifiable, scalable, and grounded supervision that encourages models to compose intermediate axioms rather than optimize only final answers during RL. We validate this approach in the medical domain, training a 14B model on short-hop reasoning paths (1-3 hops) and evaluating its zero-shot generalization to complex multi-hop queries (4-5 hops). Our experiments show that path-derived rewards act as a "compositional bridge", enabling our model to significantly outperform much larger models and frontier systems like GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro, on the most difficult reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of our approach to adversarial perturbations against option-shuffling stress tests. This work suggests that grounding the reasoning process in structured knowledge is a scalable and efficient path toward intelligent reasoning.
