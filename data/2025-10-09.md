### [1] [Milestone Determination for Autonomous Railway Operation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06229)
*Josh Hunter,John McDermid,Simon Burton,Poppy Fynes,Mia Dempster*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a milestone-based approach for railway automation vision systems, using route-specific contextual cues to generate sequential datasets that focus on critical decision points rather than generalized dynamic component recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional computer vision systems for railway automation face challenges due to limited high-quality sequential data and lack of spatio-temporal context, while alternative solutions suffer from realism and applicability issues.

Method: The approach focuses on route-specific, contextually relevant cues to generate rich sequential datasets, using milestone determination to develop targeted rule-based models that simplify learning by concentrating on critical decision points along railway routes.

Result: The method provides a practical framework for training vision agents in controlled, predictable environments, enabling more effective real-time decision-making for railway automation systems.

Conclusion: This milestone-based approach facilitates safer and more efficient machine learning systems for railway automation by eliminating the need for generalized recognition of dynamic components and focusing instead on critical route decision points.

Abstract: In the field of railway automation, one of the key challenges has been the
development of effective computer vision systems due to the limited
availability of high-quality, sequential data. Traditional datasets are
restricted in scope, lacking the spatio temporal context necessary for
real-time decision-making, while alternative solutions introduce issues related
to realism and applicability. By focusing on route-specific, contextually
relevant cues, we can generate rich, sequential datasets that align more
closely with real-world operational logic. The concept of milestone
determination allows for the development of targeted, rule-based models that
simplify the learning process by eliminating the need for generalized
recognition of dynamic components, focusing instead on the critical decision
points along a route. We argue that this approach provides a practical
framework for training vision agents in controlled, predictable environments,
facilitating safer and more efficient machine learning systems for railway
automation.

### [2] [CML-Bench: A Framework for Evaluating and Enhancing LLM-Powered Movie Scripts Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06231)
*Mingzhe Zheng,Dingjie Song,Guanyu Zhou,Jun You,Jiahao Zhan,Xuran Ma,Xinyuan Song,Ser-Nam Lim,Qifeng Chen,Harry Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes LLMs' limitations in generating emotionally rich movie scripts, introduces CML-Bench for quality assessment across three dimensions, and proposes CML-Instruction to improve LLM-generated screenplays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs generate structurally organized texts but lack the nuanced storytelling and emotional depth required for compelling movie scripts, failing to capture the 'soul' of cinema.

Method: Created CML-Dataset from authentic movie scripts, identified three quality dimensions (Dialogue Coherence, Character Consistency, Plot Reasonableness), developed CML-Bench metrics, and introduced CML-Instruction prompting strategy.

Result: CML-Bench effectively distinguishes human-written scripts from LLM-generated ones and identifies LLM weaknesses. CML-Instruction helps LLMs generate higher-quality screenplays that align with human preferences.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark and instruction strategy successfully address LLMs' deficiencies in cinematic script generation, enabling better assessment and improvement of screenplay quality.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
generating highly structured texts. However, while exhibiting a high degree of
structural organization, movie scripts demand an additional layer of nuanced
storytelling and emotional depth-the 'soul' of compelling cinema-that LLMs
often fail to capture. To investigate this deficiency, we first curated
CML-Dataset, a dataset comprising (summary, content) pairs for Cinematic Markup
Language (CML), where 'content' consists of segments from esteemed,
high-quality movie scripts and 'summary' is a concise description of the
content. Through an in-depth analysis of the intrinsic multi-shot continuity
and narrative structures within these authentic scripts, we identified three
pivotal dimensions for quality assessment: Dialogue Coherence (DC), Character
Consistency (CC), and Plot Reasonableness (PR). Informed by these findings, we
propose the CML-Bench, featuring quantitative metrics across these dimensions.
CML-Bench effectively assigns high scores to well-crafted, human-written
scripts while concurrently pinpointing the weaknesses in screenplays generated
by LLMs. To further validate our benchmark, we introduce CML-Instruction, a
prompting strategy with detailed instructions on character dialogue and event
logic, to guide LLMs to generate more structured and cinematically sound
scripts. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our benchmark and
demonstrate that LLMs guided by CML-Instruction generate higher-quality
screenplays, with results aligned with human preferences.

### [3] [User to Video: A Model for Spammer Detection Inspired by Video Classification Technology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06233)
*Haoyang Zhang,Zhou Yang,Yucai Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UVSD is a spammer detection model that treats user behavior as video frames, using pixelization and video classification techniques to identify spammers with improved performance on social media datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is inspired by video classification technology, aiming to detect spammers by viewing user behavior patterns as video sequences rather than static data.

Method: Proposes UVSD model with three main steps: 1) user2piexl algorithm for pixelizing users with RGB values representing stances, 2) behavior2image algorithm transforming behavior subspace into frame images using representation learning and diffusion algorithms, 3) constructing behavior videos and applying video classification.

Result: Experiments on WEIBO and TWITTER datasets show UVSD outperforms state-of-the-art spammer detection methods.

Conclusion: The video-based approach to spammer detection by treating user behavior as temporal video sequences proves effective and achieves superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: This article is inspired by video classification technology. If the user
behavior subspace is viewed as a frame image, consecutive frame images are
viewed as a video. Following this novel idea, a model for spammer detection
based on user videoization, called UVSD, is proposed. Firstly, a user2piexl
algorithm for user pixelization is proposed. Considering the adversarial
behavior of user stances, the user is viewed as a pixel, and the stance is
quantified as the pixel's RGB. Secondly, a behavior2image algorithm is proposed
for transforming user behavior subspace into frame images. Low-rank dense
vectorization of subspace user relations is performed using representation
learning, while cutting and diffusion algorithms are introduced to complete the
frame imageization. Finally, user behavior videos are constructed based on
temporal features. Subsequently, a video classification algorithm is combined
to identify the spammers. Experiments using publicly available datasets, i.e.,
WEIBO and TWITTER, show an advantage of the UVSD model over state-of-the-art
methods.

### [4] [Uncertainty Quantification In Surface Landmines and UXO Classification Using MC Dropout](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06238)
*Sagar Lekhak,Emmett J. Ientilucci,Dimah Dera,Susmita Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes using Monte Carlo Dropout with ResNet-50 for uncertainty quantification in surface landmine/UXO detection, showing improved reliability under noisy and adversarial conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deterministic neural networks for landmine detection are vulnerable to noise and adversarial attacks, leading to missed detections and misclassifications in humanitarian demining operations.

Method: Integrated Monte Carlo Dropout into a fine-tuned ResNet-50 architecture for surface landmine/UXO classification, tested on simulated datasets under clean, noisy, and adversarial conditions.

Result: The model successfully flagged unreliable predictions under challenging conditions, demonstrating the value of uncertainty quantification for making more informed decisions in demining operations.

Conclusion: This proof-of-concept highlights the need for uncertainty quantification in demining, raises awareness about neural network vulnerabilities to adversarial threats, and emphasizes developing more robust models for practical applications.

Abstract: Detecting surface landmines and unexploded ordnances (UXOs) using deep
learning has shown promise in humanitarian demining. However, deterministic
neural networks can be vulnerable to noisy conditions and adversarial attacks,
leading to missed detection or misclassification. This study introduces the
idea of uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout, integrated
into a fine-tuned ResNet-50 architecture for surface landmine and UXO
classification, which was tested on a simulated dataset. Integrating the MC
Dropout approach helps quantify epistemic uncertainty, providing an additional
metric for prediction reliability, which could be helpful to make more informed
decisions in demining operations. Experimental results on clean, adversarially
perturbed, and noisy test images demonstrate the model's ability to flag
unreliable predictions under challenging conditions. This proof-of-concept
study highlights the need for uncertainty quantification in demining, raises
awareness about the vulnerability of existing neural networks in demining to
adversarial threats, and emphasizes the importance of developing more robust
and reliable models for practical applications.

### [5] [multimodars: A Rust-powered toolkit for multi-modality cardiac image fusion and registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06241)
*Anselm W. Stark,Marc Ilic,Ali Mokhtari,Pooya Mohammadi Kazaj,Christoph Graeni,Isaac Shiri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: multimodars is an open toolkit for deterministic fusion of intravascular imaging and CCTA data, enabling multi-state coronary analysis with high performance and pipeline integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack an open, flexible toolkit for multi-state coronary analysis that combines high-resolution intravascular imaging with 3D CCTA context while offering deterministic behavior and easy integration.

Method: Uses deterministic alignment algorithms, a compact NumPy-centered data model, and an optimized Rust backend for scalable performance. Accepts CSV/NumPy inputs including AIVUS-CAA formats.

Result: Provides a solution for reproducible multi-state coronary analysis combining complementary imaging modalities with deterministic behavior and high performance.

Conclusion: multimodars fills the gap for open, flexible coronary imaging fusion toolkit suitable for scalable, reproducible experiments across different physiological states.

Abstract: Combining complementary imaging modalities is critical to build reliable 3D
coronary models: intravascular imaging gives sub-millimetre resolution but
limited whole-vessel context, while CCTA supplies 3D geometry but suffers from
limited spatial resolution and artefacts (e.g., blooming). Prior work
demonstrated intravascular/CCTA fusion, yet no open, flexible toolkit is
tailored for multi-state analysis (rest/stress, pre-/post-stenting) while
offering deterministic behaviour, high performance, and easy pipeline
integration. multimodars addresses this gap with deterministic alignment
algorithms, a compact NumPy-centred data model, and an optimised Rust backend
suitable for scalable, reproducible experiments. The package accepts CSV/NumPy
inputs including data formats produced by the AIVUS-CAA software

### [6] [Does Physics Knowledge Emerge in Frontier Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06251)
*Ieva Bagdonaviciute,Vibhav Vineet*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs show strong visual perception but struggle with physical dynamics understanding, with weak correlation between diagnostic skills and evaluation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To benchmark VLMs' ability to understand and predict physical dynamics, as current models show strong visual perception but unclear physics reasoning capabilities.

Method: Benchmark six frontier VLMs on three physical simulation datasets (CLEVRER, Physion, Physion++) with diagnostic subtests isolating perception from physics reasoning.

Result: Weak correlations found between diagnostic performance and evaluation accuracy - models excelling at perception or physics reasoning don't consistently perform better on predictive or counterfactual tasks.

Conclusion: Current VLMs have fragmented perceptual and physics skills that fail to combine into causal understanding, highlighting the need for architectures that better integrate perception and reasoning.

Abstract: Leading Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show strong results in visual
perception and general reasoning, but their ability to understand and predict
physical dynamics remains unclear. We benchmark six frontier VLMs on three
physical simulation datasets - CLEVRER, Physion, and Physion++ - where the
evaluation tasks test whether a model can predict outcomes or hypothesize about
alternative situations. To probe deeper, we design diagnostic subtests that
isolate perception (objects, colors, occluders) from physics reasoning (motion
prediction, spatial relations). Intuitively, stronger diagnostic performance
should support higher evaluation accuracy. Yet our analysis reveals weak
correlations: models that excel at perception or physics reasoning do not
consistently perform better on predictive or counterfactual evaluation. This
counterintuitive gap exposes a central limitation of current VLMs: perceptual
and physics skills remain fragmented and fail to combine into causal
understanding, underscoring the need for architectures that bind perception and
reasoning more tightly.

### [7] [Enhanced Self-Distillation Framework for Efficient Spiking Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06254)
*Xiaochen Zhao,Chengting Yu,Kairong Yu,Lei Liu,Aili Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Enhanced self-distillation framework for SNNs that reduces training complexity while achieving high performance by projecting SNN firing rates onto ANN branches and using reliable self-generated knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional SNN training methods lag behind ANNs in performance and incur significant computational/memory overheads that grow linearly with temporal dimension, making high-performance SNN training challenging under limited resources.

Method: Joint optimization of enhanced self-distillation with rate-based backpropagation, where SNN firing rates are projected onto lightweight ANN branches, and only reliable self-generated knowledge components are used to guide optimization through ANN pathways.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CIFAR10-DVS, and ImageNet demonstrate reduced training complexity while achieving high-performance SNN training.

Conclusion: The proposed enhanced self-distillation framework enables efficient and high-performance SNN training by addressing the limitations of traditional self-distillation and conventional SNN training methods.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) exhibit exceptional energy efficiency on
neuromorphic hardware due to their sparse activation patterns. However,
conventional training methods based on surrogate gradients and Backpropagation
Through Time (BPTT) not only lag behind Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in
performance, but also incur significant computational and memory overheads that
grow linearly with the temporal dimension. To enable high-performance SNN
training under limited computational resources, we propose an enhanced
self-distillation framework, jointly optimized with rate-based backpropagation.
Specifically, the firing rates of intermediate SNN layers are projected onto
lightweight ANN branches, and high-quality knowledge generated by the model
itself is used to optimize substructures through the ANN pathways. Unlike
traditional self-distillation paradigms, we observe that low-quality
self-generated knowledge may hinder convergence. To address this, we decouple
the teacher signal into reliable and unreliable components, ensuring that only
reliable knowledge is used to guide the optimization of the model. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CIFAR10-DVS, and ImageNet demonstrate that
our method reduces training complexity while achieving high-performance SNN
training. Our code is available at

### [8] [Ensemble Deep Learning and LLM-Assisted Reporting for Automated Skin Lesion Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06260)
*Sher Khan,Raz Muhammad,Adil Hussain,Muhammad Sajjad,Muhammad Rashid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified AI framework for dermatological diagnostics combining heterogeneous CNN ensembles with integrated LLM capabilities to improve diagnostic reliability and patient communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in current dermatological diagnostics including inter-observer variability, access disparities, dataset biases across skin tones, and fragmented AI approaches that treat NLP as separate from clinical decision-making.

Method: Two synergistic innovations: 1) A heterogeneous ensemble of architecturally diverse CNNs with intrinsic uncertainty mechanisms for flagging discordant cases, and 2) Embedding LLM capabilities directly into diagnostic workflow to transform classifications into clinically meaningful assessments and structured reports.

Result: The framework generates structured reports with precise lesion characterization, accessible diagnostic reasoning, and actionable monitoring guidance, bridging the translational gap between AI implementation and clinical impact.

Conclusion: This approach represents a significant advancement toward deployable dermatological AI that enhances diagnostic precision while supporting the continuum of care from detection through patient education, ultimately improving early intervention rates for skin lesions.

Abstract: Cutaneous malignancies demand early detection for favorable outcomes, yet
current diagnostics suffer from inter-observer variability and access
disparities. While AI shows promise, existing dermatological systems are
limited by homogeneous architectures, dataset biases across skin tones, and
fragmented approaches that treat natural language processing as separate
post-hoc explanations rather than integral to clinical decision-making. We
introduce a unified framework that fundamentally reimagines AI integration for
dermatological diagnostics through two synergistic innovations. First, a
purposefully heterogeneous ensemble of architecturally diverse convolutional
neural networks provides complementary diagnostic perspectives, with an
intrinsic uncertainty mechanism flagging discordant cases for specialist review
-- mimicking clinical best practices. Second, we embed large language model
capabilities directly into the diagnostic workflow, transforming classification
outputs into clinically meaningful assessments that simultaneously fulfill
medical documentation requirements and deliver patient-centered education. This
seamless integration generates structured reports featuring precise lesion
characterization, accessible diagnostic reasoning, and actionable monitoring
guidance -- empowering patients to recognize early warning signs between
visits. By addressing both diagnostic reliability and communication barriers
within a single cohesive system, our approach bridges the critical
translational gap that has prevented previous AI implementations from achieving
clinical impact. The framework represents a significant advancement toward
deployable dermatological AI that enhances diagnostic precision while actively
supporting the continuum of care from initial detection through patient
education, ultimately improving early intervention rates for skin lesions.

### [9] [Vision Transformer for Transient Noise Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06273)
*Divyansh Srivastava,Andrzej Niedzielski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper uses Vision Transformer (ViT) to classify transient noise (glitches) in LIGO gravitational wave data into 22 existing classes plus 2 new classes from O3a run, achieving 92.26% classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transient noise (glitches) in LIGO data hinders gravitational wave detection, and with the O3 run adding two new noise classes, there's a need to train new models for effective classification.

Method: Train a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT-B/32) model on a combined dataset consisting of the Gravity Spy dataset with the additional two classes from the LIGO O3a run.

Result: Achieved a classification efficiency of 92.26%, demonstrating the potential of Vision Transformer to improve gravitational wave detection accuracy.

Conclusion: Vision Transformer effectively distinguishes transient noise in LIGO data, showing promise for improving gravitational wave detection by accurately classifying various noise events.

Abstract: Transient noise (glitches) in LIGO data hinders the detection of
gravitational waves (GW). The Gravity Spy project has categorized these noise
events into various classes. With the O3 run, there is the inclusion of two
additional noise classes and thus a need to train new models for effective
classification. We aim to classify glitches in LIGO data into 22 existing
classes from the first run plus 2 additional noise classes from O3a using the
Vision Transformer (ViT) model. We train a pre-trained Vision Transformer
(ViT-B/32) model on a combined dataset consisting of the Gravity Spy dataset
with the additional two classes from the LIGO O3a run. We achieve a
classification efficiency of 92.26%, demonstrating the potential of Vision
Transformer to improve the accuracy of gravitational wave detection by
effectively distinguishing transient noise.

### [10] [General and Efficient Visual Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning using Object-Agnostic Masks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06277)
*Fahim Shahriar,Cheryl Wang,Alireza Azimi,Gautham Vasan,Hany Hamed Elanwar,A. Rupam Mahmood,Colin Bellinger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A mask-based goal representation system for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning that provides object-agnostic visual cues, enabling efficient learning and superior generalization without requiring positional information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing goal representation methods in GCRL (target state images, 3D coordinates, one-hot vectors) suffer from poor generalization to unseen objects, slow convergence, and dependency on special cameras.

Method: Proposed mask-based goal representation that provides object-agnostic visual cues, can be processed for dense rewards without distance calculations, and utilizes pretrained open vocabulary object detection models for mask generation.

Result: Achieved 99.9% reaching accuracy on both training and unseen test objects, successfully performed pick-up tasks with high accuracy without positional information, and demonstrated learning from scratch and sim-to-real transfer on physical robots.

Conclusion: The mask-based goal representation system enables efficient learning, superior generalization, and practical deployment in real-world robotic applications without the limitations of traditional goal representation methods.

Abstract: Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) allows agents to learn diverse
objectives using a unified policy. The success of GCRL, however, is contingent
on the choice of goal representation. In this work, we propose a mask-based
goal representation system that provides object-agnostic visual cues to the
agent, enabling efficient learning and superior generalization. In contrast,
existing goal representation methods, such as target state images, 3D
coordinates, and one-hot vectors, face issues of poor generalization to unseen
objects, slow convergence, and the need for special cameras. Masks can be
processed to generate dense rewards without requiring error-prone distance
calculations. Learning with ground truth masks in simulation, we achieved 99.9%
reaching accuracy on training and unseen test objects. Our proposed method can
be utilized to perform pick-up tasks with high accuracy, without using any
positional information of the target. Moreover, we demonstrate learning from
scratch and sim-to-real transfer applications using two different physical
robots, utilizing pretrained open vocabulary object detection models for mask
generation.

### [11] [Improving the Spatial Resolution of GONG Solar Images to GST Quality Using Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06281)
*Chenyang Li,Qin Li,Haimin Wang,Bo Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAN-based super-resolution approach to enhance low-resolution full-disk Hα solar images from GONG to match high-resolution quality from BBSO/GST, achieving significant improvement in resolving fine solar features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution solar imaging is essential for capturing fine-scale dynamic features like filaments and fibrils, but current full-disk Hα images have limited spatial resolution that cannot resolve these small-scale structures.

Method: Used Real-ESRGAN with Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks and a relativistic discriminator, carefully aligning GONG-GST image pairs for training the super-resolution model.

Result: The model effectively recovers fine details in sunspot penumbrae and resolves filaments and fibrils, achieving MSE of 467.15, RMSE of 21.59, and cross-correlation of 0.7794.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enhances solar image resolution, though slight misalignments between image pairs limit quantitative performance, with plans to address this and expand the dataset for further improvements.

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) solar imaging is crucial for capturing fine-scale
dynamic features such as filaments and fibrils. However, the spatial resolution
of the full-disk H$\alpha$ images is limited and insufficient to resolve these
small-scale structures. To address this, we propose a GAN-based superresolution
approach to enhance low-resolution (LR) full-disk H$\alpha$ images from the
Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) to a quality comparable with HR
observations from the Big Bear Solar Observatory/Goode Solar Telescope
(BBSO/GST). We employ Real-ESRGAN with Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks and a
relativistic discriminator. We carefully aligned GONG-GST pairs. The model
effectively recovers fine details within sunspot penumbrae and resolves fine
details in filaments and fibrils, achieving an average mean squared error (MSE)
of 467.15, root mean squared error (RMSE) of 21.59, and cross-correlation (CC)
of 0.7794. Slight misalignments between image pairs limit quantitative
performance, which we plan to address in future work alongside dataset
expansion to further improve reconstruction quality.

### [12] [ChainMPQ: Interleaved Text-Image Reasoning Chains for Mitigating Relation Hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06292)
*Yike Wu,Yiwei Wang,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChainMPQ is a training-free method that reduces relation hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models by using multi-perspective questions and interleaved chains of images and text to improve relational reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Relation hallucinations account for the largest proportion among three categories of hallucinations in LVLMs but have received the least attention, hindering model reliability.

Method: ChainMPQ extracts subject/object keywords to enhance image regions, constructs multi-perspective questions focusing on subject, object, and relation components, and uses sequential input with accumulated textual/visual memories to guide progressive relational reasoning.

Result: Experiments on multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show ChainMPQ substantially reduces relation hallucinations, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of its three core modules.

Conclusion: ChainMPQ effectively addresses relation hallucinations in LVLMs through multi-perspective questioning and interleaved chain reasoning, improving model reliability without requiring additional training.

Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance in
multimodal tasks, hallucinations continue to hinder their reliability. Among
the three categories of hallucinations, which include object, attribute, and
relation, relation hallucinations account for the largest proportion but have
received the least attention. To address this issue, we propose ChainMPQ
(Multi-Perspective Questions guided Interleaved Chain of Image and Text), a
training-free method that improves relational inference in LVLMs by utilizing
accumulated textual and visual memories. ChainMPQ first extracts subject and
object keywords from the question to enhance the corresponding image regions.
It then constructs multi-perspective questions that focus on the three core
components of a relationship: the subject, the object, and the relation that
links them. These questions are sequentially input to the model, with textual
and visual memories from earlier steps providing supporting context for
subsequent ones, thereby forming an interleaved chain of images and text that
guides progressive relational reasoning. Experiments on multiple LVLMs and
benchmarks show that ChainMPQ substantially reduces relation hallucinations,
while ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of its three core
modules.

*Young D. Kwon,Abhinav Mehrotra,Malcolm Chadwick,Alberto Gil Ramos,Sourav Bhattacharya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MobilePicasso enables efficient 4K image editing on mobile devices using a three-stage approach that reduces hallucinations and improves quality while maintaining low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for image editing face memory and quality challenges on resource-constrained mobile devices, making high-resolution editing difficult to deploy.

Method: Three-stage system: (1) image editing at standard resolution with hallucination-aware loss, (2) latent projection to avoid pixel space conversion, (3) upscaling with adaptive context-preserving tiling.

Result: Improves image quality by 18-48%, reduces hallucinations by 14-51%, achieves up to 55.8× speed-up with only 9% memory increase, and runs faster on-device than server-based models on A100 GPU.

Conclusion: MobilePicasso successfully enables efficient high-resolution image editing on mobile devices with superior performance and minimal resource requirements.

Abstract: High-resolution (4K) image-to-image synthesis has become increasingly
important for mobile applications. Existing diffusion models for image editing
face significant challenges, in terms of memory and image quality, when
deployed on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present
MobilePicasso, a novel system that enables efficient image editing at high
resolutions, while minimising computational cost and memory usage.
MobilePicasso comprises three stages: (i) performing image editing at a
standard resolution with hallucination-aware loss, (ii) applying latent
projection to overcome going to the pixel space, and (iii) upscaling the edited
image latent to a higher resolution with adaptive context-preserving tiling.
Our user study with 46 participants reveals that MobilePicasso not only
improves image quality by 18-48% but reduces hallucinations by 14-51% over
existing methods. MobilePicasso demonstrates significantly lower latency, e.g.,
up to 55.8$\times$ speed-up, yet with a small increase in runtime memory, e.g.,
a mere 9% increase over prior work. Surprisingly, the on-device runtime of
MobilePicasso is observed to be faster than a server-based high-resolution
image editing model running on an A100 GPU.

*Tobias J. Bauer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Implementation of an AI-based Gaze Tracking system using RGBD images with Transformer-based feature fusion, achieving competitive results on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the novel combination of RGBD input images and Transformers for gaze tracking, which hasn't been investigated before, and to create a new dataset suitable for Gaze Angle Estimation since existing datasets lack depth information or appropriate labels.

Method: Uses RGBD images with Transformer architecture for feature fusion, based on Lian et al.'s GAN-based approach for depth map artifact removal and head pose feature extraction. Experiments include configurations with/without Transformer modules and MLP replacements.

Result: On ShanghaiTechGaze+: Transformer model achieved 55.3mm mean Euclidean error, while no pre-trained GAN module achieved 30.1mm, and MLP replacement improved to 26.9mm. On ETH-XGaze: Transformer module achieved 3.59° mean angular error, without Transformer 3.26°, compared to baseline 2.04°. Results were consistent across datasets.

Conclusion: The Transformer-based feature fusion approach shows promise for RGBD gaze tracking, though simpler architectures (MLP) can outperform Transformers in some configurations. The method provides competitive performance while exploring novel RGBD-Transformer combinations.

Abstract: Subject of this thesis is the implementation of an AI-based Gaze Tracking
system using RGBD images that contain both color (RGB) and depth (D)
information. To fuse the features extracted from the images, a module based on
the Transformer architecture is used. The combination of RGBD input images and
Transformers was chosen because it has not yet been investigated. Furthermore,
a new dataset is created for training the AI models as existing datasets either
do not contain depth information or only contain labels for Gaze Point
Estimation that are not suitable for the task of Gaze Angle Estimation. Various
model configurations are trained, validated and evaluated on a total of three
different datasets. The trained models are then to be used in a real-time
pipeline to estimate the gaze direction and thus the gaze point of a person in
front of a computer screen. The AI model architecture used in this thesis is
based on an earlier work by Lian et al. It uses a Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) to simultaneously remove depth map artifacts and extract head
pose features. Lian et al. achieve a mean Euclidean error of 38.7mm on their
own dataset ShanghaiTechGaze+. In this thesis, a model architecture with a
Transformer module for feature fusion achieves a mean Euclidean error of 55.3mm
on the same dataset, but we show that using no pre-trained GAN module leads to
a mean Euclidean error of 30.1mm. Replacing the Transformer module with a
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) improves the error to 26.9mm. These results are
coherent with the ones on the other two datasets. On the ETH-XGaze dataset, the
model with Transformer module achieves a mean angular error of 3.59{\deg} and
without Transformer module 3.26{\deg}, whereas the fundamentally different
model architecture used by the dataset authors Zhang et al. achieves a mean
angular error of 2.04{\deg}. On the OTH-Gaze-Estimation dataset created for...

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework that fuses GEDI lidar with SAR data to produce global, high-resolution (25m) maps of forest structural complexity, achieving high accuracy (R²=0.82) with minimal computational requirements.


<details>

Motivation: Spaceborne lidar from GEDI provides valuable forest structural data but has sparse sampling that limits continuous high-resolution mapping capabilities.

Method: Adapted EfficientNetV2 architecture trained on 130+ million GEDI footprints, fused with multimodal SAR datasets to create wall-to-wall forest structural complexity maps.

Result: Achieved global R²=0.82 with fewer than 400,000 parameters, enabling processing at any scale without specialized computing infrastructure. Produced accurate predictions with calibrated uncertainty across biomes and time periods.

Conclusion: This scalable framework supports continuous multi-temporal monitoring of global forest structural dynamics and provides tools for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management in a changing climate.

Abstract: Forest structural complexity metrics integrate multiple canopy attributes
into a single value that reflects habitat quality and ecosystem function.
Spaceborne lidar from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) has
enabled mapping of structural complexity in temperate and tropical forests, but
its sparse sampling limits continuous high-resolution mapping. We present a
scalable, deep learning framework fusing GEDI observations with multimodal
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) datasets to produce global, high-resolution (25
m) wall-to-wall maps of forest structural complexity. Our adapted
EfficientNetV2 architecture, trained on over 130 million GEDI footprints,
achieves high performance (global R2 = 0.82) with fewer than 400,000
parameters, making it an accessible tool that enables researchers to process
datasets at any scale without requiring specialized computing infrastructure.
The model produces accurate predictions with calibrated uncertainty estimates
across biomes and time periods, preserving fine-scale spatial patterns. It has
been used to generate a global, multi-temporal dataset of forest structural
complexity from 2015 to 2022. Through transfer learning, this framework can be
extended to predict additional forest structural variables with minimal
computational cost. This approach supports continuous, multi-temporal
monitoring of global forest structural dynamics and provides tools for
biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management efforts in a changing
climate.

*Allen Tu,Kartik Narayan,Joshua Gleason,Jennifer Xu,Matthew Meyn,Tom Goldstein,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TransFIRA introduces a lightweight, annotation-free framework for face image recognizability assessment that grounds recognizability directly in embedding space using class-center similarity and angular separation, achieving state-of-the-art performance without external labels or backbone-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing face image quality assessment (FIQA) methods rely on visual heuristics, curated annotations, or computationally intensive generative pipelines, leaving their predictions detached from the encoder's decision geometry and failing to predict true recognizability in unconstrained environments with extreme pose, blur, illumination, and occlusion variations.

Method: TransFIRA defines recognizability via class-center similarity (CCS) and class-center angular separation (CCAS), providing a decision-boundary-aligned criterion. It uses a recognizability-informed aggregation strategy that operates without external labels, heuristics, or backbone-specific training, and extends to encoder-grounded explainability and body recognition assessment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art verification accuracy on BRIAR and IJB-C datasets while nearly doubling correlation with true recognizability. Shows strong performance on body recognition and robustness under cross-dataset shifts. Provides interpretable insights into how degradations and subject-specific factors affect recognizability.

Conclusion: TransFIRA establishes a unified, geometry-driven framework for recognizability assessment that is encoder-specific, accurate, interpretable, and extensible across modalities, significantly advancing FIQA in accuracy, explainability, and scope.

Abstract: Face recognition in unconstrained environments such as surveillance, video,
and web imagery must contend with extreme variation in pose, blur,
illumination, and occlusion, where conventional visual quality metrics fail to
predict whether inputs are truly recognizable to the deployed encoder. Existing
FIQA methods typically rely on visual heuristics, curated annotations, or
computationally intensive generative pipelines, leaving their predictions
detached from the encoder's decision geometry. We introduce TransFIRA (Transfer
Learning for Face Image Recognizability Assessment), a lightweight and
annotation-free framework that grounds recognizability directly in embedding
space. TransFIRA delivers three advances: (i) a definition of recognizability
via class-center similarity (CCS) and class-center angular separation (CCAS),
yielding the first natural, decision-boundary--aligned criterion for filtering
and weighting; (ii) a recognizability-informed aggregation strategy that
achieves state-of-the-art verification accuracy on BRIAR and IJB-C while nearly
doubling correlation with true recognizability, all without external labels,
heuristics, or backbone-specific training; and (iii) new extensions beyond
faces, including encoder-grounded explainability that reveals how degradations
and subject-specific factors affect recognizability, and the first
recognizability-aware body recognition assessment. Experiments confirm
state-of-the-art results on faces, strong performance on body recognition, and
robustness under cross-dataset shifts. Together, these contributions establish
TransFIRA as a unified, geometry-driven framework for recognizability
assessment -- encoder-specific, accurate, interpretable, and extensible across
modalities -- significantly advancing FIQA in accuracy, explainability, and
scope.

TL;DR: NYSDOT uses machine learning to automatically classify road conditions from camera images and weather data, achieving 81.5% accuracy on unseen cameras.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for evaluating road conditions (driving on roads and observing live cameras) are labor-intensive but necessary for winter weather operational decisions. Machine learning can provide automated support.

Method: Trained convolutional neural networks and random forests on ~22,000 hand-labeled camera images classified into six road surface conditions (severe snow, snow, wet, dry, poor visibility, obstructed) combined with weather data.

Result: The weather-related road surface condition model achieved 81.5% accuracy on completely unseen cameras, with model generalizability prioritized for operational use.

Conclusion: Machine learning models can successfully automate road condition classification to support NYSDOT's operational decision-making during winter weather events.

Abstract: The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) has a network of
roadside traffic cameras that are used by both the NYSDOT and the public to
observe road conditions. The NYSDOT evaluates road conditions by driving on
roads and observing live cameras, tasks which are labor-intensive but necessary
for making critical operational decisions during winter weather events.
However, machine learning models can provide additional support for the NYSDOT
by automatically classifying current road conditions across the state. In this
study, convolutional neural networks and random forests are trained on camera
images and weather data to predict road surface conditions. Models are trained
on a hand-labeled dataset of ~22,000 camera images, each classified by human
labelers into one of six road surface conditions: severe snow, snow, wet, dry,
poor visibility, or obstructed. Model generalizability is prioritized to meet
the operational needs of the NYSDOT decision makers, and the weather-related
road surface condition model in this study achieves an accuracy of 81.5% on
completely unseen cameras.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TDiff is a patch-based diffusion framework for thermal image restoration that addresses low resolution, fixed pattern noise, and localized degradations by training on small thermal patches and restoring full-resolution images through denoising overlapping patches with smooth spatial windowing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermal images from low-cost cameras suffer from low resolution, fixed pattern noise, and localized degradations, while available thermal imaging datasets are limited in size and diversity.

Method: A patch-based diffusion framework (TDiff) that leverages the local nature of distortions by training on small thermal patches, then restores full-resolution images by denoising overlapping patches and blending them using smooth spatial windowing.

Result: Experiments on denoising, super-resolution, and deblurring demonstrate strong results on both simulated and real thermal data.

Conclusion: The method establishes a unified restoration pipeline for thermal imaging and represents the first patch-based diffusion framework that models a learned prior for thermal image restoration across multiple tasks.

Abstract: Thermal images from low-cost cameras often suffer from low resolution, fixed
pattern noise, and other localized degradations. Available datasets for thermal
imaging are also limited in both size and diversity. To address these
challenges, we propose a patch-based diffusion framework (TDiff) that leverages
the local nature of these distortions by training on small thermal patches. In
this approach, full-resolution images are restored by denoising overlapping
patches and blending them using smooth spatial windowing. To our knowledge,
this is the first patch-based diffusion framework that models a learned prior
for thermal image restoration across multiple tasks. Experiments on denoising,
super-resolution, and deblurring demonstrate strong results on both simulated

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior approaches lacked the ability to perform single-pass multi-subject identity-preserved generation with both structural and spatial constraints, and couldn't support flexible user guidance at different precision levels with a single model.

Method: The framework uses a novel synthetic dataset SIGMA-SET27K containing identity, structure, and spatial information for over 100k unique subjects across 27k images, enabling training of a unified model that handles various guidance types.

Result: SIGMA-GEN achieves state-of-the-art performance in identity preservation, image generation quality, and speed through extensive evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enables unified multi-identity preserving image generation with flexible guidance options and demonstrates superior performance across multiple metrics.

Abstract: We present SIGMA-GEN, a unified framework for multi-identity preserving image
generation. Unlike prior approaches, SIGMA-GEN is the first to enable
single-pass multi-subject identity-preserved generation guided by both

to support user guidance at various levels of precision -- from coarse 2D or 3D
boxes to pixel-level segmentations and depth -- with a single model. To enable
this, we introduce SIGMA-SET27K, a novel synthetic dataset that provides
identity, structure, and spatial information for over 100k unique subjects

*Jack Roberts,Jeova Farias Sales Rocha Neto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIGRID is a new superpixel-based data structure that encodes color and shape information to reduce input dimensionality while maintaining or improving segmentation performance compared to full-resolution images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Superpixels offer computational benefits but their irregular spatial distribution complicates deep learning approaches, undermining their original efficiency motivation. There's a need for a data structure that preserves superpixel advantages while being compatible with standard deep learning architectures.

Method: Developed SIGRID (Superpixel-Integrated Grid) using classical shape descriptors to encode both color and shape information of superpixels, significantly reducing input dimensionality while maintaining compatibility with standard convolutional segmentation architectures.

Result: On four benchmark datasets using two popular convolutional segmentation architectures, SIGRIDs matched and sometimes surpassed pixel-level representation performance while significantly accelerating model training.

Conclusion: SIGRIDs achieve a favorable balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating that superpixel-based representations can be effectively integrated with standard deep learning architectures without compromising performance.

Abstract: Superpixels have long been used in image simplification to enable more
efficient data processing and storage. However, despite their computational
potential, their irregular spatial distribution has often forced deep learning
approaches to rely on specialized training algorithms and architectures,
undermining the original motivation for superpixelations. In this work, we
introduce a new superpixel-based data structure, SIGRID (Superpixel-Integrated
Grid), as an alternative to full-resolution images in segmentation tasks. By
leveraging classical shape descriptors, SIGRID encodes both color and shape
information of superpixels while substantially reducing input dimensionality.
We evaluate SIGRIDs on four benchmark datasets using two popular convolutional
segmentation architectures. Our results show that, despite compressing the
original data, SIGRIDs not only match but in some cases surpass the performance
of pixel-level representations, all while significantly accelerating model
training. This demonstrates that SIGRIDs achieve a favorable balance between
accuracy and computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Text2Interact framework generates realistic human-human interactions from text using InterCompose for scalable data synthesis and InterActor for fine-grained text-to-interaction modeling with word-level conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with realistic human-human interaction modeling due to limited two-person training data and coarse text conditioning that collapses rich prompts into single embeddings.

Method: Two main components: 1) InterCompose - scalable synthesis-by-composition pipeline using LLM-generated descriptions with single-person motion priors; 2) InterActor - text-to-interaction model with word-level conditioning and adaptive interaction loss for better spatiotemporal coordination.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent improvements in motion diversity, fidelity, and generalization, including successful performance on out-of-distribution scenarios and positive user study results.

Conclusion: The proposed Text2Interact framework effectively addresses limitations in human-human interaction modeling through scalable data synthesis and fine-grained text conditioning, enabling realistic and text-aligned interaction generation.

Abstract: Modeling human-human interactions from text remains challenging because it
requires not only realistic individual dynamics but also precise,
text-consistent spatiotemporal coupling between agents. Currently, progress is
hindered by 1) limited two-person training data, inadequate to capture the
diverse intricacies of two-person interactions; and 2) insufficiently
fine-grained text-to-interaction modeling, where language conditioning
collapses rich, structured prompts into a single sentence embedding. To address
these limitations, we propose our Text2Interact framework, designed to generate
realistic, text-aligned human-human interactions through a scalable
high-fidelity interaction data synthesizer and an effective spatiotemporal
coordination pipeline. First, we present InterCompose, a scalable
synthesis-by-composition pipeline that aligns LLM-generated interaction
descriptions with strong single-person motion priors. Given a prompt and a
motion for an agent, InterCompose retrieves candidate single-person motions,
trains a conditional reaction generator for another agent, and uses a neural
motion evaluator to filter weak or misaligned samples-expanding interaction
coverage without extra capture. Second, we propose InterActor, a
text-to-interaction model with word-level conditioning that preserves
token-level cues (initiation, response, contact ordering) and an adaptive
interaction loss that emphasizes contextually relevant inter-person joint
pairs, improving coupling and physical plausibility for fine-grained
interaction modeling. Extensive experiments show consistent gains in motion
diversity, fidelity, and generalization, including out-of-distribution
scenarios and user studies. We will release code and models to facilitate
reproducibility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KeyScore is a multimodal frame scoring framework that selects informative frames from videos by combining semantic similarity, temporal diversity, and contextual drop impact, achieving 99% frame reduction while outperforming standard methods on video-language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient video-language understanding requires selecting a small set of frames that retain semantic and contextual information from long videos, as processing all frames is computationally expensive.

Method: Proposes KeyScore for frame importance estimation using multimodal alignment, and STACFP for generating diverse frame proposals through spatio-temporal adaptive clustering.

Result: Achieves up to 99% frame reduction compared to full-frame inference and substantially outperforms standard 8-frame encoders on MSRVTT, MSVD, and DiDeMo benchmarks.

Conclusion: Emphasizing multimodal alignment between visual and textual signals enables scalable, efficient, and caption-grounded video understanding without explicit video summarization.

Abstract: Efficient video-language understanding requires selecting a small set of
frames that retain semantic and contextual information from long videos. We
propose KeyScore, a multimodal frame scoring framework that jointly leverages
captions and visual context to estimate frame-level importance. By combining
semantic similarity, temporal diversity, and contextual drop impact, KeyScore
identifies the most informative frames for downstream tasks such as retrieval,
captioning, and video-language reasoning. To complement KeyScore, we introduce
STACFP (Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Clustering for Frame Proposals), which
generates compact and diverse frame candidates for long-form videos. Together,
these modules achieve up to 99\% frame reduction compared to full-frame
inference and substantially outperform standard 8-frame encoders on MSRVTT,
MSVD, and DiDeMo. Our results demonstrate that emphasizing multimodal alignment
between visual and textual signals enables scalable, efficient, and
caption-grounded video understanding -- without explicit video summarization.

*Fei Zhang,Rob Chancia,Josie Clapp,Amirhossein Hassanzadeh,Dimah Dera,Richard MacKenzie,Jan van Aardt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A semi-automated pipeline for TLS point cloud segmentation that reduces manual annotation through spherical projection, feature enrichment, ensemble learning, and uncertainty-aware labeling guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) point clouds is costly and time-consuming, limiting accurate semantic segmentation for ecological monitoring applications like mangrove forests.

Method: Projects 3D points to 2D spherical grid, enriches with multi-source features, trains ensemble networks for pseudo-labels and uncertainty maps, back-projects to 3D, and provides visualization tools for reviewer guidance.

Result: Performance saturates after ~12 annotated scans, geometric features contribute most, compact 9-channel feature stacks achieve mIoU of ~0.76, and method generalizes across datasets.

Conclusion: The pipeline enables scalable, high-quality TLS segmentation with reduced annotation effort, demonstrated through the Mangrove3D dataset and cross-dataset validation.

Abstract: Accurate semantic segmentation of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) point
clouds is limited by costly manual annotation. We propose a semi-automated,
uncertainty-aware pipeline that integrates spherical projection, feature
enrichment, ensemble learning, and targeted annotation to reduce labeling
effort, while sustaining high accuracy. Our approach projects 3D points to a 2D
spherical grid, enriches pixels with multi-source features, and trains an
ensemble of segmentation networks to produce pseudo-labels and uncertainty
maps, the latter guiding annotation of ambiguous regions. The 2D outputs are
back-projected to 3D, yielding densely annotated point clouds supported by a
three-tier visualization suite (2D feature maps, 3D colorized point clouds, and
compact virtual spheres) for rapid triage and reviewer guidance. Using this
pipeline, we build Mangrove3D, a semantic segmentation TLS dataset for mangrove
forests. We further evaluate data efficiency and feature importance to address
two key questions: (1) how much annotated data are needed and (2) which
features matter most. Results show that performance saturates after ~12
annotated scans, geometric features contribute the most, and compact
nine-channel stacks capture nearly all discriminative power, with the mean
Intersection over Union (mIoU) plateauing at around 0.76. Finally, we confirm
the generalization of our feature-enrichment strategy through cross-dataset
tests on ForestSemantic and Semantic3D.
  Our contributions include: (i) a robust, uncertainty-aware TLS annotation
pipeline with visualization tools; (ii) the Mangrove3D dataset; and (iii)
empirical guidance on data efficiency and feature importance, thus enabling
scalable, high-quality segmentation of TLS point clouds for ecological
monitoring and beyond. The dataset and processing scripts are publicly

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces STOPs (Scores for Temporal Properties) to lift local detection scores from neural models to temporal properties over sequences, and proposes LogSTOP for efficient computation of these scores using Linear Temporal Logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable downstream applications like query matching and ranked retrieval that require reasoning about temporal properties in sequences (videos/audio), rather than just individual frame-level detections.

Method: Proposes LogSTOP scoring function that efficiently computes temporal property scores from noisy local predictors using Linear Temporal Logic representations.

Result: LogSTOP outperforms Large Vision/Audio Language Models and other Temporal Logic baselines by at least 16% on query matching, and achieves 19% and 16% improvements in mean average precision and recall on ranked retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: LogSTOP provides an effective framework for scoring temporal properties over sequences using local neural model detections, significantly outperforming existing approaches for temporal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Neural models such as YOLO and HuBERT can be used to detect local properties
such as objects ("car") and emotions ("angry") in individual frames of videos
and audio clips respectively. The likelihood of these detections is indicated
by scores in [0, 1]. Lifting these scores to temporal properties over sequences
can be useful for several downstream applications such as query matching (e.g.,
"does the speaker eventually sound happy in this audio clip?"), and ranked
retrieval (e.g., "retrieve top 5 videos with a 10 second scene where a car is
detected until a pedestrian is detected"). In this work, we formalize this
problem of assigning Scores for TempOral Properties (STOPs) over sequences,
given potentially noisy score predictors for local properties. We then propose
a scoring function called LogSTOP that can efficiently compute these scores for
temporal properties represented in Linear Temporal Logic. Empirically, LogSTOP,
with YOLO and HuBERT, outperforms Large Vision / Audio Language Models and
other Temporal Logic-based baselines by at least 16% on query matching with
temporal properties over objects-in-videos and emotions-in-speech respectively.
Similarly, on ranked retrieval with temporal properties over objects and
actions in videos, LogSTOP with Grounding DINO and SlowR50 reports at least a
19% and 16% increase in mean average precision and recall over zero-shot
text-to-video retrieval baselines respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HARP-NeXt is a high-speed LiDAR semantic segmentation network that achieves superior speed-accuracy trade-off by introducing efficient pre-processing, Conv-SE-NeXt feature extraction, and multi-scale range-point fusion, running 24× faster than top methods without test-time augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LiDAR segmentation methods face trade-offs between accuracy and speed - point-based/sparse convolution methods are accurate but slow, while projection-based methods are faster but lose geometric information. Test-time augmentation and pre-processing overhead further slow inference on embedded systems.

Method: Proposes novel pre-processing to reduce computational overhead, Conv-SE-NeXt feature extraction blocks for efficient representation capture without deep stacking, and multi-scale range-point fusion backbone to preserve geometric details at multiple abstraction levels.

Result: Achieves superior speed-accuracy trade-off on nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks, comparable to top-ranked PTv3 while running 24× faster, without relying on ensemble models or test-time augmentation.

Conclusion: HARP-NeXt provides an effective solution for real-time LiDAR semantic segmentation on resource-constrained platforms, balancing high accuracy with significantly improved inference speed through optimized pre-processing and efficient architecture design.

Abstract: LiDAR semantic segmentation is crucial for autonomous vehicles and mobile
robots, requiring high accuracy and real-time processing, especially on
resource-constrained embedded systems. Previous state-of-the-art methods often
face a trade-off between accuracy and speed. Point-based and sparse
convolution-based methods are accurate but slow due to the complexity of
neighbor searching and 3D convolutions. Projection-based methods are faster but
lose critical geometric information during the 2D projection. Additionally,
many recent methods rely on test-time augmentation (TTA) to improve
performance, which further slows the inference. Moreover, the pre-processing
phase across all methods increases execution time and is demanding on embedded
platforms. Therefore, we introduce HARP-NeXt, a high-speed and accurate LiDAR
semantic segmentation network. We first propose a novel pre-processing
methodology that significantly reduces computational overhead. Then, we design
the Conv-SE-NeXt feature extraction block to efficiently capture
representations without deep layer stacking per network stage. We also employ a
multi-scale range-point fusion backbone that leverages information at multiple
abstraction levels to preserve essential geometric details, thereby enhancing
accuracy. Experiments on the nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks show that
HARP-NeXt achieves a superior speed-accuracy trade-off compared to all
state-of-the-art methods, and, without relying on ensemble models or TTA, is
comparable to the top-ranked PTv3, while running 24$\times$ faster. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the missing-wedge problem in limited-angle electron tomography that causes severe reconstruction artifacts, and overcome the challenge of obtaining large high-quality TEM datasets with known 3D ground truth.

Method: Proposes TEMDiff, a 3D diffusion-based iterative reconstruction framework trained on readily available FIB-SEM data using a simulator that maps them to TEM tilt series, operating directly on 3D volumes to enforce consistency across slices.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on simulated datasets with limited angular coverage, generalizes well to real-world TEM tilts under different conditions, and recovers accurate structures from tilt ranges as narrow as 8 degrees with 2-degree increments without retraining.

Conclusion: TEMDiff provides an effective solution for limited-angle electron tomography reconstruction by leveraging diffusion models and simulated training data, demonstrating strong performance and generalization capabilities without requiring clean TEM ground truth.

Abstract: Limited-angle electron tomography aims to reconstruct 3D shapes from 2D
projections of Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) within a restricted range
and number of tilting angles, but it suffers from the missing-wedge problem
that causes severe reconstruction artifacts. Deep learning approaches have
shown promising results in alleviating these artifacts, yet they typically
require large high-quality training datasets with known 3D ground truth which
are difficult to obtain in electron microscopy. To address these challenges, we
propose TEMDiff, a novel 3D diffusion-based iterative reconstruction framework.
Our method is trained on readily available volumetric FIB-SEM data using a
simulator that maps them to TEM tilt series, enabling the model to learn
realistic structural priors without requiring clean TEM ground truth. By
operating directly on 3D volumes, TEMDiff implicitly enforces consistency
across slices without the need for additional regularization. On simulated
electron tomography datasets with limited angular coverage, TEMDiff outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction quality. We further demonstrate that
a trained TEMDiff model generalizes well to real-world TEM tilts obtained under
different conditions and can recover accurate structures from tilt ranges as
narrow as 8 degrees, with 2-degree increments, without any retraining or
fine-tuning.

<details>

Motivation: Wrist-view observations are crucial for VLA models to capture fine-grained hand-object interactions, but large-scale datasets lack such recordings, creating a gap between abundant anchor views and scarce wrist views that existing world models cannot bridge.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) Reconstruction stage extends VGGT with Spatial Projection Consistency Loss to estimate wrist-view poses and 4D point clouds; (2) Generation stage uses video generation model to synthesize temporally coherent wrist-view videos from reconstructed perspective.

Result: State-of-the-art video generation with superior spatial consistency on Droid, Calvin, and Franka Panda datasets. Improves VLA performance by raising average task completion length on Calvin by 3.81% and closing 42.4% of the anchor-wrist view gap.

Conclusion: WristWorld successfully bridges the anchor-wrist view gap by leveraging geometric priors and enables generation of wrist-view videos from anchor views alone, enhancing VLA manipulation performance.

Abstract: Wrist-view observations are crucial for VLA models as they capture
fine-grained hand-object interactions that directly enhance manipulation
performance. Yet large-scale datasets rarely include such recordings, resulting
in a substantial gap between abundant anchor views and scarce wrist views.
Existing world models cannot bridge this gap, as they require a wrist-view
first frame and thus fail to generate wrist-view videos from anchor views
alone. Amid this gap, recent visual geometry models such as VGGT emerge with
geometric and cross-view priors that make it possible to address extreme
viewpoint shifts. Inspired by these insights, we propose WristWorld, the first
4D world model that generates wrist-view videos solely from anchor views.
WristWorld operates in two stages: (i) Reconstruction, which extends VGGT and
incorporates our Spatial Projection Consistency (SPC) Loss to estimate
geometrically consistent wrist-view poses and 4D point clouds; (ii) Generation,
which employs our video generation model to synthesize temporally coherent
wrist-view videos from the reconstructed perspective. Experiments on Droid,
Calvin, and Franka Panda demonstrate state-of-the-art video generation with
superior spatial consistency, while also improving VLA performance, raising the
average task completion length on Calvin by 3.81% and closing 42.4% of the
anchor-wrist view gap.

*Xiangyi Chen,Théophane Vallaeys,Maha Elbayad,John Nguyen,Jakob Verbeek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VUGEN is a novel framework that leverages Vision-Language Models' pretrained visual understanding priors for efficient and high-quality image generation without complex bridging mechanisms or reconstruction-oriented autoencoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for equipping VLMs with image generation capabilities often rely on reconstruction-oriented autoencoders or complex bridging mechanisms, leading to misalignment between understanding and generation representations, or architectural complexity.

Method: VUGEN transforms the VLM's high-dimensional latent space into a lower-dimensional, tractable distribution that preserves visual information, trains the VLM to sample within this reduced latent space, and uses a VAE-free pixel diffusion decoder to map generated latents back to image space.

Result: VUGEN achieves superior image generation performance, improving DPG Bench from 71.17 to 74.32 and FID from 11.86 to 9.06 on COCO, while fully preserving the VLM's original understanding capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates that leveraging VLM's pretrained visual understanding priors enables efficient and high-quality image generation without complex latent diffusion decoders that rely on VAE latents.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled unified
understanding across text and images, yet equipping these models with robust
image generation capabilities remains challenging. Existing approaches often
rely on reconstruction-oriented autoencoders or complex bridging mechanisms,
leading to misalignment between understanding and generation representations,
or architectural complexity. In this work, we propose VUGEN, a novel framework
that explicitly leverages VLM's pretrained visual understanding priors for
efficient and high-quality image generation. Our approach first transforms the
high-dimensional latent space of the VLM's native vision encoder into a
lower-dimensional, tractable distribution that maximally preserves visual
information. The VLM is then trained to sample within this reduced latent
space, ensuring alignment with its visual understanding capabilities. Finally,
a dedicated pixel decoder maps these generated latents back to the image space.
We find that a VAE-free pixel diffusion decoder to be on par or better than
commonly used complex latent diffusion decoders that internally rely on VAE
latents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VUGEN achieves superior image
generation performance, improving DPG Bench from 71.17 to 74.32 and FID from
11.86 to 9.06 on COCO, while fully preserving the VLM's original understanding
capabilities.

*Nicholas M. Kroeger,Vincent Bindschaedler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cluster paths is a post-hoc interpretability method that clusters neural network activations and represents inputs as sequences of cluster IDs, providing human-readable explanations while maintaining model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern deep neural networks are opaque in their decision processes, risking unwarranted trust, undetected biases, and unexpected failures. There's a need for interpretability methods that can scale to large vision models while generating concise explanations.

Method: Cluster activations at selected layers and represent each input as its sequence of cluster IDs. Extend to concept paths using large language models on minimal path divergences. Evaluate using four metrics: path complexity, weighted-path purity, decision-alignment faithfulness, and path agreement.

Result: Identified color-based shortcuts in spurious-cue CIFAR-10; achieved 90% faithfulness and 96% agreement under noise in CelebA hair-color task; scaled to Vision Transformer on ImageNet; effective as OOD detector; uncovered visual concepts like color palettes, textures, and object contexts.

Conclusion: Cluster paths provide scalable, human-readable explanations for large vision models, maintaining performance while revealing decision processes and detecting anomalies, making them a practical interpretability solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: While modern deep neural networks achieve impressive performance in vision
tasks, they remain opaque in their decision processes, risking unwarranted
trust, undetected biases and unexpected failures. We propose cluster paths, a
post-hoc interpretability method that clusters activations at selected layers
and represents each input as its sequence of cluster IDs. To assess these
cluster paths, we introduce four metrics: path complexity (cognitive load),
weighted-path purity (class alignment), decision-alignment faithfulness
(predictive fidelity), and path agreement (stability under perturbations). In a
spurious-cue CIFAR-10 experiment, cluster paths identify color-based shortcuts
and collapse when the cue is removed. On a five-class CelebA hair-color task,
they achieve 90% faithfulness and maintain 96% agreement under Gaussian noise
without sacrificing accuracy. Scaling to a Vision Transformer pretrained on
ImageNet, we extend cluster paths to concept paths derived from prompting a
large language model on minimal path divergences. Finally, we show that cluster
paths can serve as an effective out-of-distribution (OOD) detector, reliably
flagging anomalous samples before the model generates over-confident
predictions. Cluster paths uncover visual concepts, such as color palettes,
textures, or object contexts, at multiple network depths, demonstrating that
cluster paths scale to large vision models while generating concise and
human-readable explanations.

*Qiongyang Hu,Wenyang Liu,Wenbin Zou,Yuejiao Su,Lap-Pui Chau,Yi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HSNet is a novel graph-based framework for image super-resolution that decomposes global graphs into manageable sub-components to achieve structural flexibility while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning approaches for image super-resolution (CNNs and attention mechanisms) suffer from structural inflexibility, while graph-based methods offer adaptability but are hindered by excessive computational complexity.

Method: Proposes Heterogeneous Subgraph Network (HSNet) with three key components: Constructive Subgraph Set Block (CSSB) generates diverse complementary subgraphs capturing heterogeneous characteristics; Subgraph Aggregation Block (SAB) integrates representations across subgraphs through adaptive weighting; Node Sampling Strategy (NSS) selectively retains salient features to reduce computational overhead.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that HSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively balancing reconstruction quality with computational efficiency.

Conclusion: HSNet successfully overcomes limitations of existing methods by efficiently leveraging graph modeling while maintaining computational feasibility, achieving superior performance in image super-resolution tasks.

Abstract: Existing deep learning approaches for image super-resolution, particularly
those based on CNNs and attention mechanisms, often suffer from structural
inflexibility. Although graph-based methods offer greater representational
adaptability, they are frequently impeded by excessive computational
complexity. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes the
Heterogeneous Subgraph Network (HSNet), a novel framework that efficiently
leverages graph modeling while maintaining computational feasibility. The core
idea of HSNet is to decompose the global graph into manageable sub-components.
First, we introduce the Constructive Subgraph Set Block (CSSB), which generates
a diverse set of complementary subgraphs. Rather than relying on a single
monolithic graph, CSSB captures heterogeneous characteristics of the image by
modeling different relational patterns and feature interactions, producing a
rich ensemble of both local and global graph structures. Subsequently, the
Subgraph Aggregation Block (SAB) integrates the representations embedded across
these subgraphs. Through adaptive weighting and fusion of multi-graph features,
SAB constructs a comprehensive and discriminative representation that captures
intricate interdependencies. Furthermore, a Node Sampling Strategy (NSS) is
designed to selectively retain the most salient features, thereby enhancing
accuracy while reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively
balancing reconstruction quality with computational efficiency. The code will
be made publicly available.

### [32] [Improving Artifact Robustness for CT Deep Learning Models Without Labeled Artifact Images via Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06584)
*Justin Cheung,Samuel Savine,Calvin Nguyen,Lin Lu,Alhassan S. Yasin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Domain adaptation using DANN maintains CT image classification accuracy on new ring artifacts without requiring labeled artifact data, outperforming baseline and traditional augmentation approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models fail to generalize when CT scanners introduce new artifacts not present in training data, and labeling new distributions is costly.

Method: Simulated ring artifacts from detector gain error in sinogram space and evaluated domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) against baseline and augmentation approaches on OrganAMNIST abdominal CT dataset.

Result: DANN maintained high classification accuracy on ring artifact images using only unlabeled artifact data, performing comparably to models trained with labeled artifact images, with unexpected generalization to uniform noise.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation effectively addresses distribution shift in medical imaging without expensive expert labeling, showing promise for clinical deployment where novel artifacts may emerge.

Abstract: Deep learning models which perform well on images from their training
distribution can degrade substantially when applied to new distributions. If a
CT scanner introduces a new artifact not present in the training labels, the
model may misclassify the images. Although modern CT scanners include design
features which mitigate these artifacts, unanticipated or difficult-to-mitigate
artifacts can still appear in practice. The direct solution of labeling images
from this new distribution can be costly. As a more accessible alternative,
this study evaluates domain adaptation as an approach for training models that
maintain classification performance despite new artifacts, even without
corresponding labels. We simulate ring artifacts from detector gain error in
sinogram space and evaluate domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) against
baseline and augmentation-based approaches on the OrganAMNIST abdominal CT
dataset. Our results demonstrate that baseline models trained only on clean
images fail to generalize to images with ring artifacts, and traditional
augmentation with other distortion types provides no improvement on unseen
artifact domains. In contrast, the DANN approach successfully maintains high
classification accuracy on ring artifact images using only unlabeled artifact
data during training, demonstrating the viability of domain adaptation for
artifact robustness. The domain-adapted model achieved classification
performance on ring artifact test data comparable to models explicitly trained
with labeled artifact images, while also showing unexpected generalization to
uniform noise. These findings provide empirical evidence that domain adaptation
can effectively address distribution shift in medical imaging without requiring
expensive expert labeling of new artifact distributions, suggesting promise for
deployment in clinical settings where novel artifacts may emerge.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MingTok introduces a continuous latent space visual tokenizer that unifies visual understanding and generation under autoregressive modeling, eliminating quantization errors and supporting multi-round tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing discrete tokenizers suffer from quantization errors that limit semantic expressiveness and degrade vision-language understanding capabilities, creating a need for continuous space tokenization.

Method: Three-stage sequential architecture: low-level encoding, semantic expansion, and visual reconstruction, enabling unified autoregressive prediction in a shared continuous space.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across both understanding and generation domains by reconciling competing requirements through unified continuous visual representations.

Conclusion: Continuous visual tokenization successfully unifies vision-language tasks under a single autoregressive paradigm and facilitates multi-round understanding, generation and editing tasks.

Abstract: Visual tokenization remains a core challenge in unifying visual understanding
and generation within the autoregressive paradigm. Existing methods typically
employ tokenizers in discrete latent spaces to align with the tokens from large
language models, where the quantization errors can limit semantic
expressiveness and degrade the capability of vision-language understanding. To
address this, we introduce MingTok, a new family of visual tokenizers with a
continuous latent space, for unified autoregressive generation and
understanding. While understanding tasks favor discriminative high-dimensional
features, generation tasks prefer compact low-level codes. Thus, to reconcile
these competing demands, MingTok adopts a three-stage sequential architecture
involving low-level encoding, semantic expansion, and visual reconstruction.
Built on top of it, Ming-UniVision eliminates the need for task-specific visual
representations, and unifies diverse vision-language tasks under a single
autoregrsssive prediction paradigm. By formulating both understanding and
generation as next-token prediction in a shared continuous space, it seamlessly
supports multi-round, in-context tasks such as iterative understanding,
generation and editing. Empirically, we find that using a unified continuous
visual representation reconciles the competing requirements on the tokenizers
by the understanding and generation tasks, thereby leading to state-of-the-art
level performance across both domains. We hope our findings will facilitate
unified visual tokenization in the continuous domain. Inference code and model
weights are released to benefit community.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes BeerLaNet, a trainable color normalization model based on Beer-Lambert law that integrates with backbone networks to address domain shift in digital pathology by extracting stain-invariant structural information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Color variability in pathology images due to different staining protocols and imaging conditions reduces deep learning model performance when deployed on data from different domains (domain shift). Existing color normalization methods have drawbacks like introducing artifacts or requiring template image selection.

Method: Uses algorithmic unrolling of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) model based on Beer-Lambert law physics to extract stain-invariant structural information from pathology images. The trainable model can be integrated with any backbone network for downstream tasks.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art stain normalization methods on publicly available pathology datasets and internally curated malaria blood smears for cross-domain object detection and classification tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed BeerLaNet provides an effective trainable color normalization approach that addresses domain shift in digital pathology by leveraging physics-based modeling and integration with backbone networks, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Deep learning advances have revolutionized automated digital pathology
analysis. However, differences in staining protocols and imaging conditions can
introduce significant color variability. In deep learning, such color
inconsistency often reduces performance when deploying models on data acquired
under different conditions from the training data, a challenge known as domain
shift. Many existing methods attempt to address this problem via color
normalization but suffer from several notable drawbacks such as introducing
artifacts or requiring careful choice of a template image for stain mapping. To
address these limitations, we propose a trainable color normalization model
that can be integrated with any backbone network for downstream tasks such as
object detection and classification. Based on the physics of the imaging
process per the Beer-Lambert law, our model architecture is derived via
algorithmic unrolling of a nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) model to
extract stain-invariant structural information from the original pathology
images, which serves as input for further processing. Experimentally, we
evaluate the method on publicly available pathology datasets and an internally
curated collection of malaria blood smears for cross-domain object detection
and classification, where our method outperforms many state-of-the-art stain
normalization methods. Our code is available at

TL;DR: This paper introduces SDQM, a metric for evaluating synthetic dataset quality in object detection tasks without requiring model training, showing strong correlation with mAP scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of evaluating synthetic data quality efficiently, as current methods require costly iterative training and show weak correlation with model performance.

Method: Proposed Synthetic Dataset Quality Metric (SDQM) that assesses data quality for object detection without needing model convergence, enabling efficient dataset generation and selection.

Result: SDQM demonstrated strong correlation with YOLOv11 mAP scores, outperforming previous metrics that showed only moderate/weak correlations, and provided actionable insights for dataset improvement.

Conclusion: SDQM sets a new standard for synthetic data evaluation by being scalable, efficient, and providing meaningful quality assessment without expensive training iterations.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models depends heavily on training data.
The scarcity of large-scale, well-annotated datasets poses significant
challenges in creating robust models. To address this, synthetic data generated
through simulations and generative models has emerged as a promising solution,
enhancing dataset diversity and improving the performance, reliability, and
resilience of models. However, evaluating the quality of this generated data
requires an effective metric. This paper introduces the Synthetic Dataset
Quality Metric (SDQM) to assess data quality for object detection tasks without
requiring model training to converge. This metric enables more efficient
generation and selection of synthetic datasets, addressing a key challenge in
resource-constrained object detection tasks. In our experiments, SDQM
demonstrated a strong correlation with the mean Average Precision (mAP) scores
of YOLOv11, a leading object detection model, while previous metrics only
exhibited moderate or weak correlations. Additionally, it provides actionable
insights for improving dataset quality, minimizing the need for costly
iterative training. This scalable and efficient metric sets a new standard for
evaluating synthetic data. The code for SDQM is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UnrollINR is a zero-shot self-supervised framework for fast MRI reconstruction that combines physics-guided unrolled iterative architecture with Implicit Neural Representation as regularization prior, achieving superior performance even at 10x acceleration without external training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI scan times are prolonged, limiting clinical application. While deep learning methods show promise, they often require fully sampled data which is difficult to obtain. There's a need for scan-specific reconstruction without external training data.

Method: Proposes UnrollINR framework combining physics-guided unrolled iterative reconstruction architecture with Implicit Neural Representation (INR) as regularization prior. Uses zero-shot self-supervised learning without external data.

Result: Achieves superior reconstruction performance compared to supervised learning methods, even at high acceleration rate of 10x.

Conclusion: The combination of deep unrolled structure with INR's implicit representation capability enhances both interpretability and reconstruction performance, validating the superiority of the proposed zero-shot self-supervised approach.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a vital clinical diagnostic tool, yet its
widespread application is limited by prolonged scan times. Fast MRI
reconstruction techniques effectively reduce acquisition duration by
reconstructing high-fidelity MR images from undersampled k-space data. In
recent years, deep learning-based methods have demonstrated remarkable progress
in this field, with self-supervised and unsupervised learning approaches
proving particularly valuable in scenarios where fully sampled data are
difficult to obtain. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot self-supervised
reconstruction framework named UnrollINR, which enables scan-specific MRI
reconstruction without relying on external training data. The method adopts a
physics-guided unrolled iterative reconstruction architecture and introduces
Implicit Neural Representation (INR) as a regularization prior to effectively
constrain the solution space. By combining a deep unrolled structure with the
powerful implicit representation capability of INR, the model's
interpretability and reconstruction performance are enhanced. Experimental
results demonstrate that even at a high acceleration rate of 10, UnrollINR
achieves superior reconstruction performance compared to the supervised
learning method, validating the superiority of the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TFS models perform well in English but poorly in non-English languages due to English-dominated training datasets and lack of cross-language generalization abilities, producing wrong mouth shapes and rigid facial expressions.

Method: Proposes Multilingual Experts (MuEx) with Phoneme-Guided Mixture-of-Experts (PG-MoE) architecture that extracts phonemes and visemes as universal speech units, and introduces Phoneme-Viseme Alignment Mechanism (PV-Align) for robust cross-modal synchronization.

Result: Extensive experiments show MuEx achieves superior performance across all 12 languages in the MTFB benchmark and exhibits effective zero-shot generalization to unseen languages without additional training.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses multilingual TFS challenges by using phonemes and visemes as universal intermediaries, enabling lifelike facial animations across diverse languages with strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Speech-driven talking face synthesis (TFS) focuses on generating lifelike
facial animations from audio input. Current TFS models perform well in English
but unsatisfactorily in non-English languages, producing wrong mouth shapes and
rigid facial expressions. The terrible performance is caused by the
English-dominated training datasets and the lack of cross-language
generalization abilities. Thus, we propose Multilingual Experts (MuEx), a novel
framework featuring a Phoneme-Guided Mixture-of-Experts (PG-MoE) architecture
that employs phonemes and visemes as universal intermediaries to bridge audio
and video modalities, achieving lifelike multilingual TFS. To alleviate the
influence of linguistic differences and dataset bias, we extract audio and
video features as phonemes and visemes respectively, which are the basic units
of speech sounds and mouth movements. To address audiovisual synchronization
issues, we introduce the Phoneme-Viseme Alignment Mechanism (PV-Align), which
establishes robust cross-modal correspondences between phonemes and visemes. In
addition, we build a Multilingual Talking Face Benchmark (MTFB) comprising 12
diverse languages with 95.04 hours of high-quality videos for training and
evaluating multilingual TFS performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MuEx achieves superior performance across all languages in MTFB and exhibits
effective zero-shot generalization to unseen languages without additional
training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-based trackers struggle with real-world challenges like occlusion, similar object interference, and complex backgrounds. Multispectral imagery offers better target discriminability, but existing datasets are limited in scale and diversity.

Method: Created MSITrack dataset with 300 videos containing over 129k frames of multispectral imagery, covering 55 object categories and 300 natural scenes. Each frame underwent meticulous manual labeling and multi-stage verification for annotation precision.

Result: Extensive evaluations show that multispectral data in MSITrack significantly improves tracking performance compared to RGB-only baselines, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness for advancing multispectral tracking research.

Conclusion: MSITrack provides a comprehensive benchmark that bridges the gap in multispectral tracking datasets and has the potential to drive future advancements in visual object tracking by leveraging spectral reflectance information.

Abstract: Visual object tracking in real-world scenarios presents numerous challenges
including occlusion, interference from similar objects and complex
backgrounds-all of which limit the effectiveness of RGB-based trackers.
Multispectral imagery, which captures pixel-level spectral reflectance,
enhances target discriminability. However, the availability of multispectral
tracking datasets remains limited. To bridge this gap, we introduce MSITrack,
the largest and most diverse multispectral single object tracking dataset to
date. MSITrack offers the following key features: (i) More Challenging
Attributes-including interference from similar objects and similarity in color
and texture between targets and backgrounds in natural scenarios, along with a
wide range of real-world tracking challenges; (ii) Richer and More Natural
Scenes-spanning 55 object categories and 300 distinct natural scenes, MSITrack
far exceeds the scope of existing benchmarks. Many of these scenes and
categories are introduced to the multispectral tracking domain for the first
time; (iii) Larger Scale-300 videos comprising over 129k frames of
multispectral imagery. To ensure annotation precision, each frame has undergone
meticulous processing, manual labeling and multi-stage verification. Extensive
evaluations using representative trackers demonstrate that the multispectral

TL;DR: StaR-KVQA improves implicit-knowledge visual question answering by supervising structured reasoning traces (dual symbolic relation paths with explanations) to make reasoning transparent and verifiable, achieving significant accuracy gains without external knowledge sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs used for implicit-knowledge VQA lack explicit reasoning supervision, produce inconsistent justifications, and generalize poorly after standard fine-tuning, requiring a method to make reasoning transparent and verifiable.

Method: Constructs and selects path-grounded reasoning traces to form trace-enriched dataset, then fine-tunes via structured self-distillation to align generation with supervision; uses no external retrievers, verifiers, or curated KBs.

Result: Achieves up to +11.3% higher answer accuracy on OK-VQA over strongest baseline while exhibiting robust cross-domain generalization, improving both accuracy and interpretability.

Conclusion: StaR-KVQA effectively addresses limitations of MLLMs in implicit-knowledge VQA by supervising structured reasoning traces, enabling transparent and verifiable reasoning without external knowledge sources.

Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KVQA) requires models to ground
entities in images and reason over factual knowledge. We study its
implicit-knowledge variant, IK-KVQA, where a multimodal large language model
(MLLM) is the sole knowledge source, without external retrieval. Yet, MLLMs
lack explicit reasoning supervision and produce inconsistent justifications,
and generalize poorly after standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We present
StaR-KVQA (Structured Reasoning Traces for IK-KVQA), which supervises
structured traces - dual symbolic relation paths plus path-grounded
natural-language explanations - so that reasoning becomes transparent and
verifiable. With one open-source MLLM, StaR-KVQA constructs and selects
path-grounded reasoning traces to form a trace-enriched dataset, then
fine-tunes via structured self-distillation to align generation with
supervision; no external retrievers, verifiers, or curated knowledge bases
(KBs) are used, traces are built offline, and inference is a single
autoregressive pass. Across benchmarks, StaR-KVQA improves both accuracy and
interpretability, achieving up to +11.3% higher answer accuracy on OK-VQA over
the strongest baseline while exhibiting robust cross-domain generalization.

Method: Proposes AutoNAD framework that jointly searches over convolutions, transformers, and multi-layer perceptrons. Uses cross weight sharing strategy for efficient training, searchable multi-level feature aggregation module for multi-scale learning, and latency-aware prior for efficient architecture selection.

Result: Validated on three industrial defect datasets and applied within a defect imaging and detection platform. The hybrid design captures both fine-grained local variations and long-range semantic context.

Conclusion: AutoNAD effectively addresses the key challenges in surface defect detection while reducing manual network design costs and considering deployment efficiency. The framework shows promise for industrial applications.

quality and manufacturing reliability. Due to the diverse shapes and sizes of
surface defects, SDD faces two main challenges: intraclass difference and
interclass similarity. Existing methods primarily utilize manually designed
models, which require extensive trial and error and often struggle to address
both challenges effectively. To overcome this, we propose AutoNAD, an automated
neural architecture design framework for SDD that jointly searches over
convolutions, transformers, and multi-layer perceptrons. This hybrid design
enables the model to capture both fine-grained local variations and long-range
semantic context, addressing the two key challenges while reducing the cost of
manual network design. To support efficient training of such a diverse search
space, AutoNAD introduces a cross weight sharing strategy, which accelerates
supernet convergence and improves subnet performance. Additionally, a
searchable multi-level feature aggregation module (MFAM) is integrated to
enhance multi-scale feature learning. Beyond detection accuracy, runtime
efficiency is essential for industrial deployment. To this end, AutoNAD
incorporates a latency-aware prior to guide the selection of efficient
architectures. The effectiveness of AutoNAD is validated on three industrial
defect datasets and further applied within a defect imaging and detection
platform. Code will be available at https://github.com/Yuxi104/AutoNAD.

Motivation: To rethink language modeling principles for visual signals by developing a more principled approach that avoids common limitations like classifier-free guidance (CFG) and semantic tokenizers in current image generation models.

Method: Uses causal Transformer with reconstruction-focused visual tokenizer and introduces next 2D distribution prediction - predicting distribution over entire 2D spatial grid at each timestep, unifying autoregressive sequential modeling with masked autoencoding's holistic self-supervised learning.

Result: Achieves FID of 2.70 on ImageNet generation benchmark, significantly outperforming previous causal autoregressive approaches.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the effectiveness of principled language modeling approaches for visual signals and aims to inspire rethinking of such methods beyond image generation.

Abstract: We introduce Heptapod, an image autoregressive model that adheres to the
foundational principles of language modeling. Heptapod employs \textbf{causal
attention}, \textbf{eliminates reliance on CFG}, and \textbf{eschews the trend
of semantic tokenizers}. Our key innovation is \textit{next 2D distribution
prediction}: a causal Transformer with reconstruction-focused visual tokenizer,
learns to predict the distribution over the entire 2D spatial grid of images at
each timestep. This learning objective unifies the sequential modeling of
autoregressive framework with the holistic self-supervised learning of masked
autoencoding, enabling the model to capture comprehensive image semantics via
generative training. On the ImageNet generation benchmark, Heptapod achieves an
FID of $2.70$, significantly outperforming previous causal autoregressive
approaches. We hope our work inspires a principled rethinking of language
modeling on visual signals and beyond.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamOmni2 addresses limitations in current image editing and generation by introducing multimodal instruction-based editing and generation tasks that support both text/image instructions and handle concrete/abstract concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instruction-based image editing relies only on language which fails to capture specific details, while subject-driven generation is limited to concrete objects and ignores abstract concepts, making both inadequate for practical user needs.

Method: Proposes a data synthesis pipeline with feature mixing for concept extraction, generates multimodal editing training data, and introduces index encoding with position encoding shift to handle multi-image input and avoid pixel confusion, plus joint training with VLM.

Result: DreamOmni2 has achieved impressive results in multimodal instruction-based editing and generation, with comprehensive benchmarks proposed to drive development of these new tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal instruction-based editing and generation framework effectively addresses limitations of current methods by supporting both text/image instructions and handling both concrete and abstract concepts, significantly enhancing practical applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in instruction-based image editing and subject-driven
generation have garnered significant attention, yet both tasks still face
limitations in meeting practical user needs. Instruction-based editing relies
solely on language instructions, which often fail to capture specific editing
details, making reference images necessary. Meanwhile, subject-driven
generation is limited to combining concrete objects or people, overlooking
broader, abstract concepts. To address these challenges, we propose two novel
tasks: multimodal instruction-based editing and generation. These tasks support
both text and image instructions and extend the scope to include both concrete
and abstract concepts, greatly enhancing their practical applications. We
introduce DreamOmni2, tackling two primary challenges: data creation and model
framework design. Our data synthesis pipeline consists of three steps: (1)
using a feature mixing method to create extraction data for both abstract and
concrete concepts, (2) generating multimodal instruction-based editing training
data using the editing and extraction models, and (3) further applying the
extraction model to create training data for multimodal instruction-based
editing. For the framework, to handle multi-image input, we propose an index
encoding and position encoding shift scheme, which helps the model distinguish
images and avoid pixel confusion. Additionally, we introduce joint training
with the VLM and our generation/editing model to better process complex
instructions. In addition, we have proposed comprehensive benchmarks for these
two new tasks to drive their development. Experiments show that DreamOmni2 has
achieved impressive results. Models and codes will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a multimodal semantic segmentation method (Mlpfseg) that fuses light field and LiDAR point cloud data with feature completion and depth perception modules to improve segmentation accuracy, especially for occluded objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation faces challenges under complex conditions like occlusion in autonomous driving. Light field and LiDAR provide complementary cues but their integration is hindered by viewpoint limitations and modality discrepancies.

Method: Created a multimodal dataset integrating light field and point cloud data, then developed Mlpfseg network with feature completion module (differential reconstruction of point-cloud feature maps) and depth perception module (reinforcing attention scores for occlusion awareness).

Result: Outperforms image-only segmentation by 1.71 mIoU and point cloud-only segmentation by 2.38 mIoU, demonstrating effectiveness in multimodal fusion.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal fusion approach with feature completion and depth perception modules successfully addresses modality discrepancies and improves segmentation performance, particularly for occluded objects in autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation serves as a cornerstone of scene understanding in
autonomous driving but continues to face significant challenges under complex
conditions such as occlusion. Light field and LiDAR modalities provide
complementary visual and spatial cues that are beneficial for robust
perception; however, their effective integration is hindered by limited
viewpoint diversity and inherent modality discrepancies. To address these
challenges, the first multimodal semantic segmentation dataset integrating
light field data and point cloud data is proposed. Based on this dataset, we
proposed a multi-modal light field point-cloud fusion segmentation
network(Mlpfseg), incorporating feature completion and depth perception to
segment both camera images and LiDAR point clouds simultaneously. The feature
completion module addresses the density mismatch between point clouds and image
pixels by performing differential reconstruction of point-cloud feature maps,
enhancing the fusion of these modalities. The depth perception module improves
the segmentation of occluded objects by reinforcing attention scores for better
occlusion awareness. Our method outperforms image-only segmentation by 1.71
Mean Intersection over Union(mIoU) and point cloud-only segmentation by 2.38
mIoU, demonstrating its effectiveness.

TL;DR: The paper presents a new evaluation framework for LLM-based OCR in historical documents, addressing temporal biases and period-specific errors that traditional metrics miss. It introduces novel metrics like Historical Character Preservation Rate and Archaic Insertion Rate, and evaluates 12 multimodal LLMs on 18th-century Russian texts.

Motivation: Digital humanities scholars lack appropriate evaluation frameworks for LLM-based OCR in historical documents, as traditional metrics fail to capture temporal biases and period-specific errors crucial for historical corpus creation.

Method: Developed an evaluation methodology with novel metrics (HCPR, AIR), contamination control protocols, and stability testing. Evaluated 12 multimodal LLMs on 18th-century Russian Civil font texts.

Result: Gemini and Qwen models outperformed traditional OCR but exhibited over-historicization - inserting archaic characters from incorrect historical periods. Post-OCR correction degraded rather than improved performance.

Conclusion: The methodology provides digital humanities practitioners with guidelines for model selection and quality assessment in historical corpus digitization, addressing systematic biases in diplomatic transcription.

Abstract: Digital humanities scholars increasingly use Large Language Models for
historical document digitization, yet lack appropriate evaluation frameworks
for LLM-based OCR. Traditional metrics fail to capture temporal biases and
period-specific errors crucial for historical corpus creation. We present an

risks and systematic biases in diplomatic transcription. Using 18th-century
Russian Civil font texts, we introduce novel metrics including Historical
Character Preservation Rate (HCPR) and Archaic Insertion Rate (AIR), alongside
protocols for contamination control and stability testing. We evaluate 12
multimodal LLMs, finding that Gemini and Qwen models outperform traditional OCR
while exhibiting over-historicization: inserting archaic characters from
incorrect historical periods. Post-OCR correction degrades rather than improves
performance. Our methodology provides digital humanities practitioners with

*Zhiliang Zhu,Tao Zeng,Tao Yang,Guoliang Luo,Jiyong Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeRainMamba integrates frequency-aware state-space modeling and multi-directional convolution to improve image deraining by better distinguishing rain streaks from image details while preserving local structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Mamba-based models have limited ability to capture fine-grained details and lack frequency-domain awareness, restricting further improvements in image deraining performance.

Method: Proposes DeRainMamba with Frequency-Aware State-Space Module (FASSM) that uses Fourier transform to distinguish rain streaks from high-frequency details, and Multi-Directional Perception Convolution (MDPConv) that captures anisotropic gradient features and fuses multiple convolution branches.

Result: Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks show DeRainMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in PSNR and SSIM metrics, while requiring fewer parameters and lower computational costs.

Conclusion: The combination of frequency-domain modeling and spatial detail enhancement within a state-space framework is effective for single image deraining, achieving superior performance with improved efficiency.

Abstract: Image deraining is crucial for improving visual quality and supporting
reliable downstream vision tasks. Although Mamba-based models provide efficient
sequence modeling, their limited ability to capture fine-grained details and
lack of frequency-domain awareness restrict further improvements. To address
these issues, we propose DeRainMamba, which integrates a Frequency-Aware
State-Space Module (FASSM) and Multi-Directional Perception Convolution
(MDPConv). FASSM leverages Fourier transform to distinguish rain streaks from
high-frequency image details, balancing rain removal and detail preservation.
MDPConv further restores local structures by capturing anisotropic gradient
features and efficiently fusing multiple convolution branches. Extensive
experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate that DeRainMamba consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in PSNR and SSIM, while requiring fewer
parameters and lower computational costs. These results validate the
effectiveness of combining frequency-domain modeling and spatial detail
enhancement within a state-space framework for single image deraining.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OBS-Diff is a novel one-shot pruning framework that enables accurate and training-free compression of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models by adapting Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) to diffusion model architectures with timestep-aware Hessian construction and group-wise sequential pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models suffer from prohibitive computational cost, and existing one-shot network pruning methods cannot be directly applied due to the iterative denoising nature of diffusion models.

Method: OBS-Diff revitalizes Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) for diffusion models, supports diverse pruning granularity, uses timestep-aware Hessian construction with logarithmic-decrease weighting, and employs group-wise sequential pruning strategy.

Result: Extensive experiments show OBS-Diff achieves state-of-the-art one-shot pruning for diffusion models, delivering inference acceleration with minimal degradation in visual quality.

Conclusion: OBS-Diff successfully bridges the gap between traditional pruning methods and diffusion models, providing an effective training-free compression framework for large-scale text-to-image diffusion models.

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, while powerful, suffer from
prohibitive computational cost. Existing one-shot network pruning methods can
hardly be directly applied to them due to the iterative denoising nature of
diffusion models. To bridge the gap, this paper presents OBS-Diff, a novel
one-shot pruning framework that enables accurate and training-free compression
of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, (i) OBS-Diff
revitalizes the classic Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS), adapting it to the complex
architectures of modern diffusion models and supporting diverse pruning
granularity, including unstructured, N:M semi-structured, and structured (MHA
heads and FFN neurons) sparsity; (ii) To align the pruning criteria with the
iterative dynamics of the diffusion process, by examining the problem from an
error-accumulation perspective, we propose a novel timestep-aware Hessian
construction that incorporates a logarithmic-decrease weighting scheme,
assigning greater importance to earlier timesteps to mitigate potential error
accumulation; (iii) Furthermore, a computationally efficient group-wise
sequential pruning strategy is proposed to amortize the expensive calibration
process. Extensive experiments show that OBS-Diff achieves state-of-the-art
one-shot pruning for diffusion models, delivering inference acceleration with
minimal degradation in visual quality.

*Changlin Song,Yunzhong Hou,Michael Randall Barnes,Rahul Shome,Dylan Campbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a heatmap-based extreme amodal face detector that uses contextual cues from single images to infer the presence of unseen faces outside the frame, outperforming less efficient generative approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing safety and privacy applications by detecting faces that are not visible in the input image but exist in an expanded field-of-view, focusing on single-image inference rather than image sequences.

Method: A heatmap-based extreme amodal object detector with a selective coarse-to-fine decoder that efficiently predicts out-of-frame regions using contextual cues from the visible image content.

Result: The method establishes strong results for extreme amodal detection, even outperforming less efficient generative approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed sample-free approach using contextual cues and coarse-to-fine decoding provides an efficient and effective solution for extreme amodal face detection from single images.

Abstract: Extreme amodal detection is the task of inferring the 2D location of objects
that are not fully visible in the input image but are visible within an
expanded field-of-view. This differs from amodal detection, where the object is
partially visible within the input image, but is occluded. In this paper, we
consider the sub-problem of face detection, since this class provides
motivating applications involving safety and privacy, but do not tailor our
method specifically to this class. Existing approaches rely on image sequences
so that missing detections may be interpolated from surrounding frames or make
use of generative models to sample possible completions. In contrast, we
consider the single-image task and propose a more efficient, sample-free
approach that makes use of the contextual cues from the image to infer the
presence of unseen faces. We design a heatmap-based extreme amodal object
detector that addresses the problem of efficiently predicting a lot (the
out-of-frame region) from a little (the image) with a selective coarse-to-fine
decoder. Our method establishes strong results for this new task, even
outperforming less efficient generative approaches.

*Sheng Fu,Junchao Zhang,Kailun Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A histogram matching approach transforms arbitrary noise towards Gaussian distribution, enabling a single Gaussian denoiser to handle various out-of-distribution noises through a mutually reinforcing cycle between noise transformation and denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised Gaussian denoisers have limited generalization to out-of-distribution noise due to diverse noise characteristics across different noise types.

Method: Proposes histogram matching to transform arbitrary noise to target Gaussian distribution, establishes a mutually reinforcing cycle between noise transformation and denoising, and uses specific techniques for different noise complexities: local histogram matching for signal-dependent noise, intrapatch permutation for channel-related noise, and frequency-domain histogram matching with pixel-shuffle down-sampling for spatial correlation.

Result: A single Gaussian denoiser gains remarkable capability to handle various out-of-distribution noises including synthetic noises (Poisson, salt-and-pepper, repeating pattern) and complex real-world noises.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates superior generalization and effectiveness in handling diverse noise types through the proposed noise transformation approach.

Abstract: Supervised Gaussian denoisers exhibit limited generalization when confronted
with out-of-distribution noise, due to the diverse distributional
characteristics of different noise types. To bridge this gap, we propose a
histogram matching approach that transforms arbitrary noise towards a target
Gaussian distribution with known intensity. Moreover, a mutually reinforcing
cycle is established between noise transformation and subsequent denoising.
This cycle progressively refines the noise to be converted, making it
approximate the real noise, thereby enhancing the noise transformation effect
and further improving the denoising performance. We tackle specific noise
complexities: local histogram matching handles signal-dependent noise,
intrapatch permutation processes channel-related noise, and frequency-domain
histogram matching coupled with pixel-shuffle down-sampling breaks spatial
correlation. By applying these transformations, a single Gaussian denoiser
gains remarkable capability to handle various out-of-distribution noises,
including synthetic noises such as Poisson, salt-and-pepper and repeating
pattern noises, as well as complex real-world noises. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superior generalization and effectiveness of our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates using raw sensor data instead of preprocessed images for onboard satellite AI, finding that while detection performance is similar at low-medium confidence, raw data models struggle with object boundaries at high confidence levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With increasing satellite processing power, deploying AI models directly onboard is feasible, but current solutions rely on preprocessed data rather than raw sensor data, creating a gap in understanding raw data's effects on deep learning models.

Method: Introduced a simulation workflow to generate raw-like products from high-resolution L1 imagery, trained two object detection models (YOLOv11s and YOLOX-S) on both raw and L1 datasets, and compared performance using standard metrics and explainability tools.

Result: Both models performed similarly at low to medium confidence thresholds, but the model trained on raw data struggled with object boundary identification at high confidence levels.

Conclusion: Adapting AI architectures with improved contouring methods can enhance object detection on raw images, improving onboard AI capabilities for remote sensing applications.

Abstract: With increasing processing power, deploying AI models for remote sensing
directly onboard satellites is becoming feasible. However, new constraints
arise, mainly when using raw, unprocessed sensor data instead of preprocessed
ground-based products. While current solutions primarily rely on preprocessed
sensor images, few approaches directly leverage raw data. This study
investigates the effects of utilising raw data on deep learning models for
object detection and classification tasks. We introduce a simulation workflow
to generate raw-like products from high-resolution L1 imagery, enabling
systemic evaluation. Two object detection models (YOLOv11s and YOLOX-S) are
trained on both raw and L1 datasets, and their performance is compared using
standard detection metrics and explainability tools. Results indicate that
while both models perform similarly at low to medium confidence thresholds, the
model trained on raw data struggles with object boundary identification at high
confidence levels. It suggests that adapting AI architectures with improved
contouring methods can enhance object detection on raw images, improving
onboard AI for remote sensing.

*Gianmarco Perantoni,Lorenzo Bruzzone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a Deep Multiple Instance Learning method for land-cover classification using high-resolution imagery with weak low-resolution labels, addressing label quality issues in training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the central problem of training label quantity and quality in high-resolution land-cover mapping, where weak labels from low-resolution products can be gathered in large quantities but lack direct supervision for high-resolution classification.

Method: Uses flexible pooling layers to link pixel-level semantics in high-resolution imagery to low-resolution reference labels, reframing MIL in multi-class and multi-label settings with Positive-Unlabeled Learning strategy for cases where multiple labels can be valid but only one is provided.

Result: Experimental results on the 2020 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework compared to standard training strategies.

Conclusion: The proposed DMIL framework successfully trains pixel-level multi-class classifiers using weak low-resolution labels, enabling high-resolution land-cover mapping without direct high-resolution supervision.

Abstract: The quantity and the quality of the training labels are central problems in
high-resolution land-cover mapping with machine-learning-based solutions. In
this context, weak labels can be gathered in large quantities by leveraging on
existing low-resolution or obsolete products. In this paper, we address the
problem of training land-cover classifiers using high-resolution imagery (e.g.,
Sentinel-2) and weak low-resolution reference data (e.g., MODIS -derived
land-cover maps). Inspired by recent works in Deep Multiple Instance Learning
(DMIL), we propose a method that trains pixel-level multi-class classifiers and
predicts low-resolution labels (i.e., patch-level classification), where the
actual high-resolution labels are learned implicitly without direct
supervision. This is achieved with flexible pooling layers that are able to
link the semantics of the pixels in the high-resolution imagery to the
low-resolution reference labels. Then, the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)
problem is re-framed in a multi-class and in a multi-label setting. In the
former, the low-resolution annotation represents the majority of the pixels in
the patch. In the latter, the annotation only provides us information on the
presence of one of the land-cover classes in the patch and thus multiple labels
can be considered valid for a patch at a time, whereas the low-resolution
labels provide us only one label. Therefore, the classifier is trained with a
Positive-Unlabeled Learning (PUL) strategy. Experimental results on the 2020
IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed
framework compared to standard training strategies.

TL;DR: DirectGaussian is a novel Text-to-3D method that generates 3D object surfaces using surfels representation with 2D Gaussian splatting and curvature constraints for geometric consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Text-to-3D methods struggle with complex geometric shapes in natural objects - either using 2D diffusion priors or training on specific 3D representations, which limits their effectiveness.

Method: Uses surfels to represent 3D object surfaces, employs conditional text generation models with 2D Gaussian splatting for rendering, incorporates multi-view normal and texture priors, and adds curvature constraints during optimization for geometric consistency.

Result: The framework achieves diverse and high-fidelity 3D content creation, as demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: DirectGaussian provides an effective approach for Text-to-3D generation that handles complex geometric shapes through surfel-based representation with proper geometric constraints.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Text-to-3D modeling have shown significant potential
for the creation of 3D content. However, due to the complex geometric shapes of
objects in the natural world, generating 3D content remains a challenging task.
Current methods either leverage 2D diffusion priors to recover 3D geometry, or
train the model directly based on specific 3D representations. In this paper,
we propose a novel method named DirectGaussian, which focuses on generating the
surfaces of 3D objects represented by surfels. In DirectGaussian, we utilize
conditional text generation models and the surface of a 3D object is rendered
by 2D Gaussian splatting with multi-view normal and texture priors. For
multi-view geometric consistency problems, DirectGaussian incorporates
curvature constraints on the generated surface during optimization process.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework is capable of
achieving diverse and high-fidelity 3D content creation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TTRV enhances vision language models through test-time reinforcement learning without labeled data, using frequency-based rewards and entropy control to improve performance on object recognition and VQA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward extraction methods in RL require labeled data and training splits, which differs from how humans learn directly from their environment. The authors aim to enable models to adapt at inference time without labeled data.

Method: Enhanced GRPO framework with rewards based on output frequency and multiple inferences per test sample. Also controls output diversity by rewarding low entropy of output empirical distribution.

Result: Achieved improvements up to 52.4% in object recognition and 29.8% in VQA, with average boosts of 24.6% and 10.0% across 16 datasets. TTRV applied to InternVL 8B surpassed GPT-4o by 2.3% on image recognition and remained competitive on VQA. Even with single unlabeled test example adaptation, achieved up to 5.5% improvements.

Conclusion: Test-time reinforcement learning can match or exceed proprietary models, demonstrating that VLMs can effectively adapt during inference without labeled data, even in extremely data-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Existing methods for extracting reward signals in Reinforcement Learning
typically rely on labeled data and dedicated training splits, a setup that
contrasts with how humans learn directly from their environment. In this work,
we propose TTRV to enhance vision language understanding by adapting the model
on the fly at inference time, without the need for any labeled data.
Concretely, we enhance the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework
by designing rewards based on the frequency of the base model's output, while
inferring on each test sample multiple times. Further, we also propose to
control the diversity of the model's output by simultaneously rewarding the
model for obtaining low entropy of the output empirical distribution. Our
approach delivers consistent gains across both object recognition and visual
question answering (VQA), with improvements of up to 52.4% and 29.8%,
respectively, and average boosts of 24.6% and 10.0% across 16
datasets.Remarkably, on image recognition, TTRV applied to InternVL 8B
surpasses GPT-4o by an average of 2.3% over 8 benchmarks, while remaining
highly competitive on VQA, demonstrating that test-time reinforcement learning
can match or exceed the strongest proprietary models. Finally, we find many
interesting properties of test-time RL for VLMs: for example, even in extremely
data-constrained scenarios, where adaptation is performed on a single randomly
chosen unlabeled test example, TTRV still yields non-trivial improvements of up
to 5.5% in recognition tasks.

*Shoumeng Qiu,Xinrun Li,Yang Long,Xiangyang Xue,Varun Ojha,Jian Pu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MapGR is a new architecture for online HD map construction that learns global representations from queries, addressing limitations of local query perspectives in existing DETR-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DETR-based HD map construction methods rely on independent learnable object queries with local perspectives, neglecting the inherent global representation within HD maps.

Method: Proposes MapGR with two modules: Global Representation Learning (GRL) module that aligns query distribution with global maps via holistic segmentation, and Global Representation Guidance (GRG) module that provides global contextual information to individual queries.

Result: Evaluations on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets show substantial improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP) compared to leading baselines.

Conclusion: Learning and utilizing global representations from queries significantly enhances HD map construction performance.

Abstract: The online construction of vectorized high-definition (HD) maps is a
cornerstone of modern autonomous driving systems. State-of-the-art approaches,
particularly those based on the DETR framework, formulate this as an instance
detection problem. However, their reliance on independent, learnable object
queries results in a predominantly local query perspective, neglecting the
inherent global representation within HD maps. In this work, we propose
\textbf{MapGR} (\textbf{G}lobal \textbf{R}epresentation learning for HD
\textbf{Map} construction), an architecture designed to learn and utilize a
global representations from queries. Our method introduces two synergistic
modules: a Global Representation Learning (GRL) module, which encourages the
distribution of all queries to better align with the global map through a
carefully designed holistic segmentation task, and a Global Representation
Guidance (GRG) module, which endows each individual query with explicit,
global-level contextual information to facilitate its optimization. Evaluations
on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets validate the efficacy of our approach,
demonstrating substantial improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP) compared
to leading baselines.

*Teng Wang,Haojun Jiang,Yuxuan Wang,Zhenguo Sun,Shiji Song,Gao Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Vision-Action Adapter (VA-Adapter) that enables ultrasound foundation models to provide real-time probe guidance for cardiac ultrasound imaging, helping junior sonographers acquire high-quality images by adapting medical knowledge to probe adjustment tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a shortage of skilled cardiac ultrasound operators due to the high operational difficulty, which prevents patients from receiving timely examinations. The authors aim to leverage foundation models' medical knowledge to assist junior sonographers in acquiring high-quality ultrasound images through real-time probe guidance.

Method: The authors design a parameter-efficient Vision-Action Adapter (VA-Adapter) that enables foundation models' image encoders to process vision-action sequences. This adapter incorporates sequential reasoning capabilities and allows fine-tuning of only a small subset of parameters to learn precise probe adjustment strategies.

Result: Extensive experiments show that the VA-Adapter can surpass strong probe guidance models, demonstrating effective performance in providing real-time operational recommendations for ultrasound probe adjustments.

Conclusion: The VA-Adapter successfully adapts medical foundation models to probe guidance tasks, enabling junior sonographers to acquire high-quality cardiac ultrasound images through real-time guidance while maintaining parameter efficiency through selective fine-tuning.

Abstract: Echocardiography is a critical tool for detecting heart diseases. Recently,
ultrasound foundation models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
cardiac ultrasound image analysis. However, obtaining high-quality ultrasound
images is a prerequisite for accurate diagnosis. Due to the exceptionally high
operational difficulty of cardiac ultrasound, there is a shortage of highly
skilled personnel, which hinders patients from receiving timely examination
services. In this paper, we aim to adapt the medical knowledge learned by
foundation models from vast datasets to the probe guidance task, which is
designed to provide real-time operational recommendations for junior
sonographers to acquire high-quality ultrasound images. Moreover, inspired by
the practice where experts optimize action decisions based on past
explorations, we meticulously design a parameter-efficient Vision-Action
Adapter (VA-Adapter) to enable foundation model's image encoder to encode
vision-action sequences, thereby enhancing guidance performance. With built-in
sequential reasoning capabilities in a compact design, the VA-Adapter enables a
pre-trained ultrasound foundation model to learn precise probe adjustment
strategies by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the VA-Adapter can surpass strong probe guidance
models. Our code will be released after acceptance.

### [57] [Graph Conditioned Diffusion for Controllable Histopathology Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07129)
*Sarah Cechnicka,Matthew Baugh,Weitong Zhang,Mischa Dombrowski,Zhe Li,Johannes C. Paetzold,Candice Roufosse,Bernhard Kainz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Graph-Conditioned-Diffusion, a method that uses graph-based object-level representations to enable fine-grained control over medical image generation in diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models operate in noisy latent spaces lacking semantic structure, making controlled generation challenging in medical imaging where structural consistency is critical for diagnosis.

Method: The approach generates graph nodes for each major structure in medical images, processes them with a transformer module, and integrates them into diffusion models via text-conditioning mechanisms.

Result: The method was evaluated on histopathology data and demonstrated that generated data can reliably substitute for annotated patient data in downstream segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: Graph-based object-level representations enable meaningful control over medical image generation while maintaining structural integrity critical for diagnostic applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have set new
standards in high-quality image synthesis. Yet, controlled generation remains
challenging, particularly in sensitive areas such as medical imaging. Medical
images feature inherent structure such as consistent spatial arrangement, shape
or texture, all of which are critical for diagnosis. However, existing DPMs
operate in noisy latent spaces that lack semantic structure and strong priors,
making it difficult to ensure meaningful control over generated content. To
address this, we propose graph-based object-level representations for
Graph-Conditioned-Diffusion. Our approach generates graph nodes corresponding
to each major structure in the image, encapsulating their individual features
and relationships. These graph representations are processed by a transformer
module and integrated into a diffusion model via the text-conditioning
mechanism, enabling fine-grained control over generation. We evaluate this
approach using a real-world histopathology use case, demonstrating that our
generated data can reliably substitute for annotated patient data in downstream
segmentation tasks. The code is available here.

*Mitchell Keren Taraday,Shahaf Wagner,Chaim Baskin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EDJE is an efficient vision-language reranker that precomputes and compresses visual tokens offline, enabling high-throughput inference while maintaining strong retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language joint encoders like BLIP are bottlenecked by expensive visual feature extraction, preventing practical deployment at scale for multimodal retrieval.

Method: EDJE precomputes vision tokens offline and compresses them via a lightweight attention-based adapter, allowing online inference to run only a compact joint encoder over a small set of visual tokens plus text.

Result: EDJE processes 50k image-text pairs/second while requiring only 49kB of disk storage per image, matching prior art performance on Flickr (zero-shot) and COCO (fine-tuned) retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: EDJE enables practical deployment of vision-language rerankers at scale by drastically reducing storage and online compute requirements while preserving strong retrieval performance.

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval still leans on embedding-based models like CLIP for fast
vector search over pre-computed image embeddings. Yet, unlike text retrieval,
where joint-encoder rerankers are standard, comparable vision--language
rerankers are largely absent. We find that seminal joint encoders such as BLIP
are severely bottlenecked by an expensive visual feature-extraction stage,
preventing practical deployment at scale. Motivated by this bottleneck, we
introduce EDJE, an Efficient Discriminative Joint Encoder that precomputes
vision tokens offline and compresses them via a lightweight attention-based
adapter, so online inference runs only a compact joint encoder over a small set
of visual tokens plus the text. EDJE preserves strong retrieval performance
while drastically reducing storage and online compute, enabling high-throughput
inference. Specifically, EDJE processes 50k image--text pairs/second while
requiring 49kB of disk storage per image, matching prior art on Flickr
(zero-shot) and COCO (fine-tuned) retrieval. The implementation and checkpoints
will be made publicly available shortly.

*Jaeseok Jeong,Junho Kim,Gayoung Lee,Yunjey Choi,Youngjung Uh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes negative visual query guidance (NVQG) to reduce content leakage in visual prompting for text-to-image generation, extending classifier-free guidance with swapping self-attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual prompting methods suffer from content leakage where undesired elements from visual style prompts are transferred along with intended style.

Method: Extends classifier-free guidance with swapping self-attention and proposes NVQG that uses negative scores by simulating content leakage scenarios through query swapping in self-attention layers.

Result: Significantly reduces content leakage while maintaining style transfer quality, outperforming existing approaches across various styles and text prompts.

Conclusion: NVQG provides an effective solution for precise style control in text-to-image generation by preventing unwanted content transfer from visual style prompts.

Abstract: In the domain of text-to-image generation, diffusion models have emerged as
powerful tools. Recently, studies on visual prompting, where images are used as
prompts, have enabled more precise control over style and content. However,
existing methods often suffer from content leakage, where undesired elements of
the visual style prompt are transferred along with the intended style. To
address this issue, we 1) extend classifier-free guidance (CFG) to utilize
swapping self-attention and propose 2) negative visual query guidance (NVQG) to
reduce the transfer of unwanted contents. NVQG employs negative score by
intentionally simulating content leakage scenarios that swap queries instead of
key and values of self-attention layers from visual style prompts. This simple
yet effective method significantly reduces content leakage. Furthermore, we
provide careful solutions for using a real image as visual style prompts.
Through extensive evaluation across various styles and text prompts, our method
demonstrates superiority over existing approaches, reflecting the style of the
references, and ensuring that resulting images match the text prompts. Our code

*Mikihiro Ikura,Arren Glover,Masayoshi Mizuno,Chiara Bartolozzi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Real-time line segment detection and tracking using only a high-resolution event-based camera, achieving higher accuracy than existing methods without needing frame cameras.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event-based cameras efficiently capture edge information but current methods either require additional frame cameras or struggle with high event rates from modern high-resolution sensors.

Method: Lattice-allocated pipeline with velocity-invariant event representation, line segment detection using fitting scores, and line segment tracking through endpoint perturbation.

Result: Demonstrates real-time performance and higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art event-only and event-frame hybrid baselines on both custom and public datasets.

Conclusion: Enables fully stand-alone event camera operation in real-world settings by providing efficient line segment extraction without additional frame cameras.

Abstract: Line segment extraction is effective for capturing geometric features of
human-made environments. Event-based cameras, which asynchronously respond to
contrast changes along edges, enable efficient extraction by reducing redundant
data. However, recent methods often rely on additional frame cameras or
struggle with high event rates. This research addresses real-time line segment
detection and tracking using only a modern, high-resolution (i.e., high event
rate) event-based camera. Our lattice-allocated pipeline consists of (i)
velocity-invariant event representation, (ii) line segment detection based on a
fitting score, (iii) and line segment tracking by perturbating endpoints.
Evaluation using ad-hoc recorded dataset and public datasets demonstrates
real-time performance and higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art
event-only and event-frame hybrid baselines, enabling fully stand-alone event
camera operation in real-world settings.

### [61] [Continual Action Quality Assessment via Adaptive Manifold-Aligned Graph Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06842)
*Kanglei Zhou,Qingyi Pan,Xingxing Zhang,Hubert P. H. Shum,Frederick W. B. Li,Xiaohui Liang,Liyuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Continual AQA (CAQA) to handle evolving quality distributions in action assessment, proposes MAGR++ method with adaptive manifold-aligned graph regularization to prevent catastrophic forgetting while enabling effective representation learning, and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on new CAQA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional Action Quality Assessment methods struggle with non-stationary quality distributions in real-world scenarios, limiting generalization. Continual Learning capabilities are needed to handle evolving distributions while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Proposes MAGR++ method with: (1) Full-Parameter Fine-Tuning for effective representation learning, (2) Adaptive manifold-aligned graph regularization that stabilizes shallow layers while adapting deeper ones, (3) Two-step feature rectification pipeline with manifold projector and graph regularizer to align distributions.

Result: MAGR++ achieves state-of-the-art performance with average correlation gains of 3.6% offline and 12.2% online over strongest baselines. Four CAQA benchmarks constructed from three datasets with tailored evaluation protocols.

Conclusion: The proposed MAGR++ method effectively addresses the challenges of Continual AQA by balancing representation learning and forgetting prevention, demonstrating robustness and effectiveness across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) quantifies human actions in videos,
supporting applications in sports scoring, rehabilitation, and skill
evaluation. A major challenge lies in the non-stationary nature of quality
distributions in real-world scenarios, which limits the generalization ability
of conventional methods. We introduce Continual AQA (CAQA), which equips AQA
with Continual Learning (CL) capabilities to handle evolving distributions
while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Although parameter-efficient
fine-tuning of pretrained models has shown promise in CL for image
classification, we find it insufficient for CAQA. Our empirical and theoretical
analyses reveal two insights: (i) Full-Parameter Fine-Tuning (FPFT) is
necessary for effective representation learning; yet (ii) uncontrolled FPFT
induces overfitting and feature manifold shift, thereby aggravating forgetting.
To address this, we propose Adaptive Manifold-Aligned Graph Regularization
(MAGR++), which couples backbone fine-tuning that stabilizes shallow layers
while adapting deeper ones with a two-step feature rectification pipeline: a
manifold projector to translate deviated historical features into the current
representation space, and a graph regularizer to align local and global
distributions. We construct four CAQA benchmarks from three datasets with
tailored evaluation protocols and strong baselines, enabling systematic
cross-dataset comparison. Extensive experiments show that MAGR++ achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with average correlation gains of 3.6% offline
and 12.2% online over the strongest baseline, confirming its robustness and
effectiveness. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZhouKanglei/MAGRPP.

### [62] [Resolution scaling governs DINOv3 transfer performance in chest radiograph classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07191)
*Soroosh Tayebi Arasteh,Mina Shaigan,Christiane Kuhl,Jakob Nikolas Kather,Sven Nebelung,Daniel Truhn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINOv3 SSL model with 512x512 resolution and ConvNeXt-B backbone provides optimal performance for chest radiography interpretation, outperforming DINOv2 and ImageNet initialization, with greatest benefits for detecting subtle or boundary-centered lesions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate whether Meta's DINOv3 SSL model improvements translate to better performance in chest radiography interpretation compared to DINOv2 and ImageNet initialization, given the modality's fine-grained findings and high volume.

Method: Benchmarked DINOv3 against DINOv2 and ImageNet initialization across 7 datasets (n>814,000) using ViT-B/16 and ConvNeXt-B backbones at 224x224, 512x512, and 1024x1024 resolutions. Also assessed frozen features from 7B model. Primary outcome was mean AUROC across labels.

Result: At 512x512 resolution, DINOv3 consistently outperformed both DINOv2 and ImageNet. ConvNeXt-B outperformed ViT-B/16 across all settings. Frozen DINOv3-7B features underperformed finetuned 86-89M parameter backbones. 1024x1024 resolution showed no further improvement. Resolution gains were most evident for boundary-dependent and small focal abnormalities.

Conclusion: 512x512 pixels represent the practical upper limit for chest radiography, where DINOv3-initialized ConvNeXt-B networks provide strongest performance. Higher input resolution is critical for leveraging modern SSL models, with greatest clinical gains expected for detecting subtle or boundary-centered lesions in emergency and critical care settings.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has advanced visual representation learning,
but its value in chest radiography, a high-volume imaging modality with
fine-grained findings, remains unclear. Meta's DINOv3 extends earlier SSL
models through Gram-anchored self-distillation. Whether these design choices
improve transfer learning for chest radiography has not been systematically
tested. We benchmarked DINOv3 against DINOv2 and ImageNet initialization across
seven datasets (n>814,000). Two representative backbones were evaluated:
ViT-B/16 and ConvNeXt-B. Images were analyzed at 224x224, 512x512, and
1024x1024 pixels. We additionally assessed frozen features from a 7B model. The
primary outcome was mean AUROC across labels. At 224x224, DINOv3 and DINOv2
achieved comparable performance on adult datasets. Increasing resolution to
512x512 yielded consistent improvements for DINOv3 over both DINOv2 and
ImageNet. In contrast, results in pediatric cohort showed no differences across
initializations. Across all settings, ConvNeXt-B outperformed ViT-B/16. Models
using frozen DINOv3-7B features underperformed relative to fully finetuned
86-89M-parameter backbones, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation.
Scaling to 1024x1024 did not further improve accuracy. Resolution-related gains
were most evident for boundary-dependent and small focal abnormalities. In
chest radiography, higher input resolution is critical for leveraging the
benefits of modern self-supervised models. 512x512 pixels represent a practical
upper limit where DINOv3-initialized ConvNeXt-B networks provide the strongest
performance, while larger inputs offer minimal return on cost. Clinically,
these findings support use of finetuned, mid-sized backbones at 512x512 for
chest radiograph interpretation, with the greatest gains expected in detecting
subtle or boundary-centered lesions relevant to emergency and critical care
settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Online Generic Event Boundary Detection (On-GEBD), a new task for detecting event boundaries in streaming videos in real-time without future frame access, and proposes the Estimator framework inspired by human event segmentation theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GEBD methods require processing complete video frames offline, unlike humans who process data online and in real-time. The authors aim to bridge this gap by enabling real-time event boundary detection in streaming videos.

Method: The proposed Estimator framework has two components: Consistent Event Anticipator (CEA) that predicts future frames based on prior frames, and Online Boundary Discriminator (OBD) that measures prediction error and adaptively adjusts thresholds using statistical tests on past errors to detect event transitions.

Result: Experiments show that Estimator outperforms all baselines adapted from recent online video understanding models and achieves performance comparable to prior offline-GEBD methods on Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed On-GEBD framework successfully enables real-time event boundary detection in streaming videos, bridging the gap between computational methods and human-like online processing capabilities.

Abstract: Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) aims to interpret long-form videos
through the lens of human perception. However, current GEBD methods require
processing complete video frames to make predictions, unlike humans processing
data online and in real-time. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new task,
Online Generic Event Boundary Detection (On-GEBD), aiming to detect boundaries
of generic events immediately in streaming videos. This task faces unique
challenges of identifying subtle, taxonomy-free event changes in real-time,
without the access to future frames. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
novel On-GEBD framework, Estimator, inspired by Event Segmentation Theory (EST)
which explains how humans segment ongoing activity into events by leveraging
the discrepancies between predicted and actual information. Our framework
consists of two key components: the Consistent Event Anticipator (CEA), and the
Online Boundary Discriminator (OBD). Specifically, the CEA generates a
prediction of the future frame reflecting current event dynamics based solely
on prior frames. Then, the OBD measures the prediction error and adaptively
adjusts the threshold using statistical tests on past errors to capture
diverse, subtle event transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that
Estimator outperforms all baselines adapted from recent online video
understanding models and achieves performance comparable to prior offline-GEBD
methods on the Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS datasets.

Motivation: Existing text-to-image models struggle with complex prompts, leading to semantic inconsistencies and missing details. Current solutions like fine-tuning are model-specific and require training, while automatic prompt optimization methods lack systematic error analysis and refinement strategies.

Method: GenPilot uses a multi-agent system with error analysis, clustering-based adaptive exploration, fine-grained verification, and a memory module for iterative optimization. It operates directly on input text and is model-agnostic.

Result: Experiments on DPG-bench and Geneval show improvements of up to 16.9% and 5.7% in text-image consistency and structural coherence. The approach effectively handles long and complex prompts.

Conclusion: GenPilot provides an effective test-time prompt optimization strategy that is flexible, interpretable, and model-agnostic, significantly improving text-to-image synthesis quality while offering insights into common error patterns and refinement strategies.

Abstract: Text-to-image synthesis has made remarkable progress, yet accurately
interpreting complex and lengthy prompts remains challenging, often resulting
in semantic inconsistencies and missing details. Existing solutions, such as
fine-tuning, are model-specific and require training, while prior automatic
prompt optimization (APO) approaches typically lack systematic error analysis
and refinement strategies, resulting in limited reliability and effectiveness.
Meanwhile, test-time scaling methods operate on fixed prompts and on noise or
sample numbers, limiting their interpretability and adaptability. To solve
these, we introduce a flexible and efficient test-time prompt optimization
strategy that operates directly on the input text. We propose a plug-and-play
multi-agent system called GenPilot, integrating error analysis,
clustering-based adaptive exploration, fine-grained verification, and a memory
module for iterative optimization. Our approach is model-agnostic,
interpretable, and well-suited for handling long and complex prompts.
Simultaneously, we summarize the common patterns of errors and the refinement
strategy, offering more experience and encouraging further exploration.
Experiments on DPG-bench and Geneval with improvements of up to 16.9% and 5.7%
demonstrate the strong capability of our methods in enhancing the text and

Abstract: Lung infections, particularly pneumonia, pose serious health risks that can
escalate rapidly, especially during pandemics. Accurate AI-based severity
prediction from medical imaging is essential to support timely clinical
decisions and optimize patient outcomes. In this work, we present a novel

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel active learning approach for change detection in remote sensing that selects the most critical unlabeled samples for labeling using an invertible graph convnet and adversarial loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing change detection methods rely heavily on hand-labeled training data, which is expensive and subjective. The paper aims to reduce labeling costs while maintaining performance.

Method: Uses active learning with an invertible graph convnet to generate virtual exemplars. These exemplars are selected based on representativity, diversity, and ambiguity criteria through adversarial optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the method's effectiveness in label-efficient learning, outperforming comparative approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed active learning framework successfully reduces labeling requirements while maintaining change detection performance through strategic sample selection.

Abstract: Change detection is a major task in remote sensing which consists in finding
all the occurrences of changes in multi-temporal satellite or aerial images.
The success of existing methods, and particularly deep learning ones, is
tributary to the availability of hand-labeled training data that capture the
acquisition conditions and the subjectivity of the user (oracle). In this
paper, we devise a novel change detection algorithm, based on active learning.
The main contribution of our work resides in a new model that measures how
important is each unlabeled sample, and provides an oracle with only the most
critical samples (also referred to as virtual exemplars) for further labeling.
These exemplars are generated, using an invertible graph convnet, as the
optimum of an adversarial loss that (i) measures representativity, diversity
and ambiguity of the data, and thereby (ii) challenges (the most) the current
change detection criteria, leading to a better re-estimate of these criteria in
the subsequent iterations of active learning. Extensive experiments show the
positive impact of our label-efficient learning model against comparative
methods.

TL;DR: IAR2 is an advanced autoregressive framework that improves visual content generation through hierarchical semantic-detail synthesis using a dual codebook system and progressive attention-guided conditional generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of previous autoregressive models that overlook structural properties of visual data, and to address constraints of rigid pre-trained codebooks and inaccurate hard clustering in prior work IAR.

Method: Uses Semantic-Detail Associated Dual Codebook to decouple image representations into semantic and detail components, Semantic-Detail Autoregressive Prediction with Local-Context Enhanced Autoregressive Head for hierarchical prediction, and Progressive Attention-Guided Adaptive CFG for conditional generation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with FID of 1.50 on ImageNet, surpassing previous methods while demonstrating superior computational efficiency.

Conclusion: IAR2's structured, coarse-to-fine generation strategy effectively enhances autoregressive image generation through hierarchical semantic-detail synthesis and adaptive conditional guidance.

Abstract: Autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for visual content
creation, but often overlook the intrinsic structural properties of visual
data. Our prior work, IAR, initiated a direction to address this by
reorganizing the visual codebook based on embedding similarity, thereby
improving generation robustness. However, it is constrained by the rigidity of
pre-trained codebooks and the inaccuracies of hard, uniform clustering. To
overcome these limitations, we propose IAR2, an advanced autoregressive
framework that enables a hierarchical semantic-detail synthesis process. At the
core of IAR2 is a novel Semantic-Detail Associated Dual Codebook, which
decouples image representations into a semantic codebook for global semantic
information and a detail codebook for fine-grained refinements. It expands the
quantization capacity from a linear to a polynomial scale, significantly
enhancing expressiveness. To accommodate this dual representation, we propose a
Semantic-Detail Autoregressive Prediction scheme coupled with a Local-Context
Enhanced Autoregressive Head, which performs hierarchical prediction-first the
semantic token, then the detail token-while leveraging a local context window
to enhance spatial coherence. Furthermore, for conditional generation, we
introduce a Progressive Attention-Guided Adaptive CFG mechanism that
dynamically modulates the guidance scale for each token based on its relevance
to the condition and its temporal position in the generation sequence,
improving conditional alignment without sacrificing realism. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that IAR2 sets a new state-of-the-art for
autoregressive image generation, achieving a FID of 1.50 on ImageNet. Our model
not only surpasses previous methods in performance but also demonstrates
superior computational efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of our
structured, coarse-to-fine generation strategy.

*Bing Li,Wuqi Wang,Yanan Zhang,Jingzheng Li,Haigen Min,Wei Feng,Xingyu Zhao,Jie Zhang,Qing Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Phy3DAdvGen, a text-to-3D adversarial generation method that creates physically realizable 3D objects invisible to LiDAR detectors, addressing limitations of existing attacks that rarely cause complete object disappearance and are difficult to implement physically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D adversarial attacks for LiDAR-based object detectors have critical limitations - they rarely cause complete object disappearance and are difficult to implement in physical environments, posing safety risks for autonomous driving systems that need thorough testing before deployment.

Method: The proposed Phy3DAdvGen systematically optimizes text prompts by iteratively refining verbs, objects, and poses to generate LiDAR-invisible pedestrians. It uses a physically-informed approach with a comprehensive object pool of 13 real 3D models, constraining generation to combinations of these objects to ensure physical realizability.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach can generate 3D pedestrians that evade six state-of-the-art LiDAR 3D detectors in both CARLA simulation and physical environments, successfully highlighting vulnerabilities in safety-critical applications.

Conclusion: The text-to-3D adversarial generation method enables physically realizable attacks that can create 3D objects truly invisible to LiDAR detectors, providing an effective approach for testing and exposing vulnerabilities in autonomous driving systems before real-world deployment.

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D object detectors are fundamental to autonomous driving, where
failing to detect objects poses severe safety risks. Developing effective 3D
adversarial attacks is essential for thoroughly testing these detection systems
and exposing their vulnerabilities before real-world deployment. However,
existing adversarial attacks that add optimized perturbations to 3D points have
two critical limitations: they rarely cause complete object disappearance and
prove difficult to implement in physical environments. We introduce the
text-to-3D adversarial generation method, a novel approach enabling physically
realizable attacks that can generate 3D models of objects truly invisible to
LiDAR detectors and be easily realized in the real world. Specifically, we
present the first empirical study that systematically investigates the factors
influencing detection vulnerability by manipulating the topology, connectivity,
and intensity of individual pedestrian 3D models and combining pedestrians with
multiple objects within the CARLA simulation environment. Building on the
insights, we propose the physically-informed text-to-3D adversarial generation
(Phy3DAdvGen) that systematically optimizes text prompts by iteratively
refining verbs, objects, and poses to produce LiDAR-invisible pedestrians. To
ensure physical realizability, we construct a comprehensive object pool
containing 13 3D models of real objects and constrain Phy3DAdvGen to generate
3D objects based on combinations of objects in this set. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach can generate 3D pedestrians that evade six
state-of-the-art (SOTA) LiDAR 3D detectors in both CARLA simulation and
physical environments, thereby highlighting vulnerabilities in safety-critical
applications.

### [69] [Addressing the ID-Matching Challenge in Long Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06973)
*Zhantao Yang,Huangji Wang,Ruili Feng,Han Zhang,Yuting Hu,Shangwen Zhu,Junyan Li,Yu Liu,Fan Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes RICE, a method that enhances ID-Matching in long video captioning by leveraging LVLMs' inherent capabilities, improving precision from 50% to 90% and recall from 15% to 80%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long video captioning faces challenges in accurately recognizing the same individuals across different frames (ID-Matching problem), which few prior works address effectively.

Method: Built on LVLMs, RICE improves ID-Matching through two approaches: enhancing image information usage and increasing individual description quantity, validated via a new benchmark.

Result: RICE significantly improves ID-Matching performance, with precision increasing from 50% to 90% and recall from 15% to 80% when implemented on GPT-4o.

Conclusion: RICE enables continuous tracking of individuals in long video captions, demonstrating superior caption quality and ID-Matching performance over baseline methods.

Abstract: Generating captions for long and complex videos is both critical and
challenging, with significant implications for the growing fields of
text-to-video generation and multi-modal understanding. One key challenge in
long video captioning is accurately recognizing the same individuals who appear
in different frames, which we refer to as the ID-Matching problem. Few prior
works have focused on this important issue. Those that have, usually suffer
from limited generalization and depend on point-wise matching, which limits
their overall effectiveness. In this paper, unlike previous approaches, we
build upon LVLMs to leverage their powerful priors. We aim to unlock the
inherent ID-Matching capabilities within LVLMs themselves to enhance the
ID-Matching performance of captions. Specifically, we first introduce a new
benchmark for assessing the ID-Matching capabilities of video captions. Using
this benchmark, we investigate LVLMs containing GPT-4o, revealing key insights
that the performance of ID-Matching can be improved through two methods: 1)
enhancing the usage of image information and 2) increasing the quantity of
information of individual descriptions. Based on these insights, we propose a
novel video captioning method called Recognizing Identities for Captioning
Effectively (RICE). Extensive experiments including assessments of caption
quality and ID-Matching performance, demonstrate the superiority of our
approach. Notably, when implemented on GPT-4o, our RICE improves the precision
of ID-Matching from 50% to 90% and improves the recall of ID-Matching from 15%
to 80% compared to baseline. RICE makes it possible to continuously track
different individuals in the captions of long videos.

*Girolamo Macaluso,Lorenzo Mandelli,Mirko Bicchierai,Stefano Berretti,Andrew D. Bagdanov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A post-training RL framework that fine-tunes pretrained motion diffusion models using only textual prompts, without requiring motion ground truth data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models for human motion generation require costly retraining with additional motion capture data to adapt to new actions or styles, making scaling difficult.

Method: Uses Reinforcement Learning with a pretrained text-motion retrieval network as reward signal, optimizing diffusion policy with Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization to shift generative distribution toward target domains.

Result: Consistently improves quality and diversity of generated motions in cross-dataset adaptation and leave-one-out experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets, while preserving original distribution performance.

Conclusion: Provides a flexible, data-efficient, and privacy-preserving solution for motion adaptation that works with both latent- and joint-space diffusion architectures.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced human motion generation, producing
realistic and diverse animations from textual prompts. However, adapting these
models to unseen actions or styles typically requires additional motion capture
data and full retraining, which is costly and difficult to scale. We propose a
post-training framework based on Reinforcement Learning that fine-tunes
pretrained motion diffusion models using only textual prompts, without
requiring any motion ground truth. Our approach employs a pretrained
text-motion retrieval network as a reward signal and optimizes the diffusion
policy with Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization, effectively shifting the
model's generative distribution toward the target domain without relying on
paired motion data. We evaluate our method on cross-dataset adaptation and
leave-one-out motion experiments using the HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets across
both latent- and joint-space diffusion architectures. Results from quantitative
metrics and user studies show that our approach consistently improves the
quality and diversity of generated motions, while preserving performance on the
original distribution. Our approach is a flexible, data-efficient, and
privacy-preserving solution for motion adaptation.

TL;DR: A novel approach combining deep learning with Bayesian modeling using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) integrated with Transformer Encoder-based DNNs for temporal consistency in yearly land-cover maps from satellite image time series.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve temporal consistency of yearly land-cover maps for modeling land cover evolution and change over years, and to capture both intricate temporal correlations in yearly satellite image time series and specific patterns in multiyear crop type sequences.

Method: Combines deep learning with Bayesian modeling using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) integrated with Transformer Encoder-based DNNs, with HMM layer built on top of TE for cascade classification to discern consistent yearly crop-type sequences.

Result: Validation on multiyear crop type classification dataset spanning 47 crop types and six years of Sentinel-2 acquisitions shows HMMs enhance overall performance and F1 scores, demonstrating the importance of modeling temporal consistency in predicted labels.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively captures temporal correlations and patterns in multiyear crop sequences, with HMMs significantly improving classification performance and emphasizing the value of temporal consistency modeling.

Abstract: The temporal consistency of yearly land-cover maps is of great importance to
model the evolution and change of the land cover over the years. In this paper,
we focus the attention on a novel approach to classification of yearly
satellite image time series (SITS) that combines deep learning with Bayesian
modelling, using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) integrated with Transformer
Encoder (TE) based DNNs. The proposed approach aims to capture both i)
intricate temporal correlations in yearly SITS and ii) specific patterns in
multiyear crop type sequences. It leverages the cascade classification of an
HMM layer built on top of the TE, discerning consistent yearly crop-type
sequences. Validation on a multiyear crop type classification dataset spanning
47 crop types and six years of Sentinel-2 acquisitions demonstrates the
importance of modelling temporal consistency in the predicted labels. HMMs
enhance the overall performance and F1 scores, emphasising the effectiveness of
the proposed approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: U-Bench is the first comprehensive benchmark evaluating 100 U-Net variants across 28 datasets and 10 imaging modalities, introducing a novel U-Score metric and providing model selection guidance for medical image segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite U-Net's decade-long dominance in medical image segmentation with thousands of variants, there has been no comprehensive benchmark to systematically evaluate their performance, utility, statistical validation, efficiency, and generalization across diverse datasets.

Method: U-Bench evaluates models along three dimensions: statistical robustness, zero-shot generalization, and computational efficiency. It introduces a novel U-Score metric that captures the performance-efficiency trade-off and provides a model advisor agent for selecting suitable models based on dataset characteristics and architectural paradigms.

Result: The benchmark exposes gaps in previous evaluations and provides systematic analysis of how dataset characteristics and architectural paradigms impact model performance across diverse medical imaging modalities.

Conclusion: U-Bench establishes a foundation for fair, reproducible, and practically relevant benchmarking in the next decade of U-Net-based segmentation models, with all code, models, protocols, and weights publicly available for community use and extension.

Abstract: Over the past decade, U-Net has been the dominant architecture in medical
image segmentation, leading to the development of thousands of U-shaped
variants. Despite its widespread adoption, there is still no comprehensive
benchmark to systematically evaluate their performance and utility, largely
because of insufficient statistical validation and limited consideration of
efficiency and generalization across diverse datasets. To bridge this gap, we
present U-Bench, the first large-scale, statistically rigorous benchmark that
evaluates 100 U-Net variants across 28 datasets and 10 imaging modalities. Our
contributions are threefold: (1) Comprehensive Evaluation: U-Bench evaluates
models along three key dimensions: statistical robustness, zero-shot
generalization, and computational efficiency. We introduce a novel metric,
U-Score, which jointly captures the performance-efficiency trade-off, offering
a deployment-oriented perspective on model progress. (2) Systematic Analysis
and Model Selection Guidance: We summarize key findings from the large-scale
evaluation and systematically analyze the impact of dataset characteristics and
architectural paradigms on model performance. Based on these insights, we
propose a model advisor agent to guide researchers in selecting the most
suitable models for specific datasets and tasks. (3) Public Availability: We
provide all code, models, protocols, and weights, enabling the community to
reproduce our results and extend the benchmark with future methods. In summary,
U-Bench not only exposes gaps in previous evaluations but also establishes a
foundation for fair, reproducible, and practically relevant benchmarking in the
next decade of U-Net-based segmentation models. The project can be accessed at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel approach for retrieving images that share central concepts rather than just visual or semantic similarity, using bimodal Gaussian distribution modeling to identify underlying narratives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To go beyond conventional image retrieval methods by capturing the central concepts and underlying narrative of images, rather than just visual or semantic similarity.

Method: Proposes a novel approach based on two key observations: (1) neighbors in embedding space share at least one concept with query but not necessarily with each other, and (2) modeling the neighborhood with bimodal Gaussian distribution reveals meaningful structure for concept identification.

Result: Qualitative, quantitative, and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the approach in retrieving images that share central concepts.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses concept-based image retrieval by modeling neighborhood structure with bimodal Gaussian distributions, providing a more meaningful way to capture underlying narratives in images.

Abstract: A concept may reflect either a concrete or abstract idea. Given an input
image, this paper seeks to retrieve other images that share its central
concepts, capturing aspects of the underlying narrative. This goes beyond
conventional retrieval or clustering methods, which emphasize visual or
semantic similarity. We formally define the problem, outline key requirements,
and introduce appropriate evaluation metrics. We propose a novel approach
grounded in two key observations: (1) While each neighbor in the embedding
space typically shares at least one concept with the query, not all neighbors
necessarily share the same concept with one another. (2) Modeling this
neighborhood with a bimodal Gaussian distribution uncovers meaningful structure
that facilitates concept identification. Qualitative, quantitative, and human
evaluations confirm the effectiveness of our approach. See the package on PyPI:

TL;DR: DADO is a novel self-supervised model that combines attention mechanisms and depth models to discover objects in images without human annotations, using dynamic weighting to adapt between attention and depth features based on image characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised object discovery remains a significant challenge in computer vision, as existing methods struggle with noisy attention maps and complex scenes with varying depth planes.

Method: DADO combines attention mechanisms with depth models and employs dynamic weighting to adaptively emphasize either attention or depth features based on the global characteristics of each image.

Result: DADO outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks for object discovery accuracy and robustness, without requiring fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed DADO model effectively addresses challenges in unsupervised object discovery by adaptively combining attention and depth features, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Unsupervised object discovery, the task of identifying and localizing objects
in images without human-annotated labels, remains a significant challenge and a
growing focus in computer vision. In this work, we introduce a novel model,
DADO (Depth-Attention self-supervised technique for Discovering unseen
Objects), which combines an attention mechanism and a depth model to identify
potential objects in images. To address challenges such as noisy attention maps
or complex scenes with varying depth planes, DADO employs dynamic weighting to
adaptively emphasize attention or depth features based on the global
characteristics of each image. We evaluated DADO on standard benchmarks, where
it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in object discovery accuracy and
robustness without the need for fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper identifies concept hallucination issues in CLIP-based Concept Bottleneck Models and proposes CHILI to mitigate this problem by localizing concepts and improving explanation faithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the problem of concept hallucination in CLIP-based explainable AI systems, where CLIP incorrectly predicts concept presence/absence, undermining the faithfulness of explanations in Concept Bottleneck Models.

Method: The authors introduce CHILI (Concept Hallucination Inhibition via Localized Interpretability), which disentangles image embeddings and localizes pixels corresponding to target concepts to reduce hallucination and improve explanation interpretability.

Result: The approach successfully mitigates concept hallucination in CLIP-based systems and enables the generation of more interpretable saliency-based explanations.

Conclusion: CHILI provides an effective solution to concept hallucination in zero-shot CBMs, enhancing the faithfulness and interpretability of explanations in explainable AI systems.

Abstract: This paper addresses explainable AI (XAI) through the lens of Concept
Bottleneck Models (CBMs) that do not require explicit concept annotations,
relying instead on concepts extracted using CLIP in a zero-shot manner. We show
that CLIP, which is central in these techniques, is prone to concept
hallucination, incorrectly predicting the presence or absence of concepts
within an image in scenarios used in numerous CBMs, hence undermining the
faithfulness of explanations. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Concept
Hallucination Inhibition via Localized Interpretability (CHILI), a technique
that disentangles image embeddings and localizes pixels corresponding to target
concepts. Furthermore, our approach supports the generation of saliency-based
explanations that are more interpretable.

TL;DR: MoRe is a training-free monocular geometry refinement method that improves cross-view consistency and scale alignment through graph-based optimization using feature matching and local planar approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D foundation models have scale ambiguity and cross-view inconsistency issues that limit their broader application in 3D vision tasks.

Method: Uses feature matching between frames to establish correspondences, then applies graph-based optimization with local planar approximation using estimated 3D points and surface normals from monocular foundation models.

Result: Improves cross-view consistency, achieves scale alignment, enhances 3D reconstruction, and improves novel view synthesis especially in sparse view rendering scenarios.

Conclusion: MoRe provides an effective training-free solution to address scale ambiguity and cross-view inconsistency in monocular 3D foundation models, benefiting both 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis tasks.

Abstract: Monocular 3D foundation models offer an extensible solution for perception
tasks, making them attractive for broader 3D vision applications. In this
paper, we propose MoRe, a training-free Monocular Geometry Refinement method
designed to improve cross-view consistency and achieve scale alignment. To
induce inter-frame relationships, our method employs feature matching between
frames to establish correspondences. Rather than applying simple least squares
optimization on these matched points, we formulate a graph-based optimization
framework that performs local planar approximation using the estimated 3D
points and surface normals estimated by monocular foundation models. This
formulation addresses the scale ambiguity inherent in monocular geometric
priors while preserving the underlying 3D structure. We further demonstrate
that MoRe not only enhances 3D reconstruction but also improves novel view
synthesis, particularly in sparse view rendering scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Federated learning shows resilience to non-IID data caused by different MRI intensity normalization methods, achieving 92% Dice score for brain tumor segmentation comparable to centralized training while preserving data privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning in medical imaging faces challenges with data privacy, storage, and transfer. Federated learning addresses these but may struggle with non-IID data, particularly from different MRI intensity normalization methods.

Method: Simulated non-IID conditions by applying different MRI intensity normalization techniques to separate data subsets, then trained and tested brain tumor segmentation models using federated learning approaches.

Result: FL methods demonstrated resilience to inconsistently normalized data across clients, achieving 92% 3D Dice score comparable to centralized models trained with all data.

Conclusion: Federated learning is an effective solution for training high-performing medical imaging models without violating data privacy concerns, even when dealing with heterogeneous data from different normalization methods.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has been increasingly applied in medical imaging, however,
it requires large amounts of data, which raises many challenges related to data
privacy, storage, and transfer. Federated learning (FL) is a training paradigm
that overcomes these issues, though its effectiveness may be reduced when
dealing with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. This
study simulates non-IID conditions by applying different MRI intensity
normalization techniques to separate data subsets, reflecting a common cause of
heterogeneity. These subsets are then used for training and testing models for
brain tumor segmentation. The findings provide insights into the influence of
the MRI intensity normalization methods on segmentation models, both training
and inference. Notably, the FL methods demonstrated resilience to
inconsistently normalized data across clients, achieving the 3D Dice score of
92%, which is comparable to a centralized model (trained using all data). These
results indicate that FL is a solution to effectively train high-performing
models without violating data privacy, a crucial concern in medical
applications. The code is available at:

*Karim El Khoury,Maxime Zanella,Christophe De Vleeschouwer,Benoit Macq*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first structured benchmark for evaluating few-shot adaptation methods on Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models (RSVLMs), revealing that models with similar zero-shot performance can behave very differently in few-shot scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While RSVLMs show strong zero-shot performance, their generalization in low-data regimes like few-shot learning remains insufficiently explored, creating a need for systematic evaluation.

Method: Comprehensive experiments across ten remote sensing scene classification datasets using five few-shot adaptation strategies on three state-of-the-art RSVLMs with varying backbones.

Result: Models with similar zero-shot performance exhibit markedly different behavior under few-shot adaptation, with some RSVLMs being inherently more amenable to such adaptation than others. No clear winner among existing methods was found.

Conclusion: There is a need for more robust few-shot adaptation methods tailored to remote sensing, and the authors provide a reproducible benchmarking framework and open-source code to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models (RSVLMs) have shown remarkable
potential thanks to large-scale pretraining, achieving strong zero-shot
performance on various tasks. However, their ability to generalize in low-data
regimes, such as few-shot learning, remains insufficiently explored. In this
work, we present the first structured benchmark for evaluating few-shot
adaptation methods on RSVLMs. We conduct comprehensive experiments across ten
remote sensing scene classification datasets, applying five widely used
few-shot adaptation strategies to three state-of-the-art RSVLMs with varying
backbones. Our findings reveal that models with similar zero-shot performance
can exhibit markedly different behavior under few-shot adaptation, with some
RSVLMs being inherently more amenable to such adaptation than others. The
variability of performance and the absence of a clear winner among existing
methods highlight the need for the development of more robust methods for
few-shot adaptation tailored to RS. To facilitate future research, we provide a

TL;DR: Current benchmarks for evaluating visual token compression in MLLMs are noisy and suffer from task mismatch. Simple image downsampling outperforms advanced methods, revealing the need for better evaluation. The authors propose VTC-Bench with data filtering to denoise existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a task mismatch in current MLLM benchmarks when used for visual token compression evaluation, as they were designed for assessing perception/reasoning capabilities rather than compression techniques.

Method: Extensive experiments showing that simple image downsampling consistently beats advanced compression methods. Proposed VTC-Bench framework with data filtering mechanism to denoise existing benchmarks.

Result: Found that current benchmarks are noisy for visual token compression task, and downsampling serves as an effective data filter to evaluate sample difficulty in compression tasks.

Conclusion: VTC-Bench provides a fairer and more accurate assessment framework for visual token compression methods by incorporating data filtering to address benchmark noise.

Abstract: Recent endeavors to accelerate inference in Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) have primarily focused on visual token compression. The effectiveness
of these methods is typically assessed by measuring the accuracy drop on
established benchmarks, comparing model performance before and after
compression. However, these benchmarks are originally designed to assess the
perception and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, rather than to evaluate
compression techniques. As a result, directly applying them to visual token
compression introduces a task mismatch. Strikingly, our investigation reveals
that simple image downsampling consistently outperforms many advanced
compression methods across multiple widely used benchmarks. Through extensive
experiments, we make the following observations: (i) Current benchmarks are
noisy for the visual token compression task. (ii) Down-sampling is able to
serve as a data filter to evaluate the difficulty of samples in the visual
token compression task. Motivated by these findings, we introduce VTC-Bench, an
evaluation framework that incorporates a data filtering mechanism to denoise
existing benchmarks, thereby enabling fairer and more accurate assessment of
visual token compression methods. All data and code are available at

TL;DR: MV-Performer is a framework for generating synchronized 360-degree novel view videos from monocular human captures using camera-dependent normal maps and multi-view diffusion to handle seen/unseen ambiguity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video diffusion models struggle with 360-degree viewpoint changes and primarily focus on front-view camera trajectory redirection, especially in human-centric scenarios.

Method: Uses MVHumanNet dataset with camera-dependent normal maps from oriented partial point clouds, and a multi-view human-centric video diffusion model that fuses reference video, partial rendering, and viewpoint information.

Result: Extensive experiments on three datasets show state-of-the-art effectiveness and robustness for human-centric 4D novel view synthesis.

Conclusion: MV-Performer sets a strong benchmark for synchronized 360-degree novel view video generation from monocular human captures, with robust inference for in-the-wild videos.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video generation, powered by large-scale datasets and
diffusion techniques, have shown that video diffusion models can function as
implicit 4D novel view synthesizers. Nevertheless, current methods primarily
concentrate on redirecting camera trajectory within the front view while
struggling to generate 360-degree viewpoint changes. In this paper, we focus on
human-centric subdomain and present MV-Performer, an innovative framework for
creating synchronized novel view videos from monocular full-body captures. To
achieve a 360-degree synthesis, we extensively leverage the MVHumanNet dataset
and incorporate an informative condition signal. Specifically, we use the
camera-dependent normal maps rendered from oriented partial point clouds, which
effectively alleviate the ambiguity between seen and unseen observations. To
maintain synchronization in the generated videos, we propose a multi-view
human-centric video diffusion model that fuses information from the reference
video, partial rendering, and different viewpoints. Additionally, we provide a
robust inference procedure for in-the-wild video cases, which greatly mitigates
the artifacts induced by imperfect monocular depth estimation. Extensive
experiments on three datasets demonstrate our MV-Performer's state-of-the-art
effectiveness and robustness, setting a strong model for human-centric 4D novel
view synthesis.

*Shirin Shoushtari,Yi Wang,Xiao Shi,M. Salman Asif,Ulugbek S. Kamilov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EigenScore is a new OOD detection method that uses the eigenvalue spectrum of posterior covariance from diffusion models to detect distribution shifts, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved robustness in near-OOD scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Out-of-distribution detection is critical for safe deployment of ML systems in safety-sensitive domains. Diffusion models have shown promise for OOD detection, but existing methods struggle with near-OOD scenarios.

Method: Leverages eigenvalue spectrum of posterior covariance from diffusion models, using a Jacobian-free subspace iteration method to estimate leading eigenvalues with only forward evaluations of the denoiser.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 5% AUROC improvement over best baselines, and remains robust in near-OOD settings like CIFAR-10 vs CIFAR-100 where existing diffusion-based methods fail.

Conclusion: Posterior covariance provides a consistent signal for distribution shift, and EigenScore effectively leverages this spectral signature for reliable OOD detection with improved performance and robustness.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the safe deployment of
machine learning systems in safety-sensitive domains. Diffusion models have
recently emerged as powerful generative models, capable of capturing complex
data distributions through iterative denoising. Building on this progress,
recent work has explored their potential for OOD detection. We propose
EigenScore, a new OOD detection method that leverages the eigenvalue spectrum
of the posterior covariance induced by a diffusion model. We argue that
posterior covariance provides a consistent signal of distribution shift,
leading to larger trace and leading eigenvalues on OOD inputs, yielding a clear
spectral signature. We further provide analysis explicitly linking posterior
covariance to distribution mismatch, establishing it as a reliable signal for
OOD detection. To ensure tractability, we adopt a Jacobian-free subspace
iteration method to estimate the leading eigenvalues using only forward
evaluations of the denoiser. Empirically, EigenScore achieves SOTA performance,
with up to 5% AUROC improvement over the best baseline. Notably, it remains
robust in near-OOD settings such as CIFAR-10 vs CIFAR-100, where existing
diffusion-based methods often fail.

TL;DR: TalkCuts is a large-scale dataset for multi-shot human speech video generation with 164k clips, 500+ hours of diverse camera shots, and multimodal annotations. The authors also present Orator, an LLM-guided framework that generates coherent long-form videos, showing improved cinematographic quality when trained on TalkCuts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets focus on single-shot, static viewpoints, lacking diversity in camera shots and multimodal annotations needed for advanced multi-shot speech video generation research.

Method: Created TalkCuts dataset with 164k clips featuring diverse camera shots (close-up, half-body, full-body), detailed textual descriptions, 2D keypoints, and 3D SMPL-X motion annotations. Developed Orator, an LLM-guided multi-modal generation framework where language models direct camera transitions, gestures, and vocal modulation.

Result: Training on TalkCuts significantly enhances cinematographic coherence and visual appeal of generated multi-shot speech videos in both pose-guided and audio-driven settings. The dataset enables synthesis of coherent long-form videos.

Conclusion: TalkCuts provides a strong foundation for future work in controllable, multi-shot speech video generation and broader multimodal learning, addressing limitations of existing single-shot datasets.

Abstract: In this work, we present TalkCuts, a large-scale dataset designed to
facilitate the study of multi-shot human speech video generation. Unlike
existing datasets that focus on single-shot, static viewpoints, TalkCuts offers
164k clips totaling over 500 hours of high-quality human speech videos with
diverse camera shots, including close-up, half-body, and full-body views. The
dataset includes detailed textual descriptions, 2D keypoints and 3D SMPL-X
motion annotations, covering over 10k identities, enabling multimodal learning
and evaluation. As a first attempt to showcase the value of the dataset, we
present Orator, an LLM-guided multi-modal generation framework as a simple
baseline, where the language model functions as a multi-faceted director,
orchestrating detailed specifications for camera transitions, speaker
gesticulations, and vocal modulation. This architecture enables the synthesis
of coherent long-form videos through our integrated multi-modal video
generation module. Extensive experiments in both pose-guided and audio-driven
settings show that training on TalkCuts significantly enhances the
cinematographic coherence and visual appeal of generated multi-shot speech
videos. We believe TalkCuts provides a strong foundation for future work in
controllable, multi-shot speech video generation and broader multimodal

### [83] [Evaluating Fundus-Specific Foundation Models for Diabetic Macular Edema Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07277)
*Franco Javier Arellano,José Ignacio Orlando*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foundation Models (RETFound and FLAIR) for diabetic macular edema detection don't consistently outperform fine-tuned lightweight CNNs like EfficientNet-B0, suggesting traditional CNNs remain strong baselines in data-scarce medical imaging tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) causes vision loss but deep learning detection is limited by scarce annotated data. Foundation Models offer an alternative, but their effectiveness for fine-grained DME detection is unclear.

Method: Systematic comparison of two retinal foundation models (RETFound, FLAIR) vs EfficientNet-B0 across different training regimes on IDRiD, MESSIDOR-2 and OCT-and-Eye-Fundus-Images datasets.

Result: EfficientNet-B0 ranked first/second in most settings (ROC/PR curves), RETFound only showed promise in OEFI, FLAIR demonstrated competitive zero-shot performance with appropriate prompting.

Conclusion: Foundation Models may not be suitable for fine-grained ophthalmic tasks like DME detection even after fine-tuning, and lightweight CNNs remain strong baselines in data-scarce environments.

Abstract: Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) is a leading cause of vision loss among patients
with Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). While deep learning has shown promising results
for automatically detecting this condition from fundus images, its application
remains challenging due the limited availability of annotated data. Foundation
Models (FM) have emerged as an alternative solution. However, it is unclear if
they can cope with DME detection in particular. In this paper, we
systematically compare different FM and standard transfer learning approaches
for this task. Specifically, we compare the two most popular FM for retinal
images--RETFound and FLAIR--and an EfficientNet-B0 backbone, across different
training regimes and evaluation settings in IDRiD, MESSIDOR-2 and
OCT-and-Eye-Fundus-Images (OEFI). Results show that despite their scale, FM do
not consistently outperform fine-tuned CNNs in this task. In particular, an
EfficientNet-B0 ranked first or second in terms of area under the ROC and
precision/recall curves in most evaluation settings, with RETFound only showing
promising results in OEFI. FLAIR, on the other hand, demonstrated competitive
zero-shot performance, achieving notable AUC-PR scores when prompted
appropriately. These findings reveal that FM might not be a good tool for
fine-grained ophthalmic tasks such as DME detection even after fine-tuning,
suggesting that lightweight CNNs remain strong baselines in data-scarce
environments.

*Inzamamul Alam,Md Tanvir Islam,Khan Muhammad,Simon S. Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecGuard introduces a robust invisible image watermarking method using spectral projection in frequency domain with wavelet decomposition, achieving superior performance against various attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing watermarking methods lack robustness against transformations like distortions, image regeneration, and adversarial perturbations, creating real-world deployment challenges.

Method: Embeds messages in hidden convolution layers by converting spatial to frequency domain using spectral projection with wavelet decomposition. Uses Fast Fourier Transform approximation and strength factor for enhanced resilience. Decoder leverages Parseval's theorem for accurate watermark extraction.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models in comprehensive evaluations based on invisibility, capacity, and robustness metrics. Shows strong resilience against adversarial, geometric, and regeneration-based distortions.

Conclusion: SpecGuard provides an effective solution for robust invisible image watermarking that preserves copyrighted information under challenging transformations, with code released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Watermarking embeds imperceptible patterns into images for authenticity
verification. However, existing methods often lack robustness against various
transformations primarily including distortions, image regeneration, and
adversarial perturbation, creating real-world challenges. In this work, we
introduce SpecGuard, a novel watermarking approach for robust and invisible
image watermarking. Unlike prior approaches, we embed the message inside hidden
convolution layers by converting from the spatial domain to the frequency
domain using spectral projection of a higher frequency band that is decomposed
by wavelet projection. Spectral projection employs Fast Fourier Transform
approximation to transform spatial data into the frequency domain efficiently.
In the encoding phase, a strength factor enhances resilience against diverse
attacks, including adversarial, geometric, and regeneration-based distortions,
ensuring the preservation of copyrighted information. Meanwhile, the decoder
leverages Parseval's theorem to effectively learn and extract the watermark
pattern, enabling accurate retrieval under challenging transformations. We
evaluate the proposed SpecGuard based on the embedded watermark's invisibility,
capacity, and robustness. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed
SpecGuard outperforms the state-of-the-art models. To ensure reproducibility,
the full code is released on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how video diffusion transformers (DiTs) represent multi-instance interactions, introduces MATRIX-11K dataset with interaction-aware captions, proposes MATRIX regularization to improve interaction modeling, and develops InterGenEval evaluation protocol.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video DiTs struggle with modeling multi-instance or subject-object interactions, raising questions about how these models internally represent interactions.

Method: Curated MATRIX-11K dataset with interaction-aware captions and multi-instance mask tracks; conducted systematic analysis of semantic grounding and propagation; introduced MATRIX regularization to align attention with mask tracks; proposed InterGenEval evaluation protocol.

Result: Found interaction effects concentrate in small subset of layers; MATRIX improves interaction fidelity and semantic alignment while reducing drift and hallucination; extensive ablations validate design choices.

Conclusion: MATRIX regularization effectively enhances video DiTs' ability to model multi-instance interactions through targeted attention alignment, with improvements demonstrated in interaction fidelity and semantic alignment.

Abstract: Video DiTs have advanced video generation, yet they still struggle to model
multi-instance or subject-object interactions. This raises a key question: How
do these models internally represent interactions? To answer this, we curate
MATRIX-11K, a video dataset with interaction-aware captions and multi-instance
mask tracks. Using this dataset, we conduct a systematic analysis that
formalizes two perspectives of video DiTs: semantic grounding, via
video-to-text attention, which evaluates whether noun and verb tokens capture
instances and their relations; and semantic propagation, via video-to-video
attention, which assesses whether instance bindings persist across frames. We
find both effects concentrate in a small subset of interaction-dominant layers.
Motivated by this, we introduce MATRIX, a simple and effective regularization
that aligns attention in specific layers of video DiTs with multi-instance mask
tracks from the MATRIX-11K dataset, enhancing both grounding and propagation.
We further propose InterGenEval, an evaluation protocol for interaction-aware
video generation. In experiments, MATRIX improves both interaction fidelity and
semantic alignment while reducing drift and hallucination. Extensive ablations
validate our design choices. Codes and weights will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pixel-Perfect Depth is a monocular depth estimation model that uses pixel-space diffusion generation to create high-quality, artifact-free depth maps and point clouds, outperforming existing generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative depth estimation models using Stable Diffusion require VAE compression which introduces flying pixels at edges and details, degrading quality.

Method: Uses pixel-space diffusion generation instead of latent space, with two key designs: Semantics-Prompted Diffusion Transformers (SP-DiT) for semantic consistency and fine details, and Cascade DiT Design for progressive token increase to improve efficiency and accuracy.

Result: Achieves best performance among all published generative models across five benchmarks, and significantly outperforms all other models in edge-aware point cloud evaluation.

Conclusion: Direct pixel-space diffusion generation with semantic prompting and cascade design effectively eliminates VAE-induced artifacts and produces superior depth estimation quality.

Abstract: This paper presents Pixel-Perfect Depth, a monocular depth estimation model
based on pixel-space diffusion generation that produces high-quality,
flying-pixel-free point clouds from estimated depth maps. Current generative
depth estimation models fine-tune Stable Diffusion and achieve impressive
performance. However, they require a VAE to compress depth maps into latent
space, which inevitably introduces \textit{flying pixels} at edges and details.
Our model addresses this challenge by directly performing diffusion generation
in the pixel space, avoiding VAE-induced artifacts. To overcome the high
complexity associated with pixel-space generation, we introduce two novel
designs: 1) Semantics-Prompted Diffusion Transformers (SP-DiT), which
incorporate semantic representations from vision foundation models into DiT to
prompt the diffusion process, thereby preserving global semantic consistency
while enhancing fine-grained visual details; and 2) Cascade DiT Design that
progressively increases the number of tokens to further enhance efficiency and
accuracy. Our model achieves the best performance among all published
generative models across five benchmarks, and significantly outperforms all
other models in edge-aware point cloud evaluation.

TL;DR: This paper provides a comprehensive survey of Quantum-enhanced Computer Vision (QeCV), reviewing the field's fundamentals, methodologies, tools, and challenges for computer vision researchers interested in quantum computing applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between computer vision and quantum computing by providing a holistic reference that introduces QeCV concepts, methodologies, and tools to the computer vision community, enabling them to leverage quantum advantages in visual signal processing.

Method: The survey reviews QeCV using two main quantum computational paradigms (gate-based quantum computing and quantum annealing), explains operational principles of quantum computers, and provides comprehensive introductions to QeCV methodologies compatible with quantum hardware.

Result: A comprehensive reference that covers QeCV fundamentals, available quantum computing tools and learning materials, and discusses publishing/reviewing aspects, open challenges, and social implications of quantum-enhanced computer vision.

Conclusion: QeCV represents a promising interdisciplinary field with potential to transform visual signal processing through quantum advantages, but requires development of specialized algorithms and methodologies compatible with quantum hardware to fully realize its potential.

Abstract: Quantum-enhanced Computer Vision (QeCV) is a new research field at the
intersection of computer vision, optimisation theory, machine learning and
quantum computing. It has high potential to transform how visual signals are
processed and interpreted with the help of quantum computing that leverages
quantum-mechanical effects in computations inaccessible to classical (i.e.
non-quantum) computers. In scenarios where existing non-quantum methods cannot
find a solution in a reasonable time or compute only approximate solutions,
quantum computers can provide, among others, advantages in terms of better time
scalability for multiple problem classes. Parametrised quantum circuits can
also become, in the long term, a considerable alternative to classical neural
networks in computer vision. However, specialised and fundamentally new
algorithms must be developed to enable compatibility with quantum hardware and
unveil the potential of quantum computational paradigms in computer vision.
This survey contributes to the existing literature on QeCV with a holistic
review of this research field. It is designed as a quantum computing reference
for the computer vision community, targeting computer vision students,
scientists and readers with related backgrounds who want to familiarise
themselves with QeCV. We provide a comprehensive introduction to QeCV, its
specifics, and methodologies for formulations compatible with quantum hardware
and QeCV methods, leveraging two main quantum computational paradigms, i.e.
gate-based quantum computing and quantum annealing. We elaborate on the
operational principles of quantum computers and the available tools to access,
program and simulate them in the context of QeCV. Finally, we review existing
quantum computing tools and learning materials and discuss aspects related to
publishing and reviewing QeCV papers, open challenges and potential social
implications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Tenet, a framework that decomposes Referring Video Object Segmentation into referring, video, and segmentation factors, using temporal prompts and foundation models to avoid dense mask annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RVOS methods require end-to-end training with dense mask annotations, which is computation-consuming and less scalable. The authors aim to investigate the key to this task by leveraging foundation models.

Method: Decompose RVOS into three factors, use object detectors and trackers to produce temporal prompts, implement Prompt Preference Learning to evaluate prompt quality, and instruct image-based foundation segmentation models with these prompts.

Result: Experiments on RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the Tenet framework in producing high-quality masks for referred objects.

Conclusion: The Tenet framework enables efficient model adaptation to referring video object segmentation by leveraging foundation models and temporal prompts, avoiding the need for dense mask annotations.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment the object
referred to by the query sentence in the video. Most existing methods require
end-to-end training with dense mask annotations, which could be
computation-consuming and less scalable. In this work, we rethink the RVOS
problem and aim to investigate the key to this task. Based on existing
foundation segmentation models, we decompose the RVOS task into referring,
video, and segmentation factors, and propose a Temporal Prompt Generation and
Selection (Tenet) framework to address the referring and video factors while
leaving the segmentation problem to foundation models. To efficiently adapt
image-based foundation segmentation models to referring video object
segmentation, we leverage off-the-shelf object detectors and trackers to
produce temporal prompts associated with the referring sentence. While
high-quality temporal prompts could be produced, they can not be easily
identified from confidence scores. To tackle this issue, we propose Prompt
Preference Learning to evaluate the quality of the produced temporal prompts.
By taking such prompts to instruct image-based foundation segmentation models,
we would be able to produce high-quality masks for the referred object,
enabling efficient model adaptation to referring video object segmentation.
Experiments on RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the Tenet
framework.

*Leiyao Cui,Zihang Zhao,Sirui Xie,Wenhuan Zhang,Zhi Han,Yixin Zhu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Vi-TacMan combines vision for global guidance and tactile feedback for local precision in articulated object manipulation, achieving robust performance without explicit kinematic models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-based methods can be imprecise on unfamiliar objects, while tactile approaches require accurate initialization. There's a natural synergy between vision for global guidance and touch for local precision that hasn't been systematically exploited.

Method: Uses vision to propose grasps and coarse directions that seed a tactile controller for precise execution. Incorporates surface normals as geometric priors and models directions via von Mises-Fisher distributions.

Result: Achieves significant gains over baselines (all p<0.0001). Manipulation succeeds without explicit kinematic models through real-time contact regulation. Tests on 50,000+ simulated and real-world objects confirm robust cross-category generalization.

Conclusion: Coarse visual cues suffice for reliable manipulation when coupled with tactile feedback, offering a scalable paradigm for autonomous systems in unstructured environments.

Abstract: Autonomous manipulation of articulated objects remains a fundamental
challenge for robots in human environments. Vision-based methods can infer
hidden kinematics but can yield imprecise estimates on unfamiliar objects.
Tactile approaches achieve robust control through contact feedback but require
accurate initialization. This suggests a natural synergy: vision for global
guidance, touch for local precision. Yet no framework systematically exploits
this complementarity for generalized articulated manipulation. Here we present
Vi-TacMan, which uses vision to propose grasps and coarse directions that seed
a tactile controller for precise execution. By incorporating surface normals as
geometric priors and modeling directions via von Mises-Fisher distributions,
our approach achieves significant gains over baselines (all p<0.0001).
Critically, manipulation succeeds without explicit kinematic models -- the
tactile controller refines coarse visual estimates through real-time contact
regulation. Tests on more than 50,000 simulated and diverse real-world objects
confirm robust cross-category generalization. This work establishes that coarse
visual cues suffice for reliable manipulation when coupled with tactile
feedback, offering a scalable paradigm for autonomous systems in unstructured
environments.

### [90] [A Formal gatekeeper Framework for Safe Dual Control with Active Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06351)
*Kaleb Ben Naveed,Devansh R. Agrawal,Dimitra Panagou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework for safe trajectory planning under model uncertainty that actively reduces uncertainty only when it provides verifiable improvement without compromising safety, using gatekeeper architecture for safety verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional robust planning is too conservative and ignores uncertainty reduction, while existing dual control approaches lack formal guarantees about when exploration is beneficial and may not ensure safety.

Method: Extends gatekeeper architecture to generate safe and informative trajectories that reduce uncertainty and mission cost, integrating robust planning with active exploration under formal safety guarantees.

Result: The methodology successfully enables online dual control of a quadrotor under parametric uncertainty, allowing uncertainty reduction only when it provides verifiable improvement while maintaining safety.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a principled approach to dual control that formally guarantees safety while actively reducing uncertainty when beneficial, addressing the limitations of both conservative robust planning and unsafe exploration methods.

Abstract: Planning safe trajectories under model uncertainty is a fundamental
challenge. Robust planning ensures safety by considering worst-case
realizations, yet ignores uncertainty reduction and leads to overly
conservative behavior. Actively reducing uncertainty on-the-fly during a
nominal mission defines the dual control problem. Most approaches address this
by adding a weighted exploration term to the cost, tuned to trade off the
nominal objective and uncertainty reduction, but without formal consideration
of when exploration is beneficial. Moreover, safety is enforced in some methods
but not in others. We propose a framework that integrates robust planning with
active exploration under formal guarantees as follows: The key innovation and
contribution is that exploration is pursued only when it provides a verifiable
improvement without compromising safety. To achieve this, we utilize our
earlier work on gatekeeper as an architecture for safety verification, and
extend it so that it generates both safe and informative trajectories that
reduce uncertainty and the cost of the mission, or keep it within a
user-defined budget. The methodology is evaluated via simulation case studies
on the online dual control of a quadrotor under parametric uncertainty.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A new robotic planning method that combines LLM planning with symbolic planning oversight to improve reliability and repeatability while maintaining LLM flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of pure LLM planning (hallucinations, lack of transparency) and pure symbolic planning (scalability issues with real-world complexity), aiming to create more reliable and repeatable robot planners.

Method: Augments LLM planners with symbolic planning oversight to provide reliability guarantees and transparent hard constraint definitions, preserving LLM reasoning capabilities.

Result: Achieved 99% success rate on ALFWorld benchmark, and 100% task success in real-world quadruped robot deployment compared to 50% (pure LLM) and 30% (symbolic planner) success rates.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively enhances reliability, repeatability and transparency of LLM-based planners while retaining their flexibility and generalization capabilities for complex real-world environments.

Abstract: Replicating human-level intelligence in the execution of embodied tasks
remains challenging due to the unconstrained nature of real-world environments.
Novel use of large language models (LLMs) for task planning seeks to address
the previously intractable state/action space of complex planning tasks, but
hallucinations limit their reliability, and thus, viability beyond a research
context. Additionally, the prompt engineering required to achieve adequate
system performance lacks transparency, and thus, repeatability. In contrast to
LLM planning, symbolic planning methods offer strong reliability and
repeatability guarantees, but struggle to scale to the complexity and ambiguity
of real-world tasks. We introduce a new robotic planning method that augments
LLM planners with symbolic planning oversight to improve reliability and
repeatability, and provide a transparent approach to defining hard constraints
with considerably stronger clarity than traditional prompt engineering.
Importantly, these augmentations preserve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs
and retain impressive generalization in open-world environments. We demonstrate
our approach in simulated and real-world environments. On the ALFWorld planning
benchmark, our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving
a near-perfect 99% success rate. Deployment of our method to a real-world
quadruped robot resulted in 100% task success compared to 50% and 30% for pure
LLM and symbolic planners across embodied pick and place tasks. Our approach
presents an effective strategy to enhance the reliability, repeatability and
transparency of LLM-based robot planners while retaining their key strengths:
flexibility and generalizability to complex real-world environments. We hope
that this work will contribute to the broad goal of building resilient embodied
intelligent systems.

<details>

Motivation: Safe navigation in uncertain environments requires integrating risk aversion with active perception to handle dynamic uncertainties and ensure safety.

Method: Refines coarse paths using tail-sensitive risk maps from Average Value-at-Risk statistics on online-updated 3D Gaussian-splat Radiance Fields, and formulates NBV selection as Riemannian gradient descent optimization on SE(3) pose manifold.

Result: The approach generates locally safe and feasible trajectories while efficiently reducing uncertainty through optimized viewpoint selection.

Conclusion: The framework advances state-of-the-art by coupling risk-averse path refinement with NBV planning using scalable gradient decompositions for efficient online updates in complex environments.

Abstract: Safe navigation in uncertain environments requires planning methods that
integrate risk aversion with active perception. In this work, we present a
unified framework that refines a coarse reference path by constructing
tail-sensitive risk maps from Average Value-at-Risk statistics on an
online-updated 3D Gaussian-splat Radiance Field. These maps enable the
generation of locally safe and feasible trajectories. In parallel, we formulate
Next-Best-View (NBV) selection as an optimization problem on the SE(3) pose
manifold, where Riemannian gradient descent maximizes an expected information
gain objective to reduce uncertainty most critical for imminent motion. Our
approach advances the state-of-the-art by coupling risk-averse path refinement
with NBV planning, while introducing scalable gradient decompositions that
support efficient online updates in complex environments. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework through extensive computational
studies.

*Matthew Kim,Kensuke Nakamura,Andrea Bajcsy*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper examines limitations of latent-space safe control using RGB-only observations, identifies temperature-based failures where visual inputs alone are insufficient for safety, proposes a mutual information measure to predict such failures, and introduces a multimodal training approach that uses additional sensors during training but only requires RGB at deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current latent-space safe control methods assume safety-critical features are observable in learned latent states from RGB observations, but this can lead to myopic safety behaviors where controllers avoid seeing failure states rather than preventing actual failures.

Method: The authors introduce a mutual information-based measure to identify when observations fail to capture safety-relevant features, and propose a multimodal-supervised training strategy that shapes latent states with additional sensory inputs during training while requiring only RGB at deployment.

Result: The approach was validated in simulation and on hardware with a Franka Research 3 manipulator preventing a pot of wax from overheating, demonstrating improved safety performance compared to RGB-only methods.

Conclusion: Latent state spaces may be insufficient for safe control when safety-critical features are not captured by the available observations, and multimodal training can address this limitation without requiring additional sensors during deployment.

Abstract: Safe control techniques, such as Hamilton-Jacobi reachability, provide
principled methods for synthesizing safety-preserving robot policies but
typically assume hand-designed state spaces and full observability. Recent work
has relaxed these assumptions via latent-space safe control, where state
representations and dynamics are learned jointly through world models that
reconstruct future high-dimensional observations (e.g., RGB images) from
current observations and actions. This enables safety constraints that are
difficult to specify analytically (e.g., spilling) to be framed as
classification problems in latent space, allowing controllers to operate
directly from raw observations. However, these methods assume that
safety-critical features are observable in the learned latent state. We ask:
when are latent state spaces sufficient for safe control? To study this, we
examine temperature-based failures, comparable to overheating in cooking or
manufacturing tasks, and find that RGB-only observations can produce myopic
safety behaviors, e.g., avoiding seeing failure states rather than preventing
failure itself. To predict such behaviors, we introduce a mutual
information-based measure that identifies when observations fail to capture
safety-relevant features. Finally, we propose a multimodal-supervised training
strategy that shapes the latent state with additional sensory inputs during
training, but requires no extra modalities at deployment, and validate our
approach in simulation and on hardware with a Franka Research 3 manipulator
preventing a pot of wax from overheating.

TL;DR: A real-time transparent obstacle mapping system for sub-300g quadrotors using fused ToF camera and ultrasonic sensor data with lightweight 2D convolution model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transparent obstacles pose significant challenges for aerial robot navigation as they lack discernible features and cause depth sensor failures, leading to inaccurate maps and collisions. Existing methods are unsuitable for low SWaP robots due to large sensors or high computational requirements.

Method: Fuses Time-of-Flight camera and ultrasonic sensor data with a custom lightweight 2D convolution model that detects specular reflections and propagates depth into empty regions of depth maps to make transparent obstacles visible.

Result: The system operates in real-time using only a small fraction of a CPU core on embedded processors, successfully mapping indoor environments containing glass in both controlled and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: This is the first real-time, onboard transparent obstacle mapping system demonstrated on a low-SWaP quadrotor using only CPU, enabling safe navigation through environments with transparent obstacles.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial robots are increasingly being deployed in real-world
scenarios, where transparent obstacles present significant challenges to
reliable navigation and mapping. These materials pose a unique problem for
traditional perception systems because they lack discernible features and can
cause conventional depth sensors to fail, leading to inaccurate maps and
potential collisions. To ensure safe navigation, robots must be able to
accurately detect and map these transparent obstacles. Existing methods often
rely on large, expensive sensors or algorithms that impose high computational
burdens, making them unsuitable for low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) robots.
In this work, we propose a novel and computationally efficient framework for
detecting and mapping transparent obstacles onboard a sub-300g quadrotor. Our
method fuses data from a Time-of-Flight (ToF) camera and an ultrasonic sensor
with a custom, lightweight 2D convolution model. This specialized approach
accurately detects specular reflections and propagates their depth into
corresponding empty regions of the depth map, effectively rendering transparent
obstacles visible. The entire pipeline operates in real-time, utilizing only a
small fraction of a CPU core on an embedded processor. We validate our system
through a series of experiments in both controlled and real-world environments,
demonstrating the utility of our method through experiments where the robot
maps indoor environments containing glass. Our work is, to our knowledge, the
first of its kind to demonstrate a real-time, onboard transparent obstacle
mapping system on a low-SWaP quadrotor using only the CPU.

TL;DR: RAISE is a closed-loop autonomous lab that optimizes liquid formulations for surface wettability using Bayesian optimization, achieving ~1 contact angle measurement per minute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surface wettability is crucial for biomedical devices and coatings, but depends heavily on liquid formulations. Current methods lack automated optimization linking formulation to contact angle measurements.

Method: RAISE combines automated liquid mixing, droplet transfer, image capture, and contact angle measurement with Bayesian optimization to iteratively explore formulations based on user-defined objectives.

Result: The system can explore surfactant wettability, compensate for purity variations, and identify optimal formulations that meet target contact angles while minimizing surfactant usage and cost.

Conclusion: RAISE successfully demonstrates autonomous linking of liquid formulations to contact angle measurements using multi-objective Bayesian optimization to efficiently find optimal formulations.

Abstract: Surface wettability is a critical design parameter for biomedical devices,
coatings, and textiles. Contact angle measurements quantify liquid-surface
interactions, which depend strongly on liquid formulation. Herein, we present
the Robotic Autonomous Imaging Surface Evaluator (RAISE), a closed-loop,
self-driving laboratory that is capable of linking liquid formulation
optimization with surface wettability assessment. RAISE comprises a full
experimental orchestrator with the ability of mixing liquid ingredients to
create varying formulation cocktails, transferring droplets of prepared
formulations to a high-throughput stage, and using a pick-and-place camera tool
for automated droplet image capture. The system also includes an automated
image processing pipeline to measure contact angles. This closed loop
experiment orchestrator is integrated with a Bayesian Optimization (BO) client,
which enables iterative exploration of new formulations based on previous
contact angle measurements to meet user-defined objectives. The system operates
in a high-throughput manner and can achieve a measurement rate of approximately
1 contact angle measurement per minute. Here we demonstrate RAISE can be used
to explore surfactant wettability and how surfactant combinations create
tunable formulations that compensate for purity-related variations.
Furthermore, multi-objective BO demonstrates how precise and optimal
formulations can be reached based on application-specific goals. The
optimization is guided by a desirability score, which prioritizes formulations
that are within target contact angle ranges, minimize surfactant usage and
reduce cost. This work demonstrates the capabilities of RAISE to autonomously
link liquid formulations to contact angle measurements in a closed-loop system,
using multi-objective BO to efficiently identify optimal formulations aligned
with researcher-defined criteria.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enables space manipulators to perform complex debris capture tasks safely and reliably through model-free reinforcement learning with specialized multi-critic architecture.

Abstract: The objective of this study is to develop a model-free workspace trajectory
planner for space manipulators using a Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (TD3) agent to enable safe and reliable debris capture. A local
control strategy with singularity avoidance and manipulability enhancement is
employed to ensure stable execution. The manipulator must simultaneously track
a capture point on a non-cooperative target, avoid self-collisions, and prevent
unintended contact with the target. To address these challenges, we propose a
curriculum-based multi-critic network where one critic emphasizes accurate
tracking and the other enforces collision avoidance. A prioritized experience
replay buffer is also used to accelerate convergence and improve policy
robustness. The framework is evaluated on a simulated seven-degree-of-freedom
KUKA LBR iiwa mounted on a free-floating base in Matlab/Simulink, demonstrating
safe and adaptive trajectory generation for debris removal missions.

*Kruthika Gangaraju,Tanmayi Inaparthy,Jiaqi Yang,Yihao Zheng,Fengpei Yuan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An adaptive multimodal robotic framework using Pepper robot that provides graduated medication assistance for people with dementia, dynamically adjusting from simple reminders to comprehensive guidance based on real-time user needs assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing assistive technologies for dementia patients use one-size-fits-all approaches that fail to adapt to declining abilities, undermining autonomy and increasing caregiver burden. Occupational therapy principles emphasize matching assistance levels to individual capabilities, but current robotic systems lack this adaptive framework.

Method: Hierarchical intervention model using Pepper robot with LLM-driven interaction strategies and multimodal sensing. System progresses from (1) verbal reminders, to (2) verbal + gestural cues, to (3) full multimodal guidance including physical navigation to medication locations with step-by-step instructions.

Result: Preliminary study with healthy adults and dementia care stakeholders in controlled lab setting showed positive evaluation of system's usability, comprehensibility, and appropriateness of adaptive feedback mechanisms.

Conclusion: The work contributes an adaptive assistance framework translating occupational therapy principles into HRI design, a multimodal robotic implementation preserving dignity through graduated support, and empirical insights into stakeholder perceptions of adaptive robotic care.

Abstract: People living with dementia (PLWDs) face progressively declining abilities in
medication management-from simple forgetfulness to complete task breakdown-yet
most assistive technologies fail to adapt to these changing needs. This
one-size-fits-all approach undermines autonomy, accelerates dependence, and
increases caregiver burden. Occupational therapy principles emphasize matching
assistance levels to individual capabilities: minimal reminders for those who
merely forget, spatial guidance for those who misplace items, and comprehensive
multimodal support for those requiring step-by-step instruction. However,
existing robotic systems lack this adaptive, graduated response framework
essential for maintaining PLWD independence. We present an adaptive multimodal
robotic framework using the Pepper robot that dynamically adjusts assistance
based on real-time assessment of user needs. Our system implements a
hierarchical intervention model progressing from (1) simple verbal reminders,
to (2) verbal + gestural cues, to (3) full multimodal guidance combining
physical navigation to medication locations with step-by-step verbal and
gestural instructions. Powered by LLM-driven interaction strategies and
multimodal sensing, the system continuously evaluates task states to provide
just-enough assistance-preserving autonomy while ensuring medication adherence.
We conducted a preliminary study with healthy adults and dementia care
stakeholders in a controlled lab setting, evaluating the system's usability,
comprehensibility, and appropriateness of adaptive feedback mechanisms. This
work contributes: (1) a theoretically grounded adaptive assistance framework
translating occupational therapy principles into HRI design, (2) a multimodal
robotic implementation that preserves PLWD dignity through graduated support,
and (3) empirical insights into stakeholder perceptions of adaptive robotic
care.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RLinf-VLA is a unified framework for scalable reinforcement learning training of vision-language-action models that addresses limitations of supervised fine-tuning and enables systematic comparison across architectures and algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models rely on supervised fine-tuning which struggles with generalization under distribution shifts, while existing RL approaches lack a unified platform for fair comparison across different architectures and algorithms.

Method: Developed RLinf-VLA framework with flexible resource allocation design, hybrid fine-grained pipeline allocation for GPU-parallelized simulators, supporting diverse VLA architectures, multiple RL algorithms, and various simulators through unified interface.

Result: Achieved 98.11% success across 130 LIBERO tasks and 97.66% across 25 ManiSkill tasks in simulation. RL-trained policies showed stronger generalization than SFT-trained policies in real-world robot deployment. Framework achieved 1.61x-1.88x speedup in training.

Conclusion: RLinf-VLA provides a foundation to accelerate and standardize embodied intelligence research, with RL-trained VLA models demonstrating superior generalization capabilities compared to supervised approaches.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision and language foundation models has significantly
advanced multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generation, inspiring a surge
of interest in extending such capabilities to embodied settings through
vision-language-action (VLA) models. Yet, most VLA models are still trained
with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which struggles to generalize under
distribution shifts due to error accumulation. Reinforcement learning (RL)
offers a promising alternative by directly optimizing task performance through
interaction, but existing attempts remain fragmented and lack a unified
platform for fair and systematic comparison across model architectures and
algorithmic designs. To address this gap, we introduce RLinf-VLA, a unified and
efficient framework for scalable RL training of VLA models. The system adopts a
highly flexible resource allocation design that addresses the challenge of
integrating rendering, training, and inference in RL+VLA training. In
particular, for GPU-parallelized simulators, RLinf-VLA implements a novel
hybrid fine-grained pipeline allocation mode, achieving a 1.61x-1.88x speedup
in training. Through a unified interface, RLinf-VLA seamlessly supports diverse
VLA architectures (e.g., OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT), multiple RL algorithms (e.g.,
PPO, GRPO), and various simulators (e.g., ManiSkill, LIBERO). In simulation, a
unified model achieves 98.11\% across 130 LIBERO tasks and 97.66\% across 25
ManiSkill tasks. Beyond empirical performance, our study distills a set of best
practices for applying RL to VLA training and sheds light on emerging patterns
in this integration. Furthermore, we present preliminary deployment on a
real-world Franka robot, where RL-trained policies exhibit stronger
generalization than those trained with SFT. We envision RLinf-VLA as a
foundation to accelerate and standardize research on embodied intelligence.

### [99] [SanDRA: Safe Large-Language-Model-Based Decision Making for Automated Vehicles Using Reachability Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06717)
*Yuanfei Lin,Sebastian Illing,Matthias Althoff*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SanDRA is a safe LLM-based decision framework for autonomous vehicles that combines LLM reasoning with reachability analysis to ensure provably safe driving actions while maintaining compliance with traffic rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based decision systems for autonomous vehicles suffer from safety issues due to potential hallucinations and lack of vehicle dynamics integration, making them unreliable for real-world deployment.

Method: The framework first uses LLMs to generate and rank driving actions based on scenario descriptions, then translates these actions into temporal logic formulas incorporating traffic rules, and finally uses reachability analysis to filter out unsafe actions.

Result: Validation in both open-loop and closed-loop environments shows the framework provides provably safe and legally compliant driving actions even under high-density traffic conditions, working with both off-the-shelf and fine-tuned LLMs.

Conclusion: SanDRA successfully bridges the gap between LLM reasoning capabilities and safety requirements for autonomous vehicles, offering a transparent and publicly available solution for safe decision-making.

Abstract: Large language models have been widely applied to knowledge-driven
decision-making for automated vehicles due to their strong generalization and
reasoning capabilities. However, the safety of the resulting decisions cannot
be ensured due to possible hallucinations and the lack of integrated vehicle
dynamics. To address this issue, we propose SanDRA, the first safe
large-language-model-based decision making framework for automated vehicles
using reachability analysis. Our approach starts with a comprehensive
description of the driving scenario to prompt large language models to generate
and rank feasible driving actions. These actions are translated into temporal
logic formulas that incorporate formalized traffic rules, and are subsequently
integrated into reachability analysis to eliminate unsafe actions. We validate
our approach in both open-loop and closed-loop driving environments using
off-the-shelf and finetuned large language models, showing that it can provide
provably safe and, where possible, legally compliant driving actions, even
under high-density traffic conditions. To ensure transparency and facilitate
future research, all code and experimental setups are publicly available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UniFField is a unified uncertainty-aware neural feature field that combines visual, semantic, and geometric features in a generalizable 3D representation with uncertainty prediction, enabling zero-shot application to new environments and robust robotic decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D neural feature fields are typically scene-specific and lack uncertainty modeling, which is crucial for robust robotic decision-making in unstructured environments where reliability of perceived information must be evaluated.

Method: A voxel-based feature representation that incrementally integrates RGB-D images as the robot explores scenes, simultaneously updating uncertainty estimation for visual, semantic, and geometric modalities. The approach can be applied zero-shot to any new environment.

Result: The uncertainty estimations accurately describe model prediction errors in scene reconstruction and semantic feature prediction. The system successfully enables active object search tasks using a mobile manipulator robot, demonstrating robust decision-making capabilities.

Conclusion: UniFField provides a unified uncertainty-aware neural feature field that addresses critical limitations of existing methods by being generalizable across scenes and incorporating uncertainty modeling, enabling more reliable robotic perception and decision-making in complex environments.

Abstract: Comprehensive visual, geometric, and semantic understanding of a 3D scene is
crucial for successful execution of robotic tasks, especially in unstructured
and complex environments. Additionally, to make robust decisions, it is
necessary for the robot to evaluate the reliability of perceived information.
While recent advances in 3D neural feature fields have enabled robots to
leverage features from pretrained foundation models for tasks such as
language-guided manipulation and navigation, existing methods suffer from two
critical limitations: (i) they are typically scene-specific, and (ii) they lack
the ability to model uncertainty in their predictions. We present UniFField, a
unified uncertainty-aware neural feature field that combines visual, semantic,
and geometric features in a single generalizable representation while also
predicting uncertainty in each modality. Our approach, which can be applied
zero shot to any new environment, incrementally integrates RGB-D images into
our voxel-based feature representation as the robot explores the scene,
simultaneously updating uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our uncertainty
estimations to accurately describe the model prediction errors in scene
reconstruction and semantic feature prediction. Furthermore, we successfully
leverage our feature predictions and their respective uncertainty for an active
object search task using a mobile manipulator robot, demonstrating the
capability for robust decision-making.

Conclusion: Kirigami offers promising opportunities for robotics through its unique mechanical properties, though challenges remain in pattern design optimization and fabrication techniques for specific functions.

Abstract: Kirigami, the traditional paper-cutting craft, holds immense potential for
revolutionizing robotics by providing multifunctional, lightweight, and

*Sicong Pan,Xuying Huang,Maren Bennewitz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a temporal-prior-guided view planning method for periodic plant reconstruction that uses previously reconstructed models to guide new view selection, reducing the number of views needed while maintaining coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional periodic 3D reconstruction restarts from scratch each cycle, wasting resources and ignoring valuable information from previous captures of the same plant.

Method: Non-rigidly aligns previous plant models to new partial observations, inflates the approximation to accommodate growth, solves set covering optimization for minimal views, integrates additional next-best view for robustness, and plans globally shortest path for view sequence.

Result: Experiments on maize and tomato show the system maintains or improves surface coverage while requiring fewer views and comparable movement cost compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed temporal-prior-guided approach effectively leverages historical reconstruction data to optimize periodic plant monitoring, achieving efficient coverage with reduced resource usage.

Abstract: Periodic 3D reconstruction is essential for crop monitoring, but costly when
each cycle restarts from scratch, wasting resources and ignoring information
from previous captures. We propose temporal-prior-guided view planning for
periodic plant reconstruction, in which a previously reconstructed model of the
same plant is non-rigidly aligned to a new partial observation to form an
approximation of the current geometry. To accommodate plant growth, we inflate
this approximation and solve a set covering optimization problem to compute a
minimal set of views. We integrated this method into a complete pipeline that
acquires one additional next-best view before registration for robustness and
then plans a globally shortest path to connect the planned set of views and
outputs the best view sequence. Experiments on maize and tomato under
hemisphere and sphere view spaces show that our system maintains or improves
surface coverage while requiring fewer views and comparable movement cost
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

*Abhinav Kumar,Fan Yang,Sergio Aguilera Marinovic,Soshi Iba,Rana Soltani Zarrin,Dmitry Berenson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework for autonomous recovery in multi-fingered robotic manipulation that detects when recovery is needed and plans contact-rich trajectories to resume normal task execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Environmental perturbations and execution errors can disrupt fine manipulation tasks with multi-fingered hands, necessitating recovery behaviors to resume normal task execution.

Method: Uses diffusion models for out-of-distribution detection to identify when recovery is needed, then employs diffusion sampling and trajectory optimization to plan contact-rich recovery trajectories. Also proposes a novel diffusion-based approach to efficiently parameterize the recovery trajectory optimization problem.

Result: On a hardware screwdriver-turning task, the method improves task performance by 96% and is the only evaluated method that can attempt recovery without causing catastrophic task failure.

Conclusion: The diffusion-based framework effectively enables autonomous recovery in contact-rich manipulation tasks, significantly improving task performance and preventing catastrophic failures.

Abstract: Multi-fingered hands are emerging as powerful platforms for performing fine
manipulation tasks, including tool use. However, environmental perturbations or
execution errors can impede task performance, motivating the use of recovery
behaviors that enable normal task execution to resume. In this work, we take
advantage of recent advances in diffusion models to construct a framework that
autonomously identifies when recovery is necessary and optimizes contact-rich
trajectories to recover. We use a diffusion model trained on the task to
estimate when states are not conducive to task execution, framed as an
out-of-distribution detection problem. We then use diffusion sampling to
project these states in-distribution and use trajectory optimization to plan
contact-rich recovery trajectories. We also propose a novel diffusion-based
approach that distills this process to efficiently diffuse the full
parameterization, including constraints, goal state, and initialization, of the
recovery trajectory optimization problem, saving time during online execution.
We compare our method to a reinforcement learning baseline and other methods
that do not explicitly plan contact interactions, including on a hardware
screwdriver-turning task where we show that recovering using our method
improves task performance by 96% and that ours is the only method evaluated
that can attempt recovery without causing catastrophic task failure. Videos can

*Daria Pugacheva,Andrey Moskalenko,Denis Shepelev,Andrey Kuznetsov,Vlad Shakhuro,Elena Tutubalina*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Vision Language Action (VLA) models show significant performance degradation under linguistic perturbations, particularly with semantically similar irrelevant context (50% drop) and human paraphrases (20% drop). An LLM-based filtering framework can recover up to 98.5% of original performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate the robustness of VLA models to natural language variability in real-world scenarios, as their robustness to linguistic perturbations has not been thoroughly studied.

Method: Evaluate VLA models under two types of instruction noise: human-generated paraphrasing and addition of irrelevant context (categorized by length, semantic and lexical proximity). Propose an LLM-based filtering framework to extract core commands from noisy inputs.

Result: Models show consistent performance degradation as context expands. They exhibit relative robustness to random context (within 10% drop), but semantically/lexically similar context causes ~50% performance decline. Human paraphrases lead to ~20% drop. The filtering framework recovers up to 98.5% of original performance.

Conclusion: VLA models are vulnerable to linguistic perturbations, especially semantically similar irrelevant context, but an LLM-based filtering approach can effectively mitigate these robustness issues.

Abstract: Vision Language Action (VLA) models are widely used in Embodied AI, enabling
robots to interpret and execute language instructions. However, their
robustness to natural language variability in real-world scenarios has not been
thoroughly investigated. In this work, we present a novel systematic study of
the robustness of state-of-the-art VLA models under linguistic perturbations.
Specifically, we evaluate model performance under two types of instruction
noise: (1) human-generated paraphrasing and (2) the addition of irrelevant
context. We further categorize irrelevant contexts into two groups according to
their length and their semantic and lexical proximity to robot commands. In
this study, we observe consistent performance degradation as context size
expands. We also demonstrate that the model can exhibit relative robustness to
random context, with a performance drop within 10%, while semantically and
lexically similar context of the same length can trigger a quality decline of
around 50%. Human paraphrases of instructions lead to a drop of nearly 20%. To
mitigate this, we propose an LLM-based filtering framework that extracts core
commands from noisy inputs. Incorporating our filtering step allows models to
recover up to 98.5% of their original performance under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: This survey provides a systematic framework for understanding and implementing VLA models in robotics, with all categorized references available on the project website for the robotics community.

Abstract: Amid growing efforts to leverage advances in large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs) for robotics, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models
have recently gained significant attention. By unifying vision, language, and
action data at scale, which have traditionally been studied separately, VLA
models aim to learn policies that generalise across diverse tasks, objects,
embodiments, and environments. This generalisation capability is expected to
enable robots to solve novel downstream tasks with minimal or no additional
task-specific data, facilitating more flexible and scalable real-world
deployment. Unlike previous surveys that focus narrowly on action
representations or high-level model architectures, this work offers a
comprehensive, full-stack review, integrating both software and hardware
components of VLA systems. In particular, this paper provides a systematic
review of VLAs, covering their strategy and architectural transition,
architectures and building blocks, modality-specific processing techniques, and
learning paradigms. In addition, to support the deployment of VLAs in
real-world robotic applications, we also review commonly used robot platforms,
data collection strategies, publicly available datasets, data augmentation

TL;DR: This paper explores different sampling strategies for robot parameters and joint gains to train robust universal locomotion policies for quadrupeds that generalize across configurations and close the sim-to-real gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a single reinforcement learning policy that can generalize to multiple robot parameter configurations and enable robust zero-shot deployment from simulation to real hardware.

Method: Compared three joint gain sampling strategies: linear/polynomial function mappings of mass-to-gains, performance-based adaptive filtering, and uniform random sampling. Used RaiSim for training and tested on diverse quadrupeds.

Result: Demonstrated that significant joint controller gains randomization is necessary for robust sim-to-real transfer. The approach successfully enabled zero-shot deployment on ANYmal quadruped robot.

Conclusion: Parameter sampling with proper gain randomization strategies is crucial for training robust universal locomotion policies that can effectively bridge the sim-to-real gap in quadrupedal robotics.

Abstract: This work focuses on sampling strategies of configuration variations for
generating robust universal locomotion policies for quadrupedal robots. We
investigate the effects of sampling physical robot parameters and joint
proportional-derivative gains to enable training a single reinforcement
learning policy that generalizes to multiple parameter configurations. Three
fundamental joint gain sampling strategies are compared: parameter sampling
with (1) linear and polynomial function mappings of mass-to-gains, (2)
performance-based adaptive filtering, and (3) uniform random sampling. We
improve the robustness of the policy by biasing the configurations using
nominal priors and reference models. All training was conducted on RaiSim,
tested in simulation on a range of diverse quadrupeds, and zero-shot deployed
onto hardware using the ANYmal quadruped robot. Compared to multiple baseline
implementations, our results demonstrate the need for significant joint
controller gains randomization for robust closing of the sim-to-real gap.

TL;DR: A digital twin-driven metamorphic testing framework for self-driving cars that uses AI image generation to create diverse driving scenarios, improving test coverage and effectiveness compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional testing methods for self-driving cars face limitations like the oracle problem and inability to cover all real-world scenarios, making safety assurance challenging.

Method: Combines digital twin technology with AI image generative models (Stable Diffusion) to create virtual replicas and systematically generate realistic driving scenes with variations in weather, road topology, and environmental features while maintaining core semantics.

Result: Achieved highest true positive rate (0.719), F1 score (0.689), and precision (0.662) compared to baseline approaches when validated in Udacity self-driving simulator.

Conclusion: Integrating digital twins with AI-powered scenario generation provides a scalable, automated, and high-fidelity testing solution for autonomous vehicle safety.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of self-driving cars remains a major challenge due to the
complexity and unpredictability of real-world driving environments. Traditional
testing methods face significant limitations, such as the oracle problem, which
makes it difficult to determine whether a system's behavior is correct, and the
inability to cover the full range of scenarios an autonomous vehicle may
encounter. In this paper, we introduce a digital twin-driven metamorphic
testing framework that addresses these challenges by creating a virtual replica
of the self-driving system and its operating environment. By combining digital
twin technology with AI-based image generative models such as Stable Diffusion,
our approach enables the systematic generation of realistic and diverse driving
scenes. This includes variations in weather, road topology, and environmental
features, all while maintaining the core semantics of the original scenario.
The digital twin provides a synchronized simulation environment where changes
can be tested in a controlled and repeatable manner. Within this environment,
we define three metamorphic relations inspired by real-world traffic rules and
vehicle behavior. We validate our framework in the Udacity self-driving
simulator and demonstrate that it significantly enhances test coverage and
effectiveness. Our method achieves the highest true positive rate (0.719), F1
score (0.689), and precision (0.662) compared to baseline approaches. This
paper highlights the value of integrating digital twins with AI-powered
scenario generation to create a scalable, automated, and high-fidelity testing
solution for autonomous vehicle safety.

TL;DR: TrackVLA++ is a Vision-Language-Action model that enhances embodied visual tracking with spatial reasoning and target memory modules, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing embodied visual tracking approaches lack explicit spatial reasoning and effective temporal memory, causing failures under severe occlusions or with similar-looking distractors.

Method: Introduces two key modules: 1) Spatial reasoning using Polar-CoT (Chain-of-Thought) to infer target's relative position as polar-coordinate tokens, and 2) Target Identification Memory (TIM) with gated update strategy to preserve long-horizon target memory.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks, surpassing previous leading approach by 5.1 and 12 on EVT-Bench DT split. Shows strong zero-shot generalization for robust real-world tracking in dynamic and occluded scenarios.

Conclusion: TrackVLA++ effectively addresses limitations in embodied visual tracking through spatial reasoning and temporal memory mechanisms, demonstrating superior performance and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Embodied Visual Tracking (EVT) is a fundamental ability that underpins
practical applications, such as companion robots, guidance robots and service
assistants, where continuously following moving targets is essential. Recent
advances have enabled language-guided tracking in complex and unstructured
scenes. However, existing approaches lack explicit spatial reasoning and
effective temporal memory, causing failures under severe occlusions or in the
presence of similar-looking distractors. To address these challenges, we
present TrackVLA++, a novel Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that enhances
embodied visual tracking with two key modules, a spatial reasoning mechanism
and a Target Identification Memory (TIM). The reasoning module introduces a
Chain-of-Thought paradigm, termed Polar-CoT, which infers the target's relative
position and encodes it as a compact polar-coordinate token for action
prediction. Guided by these spatial priors, the TIM employs a gated update
strategy to preserve long-horizon target memory, ensuring spatiotemporal
consistency and mitigating target loss during extended occlusions. Extensive
experiments show that TrackVLA++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on
public benchmarks across both egocentric and multi-camera settings. On the
challenging EVT-Bench DT split, TrackVLA++ surpasses the previous leading
approach by 5.1 and 12, respectively. Furthermore, TrackVLA++ exhibits strong
zero-shot generalization, enabling robust real-world tracking in dynamic and
occluded scenarios.

*Jingkai Sun,Gang Han,Pihai Sun,Wen Zhao,Jiahang Cao,Jiaxu Wang,Yijie Guo,Qiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel framework for terrain-aware humanoid locomotion that integrates a blind locomotion policy, terrain reconstruction from noisy depth images, and realistic depth synthesis to overcome limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current terrain-aware humanoid locomotion methods face challenges: end-to-end learning has poor training efficiency and sim-to-real gaps, while elevation map-based methods require multiple sensors leading to latency and reduced robustness.

Method: Three key components: (1) Terrain-Aware Locomotion Policy with Blind Backbone using pre-trained perception, (2) Multi-Modality Cross-Attention Transformer for terrain reconstruction from noisy depth, (3) Realistic Depth Images Synthetic Method with self-occlusion-aware ray casting and noise modeling.

Result: Achieves over 30% reduction in terrain reconstruction error, enables efficient policy training with limited data/hardware, and demonstrates agile locomotion across diverse challenging terrains on a full-sized humanoid robot.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by integrating terrain reconstruction and realistic depth synthesis, enabling robust and adaptive humanoid locomotion without heavy reliance on multiple sensors or suffering from sim-to-real gaps.

Abstract: Recent advancements in legged robot perceptive locomotion have shown
promising progress. However, terrain-aware humanoid locomotion remains largely
constrained to two paradigms: depth image-based end-to-end learning and
elevation map-based methods. The former suffers from limited training
efficiency and a significant sim-to-real gap in depth perception, while the
latter depends heavily on multiple vision sensors and localization systems,
resulting in latency and reduced robustness. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a novel framework that tightly integrates three key components: (1)
Terrain-Aware Locomotion Policy with a Blind Backbone, which leverages
pre-trained elevation map-based perception to guide reinforcement learning with
minimal visual input; (2) Multi-Modality Cross-Attention Transformer, which
reconstructs structured terrain representations from noisy depth images; (3)
Realistic Depth Images Synthetic Method, which employs self-occlusion-aware ray
casting and noise-aware modeling to synthesize realistic depth observations,
achieving over 30\% reduction in terrain reconstruction error. This combination
enables efficient policy training with limited data and hardware resources,
while preserving critical terrain features essential for generalization. We
validate our framework on a full-sized humanoid robot, demonstrating agile and
adaptive locomotion across diverse and challenging terrains.

### [111] [A Narwhal-Inspired Sensing-to-Control Framework for Small Fixed-Wing Aircraft](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07160)
*Fengze Xie,Xiaozhou Fan,Jacob Schuster,Yisong Yue,Morteza Gharib*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents an end-to-end sensing-to-control pipeline for fixed-wing UAVs that combines bio-inspired multi-hole probes, wing pressure sensors, physics-informed dynamics learning, and convex control allocation to improve low-speed agility and control performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed-wing UAVs lack low-speed agility due to highly coupled dynamics, and measuring airflow on small airframes is challenging due to distorted pressure signals from various sources including propeller slipstream and control-surface actuation.

Method: The approach uses bio-inspired multi-hole probes mounted upstream (inspired by narwhal tusks) with wing pressure sensors, data-driven calibration for airspeed/angle estimation, learning a control-affine dynamics model with symmetry regularization, and a regularized least-squares control allocator.

Result: Wind-tunnel tests show 25-30% reduction in force-estimation error with wing pressures, 12% degradation under distribution shift (vs 44% for baseline), and 27-34% improvement in force tracking with smoother inputs compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: The integrated sensing-to-control pipeline significantly improves fixed-wing UAV performance through bio-inspired sensing, physics-informed modeling, and optimized control allocation, enabling better low-speed agility despite complex aerodynamic interactions.

Abstract: Fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer endurance and efficiency but
lack low-speed agility due to highly coupled dynamics. We present an end-to-end
sensing-to-control pipeline that combines bio-inspired hardware,
physics-informed dynamics learning, and convex control allocation. Measuring
airflow on a small airframe is difficult because near-body aerodynamics,
propeller slipstream, control-surface actuation, and ambient gusts distort
pressure signals. Inspired by the narwhal's protruding tusk, we mount in-house
multi-hole probes far upstream and complement them with sparse, carefully
placed wing pressure sensors for local flow measurement. A data-driven
calibration maps probe pressures to airspeed and flow angles. We then learn a
control-affine dynamics model using the estimated airspeed/angles and sparse
sensors. A soft left/right symmetry regularizer improves identifiability under
partial observability and limits confounding between wing pressures and
flaperon inputs. Desired wrenches (forces and moments) are realized by a
regularized least-squares allocator that yields smooth, trimmed actuation.
Wind-tunnel studies across a wide operating range show that adding wing
pressures reduces force-estimation error by 25-30%, the proposed model degrades
less under distribution shift (about 12% versus 44% for an unstructured
baseline), and force tracking improves with smoother inputs, including a 27%
reduction in normal-force RMSE versus a plain affine model and 34% versus an
unstructured baseline.

*Yi Han,Cheng Chi,Enshen Zhou,Shanyu Rong,Jingkun An,Pengwei Wang,Zhongyuan Wang,Lu Sheng,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TIGeR transforms VLMs from qualitative spatial reasoners to precise geometric computers by enabling them to generate and execute geometric computations through external tools, achieving centimeter-level accuracy for robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs lack computational precision for real-world robotics, reducing geometric problems to pattern recognition without leveraging metric cues from depth sensors and camera calibration.

Method: TIGeR framework enables VLMs to recognize geometric reasoning requirements, synthesize computational code, and invoke specialized libraries. Uses two-stage training with SFT and RFT with hierarchical rewards, supported by TIGeR-300K dataset.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on geometric reasoning benchmarks and demonstrates centimeter-level precision in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: TIGeR successfully transforms VLMs into precise geometric computers by leveraging external tools rather than internalizing complex operations, enabling practical robotic applications.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in spatial
reasoning, yet they remain fundamentally limited to qualitative precision and
lack the computational precision required for real-world robotics. Current
approaches fail to leverage metric cues from depth sensors and camera
calibration, instead reducing geometric problems to pattern recognition tasks
that cannot deliver the centimeter-level accuracy essential for robotic
manipulation. We present TIGeR (Tool-Integrated Geometric Reasoning), a novel
framework that transforms VLMs from perceptual estimators to geometric
computers by enabling them to generate and execute precise geometric
computations through external tools. Rather than attempting to internalize
complex geometric operations within neural networks, TIGeR empowers models to
recognize geometric reasoning requirements, synthesize appropriate
computational code, and invoke specialized libraries for exact calculations. To
support this paradigm, we introduce TIGeR-300K, a comprehensive
tool-invocation-oriented dataset covering point transformations, pose
estimation, trajectory generation, and spatial compatibility verification,
complete with tool invocation sequences and intermediate computations. Through
a two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) with our proposed hierarchical reward design,
TIGeR achieves SOTA performance on geometric reasoning benchmarks while
demonstrating centimeter-level precision in real-world robotic manipulation
tasks.

Motivation: Limited research exists on optimizing gearbox parameters and automating actuator CAD design, despite its importance for robotic actuator development.

Method: Systematically optimizes gearbox parameters for four types (SSPG, CPG, WPG, DSPG) to minimize mass/width while maximizing efficiency, and automates CAD generation for direct 3D printing.

Result: SSPG actuator achieved 60-80% efficiency, 0.59° backlash, 242.7 Nm/rad stiffness; CPG achieved 60% efficiency, 2.6° backlash, 201.6 Nm/rad stiffness. Framework successfully generated CAD models for all gearbox types.

Conclusion: COMPAct provides an effective framework for automated actuator design optimization and enables insights into gearbox type suitability across different gear ratio ranges.

Abstract: The optimal design of robotic actuators is a critical area of research, yet
limited attention has been given to optimizing gearbox parameters and
automating actuator CAD. This paper introduces COMPAct: Computational
Optimization and Automated Modular Design of Planetary Actuators, a framework
that systematically identifies optimal gearbox parameters for a given motor
across four gearbox types, single-stage planetary gearbox (SSPG), compound
planetary gearbox (CPG), Wolfrom planetary gearbox (WPG), and double-stage
planetary gearbox (DSPG). The framework minimizes mass and actuator width while
maximizing efficiency, and further automates actuator CAD generation to enable
direct 3D printing without manual redesign. Using this framework, optimal
gearbox designs are explored over a wide range of gear ratios, providing
insights into the suitability of different gearbox types across various gear
ratio ranges. In addition, the framework is used to generate CAD models of all
four gearbox types with varying gear ratios and motors. Two actuator types are
fabricated and experimentally evaluated through power efficiency, no-load
backlash, and transmission stiffness tests. Experimental results indicate that
the SSPG actuator achieves a mechanical efficiency of 60-80 %, a no-load
backlash of 0.59 deg, and a transmission stiffness of 242.7 Nm/rad, while the
CPG actuator demonstrates 60 % efficiency, 2.6 deg backlash, and a stiffness of
201.6 Nm/rad. Code available at:

that HyPlan may navigate safer than selected relevant baselines and perform
significantly faster than considered alternative online POMDP planners.

Main category: cs.RO

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Telemanipulation of deformable objects requires high precision and dexterity, but dynamic shape changes cause ambiguous perception of alignment and robot positioning errors, necessitating tilt angle and position classification.

Method: Uses a multi-contact haptic device (LinkGlide) for palm feedback and tactile sensor arrays in a 2-finger Robotiq gripper, with CNN-based approach to detect tilt and position while grasping deformable objects, generating masks for tactile stimuli rendering.

Result: CNN algorithm with preset mask increased tilt and position recognition from 9.67% using direct data to 82.5%.

Conclusion: The proposed CNN-based approach significantly improves user recognition of tilt and position during telemanipulation of deformable objects through enhanced haptic feedback.

Abstract: Telemanipulation of deformable objects requires high precision and dexterity
from the users, which can be increased by kinesthetic and tactile feedback.
However, the object shape can change dynamically, causing ambiguous perception
of its alignment and hence errors in the robot positioning. Therefore, the tilt
angle and position classification problem has to be solved to present a clear
tactile pattern to the user. This work presents a telemanipulation system for
plastic pipettes consisting of a multi-contact haptic device LinkGlide to
deliver haptic feedback at the users' palm and two tactile sensors array
embedded in the 2-finger Robotiq gripper. We propose a novel approach based on
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect the tilt and position while
grasping deformable objects. The CNN generates a mask based on recognized tilt
and position data to render further multi-contact tactile stimuli provided to
the user during the telemanipulation. The study has shown that using the CNN
algorithm and the preset mask, tilt, and position recognition by users is
increased from 9.67% using the direct data to 82.5%.

Conclusion: CNN-generated tactile patterns significantly improve user performance in detecting tilt and successfully telemanipulating deformable objects.

Abstract: The shape of deformable objects can change drastically during grasping by
robotic grippers, causing an ambiguous perception of their alignment and hence
resulting in errors in robot positioning and telemanipulation. Rendering clear
tactile patterns is fundamental to increasing users' precision and dexterity
through tactile haptic feedback during telemanipulation. Therefore, different
methods have to be studied to decode the sensors' data into haptic stimuli.
This work presents a telemanipulation system for plastic pipettes that consists

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome two key bottlenecks in foundation model reasoning: limited model-intrinsic capacity and unreliable test-time iteration, which constrain the practical deployment of FMs in complex reasoning tasks.

Method: Orchestrates multiple models with professional tools including computation (Python with numerical/symbolic libraries) and retrieval (task-relevant external information), using a shared state map for multi-round, multi-model solution evolution with iterative refinement.

Conclusion: AlphaApollo effectively lifts the capability ceiling of foundation models through systematic tool orchestration and multi-model reasoning, demonstrating reliable performance improvements across different model architectures.

Abstract: We present AlphaApollo, a self-evolving agentic reasoning system that aims to
address two bottlenecks in foundation model (FM) reasoning-limited
model-intrinsic capacity and unreliable test-time iteration. AlphaApollo
orchestrates multiple models with professional tools to enable deliberate,
verifiable reasoning. It couples (i) a computation tool (Python with numerical

information) to execute exact calculations and ground decisions. The system
further supports multi-round, multi-model solution evolution via a shared state
map that records candidates, executable checks, and feedback for iterative
refinement. In evaluations on AIME 2024/2025 across multiple models,
AlphaApollo delivers consistent gains: +5.15% Average@32 and +23.34% Pass@32
for Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, and +8.91% Average@32 with +26.67% Pass@32 for
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. Tool-use analysis shows that more than 80% of tool

*Mohammad Mahdi Samiei Paqaleh,Arash Marioriyad,Arman Tahmasebi-Zadeh,Mohamadreza Fereydooni,Mahdi Ghaznavai,Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Complexity Out of Distribution (Complexity OoD) generalization as a framework to define and measure reasoning ability in AI systems, distinguishing it from traditional pattern recognition by requiring models to handle problems whose solution complexity exceeds that of training examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems lack clear definitions and metrics for reasoning ability, unlike learning where generalization concepts are well-established. The authors aim to formalize reasoning through complexity-based generalization.

Method: The authors formalize complexity using Kolmogorov complexity and operational proxies (object/relation counts, reasoning step counts), and propose incorporating complexity into benchmark design, supervision strategies, and inductive biases for Complexity OoD generalization.

Result: The framework unifies learning and reasoning, showing that System1-like processing at low complexity becomes System2-like under complexity pressure, and System2 can be viewed as generalization over solution structures.

Conclusion: Progress toward robust reasoning requires architectures and training regimes that explicitly model and allocate computation with respect to complexity, as Complexity OoD cannot be solved by scaling data alone.

Abstract: Recent progress has pushed AI frontiers from pattern recognition tasks toward
problems that require step by step, System2 style reasoning, especially with
large language models. Yet, unlike learning, where generalization and out of
distribution (OoD) evaluation concepts are well formalized, there is no clear,
consistent definition or metric for reasoning ability. We propose Complexity
Out of Distribution (Complexity OoD) generalization as a framework and problem
setting to define and measure reasoning. A model exhibits Complexity OoD
generalization when it maintains performance on test instances whose minimal
required solution complexity, either representational (richer solution
structure) or computational (more reasoning steps/program length), exceeds that
of all training examples. We formalize complexity via solution description
Kolmogorov complexity and operational proxies (e.g., object/relation counts;
reasoning step counts), clarifying how Complexity OoD differs from length and
compositional OoD. This lens unifies learning and reasoning: many cases
solvable with System1 like processing at low complexity become System2 like
under complexity pressure, while System2 can be viewed as generalization over
solution structures. We translate this perspective into practice with
recommendations for operationalizing Complexity OoD across the stack:
incorporating complexity into benchmark and evaluation metric design,
rethinking supervision to target solution traces, seeking and designing
inductive biases for Complexity OoD generalization, addressing learning to
reason spillovers such as spurious shortcuts, semantic robustness, catastrophic
forgetting, and step wise calibration. Because Complexity OoD cannot be solved
by scaling data alone, progress toward robust reasoning will require
architectures and training regimes that explicitly model and allocate
computation with respect to complexity.

TL;DR: BuilderBench is a benchmark for agent pre-training that focuses on open-ended exploration, requiring agents to learn how to build various structures using blocks in a simulated environment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models struggle with novel problems beyond existing data limits, and there's a need for scalable learning mechanisms that enable agents to learn through interaction and exploration.

Method: The benchmark includes a hardware-accelerated simulator of a robotic agent interacting with physical blocks, and a task suite with 42 diverse target structures testing physics understanding, mathematics, and long-horizon planning. Agents learn through exploration without external supervision.

Result: The experiments show that current algorithms struggle with many of these tasks, demonstrating the need for improved embodied reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: BuilderBench provides a framework to accelerate research in agent pre-training through open-ended exploration, with implementations of six algorithms as reference points for future development.

Abstract: Today's AI models learn primarily through mimicry and sharpening, so it is
not surprising that they struggle to solve problems beyond the limits set by
existing data. To solve novel problems, agents should acquire skills for
exploring and learning through experience. Finding a scalable learning
mechanism for developing agents that learn through interaction remains a major
open problem. In this work, we introduce BuilderBench, a benchmark to
accelerate research into agent pre-training that centers open-ended
exploration. BuilderBench requires agents to learn how to build any structure
using blocks. BuilderBench is equipped with $(1)$ a hardware accelerated
simulator of a robotic agent interacting with various physical blocks, and
$(2)$ a task-suite with over 42 diverse target structures that are carefully
curated to test an understanding of physics, mathematics, and long-horizon
planning. During training, agents have to explore and learn general principles
about the environment without any external supervision. During evaluation,
agents have to build the unseen target structures from the task suite. Solving
these tasks requires a sort of \emph{embodied reasoning} that is not reflected
in words but rather in actions, experimenting with different strategies and
piecing them together. Our experiments show that many of these tasks challenge
the current iteration of algorithms. Hence, we also provide a ``training
wheels'' protocol, in which agents are trained and evaluated to build a single
target structure from the task suite. Finally, we provide single-file
implementations of six different algorithms as a reference point for
researchers.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a game-based learning framework to address the high learning curve and low motivation issues in training professionals for information system integration during post-merger integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods AMILI and AMILP for information system integration in post-merger contexts have high learning curves and low learner motivation, creating a gap in effective training despite available business-level guidance.

Method: The study analyzes learning theories, cognitive load and motivation models, and serious game design frameworks to develop requirements for a game-based learning design framework, structured into transformation process and learning experience components.

Result: The paper identifies essential requirements for a game-based learning framework that transforms static method training into engaging learning experiences for information system integration professionals.

Conclusion: The study concludes with a plan for iterative development and real-world validation of the proposed game-based learning framework to improve training effectiveness in post-merger information system integration.

Abstract: Post-merger integration states unique challenges for professionals
responsible for information system integration aimed on alignment and
combination diverse system architectures of merging organizations. Although the
theoretical and practical guidance exists for post-merger integration on the
business level, there is a significant gap in training for information system
integration in this context. In prior research specific methods AMILI (Support
method for informed decision identification) and AMILP (Support method for
informed decision-making) were introduced for the support of information system
integration decisions in the post-merger integration. But during the practical
application was reported high learning curve and low learner motivation. This
paper explores how game-based learning design can address these limitations by
transforming static method training into engaging learning experience. The
study analyzes foundational learning theories, cognitive load and motivation
models, and serious game design frameworks to identify the essential
requirements for a game-based learning design framework tailored to information
system integration in post-merger integration. Requirements are structured in
two components: the transformation process and resulting learning experience.
The paper concludes with a plan for developing and evaluating the proposed
framework through iterative design and real-world validation.

TL;DR: BCCS framework improves multi-agent consensus by selecting optimal collaborators and calibrating consensus judgment using system-internal beliefs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on MATH and MMLU benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing consensus-seeking approaches in multi-agent systems rely on voting mechanisms that overlook contradictions in system-internal beliefs and use uniform collaboration that fails to identify optimal collaborators, hindering stable consensus.

Method: Proposed Belief-Calibrated Consensus Seeking (BCCS) framework with theoretical foundation for selecting optimal collaborators to maximize consensus stability, and calibrating consensus judgment using system-internal beliefs.

Result: Outperformed best existing results by 2.23% accuracy on MATH benchmark and 3.95% accuracy on MMLU benchmark for challenging NLP tasks.

Conclusion: The BCCS framework effectively addresses limitations of existing consensus-seeking methods by optimizing collaborator selection and belief calibration, leading to more stable consensus and improved performance on complex NLP tasks.

Abstract: A multi-agent system (MAS) enhances its capacity to solve complex natural
language processing (NLP) tasks through collaboration among multiple agents,
where consensus-seeking serves as a fundamental mechanism. However, existing
consensus-seeking approaches typically rely on voting mechanisms to judge
consensus, overlooking contradictions in system-internal beliefs that
destabilize the consensus. Moreover, these methods often involve agents
updating their results through indiscriminate collaboration with every other
agent. Such uniform interaction fails to identify the optimal collaborators for
each agent, hindering the emergence of a stable consensus. To address these
challenges, we provide a theoretical framework for selecting optimal
collaborators that maximize consensus stability. Based on the theorems, we
propose the Belief-Calibrated Consensus Seeking (BCCS) framework to facilitate
stable consensus via selecting optimal collaborators and calibrating the
consensus judgment by system-internal beliefs. Experimental results on the MATH
and MMLU benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed BCCS framework
outperforms the best existing results by 2.23% and 3.95% of accuracy on
challenging tasks, respectively. Our code and data are available at

### [122] [Off-Trajectory Reasoning: Can LLMs Collaborate on Reasoning Trajectory?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06410)
*Aochong Oliver Li,Tanya Goyal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Standard solo-reasoning training pipelines fail to deliver effective off-trajectory reasoning behaviors in LLMs, with stronger models being more fragile under distraction and all models failing to leverage collaborators' reasoning on problems beyond their capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether standard solo-reasoning training pipelines can enable LLMs to effectively collaborate by assessing and building upon each other's partial reasoning (off-trajectory reasoning), which is crucial for multi-model collaboration in shared reasoning trajectories.

Method: Proposed twin tests (Recoverability and Guidability) to evaluate off-trajectory reasoning, tested 15 open-weight LLMs (1.5B-32B), and conducted control studies to isolate effects of distillation teacher choice, RL usage, and data selection strategy in post-training.

Result: Counterintuitively, stronger LLMs on benchmarks are more fragile under distraction; all models fail to leverage guiding steps from collaborators on problems beyond their capabilities (solve rates <9.2%); suboptimal recoverability behaviors transfer from teachers to distilled students even with correct distillation trajectories.

Conclusion: Current reasoning LLMs have significant limitations in off-trajectory reasoning capabilities, highlighting the need for specialized training approaches to enable effective multi-model collaboration in shared reasoning trajectories.

Abstract: Reasoning LLMs are trained to verbalize their reasoning process, yielding
strong gains on complex tasks. This transparency also opens a promising
direction: multiple reasoners can directly collaborate on each other's thinking
within a shared trajectory, yielding better inference efficiency and
exploration. A key prerequisite, however, is the ability to assess the
usefulness and build on another model's partial thinking -- we call this
off-trajectory reasoning. Our paper investigates a critical question: can
standard solo-reasoning training pipelines deliver desired off-trajectory
behaviors? We propose twin tests that capture the two extremes of the
off-trajectory spectrum, namely Recoverability, which tests whether LLMs can
backtrack from "distractions" induced by misleading reasoning traces, and
Guidability, which tests their ability to build upon correct reasoning from
stronger collaborators. Our study evaluates 15 open-weight LLMs (1.5B-32B) and
reveals a counterintuitive finding -- "stronger" LLMs on benchmarks are often
more fragile under distraction. Moreover, all models tested fail to effectively
leverage guiding steps from collaborators on problems beyond their inherent
capabilities with solve rates remaining under 9.2%. Finally, we conduct control
studies to isolate the effects of three factors in post-training on these
behaviors: the choice of distillation teacher, the use of RL, and data
selection strategy. Our results provide actionable insights for training
natively strong reasoning collaborators; e.g., we find that suboptimal
recoverability behaviors of teacher models are transferred to distilled
students even if the distillation trajectories are correct. Taken together,
this work lays the groundwork for evaluating multi-model collaborations in
shared reasoning trajectories and highlights the limitations of off-the-shelf
reasoning LLMs.

### [123] [Flavonoid Fusion: Creating a Knowledge Graph to Unveil the Interplay Between Food and Health](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06433)
*Aryan Singh Dalal,Yinglun Zhang,Duru Doğan,Atalay Mert İleri,Hande Küçük McGinty*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study creates a knowledge graph to represent relationships between food and health, specifically focusing on flavonoid contents from USDA databases and cancer connections from literature, using KNARM methodology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in representing food-health relationships in standardized, machine-readable format using semantic web technologies, as current research lacks this approach despite growing interest in 'food as medicine'.

Method: Used KNARM methodology to create a knowledge graph that combines information from USDA databases (flavonoid contents) and literature (cancer connections), representing relationships in machine-operable format.

Result: Developed a knowledge graph that links food and health, serving as an example for researchers to explore dietary choices and disease management relationships.

Conclusion: The knowledge graph provides a foundation for future expansion by capturing nuances, adding more data, and performing inferences to uncover hidden relationships between food and health.

Abstract: The focus on "food as medicine" is gaining traction in the field of health
and several studies conducted in the past few years discussed this aspect of
food in the literature. However, very little research has been done on
representing the relationship between food and health in a standardized,
machine-readable format using a semantic web that can help us leverage this
knowledge effectively. To address this gap, this study aims to create a
knowledge graph to link food and health through the knowledge graph's ability
to combine information from various platforms focusing on flavonoid contents of
food found in the USDA databases and cancer connections found in the
literature. We looked closely at these relationships using KNARM methodology
and represented them in machine-operable format. The proposed knowledge graph
serves as an example for researchers, enabling them to explore the complex
interplay between dietary choices and disease management. Future work for this
study involves expanding the scope of the knowledge graph by capturing nuances,
adding more related data, and performing inferences on the acquired knowledge
to uncover hidden relationships.

*Yitao Long,Yuru Jiang,Hongjun Liu,Yilun Zhao,Jingchen Sun,Yiqiu Shen,Chen Zhao,Arman Cohan,Dennis Shasha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PuzzlePlex is a benchmark for evaluating foundation models' reasoning and planning capabilities through 15 diverse puzzle types, with findings showing reasoning models excel in instruction-based settings while code-based execution offers scalability despite challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reasoning and planning capabilities of foundation models and their scalability in complex, dynamic environments, as current benchmarks may not adequately test these advanced cognitive abilities.

Method: Developed PuzzlePlex benchmark with 15 puzzle types including deterministic/stochastic games and single/two-player scenarios, implemented customized strategies, created fine-grained metrics, and tested frontier models in instruction-based and code-based settings while systematically investigating scaling limits.

Result: Reasoning models performed best in instruction-based settings, while code-based execution presented greater challenges but offered a scalable and efficient alternative for foundation models.

Conclusion: PuzzlePlex enables targeted evaluation and guides future improvements in reasoning, planning, and generalization for foundation models, demonstrating the importance of specialized benchmarks for advancing AI capabilities.

Abstract: This work investigates the reasoning and planning capabilities of foundation
models and their scalability in complex, dynamic environments. We introduce
PuzzlePlex, a benchmark designed to assess these capabilities through a diverse
set of puzzles. PuzzlePlex consists of 15 types of puzzles, including
deterministic and stochastic games of varying difficulty, as well as
single-player and two-player scenarios. The PuzzlePlex framework provides a
comprehensive environment for each game, and supports extensibility to generate
more challenging instances as foundation models evolve. Additionally, we
implement customized game-playing strategies for comparison. Building on this
benchmark, we develop fine-grained metrics to measure performance and conduct
an in-depth analysis of frontier foundation models across two settings:
instruction-based and code-based. Furthermore, we systematically investigate
their scaling limits. Our findings show that reasoning models outperform others
in instruction-based settings, while code-based execution presents greater
challenges but offers a scalable and efficient alternative. PuzzlePlex enables
targeted evaluation and guides future improvements in reasoning, planning, and
generalization for foundation models.

### [125] [Beneficial Reasoning Behaviors in Agentic Search and Effective Post-training to Obtain Them](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06534)
*Jiahe Jin,Abhijay Paladugu,Chenyan Xiong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Behavior Priming - a technique to train agentic search models by synthesizing trajectories with four key reasoning behaviors (Information Verification, Authority Evaluation, Adaptive Search, Error Recovery) through SFT followed by RL, achieving 35%+ gains over direct RL training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic search using LLMs faces challenges in reasoning and agentic capabilities when interacting with retrieval systems. The paper aims to study effective reasoning behavior patterns and leverage them to train more effective agentic search models.

Method: Developed a reasoning-driven LLM pipeline to analyze successful agentic search trajectories, identified four beneficial reasoning behaviors, and proposed Behavior Priming technique that synthesizes trajectories exhibiting these behaviors for SFT followed by standard RL.

Result: Experiments on GAIA, WebWalker, and HLE benchmarks show Behavior Priming yields over 35% gains in Llama3.2-3B and Qwen3-1.7B compared to direct RL training. Crucially, desirable reasoning behaviors in SFT data, not answer correctness, is key to strong RL performance.

Conclusion: Behavior Priming endows models with more effective exploration and test-time scaling capabilities, providing a strong foundation for RL. The introduced reasoning behaviors are critical for achieving superior performance in agentic search tasks.

Abstract: Agentic search leverages large language models (LLMs) to interpret complex
user information needs and execute a multi-step process of planning, searching,
and synthesizing information to provide answers. This paradigm introduces
unique challenges for LLMs' reasoning and agentic capabilities when interacting
with retrieval systems and the broader web. In this paper, we propose a
reasoning-driven LLM-based pipeline to study effective reasoning behavior
patterns in agentic search. Using this pipeline, we analyze successful agentic
search trajectories and identify four beneficial reasoning behaviors:
Information Verification, Authority Evaluation, Adaptive Search, and Error
Recovery. Based on these findings, we propose a technique called Behavior
Priming to train more effective agentic search models. It synthesizes agentic
search trajectories that exhibit these four behaviors and integrates them into
the agentic search model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by
standard reinforcement learning (RL). Experiments on three benchmarks (GAIA,
WebWalker, and HLE) demonstrate that behavior priming yields over 35% gains in
Llama3.2-3B and Qwen3-1.7B compared to directly training agentic search models
with RL. Crucially, we demonstrate that the desired reasoning behaviors in the
SFT data, rather than the correctness of the final answer, is the critical
factor for achieving strong final performance after RL: fine-tuning on
trajectories with desirable reasoning behaviors but incorrect answers leads to
better performance than fine-tuning on trajectories with correct answers. Our
analysis further reveals the underlying mechanism: the introduced reasoning
behaviors endow models with more effective exploration (higher pass@k and
entropy) and test-time scaling (longer trajectories) capabilities, providing a
strong foundation for RL. Our code will be released as open source.

TL;DR: APE framework improves LLM judge reliability by automatically learning evaluation dimensions from failure cases and using confidence-based ensemble to selectively augment judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM judges often miss crucial evaluation dimensions because they fail to recognize implicit standards in human assessments, creating an evaluation gap.

Method: Proposes Auto-Prompt Ensemble (APE) - adaptive framework that learns evaluation dimensions from failure cases, uses Collective Confidence estimation for confidence-based ensemble mechanism.

Result: APE improves GPT-4o agreement rate on Reward Bench from 87.2% to 90.5% in zero-shot setting, enhances reliability across diverse standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: APE provides principled approach for LLM judges to leverage test-time computation and bridge evaluation gap between human and LLM judges.

Abstract: We present a novel framework that improves the reliability of LLM judges by
selectively augmenting LLM with auxiliary evaluation dimensions. Existing LLM
judges often miss crucial evaluation dimensions because they fail to recognize
the implicit standards underlying human assessments. To address this challenge,
we propose the Auto-Prompt Ensemble (APE), an adaptive framework that
automatically learns evaluation dimensions from its failure cases. APE
incorporates a confidence-based ensemble mechanism to decide when to adopt the
judgments from additional evaluation dimensions through a novel confidence
estimation approach called Collective Confidence. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that APE improves the reliability of LLM Judge across diverse
standard benchmarks. For instance, APE enhances GPT-4o agreement rate on Reward
Bench from 87.2% to 90.5% in the zero-shot setting. Overall, APE provides a
principled approach for LLM Judge to leverage test-time computation, and bridge
the evaluation gap between human and LLM judges.

*Jingbo Yang,Bairu Hou,Wei Wei,Shiyu Chang,Yujia Bao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WebDART is a framework that enables a single LLM to handle complex web tasks by dynamically decomposing objectives into navigation, information extraction, and execution subtasks, with continuous replanning as new webpages are revealed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents struggle with objectives requiring long horizon navigation, large scale information extraction, and reasoning under constraints, despite being competent at straightforward web tasks.

Method: WebDART dynamically decomposes objectives into three focused subtasks (navigation, information extraction, execution) and continuously replans the decomposition as new webpages are revealed to take advantage of discovered filters/shortcuts and avoid redundant exploration.

Result: WebDART improves success rates by up to 13.7 percentage points over previous SOTA agents on WebChoreArena, matches performance on easier WebArena suite, and completes tasks with up to 14.7 fewer navigation steps.

Conclusion: The WebDART framework effectively enables single LLMs to handle complex web chores through dynamic task decomposition and continuous replanning, significantly improving performance on challenging web tasks.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are becoming competent at straightforward
web tasks, such as opening an item page or submitting a form, but still
struggle with objectives that require long horizon navigation, large scale
information extraction, and reasoning under constraints. We present WebDART, a
general framework that enables a single LLM to handle such complex chores.
WebDART (i) dynamically decomposes each objective into three focused subtasks:
navigation, information extraction, and execution, so the model concentrates on
one skill at a time, and (ii) continuously replans the decomposition as new
webpages are revealed, taking advantage of newly discovered filters or
shortcuts and avoiding redundant exploration. Evaluated on WebChoreArena,
WebDART lifts success rates by up to 13.7 percentage points over previous SOTA
agents, while matching their performance on the easier WebArena suite and
completing tasks with up to 14.7 fewer navigation steps.

### [128] [Fine-Grained Emotion Recognition via In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06600)
*Zhaochun Ren,Zhou Yang,Chenglong Ye,Haizhou Sun,Chao Chen,Xiaofei Zhu,Xiangwen Liao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EICL improves fine-grained emotion recognition by addressing emotional discrepancies in ICL through emotionally similar examples and dynamic soft-label strategy, outperforming ICL on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ICL methods enhance reasoning but overlook decision-making in emotion recognition. Semantically similar examples often introduce emotional discrepancies that hinder accurate representations.

Method: Proposes Emotion In-Context Learning (EICL) with emotionally similar examples and dynamic soft-label strategy to improve query representations, plus a two-stage exclusion strategy for multi-angle similarity assessment.

Result: Extensive experiments show EICL significantly outperforms ICL on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: EICL effectively addresses emotional discrepancies in ICL and improves both reasoning and decision-making processes in fine-grained emotion recognition.

Abstract: Fine-grained emotion recognition aims to identify the emotional type in
queries through reasoning and decision-making processes, playing a crucial role
in various systems. Recent methods use In-Context Learning (ICL), enhancing the
representation of queries in the reasoning process through semantically similar
examples, while further improving emotion recognition by explaining the
reasoning mechanisms. However, these methods enhance the reasoning process but
overlook the decision-making process. This paper investigates decision-making
in fine-grained emotion recognition through prototype theory. We show that ICL
relies on similarity matching between query representations and emotional
prototypes within the model, where emotion-accurate representations are
critical. However, semantically similar examples often introduce emotional
discrepancies, hindering accurate representations and causing errors. To
address this, we propose Emotion In-Context Learning (EICL), which introduces
emotionally similar examples and uses a dynamic soft-label strategy to improve
query representations in the emotion reasoning process. A two-stage exclusion
strategy is then employed to assess similarity from multiple angles, further
optimizing the decision-making process. Extensive experiments show that EICL
significantly outperforms ICL on multiple datasets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an Agent-in-the-Loop (AITL) framework that creates a continuous data flywheel for improving LLM-based customer support systems by integrating real-time human feedback directly into operational workflows, reducing retraining cycles from months to weeks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard offline approaches relying on batch annotations are inefficient and slow for improving customer support systems. There's a need for more continuous, real-time feedback mechanisms that can rapidly improve LLM performance in production environments.

Method: AITL framework integrates four types of live annotations: (1) pairwise response preferences, (2) agent adoption and rationales, (3) knowledge relevance checks, and (4) identification of missing knowledge. These feedback signals are collected directly during customer operations and used for model updates.

Result: Production pilot with US-based customer support agents showed significant improvements: retrieval accuracy (+11.7% recall@75, +14.8% precision@8), generation quality (+8.4% helpfulness), and agent adoption rates (+4.5%). Retraining cycles reduced from months to weeks.

Conclusion: Embedding human feedback loops directly into operational workflows is highly effective for continuously refining LLM-based customer support systems, demonstrating substantial performance improvements across multiple metrics.

Abstract: We introduce an Agent-in-the-Loop (AITL) framework that implements a
continuous data flywheel for iteratively improving an LLM-based customer
support system. Unlike standard offline approaches that rely on batch
annotations, AITL integrates four key types of annotations directly into live
customer operations: (1) pairwise response preferences, (2) agent adoption and
rationales, (3) knowledge relevance checks, and (4) identification of missing
knowledge. These feedback signals seamlessly feed back into models' updates,
reducing retraining cycles from months to weeks. Our production pilot involving
US-based customer support agents demonstrated significant improvements in
retrieval accuracy (+11.7% recall@75, +14.8% precision@8), generation quality
(+8.4% helpfulness) and agent adoption rates (+4.5%). These results underscore
the effectiveness of embedding human feedback loops directly into operational

### [130] [Inefficiencies of Meta Agents for Agent Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06711)
*Batu El,Mert Yuksekgonul,James Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Meta-agents for automated agent design face three key challenges: poor learning across iterations, low behavioral diversity in designed agents, and limited economic viability compared to human-designed agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in automated agent design systems where meta-agents propose and refine agent architectures, examining how they learn across iterations, behavioral diversity, and economic viability.

Method: Examined three key challenges: 1) learning across iterations (comparing context expansion vs evolutionary approaches), 2) behavioral diversity of designed agents, and 3) economic cost-benefit analysis comparing automated vs human-designed agents across multiple datasets.

Result: 1) Evolutionary approach outperforms context expansion for learning across iterations; 2) Designed agents have low behavioral diversity, limiting complementary use; 3) Automated design is only economically viable for 2 datasets when deployed on 15,000+ examples, with performance gains not justifying costs for other datasets.

Conclusion: Current meta-agent approaches for automated agent design face significant limitations in learning efficiency, behavioral diversity, and economic viability, with automated design only being cost-effective in specific scenarios.

Abstract: Recent works began to automate the design of agentic systems using
meta-agents that propose and iteratively refine new agent architectures. In
this paper, we examine three key challenges in a common class of meta-agents.
First, we investigate how a meta-agent learns across iterations and find that
simply expanding the context with all previous agents, as proposed by previous
works, performs worse than ignoring prior designs entirely. We show that the
performance improves with an evolutionary approach. Second, although the
meta-agent designs multiple agents during training, it typically commits to a
single agent at test time. We find that the designed agents have low behavioral
diversity, limiting the potential for their complementary use. Third, we assess
when automated design is economically viable. We find that only in a few
cases--specifically, two datasets--the overall cost of designing and deploying
the agents is lower than that of human-designed agents when deployed on over
15,000 examples. In contrast, the performance gains for other datasets do not
justify the design cost, regardless of scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of traditional machine learning methods in capturing complex semantic relationships between genes, diseases, and cognitive processes by leveraging large language models for knowledge graph integration.

Method: Integrates CNKG (2.9K nodes, 4.3K edges), Gene Ontology (43K nodes, 75K edges), and Disease Ontology (11.2K nodes, 8.8K edges) using LLMs like GPT-4 for entity alignment, semantic similarity computation, and graph augmentation.

Result: Created MultiCNKG with 6.9K nodes across 5 types and 11.3K edges across 7 types. Achieved precision (85.20%), recall (87.30%), coverage (92.18%), graph consistency (82.50%), novelty detection (40.28%), and expert validation (89.50%). Link prediction with TransE (MR: 391, MRR: 0.411) and RotatE (MR: 263, MRR: 0.395) showed competitive performance.

Conclusion: MultiCNKG provides a multi-layered view from molecular to behavioral domains, advancing applications in personalized medicine, cognitive disorder diagnostics, and hypothesis formulation in cognitive neuroscience.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the integration
of knowledge graphs (KGs) in biomedical and cognitive sciences, overcoming
limitations in traditional machine learning methods for capturing intricate
semantic links among genes, diseases, and cognitive processes. We introduce
MultiCNKG, an innovative framework that merges three key knowledge sources: the
Cognitive Neuroscience Knowledge Graph (CNKG) with 2.9K nodes and 4.3K edges
across 9 node types and 20 edge types; Gene Ontology (GO) featuring 43K nodes
and 75K edges in 3 node types and 4 edge types; and Disease Ontology (DO)
comprising 11.2K nodes and 8.8K edges with 1 node type and 2 edge types.
Leveraging LLMs like GPT-4, we conduct entity alignment, semantic similarity
computation, and graph augmentation to create a cohesive KG that interconnects
genetic mechanisms, neurological disorders, and cognitive functions. The
resulting MultiCNKG encompasses 6.9K nodes across 5 types (e.g., Genes,
Diseases, Cognitive Processes) and 11.3K edges spanning 7 types (e.g., Causes,
Associated with, Regulates), facilitating a multi-layered view from molecular
to behavioral domains. Assessments using metrics such as precision (85.20%),
recall (87.30%), coverage (92.18%), graph consistency (82.50%), novelty
detection (40.28%), and expert validation (89.50%) affirm its robustness and
coherence. Link prediction evaluations with models like TransE (MR: 391, MRR:
0.411) and RotatE (MR: 263, MRR: 0.395) show competitive performance against
benchmarks like FB15k-237 and WN18RR. This KG advances applications in
personalized medicine, cognitive disorder diagnostics, and hypothesis
formulation in cognitive neuroscience.

*Dennis Gross,Helge Spieker,Arnaud Gotlieb*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A tool for automated verification of LLM-based policies in sequential decision-making tasks by incrementally constructing reachable MDP states guided by LLM actions and checking safety properties with Storm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide rigorous formal verification for LLM policies in safety-critical sequential decision-making scenarios, addressing the need for trustworthy AI systems.

Method: Incrementally constructs reachable MDP states using LLM-generated actions from natural language prompts, then verifies safety properties expressed as PCTL formulas using Storm model checker.

Result: Open-source LLMs can be verified when deterministically seeded but generally underperform deep reinforcement learning baselines in standard grid world benchmarks.

Conclusion: The tool provides practical foundation for formal verification of LLMs in sequential decision-making tasks, enabling continuous benchmarking and supporting integration with Ollama and PRISM-specified tasks.

Abstract: We introduce a tool for rigorous and automated verification of large language
model (LLM)- based policies in memoryless sequential decision-making tasks.
Given a Markov decision process (MDP) representing the sequential
decision-making task, an LLM policy, and a safety requirement expressed as a
PCTL formula, our approach incrementally constructs only the reachable portion
of the MDP guided by the LLM's chosen actions. Each state is encoded as a
natural language prompt, the LLM's response is parsed into an action, and
reachable successor states by the policy are expanded. The resulting formal
model is checked with Storm to determine whether the policy satisfies the
specified safety property. In experiments on standard grid world benchmarks, we
show that open source LLMs accessed via Ollama can be verified when
deterministically seeded, but generally underperform deep reinforcement
learning baselines. Our tool natively integrates with Ollama and supports
PRISM-specified tasks, enabling continuous benchmarking in user-specified
sequential decision-making tasks and laying a practical foundation for formally
verifying increasingly capable LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DLMA is a double-loop multi-agent framework that automates scientific research by evolving novel research plans through professor agents and executing them via doctoral student agents, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating end-to-end scientific research requires handling both high-level plan evolution and dynamic execution under uncertainty, which poses a fundamental bilevel challenge.

Method: Uses a double-loop architecture: leader loop with professor agents evolves research plans using evolutionary algorithms through meetings; follower loop with doctoral student agents executes plans with dynamic adjustments via pre/post-hoc meetings.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art scores on ACLAward and Laboratory benchmarks, significantly outperforming baselines. Ablation studies confirm both loops are critical - evolution drives novelty and execution ensures soundness.

Conclusion: DLMA successfully addresses the bilevel challenge of automated scientific research through its double-loop multi-agent framework, demonstrating effective plan evolution and execution capabilities.

Abstract: Automating the end-to-end scientific research process poses a fundamental
challenge: it requires both evolving high-level plans that are novel and sound,
and executing these plans correctly amidst dynamic and uncertain conditions. To
address this bilevel challenge, we propose a novel Double-Loop Multi-Agent
(DLMA) framework to solve the given research problem automatically. The leader
loop, composed of professor agents, is responsible for evolving research plans.
It employs an evolutionary algorithm through involvement, improvement, and
integration meetings to iteratively generate and refine a pool of research
proposals, exploring the solution space effectively. The follower loop,
composed of doctoral student agents, is responsible for executing the
best-evolved plan. It dynamically adjusts the plan during implementation via
pre-hoc and post-hoc meetings, ensuring each step (e.g., drafting, coding) is
well-supported by contextual and external observations. Extensive experiments
on benchmarks like ACLAward and Laboratory show that DLMA generates research
papers that achieve state-of-the-art scores in automated evaluation,
significantly outperforming strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm the
critical roles of both loops, with evolution driving novelty and execution
ensuring soundness.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ATF is an autoformalization method that uses tool feedback (Lean 4 compilers for syntax and multi-LLM judges for consistency) to iteratively refine formal statements, achieving better syntactic validity and semantic consistency than existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoformalization models struggle to consistently generate valid statements that meet both syntactic validity and semantic consistency requirements.

Method: Proposes ATF which integrates Lean 4 compilers for syntax corrections and multi-LLM judges for consistency validation, with training phases including cold-start on synthetic data, expert iteration, and Direct Preference Optimization.

Result: ATF markedly outperforms baseline formalizer models, shows excellent inference scaling properties, and the authors open-source Numina-ATF dataset with 750K synthetic formal statements.

Conclusion: The tool feedback approach significantly improves autoformalization by enhancing both syntactic validity and semantic consistency of generated formal statements.

Abstract: Autoformalization addresses the scarcity of data for Automated Theorem
Proving (ATP) by translating mathematical problems from natural language into
formal statements. Efforts in recent work shift from directly prompting large
language models to training an end-to-end formalizer model from scratch,
achieving remarkable advancements. However, existing formalizer still struggles
to consistently generate valid statements that meet syntactic validity and
semantic consistency. To address this issue, we propose the Autoformalizer with
Tool Feedback (ATF), a novel approach that incorporates syntactic and
consistency information as tools into the formalization process. By integrating
Lean 4 compilers for syntax corrections and employing a multi-LLMs-as-judge
approach for consistency validation, the model is able to adaptively refine
generated statements according to the tool feedback, enhancing both syntactic
validity and semantic consistency. The training of ATF involves a cold-start
phase on synthetic tool-calling data, an expert iteration phase to improve
formalization capabilities, and Direct Preference Optimization to alleviate
ineffective revisions. Experimental results show that ATF markedly outperforms
a range of baseline formalizer models, with its superior performance further
validated by human evaluations. Subsequent analysis reveals that ATF
demonstrates excellent inference scaling properties. Moreover, we open-source
Numina-ATF, a dataset containing 750K synthetic formal statements to facilitate
advancements in autoformalization and ATP research.

TL;DR: TGPR combines GRPO with Thompson-Sampling-based tree search to improve iterative refinement in LLMs, achieving significant performance gains on coding benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing iterative refinement methods rely on predefined heuristics that struggle with the exploration-exploitation dilemma and cannot adapt based on past outcomes.

Method: TGPR framework combines GRPO with Thompson-Sampling-based tree search to actively explore both failed and successful refinement paths, enabling denser training trajectories and more adaptive policies.

Result: Achieved up to +4.2 percentage points absolute improvement in pass@1 on MBPP and up to +12.51 percentage points absolute improvement in pass@10 on APPS compared to GRPO baseline.

Conclusion: TGPR offers a principled approach to combining learned policies with structured search methods, providing a general framework for enhancing iterative refinement and stateful reasoning in LLMs beyond just code debugging.

Abstract: Iterative refinement has been a promising paradigm to enable large language
models (LLMs) to resolve difficult reasoning and problem-solving tasks. One of
the key challenges, however, is how to effectively search through the enormous
search space of possible refinements. Existing methods typically fall back on
predefined heuristics, which are troubled by the exploration-exploitation
dilemma and cannot adapt based on past refinement outcomes. We introduce
Tree-Guided Policy Refinement (TGPR), a novel framework that combines GRPO with
a Thompson-Sampling-based tree search. TGPR explores both failed and successful
refinement paths actively, with denser training trajectories and more adaptive
policies. On HumanEval, MBPP, and APPS benchmarks, our method achieves up to
+4.2 percentage points absolute improvement in pass@1 (on MBPP) and up to
+12.51 percentage points absolute improvement in pass@10 (on APPS) compared to
a competitive GRPO baseline. Apart from debugging code, TGPR focuses on a
principled approach to combining learned policies with structured search
methods, offering a general framework for enhancing iterative refinement and
stateful reasoning in LLMs.

*Hacane Hechehouche,Andre Antakli,Matthias Klusch*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An IDE is developed to simplify the modeling of AJAN multi-agent systems by addressing challenges with RDF/RDFS, SPARQL queries, and URIs, while incorporating Large Language Models to expand the user base.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of defining RDF/RDFS and SPARQL-based agent behaviors, including error-prone URI handling and steep learning curves for complex queries, hinders practical adoption of AJAN multi-agent systems.

Method: The paper presents an integrated development environment (IDE) that facilitates the modeling of AJAN agents and leverages Large Language Models to assist in agent engineering.

Result: The IDE reduces the hurdles associated with RDF/RDFS and SPARQL, making agent modeling more accessible and less error-prone.

Conclusion: The proposed IDE extends the AJAN user community by simplifying agent engineering and integrating Large Language Models to support developers.

Abstract: There are many established semantic Web standards for implementing
multi-agent driven applications. The AJAN framework allows to engineer
multi-agent systems based on these standards. In particular, agent knowledge is
represented in RDF/RDFS and OWL, while agent behavior models are defined with
Behavior Trees and SPARQL to access and manipulate this knowledge. However, the
appropriate definition of RDF/RDFS and SPARQL-based agent behaviors still
remains a major hurdle not only for agent modelers in practice. For example,
dealing with URIs is very error-prone regarding typos and dealing with complex
SPARQL queries in large-scale environments requires a high learning curve. In
this paper, we present an integrated development environment to overcome such
hurdles of modeling AJAN agents and at the same time to extend the user
community for AJAN by the possibility to leverage Large Language Models for
agent engineering.

### [137] [Revisiting the Uniform Information Density Hypothesis in LLM Reasoning Traces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06953)
*Minju Gwak,Guijin Son,Jaehyung Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper shows that step-level uniformity of information density in LLM reasoning traces correlates with reasoning quality, with uniform traces leading to 10-32% accuracy improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether the Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis applies to LLM reasoning traces and whether step-level uniformity reflects reasoning quality.

Method: Proposed an entropy-based stepwise information density metric and introduced two complementary measures of uniformity: local and global uniformity scores, tested across six reasoning benchmarks.

Result: Correct reasoning traces avoid sharp information density spikes while incorrect traces show irregular bursts; selecting traces with uniform information density improves accuracy by 10-32% relative gains at AIME2025.

Conclusion: UID-inspired information density measures outperform alternative internal signals as predictors of reasoning quality, making uniformity a robust diagnostic and selection criterion for building more reliable reasoning systems.

Abstract: The Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis suggests that effective
communication maintains a stable flow of information. In this work, we revisit
this principle in the context of large language model (LLM) reasoning traces,
asking whether step-level uniformity reflects reasoning quality. To this end,
we propose an entropy-based stepwise information density metric and introduce
two complementary measures of uniformity, local and global uniformity scores.
Across the experiments on six different reasoning benchmarks, we find that
step-level uniformity not only provides a strong theoretical lens but also
yields practical performance benefits; for example, selecting reasoning traces
with more uniform information density at the step-level improves accuracy by
10-32\% relative gains over baselines at AIME2025. Our analysis further reveals
that correct reasoning traces tend to avoid sharp information density spikes,
while incorrect traces exhibit irregular information bursts. These results
demonstrate that UID-inspired information density measures outperform
alternative internal signals as predictors of reasoning quality. Results
highlight the uniformity of the information density as a robust diagnostic and
selection criterion for building more reliable and accurate reasoning systems.

*Wenxun Wu,Yuanyang Li,Guhan Chen,Linyue Wang,Hongyang Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TAPO is a reinforcement learning framework that combines multi-hop reasoning with adaptive tool-calling capabilities, enabling LLMs to dynamically use tools like search APIs and Python interpreters during reasoning processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with tasks requiring up-to-date knowledge or computational tools for complex arithmetic operations, despite advances in test-time scaling approaches for mathematical reasoning.

Method: Proposes Tool-Augmented Policy Optimization (TAPO), a novel RL framework based on modified Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization (DAPO) adapted for tool invocation scenarios. Introduces two datasets (TAPO-easy-60K and TAPO-hard-18K) for training and evaluation.

Result: Experiments on Qwen2.5-3B and Qwen2.5-7B models show state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring external knowledge and mathematical computation. TAPO achieves more efficient tool utilization than baselines while preventing excessive calls from reward hacking.

Conclusion: Combining advanced reasoning with tool usage significantly enhances model performance in knowledge-intensive and computationally demanding tasks, demonstrating the potential of systematic tool integration in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have popularized test-time
scaling, where models generate additional reasoning tokens before producing
final answers. These approaches have demonstrated significant performance
improvements on benchmarks involving mathematical reasoning. However, language
models relying solely on direct inference still struggle with tasks demanding
up-to-date knowledge or computational tools such as calculators and code
interpreters for complex arithmetic operations. To overcome these limitations,
we propose Tool-Augmented Policy Optimization (TAPO), a novel reinforcement
learning framework that systematically integrates multi-hop reasoning with
adaptive tool-calling capabilities. Our approach employs a modified version of
Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization (DAPO), a recently developed RL paradigm,
which we adapt specifically for tool invocation scenarios, enabling models to
dynamically interleave complex reasoning with on-demand tool usage (including
search APIs and Python interpreters).
  To support this research, we introduce two new datasets: TAPO-easy-60K and
TAPO-hard-18K, specifically designed to train and evaluate both fact-based
reasoning and mathematical calculation capabilities. Our experiments on
Qwen2.5-3B and Qwen2.5-7B models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
with both models achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring
external knowledge and mathematical computation among methods with comparable
parameters. Notably, TAPO achieves more efficient tool utilization than
baseline methods while preventing excessive calls caused by reward hacking.
These results highlight the significant potential of combining advanced
reasoning with tool usage to enhance model performance in knowledge-intensive
and computationally demanding tasks.

### [139] [Prompt Optimization Across Multiple Agents for Representing Diverse Human Populations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07064)
*Manh Hung Nguyen,Sebastian Tschiatschek,Adish Singla*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a framework using multiple LLM agents with human demonstrations to capture population diversity, addressing LLM homogeneity through submodular optimization for representative agent selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are cost-effective proxies for human behavior but produce homogeneous outputs that fail to capture human diversity. Need to represent diverse perspectives and behaviors of human populations.

Method: Construct multiple LLM agents conditioned on human demonstrations via in-context learning. Use submodular optimization to select representative agent sets from exponential space, with trade-offs between time complexity and performance guarantees.

Result: Agents more effectively represent human populations than baselines in crowdsourcing and educational domains. Behavioral analyses show agents reproduce behavior patterns and perspectives of represented students and annotators.

Conclusion: Multi-agent framework with submodular optimization successfully captures human diversity, making LLMs better proxies for representing varied human behaviors and perspectives.

Abstract: The difficulty and expense of obtaining large-scale human responses make
Large Language Models (LLMs) an attractive alternative and a promising proxy
for human behavior. However, prior work shows that LLMs often produce
homogeneous outputs that fail to capture the rich diversity of human
perspectives and behaviors. Thus, rather than trying to capture this diversity
with a single LLM agent, we propose a novel framework to construct a set of
agents that collectively capture the diversity of a given human population.
Each agent is an LLM whose behavior is steered by conditioning on a small set
of human demonstrations (task-response pairs) through in-context learning. The
central challenge is therefore to select a representative set of LLM agents
from the exponentially large space of possible agents. We tackle this selection
problem from the lens of submodular optimization. In particular, we develop
methods that offer different trade-offs regarding time complexity and
performance guarantees. Extensive experiments in crowdsourcing and educational
domains demonstrate that our approach constructs agents that more effectively
represent human populations compared to baselines. Moreover, behavioral
analyses on new tasks show that these agents reproduce the behavior patterns
and perspectives of the students and annotators they are designed to represent.

*Hongbo Hu,Yisong Wang,Yi Huang,Kewen Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents an inductive reasoning approach for possibilistic logic programs (poss-programs) under stable models, defining induction tasks and providing algorithms (ilpsm and ilpsmmin) to extract poss-programs from background programs and examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While possibilistic stable models semantics and properties have been well studied, the problem of inductive reasoning for poss-programs had not been investigated yet, creating a gap in the research.

Method: The authors formally define induction tasks, investigate their properties, and present two algorithms (ilpsm and ilpsmmin) for computing induction solutions. They also implement ilpsmmin and conduct experiments.

Result: Experimental results show that when inputs are ordinary logic programs, the prototype implementation of ilpsmmin outperforms a major inductive learning system for normal logic programs from stable models on randomly generated datasets.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the inductive reasoning problem for poss-programs by providing formal definitions, algorithms, and empirical evidence showing improved performance over existing systems for ordinary logic programs.

Abstract: Possibilistic logic programs (poss-programs) under stable models are a major
variant of answer set programming (ASP). While its semantics (possibilistic
stable models) and properties have been well investigated, the problem of
inductive reasoning has not been investigated yet. This paper presents an
approach to extracting poss-programs from a background program and examples
(parts of intended possibilistic stable models). To this end, the notion of
induction tasks is first formally defined, its properties are investigated and
two algorithms ilpsm and ilpsmmin for computing induction solutions are
presented. An implementation of ilpsmmin is also provided and experimental
results show that when inputs are ordinary logic programs, the prototype
outperforms a major inductive learning system for normal logic programs from
stable models on the datasets that are randomly generated.

### [141] [VRPAgent: LLM-Driven Discovery of Heuristic Operators for Vehicle Routing Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07073)
*André Hottung,Federico Berto,Chuanbo Hua,Nayeli Gast Zepeda,Daniel Wetzel,Michael Römer,Haoran Ye,Davide Zago,Michael Poli,Stefano Massaroli,Jinkyoo Park,Kevin Tierney*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VRPAgent is a framework that uses LLM-generated components within a metaheuristic, refined through genetic search, to automatically discover high-performing heuristic operators for vehicle routing problems that outperform human-crafted methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing effective heuristics for VRPs requires significant domain expertise and intuition. While LLM-based code generation shows promise, it currently falls short of producing heuristics that can compete with human experts.

Method: Integrates LLM-generated problem-specific operators into a generic metaheuristic framework, then refines them through a novel genetic search approach. This keeps tasks manageable while ensuring correctness and enabling discovery of novel strategies.

Result: VRPAgent discovers heuristic operators that outperform handcrafted methods and recent learning-based approaches across multiple VRP variants (capacitated VRP, VRP with time windows, prize-collecting VRP) while requiring only a single CPU core.

Conclusion: VRPAgent is the first LLM-based paradigm to advance state-of-the-art in VRPs, demonstrating a promising future for automated heuristics discovery in complex optimization problems.

Abstract: Designing high-performing heuristics for vehicle routing problems (VRPs) is a
complex task that requires both intuition and deep domain knowledge. Large
language model (LLM)-based code generation has recently shown promise across
many domains, but it still falls short of producing heuristics that rival those
crafted by human experts. In this paper, we propose VRPAgent, a framework that
integrates LLM-generated components into a metaheuristic and refines them
through a novel genetic search. By using the LLM to generate problem-specific
operators, embedded within a generic metaheuristic framework, VRPAgent keeps
tasks manageable, guarantees correctness, and still enables the discovery of
novel and powerful strategies. Across multiple problems, including the
capacitated VRP, the VRP with time windows, and the prize-collecting VRP, our
method discovers heuristic operators that outperform handcrafted methods and
recent learning-based approaches while requiring only a single CPU core. To our
knowledge, \VRPAgent is the first LLM-based paradigm to advance the
state-of-the-art in VRPs, highlighting a promising future for automated
heuristics discovery.

### [142] [The Cognitive Bandwidth Bottleneck: Shifting Long-Horizon Agent from Planning with Actions to Planning with Schemas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07091)
*Baixuan Xu,Tianshi Zheng,Zhaowei Wang,Hong Ting Tsang,Weiqi Wang,Tianqing Fang,Yangqiu Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper studies optimal action representations for long-horizon agents in combinatorial action spaces, comparing Planning with Actions (PwA) vs Planning with Schemas (PwS), identifying an inflection point between ALFWorld (~35 actions) and SciWorld (~500 actions).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional action planning becomes impractical in combinatorial action spaces of open-ended real world environments, necessitating scalable action representations for long-horizon autonomy.

Method: Systematic comparison of PwA (direct action lists) vs PwS (schema instantiation), using cognitive bandwidth framework and controlled experiments across ALFWorld and SciWorld benchmarks.

Result: Found representation-choice inflection point between 35-500 actions; stronger planning shifts inflection rightward, better schema instantiation shifts it leftward; PwS shows suboptimal performance but offers scalability.

Conclusion: PwS provides scalable representation for combinatorial action spaces, with actionable guidance needed to improve PwS agent capabilities for better autonomous performance.

Abstract: Enabling LLMs to effectively operate long-horizon task which requires
long-term planning and multiple interactions is essential for open-world
autonomy. Conventional methods adopt planning with actions where a executable
action list would be provided as reference. However, this action representation
choice would be impractical when the environment action space is combinatorial
exploded (e.g., open-ended real world). This naturally leads to a question: As
environmental action space scales, what is the optimal action representation
for long-horizon agents? In this paper, we systematically study the
effectiveness of two different action representations. The first one is
conventional planning with actions (PwA) which is predominantly adopted for its
effectiveness on existing benchmarks. The other one is planning with schemas
(PwS) which instantiate an action schema into action lists (e.g., "move [OBJ]
to [OBJ]" -> "move apple to desk") to ensure concise action space and reliable
scalability. This alternative is motivated by its alignment with human
cognition and its compliance with environment-imposed action format
restriction. We propose cognitive bandwidth perspective as a conceptual
framework to qualitatively understand the differences between these two action
representations and empirically observe a representation-choice inflection
point between ALFWorld (~35 actions) and SciWorld (~500 actions), which serve
as evidence of the need for scalable representations. We further conduct
controlled experiments to study how the location of this inflection point
interacts with different model capacities: stronger planning proficiency shifts
the inflection rightward, whereas better schema instantiation shifts it
leftward. Finally, noting the suboptimal performance of PwS agents, we provide
an actionable guide for building more capable PwS agents for better scalable
autonomy.

### [143] [The Contingencies of Physical Embodiment Allow for Open-Endedness and Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07117)
*Leonardo Christov-Moore,Arthur Juliani,Alex Kiefer,Nicco Reggente,B. Scott Rousse,Adam Safron,Nicol'as Hinrichs,Daniel Polani,Antonio Damasio*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes that physical vulnerability and mortality (being-towards-death) combined with embodiment (being-in-the-world) create intrinsic drives for artificial agents to maintain integrity and maximize control, enabling open-ended adaptation and care.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biological organisms adapt and care for each other in open-ended environments with ease, while artificial agents struggle. Understanding the conditions of life can help develop more robust, adaptive, and caring AI agents.

Method: Define two minimal conditions from Heidegger's existentialist phenomenology: being-in-the-world (embodiment) and being-towards-death (vulnerability). Formalize these concepts in reinforcement learning to create intrinsic drives for homeostasis and empowerment.

Result: The framework enables agents to develop homeostatic drives to maintain integrity and intrinsic drives to maximize control over future states (empowerment), enhancing their capacity to meet future needs.

Conclusion: By embracing physical vulnerability and mortality as foundational conditions, artificial agents can cultivate capacities for open-endedness and care similar to biological organisms, leading to more robust and adaptive AI systems.

Abstract: Physical vulnerability and mortality are often seen as obstacles to be
avoided in the development of artificial agents, which struggle to adapt to
open-ended environments and provide aligned care. Meanwhile, biological
organisms survive, thrive, and care for each other in an open-ended physical
world with relative ease and efficiency. Understanding the role of the
conditions of life in this disparity can aid in developing more robust,
adaptive, and caring artificial agents. Here we define two minimal conditions
for physical embodiment inspired by the existentialist phenomenology of Martin
Heidegger: being-in-the-world (the agent is a part of the environment) and
being-towards-death (unless counteracted, the agent drifts toward terminal
states due to the second law of thermodynamics). We propose that from these
conditions we can obtain both a homeostatic drive - aimed at maintaining
integrity and avoiding death by expending energy to learn and act - and an
intrinsic drive to continue to do so in as many ways as possible. Drawing
inspiration from Friedrich Nietzsche's existentialist concept of will-to-power,
we examine how intrinsic drives to maximize control over future states, e.g.,
empowerment, allow agents to increase the probability that they will be able to
meet their future homeostatic needs, thereby enhancing their capacity to
maintain physical integrity. We formalize these concepts within a reinforcement
learning framework, which enables us to examine how intrinsically driven
embodied agents learning in open-ended multi-agent environments may cultivate
the capacities for open-endedness and care.ov

### [144] [Integrating Domain Knowledge into Process Discovery Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07161)
*Ali Norouzifar,Humam Kourani,Marcus Dees,Wil van der Aalst*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An interactive framework that integrates domain knowledge via LLMs to improve process discovery by extracting declarative rules from natural language descriptions and guiding the discovery algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional process discovery methods rely solely on event logs, which are often incomplete or noisy, and ignore valuable domain knowledge, leading to unreliable models for downstream tasks.

Method: Uses LLMs to extract declarative rules from textual domain knowledge, integrates these rules with the IMr discovery algorithm to recursively construct process models, and coordinates interactions between LLMs, domain experts, and backend services.

Result: Developed a fully implemented tool, evaluated multiple LLMs and prompt strategies, and conducted empirical study with domain experts who assessed the framework's usability and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully incorporates domain knowledge into process discovery, improving model reliability and addressing limitations of purely data-driven approaches.

Abstract: Process discovery aims to derive process models from event logs, providing
insights into operational behavior and forming a foundation for conformance
checking and process improvement. However, models derived solely from event
data may not accurately reflect the real process, as event logs are often
incomplete or affected by noise, and domain knowledge, an important
complementary resource, is typically disregarded. As a result, the discovered
models may lack reliability for downstream tasks. We propose an interactive
framework that incorporates domain knowledge, expressed in natural language,
into the process discovery pipeline using Large Language Models (LLMs). Our
approach leverages LLMs to extract declarative rules from textual descriptions
provided by domain experts. These rules are used to guide the IMr discovery
algorithm, which recursively constructs process models by combining insights
from both the event log and the extracted rules, helping to avoid problematic
process structures that contradict domain knowledge. The framework coordinates
interactions among the LLM, domain experts, and a set of backend services. We
present a fully implemented tool that supports this workflow and conduct an
extensive evaluation of multiple LLMs and prompt engineering strategies. Our
empirical study includes a case study based on a real-life event log with the
involvement of domain experts, who assessed the usability and effectiveness of
the framework.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NewtonBench is a new benchmark with 324 scientific law discovery tasks across 12 physics domains that addresses limitations in existing benchmarks by using metaphysical shifts to create scalable, relevant, and memorization-resistant problems, and elevates evaluation from static function fitting to interactive model discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for scientific law discovery suffer from a methodological trilemma forcing trade-offs between scientific relevance, scalability, and memorization resistance, and oversimplify discovery as static function fitting rather than capturing the authentic scientific process of interactive exploration.

Method: The benchmark uses metaphysical shifts - systematic alterations of canonical laws - to generate a vast suite of problems across 12 physics domains. It elevates evaluation to interactive model discovery where agents must experimentally probe simulated complex systems to uncover hidden principles.

Result: Experiments reveal a clear but fragile discovery capability in frontier LLMs that degrades with increasing system complexity and is extremely sensitive to observational noise. Tool assistance paradoxically hinders more capable models by inducing premature shift from exploration to exploitation, causing them to settle for suboptimal solutions.

Conclusion: Robust, generalizable discovery in complex interactive environments remains the core challenge. NewtonBench provides a scalable, robust, and scientifically authentic testbed for measuring progress and guiding development of next-generation AI agents capable of genuine scientific discovery.

Abstract: Large language models are emerging as powerful tools for scientific law
discovery, a foundational challenge in AI-driven science. However, existing
benchmarks for this task suffer from a fundamental methodological trilemma,
forcing a trade-off between scientific relevance, scalability, and resistance
to memorization. Furthermore, they oversimplify discovery as static function
fitting, failing to capture the authentic scientific process of uncovering
embedded laws through the interactive exploration of complex model systems. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce NewtonBench, a benchmark comprising
324 scientific law discovery tasks across 12 physics domains. Our design
mitigates the evaluation trilemma by using metaphysical shifts - systematic
alterations of canonical laws - to generate a vast suite of problems that are
scalable, scientifically relevant, and memorization-resistant. Moreover, we
elevate the evaluation from static function fitting to interactive model
discovery, requiring agents to experimentally probe simulated complex systems
to uncover hidden principles. Our extensive experiment reveals a clear but
fragile capability for discovery in frontier LLMs: this ability degrades
precipitously with increasing system complexity and exhibits extreme
sensitivity to observational noise. Notably, we uncover a paradoxical effect of
tool assistance: providing a code interpreter can hinder more capable models by
inducing a premature shift from exploration to exploitation, causing them to
satisfice on suboptimal solutions. These results demonstrate that robust,
generalizable discovery in complex, interactive environments remains the core
challenge. By providing a scalable, robust, and scientifically authentic
testbed, NewtonBench offers a crucial tool for measuring true progress and
guiding the development of next-generation AI agents capable of genuine
scientific discovery.

*Pulkit Rustagi,Kyle Hollins Wray,Sandhya Saisubramanian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Lexicographic Conflict-Based Search (LCBS) for multi-objective multi-agent path finding that directly computes solutions aligned with user preferences, avoiding Pareto frontier construction and scaling to 10 objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MO-MAPF algorithms don't optimize for user-defined preferences even when available, and scale poorly with increasing objectives by computing full Pareto frontiers.

Method: Lexicographic framework with LCBS algorithm that integrates priority-aware low-level A* search with conflict-based search, guided by lexicographic preference over objectives.

Result: LCBS computes optimal solutions and scales to instances with up to ten objectives, with consistently higher success rates than state-of-the-art baselines, especially as objectives increase.

Conclusion: The lexicographic approach enables efficient preference-guided planning without Pareto frontier construction, significantly improving scalability and success rates in multi-objective multi-agent path finding.

Abstract: Many real-world scenarios require multiple agents to coordinate in shared
environments, while balancing trade-offs between multiple, potentially
competing objectives. Current multi-objective multi-agent path finding
(MO-MAPF) algorithms typically produce conflict-free plans by computing Pareto
frontiers. They do not explicitly optimize for user-defined preferences, even
when the preferences are available, and scale poorly with the number of
objectives. We propose a lexicographic framework for modeling MO-MAPF, along
with an algorithm \textit{Lexicographic Conflict-Based Search} (LCBS) that
directly computes a single solution aligned with a lexicographic preference
over objectives. LCBS integrates a priority-aware low-level $A^*$ search with
conflict-based search, avoiding Pareto frontier construction and enabling
efficient planning guided by preference over objectives. We provide insights
into optimality and scalability, and empirically demonstrate that LCBS computes
optimal solutions while scaling to instances with up to ten objectives -- far
beyond the limits of existing MO-MAPF methods. Evaluations on standard and
randomized MAPF benchmarks show consistently higher success rates against
state-of-the-art baselines, especially with increasing number of objectives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve content discovery and management for NFL media researchers by replacing traditional filter-and-click interfaces with natural language queries, increasing operational efficiency.

Method: An agentic workflow that takes user queries, breaks them into elements, translates them into database queries, and uses semantic caching to improve accuracy and latency.

Result: The solution achieves over 95% accuracy and reduces average search time from 10 minutes to 30 seconds, significantly improving operational efficiency.

Conclusion: Generative AI enables efficient natural language querying for historical NFL plays, allowing users to focus on creative content production rather than time-consuming searches.

Abstract: Generative AI has unlocked new possibilities in content discovery and
management. Through collaboration with the National Football League (NFL), we
demonstrate how a generative-AI based workflow enables media researchers and
analysts to query relevant historical plays using natural language rather than
traditional filter-and-click interfaces. The agentic workflow takes a user
query as input, breaks it into elements, and translates them into the
underlying database query language. Accuracy and latency are further improved
through carefully designed semantic caching. The solution achieves over 95
percent accuracy and reduces the average time to find relevant videos from 10
minutes to 30 seconds, significantly increasing the NFL's operational
efficiency and allowing users to focus on producing creative content and
engaging storylines.
